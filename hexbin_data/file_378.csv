The present study compares the kinetics of [(18)F]FDG and three other PET tracers with relevance for infection imaging. METHODS: A juvenile porcine osteomyelitis model was used. Eleven pigs underwent PET/CT with 60-minute dynamic PET imaging of [(18)F]FDG, [(68)Ga]Ga-citrate, [(11)C]methionine, and/or [(11)C]donepezil, along with blood sampling. For infectious lesions, kinetic modelling with one- and two-tissue-compartment models was conducted for each tracer. RESULTS: Irreversible uptake was found for [(18)F]FDG and [(68)Ga]Ga-citrate; reversible uptake was found for [(11)C]methionine (two-tissue model) and [(11)C]donepezil (one-tissue model). The uptake rate for [(68)Ga]Ga-citrate was slow and diffusion-limited. For the other tracers, the uptake rate was primarily determined by perfusion (flow-limited uptake). Net uptake rate for [(18)F]FDG and distribution volume for [(11)C]methionine were significantly higher for infectious lesions than for correspondingly noninfected tissue. For [(11)C]donepezil in pigs, labelled metabolite products appeared to be important for the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The kinetics of the four studied tracers in infection was characterized. For clinical applications, [(18)F]FDG remains the first-choice PET tracer. [(11)C]methionine may have a potential for detecting soft tissue infections. [(68)Ga]Ga-citrate and [(11)C]donepezil were not found useful for imaging of osteomyelitis.","Jødal, Lars; Jensen, Svend B.; Nielsen, Ole L.; Afzelius, Pia; Borghammer, Per; Alstrup, Aage K.

Sympathetic control of ventricular function occurs through extrinsic innervation arising from the stellate ganglia and thoracic sympathetic chain. In the healthy heart, sympathetic release of norepinephrine (NE) results in positive modulation of chronotropy, inotropy, and dromotropy, significantly increasing cardiac output. However, in the setting of myocardial infarction or injury, sympathetic activation persists, contributing to heart failure and increasing the risk of arrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death. Methodologies for detection of norepinephrine in cardiac tissue are limited. Present techniques rely on microdialysis for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED), radioimmunoassay, or other immunoassays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although significant information about the release and action of norepinephrine has been obtained with these methodologies, they are limited in temporal resolution, require large sample volumes, and provide results with a significant delay after sample collection (hours to weeks). In this study, we report a novel approach for measurement of interstitial cardiac norepinephrine, using minimally invasive, electrode-based, fast-scanning cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) applied in a beating porcine heart. The first multispatial and high temporal resolution, multichannel measurements of NE release in vivo are provided. Our data demonstrate rapid changes in interstitial NE profiles with regional differences in response to coronary ischemia, sympathetic nerve stimulation, and alterations in preload/afterload. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Pharmacological, electrical, or surgical regulation of sympathetic neuronal control can be used to modulate cardiac function and treat arrhythmias. However, present methods for monitoring sympathetic release of norepinephrine in the heart are limited in spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we provide for the first time a methodology and demonstration of practice and rapid measures of individualized regional autonomic neurotransmitter levels in a beating heart. We show dynamic, spatially resolved release profiles under normal and pathological conditions.","Chan, Shyue-An; Vaseghi, Marmar; Kluge, Nicholas; Shivkumar, Kalyanam; Ardell, Jeffrey L.; Smith, Corey",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,378,22

Collected blood was profiled with a hematology analyzer and spleens were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing). The results revealed negligible differences in immune differentials. However, hematological system analyses of whole blood indicated large disparities in red blood cell differentials and morphology, suggestive of anemia. Murine Reactome networks indicated majority of spleen cells displayed differentially expressed genes (DEG) involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair. Although immune differentials were not changed, DEG analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with inflammation and dysregulated immune function persist to 1-week post-simulated spaceflight. Additionally, specific regulation pathways associated with human blood disease gene orthologs, such as blood pressure regulation, transforming growth factor-β receptor signaling, and B cell differentiation were noted. Collectively, this study revealed differential immune and hematological outcomes 1-week post-simulated spaceflight conditions, suggesting recovery from spaceflight is an unremitting process.","Paul, Amber M.; Overbey, Eliah G.; da Silveira, Willian A.; Szewczyk, Nathaniel; Nishiyama, Nina C.; Pecaut, Michael J.; Anand, Sulekha; Galazka, Jonathan M.; Mao, Xiao Wen",Sci Rep,378,1

Black cumin (Nigella sativa) has been shown to be effective in treating various kidney diseases. Accumulating evidence shows that black cumin and its vital compound, thymoquinone (TQ), can protect against kidney injury caused by various xenobiotics, namely chemotherapeutic agents, heavy metals, pesticides, and other environmental chemicals. Black cumin can also protect the kidneys from ischemic shock. The mechanisms underlying the kidney protective potential of black cumin and TQ include antioxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and antifibrosis which are manifested in their regulatory role in the antioxidant defense system, NF-κB signaling, caspase pathways, and TGF-β signaling. In clinical trials, black seed oil was shown to normalize blood and urine parameters and improve disease outcomes in advanced CKD patients. While black cumin and its products have shown promising kidney protective effects, information on nanoparticle-guided targeted delivery into kidney is still lacking. Moreover, the clinical evidence on this natural product is not sufficient to recommend it to CKD patients. This review provides insightful information on the pharmacological benefits of black cumin and TQ against kidney damage.","Hannan, Md. Abdul; Zahan, Md.

The discovery of its double life led to breathtaking advances in the understanding of virtually all aspects of its biology, including its structure, physiological and pathophysiological roles and cell biology. ACE2, like its well-known homologue, ACE, is a metallopeptidase which resides on the cell surface of the epithelial, and sometimes endothelial, cells of the heart, kidney, testes, lung and gastrointestinal tract. It is a type I transmembrane protein with a large catalytic extracellular domain which acts as both a peptidase and a viral receptor. This extracellular domain can be cleaved from the cell surface by other peptidases, modulating its activity. The levels of the enzyme on the cell surface are also thought to be regulated by internalisation on S-protein binding and by clustering in membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts. This chapter summarises the current understanding of how the cell biology of ACE2 is regulated and may influence and determine its function, and concludes by discussing the future challenges and opportunities for studies of this increasingly important enzyme.","Lambert, Daniel W.",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,378,15

In this paper, we study the Singly Connected Vertex Deletion (SCVD) problem: Given an n-vertex digraph D and a positive integer k, does there exist a set [Formula: see text] such that [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] is singly connected? This problem may be seen as a directed counterpart of the (Undirected) Feedback Vertex Set problem, as an undirected graph is singly connected if and only if it is acyclic. SCVD is known to be NP-hard on general digraphs. We study the complexity of SCVD on various classes of digraphs such as tournaments, and various generalisations of tournaments such as digraphs of bounded independence number, in- and out-tournaments and local tournaments. We show that unlike the Feedback Vertex Set on Tournaments (FVST) problem, SCVD is polynomial time solvable on tournaments. In addition, we show that SCVD is polynomial time solvable on digraphs of bounded independence number, and on the class of acyclic local tournaments. We also study the parameterized complexity of SCVD, with k as the parameter, on the class of in-tournaments. And we show that on in-tournaments (and out-tournaments), SCVD admits a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm and a quadratic kernel. We also show that on the class of local tournaments, which is a sub-class of in-tournaments, SCVD admits a linear kernel.","Das, Avinandan; Kanesh, Lawqueen; Madathil, Jayakrishnan; Muluk, Komal; Purohit, Nidhi; Saurabh, Saket",Combinatorial Algorithms,378,16

However, it was reported in 2006 that dsRNA could be detected by immunofluorescence antibody staining in double-stranded DNA and positive-strand RNA virus infections but not in negative-strand RNA virus infections. Other reports in the literature seemed to support these observations. This suggested that negative-strand RNA viruses produce little, if any, dsRNA or that more efficient viral countermeasures to mask dsRNA are mounted. Because of our interest in the use of dsRNA antibodies for virus discovery, particularly in pathological specimens, we wanted to determine how universal immunostaining for dsRNA might be in animal virus infections. We have detected the in situ formation of dsRNA in cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus, measles virus, influenza A virus, and Nyamanini virus, which represent viruses from different negative-strand RNA virus families. dsRNA was also detected in cells infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, an ambisense RNA virus, and minute virus of mice (MVM), a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) parvovirus, but not hepatitis B virus. Although dsRNA staining was primarily observed in the cytoplasm, it was also seen in the nucleus of cells infected with influenza A virus, Nyamanini virus, and MVM. Thus, it is likely that most animal virus infections produce dsRNA species that can be detected by immunofluorescence staining. The apoptosis induced in several uninfected cell lines failed to upregulate dsRNA formation. IMPORTANCE An effective antiviral host immune response depends on recognition of viral invasion and an intact innate immune system as a first line of defense. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a viral product essential for the induction of innate immunity, leading to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and the activation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. The present study demonstrates that infections, including those by ssDNA viruses and positive- and negative-strand RNA viruses, produce dsRNAs detectable by standard immunofluorescence staining. While dsRNA staining was primarily observed in the cytoplasm, nuclear staining was also present in some RNA and DNA virus infections. The nucleus is unlikely to have pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors for dsRNA because of the presence of host dsRNA molecules. Thus, it is likely that most animal virus infections produce dsRNA species detectable by immunofluorescence staining, which may prove useful in viral discovery as well.","Son, Kyung-No; Liang, Zhiguo; Lipton, Howard L",Journal of virology,378,1

Multiple clinical labs in the United States, Europe, and Asia have gone to considerable lengths to optimize and validate a range of protocols for agnostically detecting viral, bacterial, fungal, and eukaryotic parasite nucleic acid across a range of patient specimens to aid in diagnosis for particularly recalcitrant cases. Others see a role for diagnostic metagenomics as a frontline diagnostic to replace other microbiological testing. Areas covered: There are considerable barriers to adoption for diagnostic metagenomics, including analytical sensitivity, interpretation, actionability, turnaround time, antimicrobial susceptibility, clinical utility, laboratory workflow, trial comparators, cost, and reimbursement. Expert commentary: Metagenomics is unlikely to become 'one test to rule them all' any time soon, not least because it is not indicative of historical infection like some of the highest volume tests in the clinical virology lab, viral serologies. The high cost and low marginal utility compared to 'standard of care' diagnostics have forced metagenomics to be mostly used for last-ditch cases. However, waiting for such patients to declare themselves as being diagnostically challenging in turn likely lessens the diagnostic yield and actionability of the information. Significant reductions in the cost of metagenomic sequencing are required for it to move up in the diagnostic pipeline. This review covers these associated obstacles of metagenomics, arguing for a parsimonious role in last-ditch diagnostics and awaiting the answer of many outstanding questions regarding its adoption.","Greninger, Alexander L",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,378,31

This study was designed to evaluate if there is a clinical correlation between abnormal vital signs and postoperative leaks and bleeding. After IRB approval and adherence to HIPAA guidelines, a retrospective review of medical records was performed on 518 patients who underwent LRYGB between October 2002 and October 2006. Vital signs from each patient were monitored hourly. Eight patients out of 518 (1.54%) were discovered to have anastomotic leak. A marked increase in heart rate up to 120 bpm at 20 h after surgery occurred in five of eight patients (62.5%). Of the eight patients who had a leak, seven (87.5%) experienced sustained tachycardia above 120 bpm. On the other hand, 20 patients out of 518 (3.86%) were discovered to have postoperative bleeding. A gradual rather than a dramatic increase in heart rate was recorded in 17 of 20 patients (85%) starting 8 h after surgery. Five patients (25%) had unsustained tachycardia above 120 bpm. Twelve patients in this group (60%) were seen to have cyclical tachycardia that never exceeded 120 bpm at any point during hospitalization. Marginal hypotension was found in seven patients (35%) in this group. Sustained tachycardia with a heart rate exceeding 120 bpm appears to be an indicator of anastomotic leak. Tachycardia less than 120 bpm that has occurred in a cyclical pattern strongly pointed toward postoperative bleeding. Anastomotic leaks and bleeding are the two most feared major complications in patients undergoing LRYGB.

This study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TQ-A3334 in healthy participants. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The effects of a single-ascending dose of TQ-A3334 (0.2-1.8 mg) combined with food (1.2 mg) were evaluated in 48 healthy participants. RESULTS No serious adverse events or discontinuations occurred in the study. The most common adverse reactions were lymphocyte count decreased and headache, which were generally consistent with IFN-α exposure and the mechanism of action of a TLR7 agonist. TQ-A3334 was rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum plasma concentration of 0.42-0.5 h. Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) to TQ-A3334 increased with a slight saturation proportion to dose. Food reduced the exposure of TQ-A3334. The concentrations of MCP-1, ISG-15, MX-1, and OAS-1 were observed to be slightly dose-dependent, ranging from 1.0 to 1.8 mg TQ-A3334.

Because of this limitation of rRT-PCR, clinicians have often had to set a treatment plan that was solely based on clinical suspicion. We investigated the hematological and biochemical factors that are associated with rRT-PCR results, in order to help clinicians deal with acute febrile patients during influenza pandemics. METHODS We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study of 465 emergency department patients who underwent both rRT-PCR and blood tests at the same time. Hematological and biochemical findings were compared between the rRT-PCR-positive group and rRT-PCR-negative group. RESULTS Levels of leukocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, serum glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin were significantly different between the two groups in the univariate analyses. In the multivariate analyses, leukocyte counts ≤ 10.8 (× 10(9))/L [odd ratio (OR) = 8.2, sensitivity = 93.7%, NPV = 85.3%], BUN levels ≤ 7.1 μmol/L (OR = 3.0, sensitivity = 93.7%, NPV = 85.3%), and CRP levels ≤ 60 mg/L (OR = 2.4, sensitivity = 93.7%, NPV = 85.3%) were independently associated with positive rRT-PCR results.

However, drugs that function against SARS-CoV-2 have not been established. SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor of the SARS coronavirus. SARS coronavirus and coronavirus 229E, the cause of the common cold, replicate through cell-surface and endosomal pathways using a protease, the type II transmembrane protease. To examine the effects of protease inhibitors on the replication of coronavirus 229E, we pretreated primary cultures of human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells with camostat or nafamostat, each of which has been used for the treatment of pancreatitis and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation. HNE cells were then infected with coronavirus 229E, and viral titers in the airway surface liquid of the cells were examined. Pretreatment with camostat (0.1-10 μg/mL) or nafamostat (0.01-1 μg/mL) reduced the titers of coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, a significant amount of type II transmembrane protease protein was detected in the airway surface liquid of HNE cells. Additionally, interferons have been reported to have antiviral effects against SARS coronavirus. The additive effects of interferons on the inhibitory effects of other candidate drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir, have also been studied. These findings suggest that protease inhibitors of this type may inhibit coronavirus 229E replication in human airway epithelial cells at clinical concentrations. Protease inhibitors, interferons or the combination of these drugs may become candidate drugs to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2.","Yamaya, Mutsuo; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Deng, Xue; Kikuchi, Akiko; Nagatomi, Ryoichi",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,378,33

This axis plays two important but apparently opposing roles in cancer. On the one hand, this axis is significantly engaged in the trafficking of a number of effecter cells involved in mounting an immune response to a growing tumour. This suggests therapeutic strategies which involve potentiation of this axis can be used to combat the spread of cancer. On the other hand, the CCR7 axis plays a significant role in controlling the migration of tumour cells towards the lymphatic system and metastasis and can thus contribute to the expansion of cancer. This implies that therapeutic strategies which involve decreasing signaling through the CCR7 axis would have a beneficial effect in preventing dissemination of cancer. This dichotomy has partly been the reason why this axis has not yet been exploited, as other chemokine axes have, as a therapeutic target in cancer. Recent report of a crystal structure for CCR7 provides opportunities to exploit this axis in developing new cancer therapies. However, it remains unclear which of these two strategies, potentiation or antagonism of the CCR7 axis, is more appropriate for cancer therapy. This review brings together the evidence supporting both roles of the CCR7 axis in cancer and examines the future potential of each of the two different therapeutic approaches involving the CCR7 axis in cancer.","Salem, Anwar; Alotaibi, Mashael; Mroueh, Rima; Basheer, Haneen A; Afarinkia, Kamyar",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

This study examined the effect of withholding fasting orders, prior to contrast-enhanced CT, on the incidence of aspiration pneumonitis and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS This randomized controlled trial enrolled hospitalized patients referred for non-emergency, contrast-enhanced CT scan to either at least 4 h of fasting or to an unrestricted consumption of liquids and solids up to the time of CT. The primary outcome was incidence of aspiration pneumonitis and the secondary outcomes were rates of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and/or vomiting). RESULTS After excluding participants with incomplete follow-up, a total of 1080 participants were assigned to the fasting group and 1011 were assigned to the non-fasting group. Aspiration pneumonitis was not identified in either group. The mean time of fasting in the fasting group was 8.4 ± 1.6 h. Rates of nausea and vomiting were not statistically different between the fasting group compared with the non-fasting group, 6.6% vs. 7.6% (p = 0.37) and 2.6% vs. 3.0% (p = 0.58), respectively. A subgroup analysis of patients who were required to drink oral contrast agent (n = 1257) showed that rates of nausea and vomiting were not statistically different between the fasting and non-fasting groups, 6.8% vs. 8.0% (p = 0.42) and 2.6% vs. 3.6% (p = 0.3), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Withholding fasting orders prior to contrast-enhanced CT was not associated with a greater risk of aspiration pneumonitis or a significant increase in rates of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of antisera from pCMV4-rZPC(')-immunized mice on sperm-oocyte interaction in vitro. The effect of antisera from DNA vaccine-immunized mice on fertilization and early embryonic development was studied using an in vitro fertilization system. The results showed that the antisera supplemented in fertilization medium (10%, v/v) significantly decreased the rate of fertilization compared to that of control groups (P<0.05); whereas the antisera showed no significant effect on the rate of fertilization when ZP-free eggs were used. Moreover, the antisera pre-neutralized with mouse soluble zona pellucida lost the capacity to inhibit fertilization when compared with that of control groups. In addition, the antisera showed no detrimental effect on early developmental potential of mouse embryos in vitro.

This issue takes on new urgency in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, and the accompanying wave of online misinformation. In this large preregistered study (N = 3,746), we investigated the effect of a single exposure to fabricated news stories about COVID-19 on related behavioral intentions. We observed small but measurable effects on some behavioral intentions but not others-for example, participants who read a story about problems with a forthcoming contact-tracing app reported a 5% reduction in willingness to download the app. These data suggest that one-off fake news exposure may have behavioral consequences, though the effects are not large. We also found no effects of providing a general warning about the dangers of online misinformation on response to the fake stories, regardless of the framing of the warning in positive or negative terms. This suggests that generic warnings about online misinformation, such as those used by governments and social media companies, are unlikely to be effective. We conclude with a call for more empirical research on the real-world consequences of fake news.

This study aimed to determine the 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of GD and sociodemographic correlates in urban and rural regions of Beijing, China.MethodA total of 1601 elderly patients (aged 60 years) were randomly selected and interviewed in Beijing using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 1.0). Basic sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected during the interviews. RESULTS The overall 12-month prevalence of GD was 4.33%, and the 12-month prevalence rates for men and women were 2.65% and 5.83% respectively. The overall lifetime prevalence of GD was 7.83%, and lifetime prevalence rates for men and women were 4.65% and 10.66% respectively. Female sex, lower educational level, monthly income, rural abode, and the presence of one or more major medical conditions were associated with increased risk of GD. Of the GD subjects interviewed, 25.2% were receiving some type of treatment, with only 4.7% preferring to seek treatment from mental health professionals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 193 patients with RH: RH 74 patients with diabetes and 119 patients without DM. Uncontrolled RH and RfH were defined by the presence of uncontrolled blood pressure BP (140 and/or 90 mm Hg) despite the use of 3 but 5 antihypertensive drugs (for RH) and 5 antihypertensive drugs, including a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (for RfH). Clinical examination, lab tests were performed. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and vasoreactivity of middle cerebral artery (MCA) using both breath-holding and hyperventilation test were measured by high-resolution ultrasound. RESULTS The prevalence of refractory hypertension in patients with and without DM was similar (30% vs 28%, respectively). No differences in BP levels, data of echocardiography and clinical phenotype were found between the diabetic groups, but value of HOMA index, plasma resistin level and postprandial glycaemia were higher in patients with RfH. FMD and MCA reactivity to the breath-holding test were worse in patients with RfH, and they had a more pronounced vasoconstrictor response of MCA to the hyperventilation test compared to patients with RH. CONCLUSION The prevalence of RfH is the same in patients with and without diabetes.

This scoping review seeks to identify available literature regarding the applications of AI in emergency medicine. Methods The scoping review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews using Medline-OVID, EMBASE, CINAHL, and IEEE, with a double screening and extraction process. The search included articles published until February 28, 2020. Articles were excluded if they did not self-classify as studying an AI intervention, were not relevant to the emergency department (ED), or did not report outcomes or evaluation. Results Of the 1483 original database citations, 395 were eligible for full-text evaluation. Of these articles, a total of 150 were included in the scoping review. The majority of included studies were retrospective in nature (n = 124, 82.7%), with only 3 (2.0%) prospective controlled trials. We found 37 (24.7%) interventions aimed at improving diagnosis within the ED. Among the 150 studies, 19 (12.7%) focused on diagnostic imaging within the ED. A total of 16 (10.7%) studies were conducted in the out-of-hospital environment (eg, emergency medical services, paramedics) with the remainder occurring either in the ED or the trauma bay. Of the 24 (16%) studies that had human comparators, there were 12 (8%) studies in which AI interventions outperformed clinicians in at least 1 measured outcome. Conclusion AI-related research is rapidly increasing in emergency medicine. There are several promising AI interventions that can improve emergency care, particularly for acute radiographic imaging and prediction-based diagnoses.

BACKGROUND Breastfeeding benefits mothers, infants and society yet breastfeeding rates continue to fall below recommendations in part due to inadequate tailored support after hospital discharge. Influences on breastfeeding are complex and include many physiological, psychosocial and cultural factors. AIM To better understand the experience of women who have feelings of aversion during breastfeeding by synthesising the existing literature. METHODS MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care databases were searched for relevant literature published between 2000 to 2019. Using Covidence software, five qualitative research studies were identified. Studies were then analysed using meta-ethnographic qualitative synthesis. FINDINGS Feelings of aversion during breastfeeding were described as visceral and overwhelming; leading to feelings of shame and inadequacy. This synthesis identified five findings; a central conceptual category of ""it's such a strong feeling of get away from me"" with four key metaphors translated from this central conceptual category: ""I do it because I feel it is best for my baby"", ""I can't control those feelings"", ""I should be able to breastfeed my son and enjoy it"", and ""I'm glad I did it"". This phenomenon may negatively affect a women's sense of self and impact on the mother-infant relationship. CONCLUSION Some women who want to breastfeed can experience feelings of aversion while breastfeeding. The feelings of 'aversion' while breastfeeding can inhibit women from achieving their personal breastfeeding goals.","Morns, Melissa A; Steel, Amie E; Burns, Elaine; McIntyre, Erica",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,378,1

As these injuries are thought to be primarily embolic, neuroprotection strategies have focused on embolic protection devices. However, the topographical distribution of cerebral emboli and how this impacts on the effectiveness of these devices have not been thoroughly assessed. Here, we evaluated the anatomical characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined cerebral ischemic lesions occurring secondary to TAVI to enhance our understanding of the distribution of cardioembolic phenomena. METHODS Forty patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI with an Edwards SAPIEN-XT valve under general anesthesia were enrolled prospectively in this observational study. Participants underwent brain MRI preprocedure, and 3 ± 1 days and 6 ± 1 months postprocedure. RESULTS Mean ± SD participant age was 82 ± 7 years. Patients had an intermediate to high surgical risk, with a mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 6.3 ± 3.5 and EuroSCORE of 18.1 ± 10.6. Post-TAVI, there were no clinically apparent cerebrovascular events, but MRI assessments identified 83 new lesions across 19 of 31 (61%) participants, with a median ± interquartile range number and volume of 1 ± 2.8 lesions and 20 ± 190 μL per patient. By volume, 80% of the infarcts were cortical, 90% in the posterior circulation and 81% in the right hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS The distribution of lesions that we detected suggests that cortical gray matter, the posterior circulation, and the right hemisphere are all particularly vulnerable to perioperative cerebrovascular injury. This finding has implications for the use of intraoperative cerebral embolic protection devices, particularly those that leave the left subclavian and, therefore, left vertebral artery unprotected.","Fanning, Jonathon P; Wesley, Allan J; Walters, Darren L; Wong, Andrew A; Barnett, Adrian G; Strugnell, Wendy E; Platts, David G; Fraser, John F",American heart journal,378,27

This Hong Kong territory-wide study using clinical registry data between 1997 and 2017 examined the association between influenza-associated hospitalizations and the risk of subsequent hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in 3 age groups: 18-44, 45-65, and >65 years. The exposure was defined as any infection with influenza virus as a primary principal diagnosis for hospitalization, whereas the non-exposed control comprised hospitalizations for elective orthopedic surgery. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk for HHF within 12 months of hospital discharge comparing the exposed versus non-exposed groups. Results showed that influenza-associated hospitalization in the preceding 12 months was associated with increased risks for subsequent HHF in all age groups (all P <0.001).

In view of the relatively small number of subsequent HHF episodes in this age group, future studies are needed to confirm the elevated risk in this group and explore the role of age in the relationship between influenza-associated hospitalization and subsequent HHF.","Chair, Sek Ying; Cheng, Ho Yu; Choi, Kai Chow; Fung, Erik Y M G; Siow, Elaine K C; Cao, Xi",American journal of epidemiology,378,1

METHODS Patients underwent RFA following transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or RFA alone under ultrasound or CBCT guidance combined with ultrasound-based techniques. They were divided into 2 groups based on the use (C group) and nonuse (NC group) of CBCT guidance. The technical success of RFA and local tumor progression after the first RFA session were evaluated by dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging methods. Between-group differences were assessed retrospectively. RESULTS We enrolled 198 patients with 260 HCC nodules. The complete ablation rates were 63.0 and 89.4% in the NC and C groups, respectively. In log-rank testing, local tumor progression occurred significantly more often in the NC group when RFA was used without TACE, in males when des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin was ≥29 mAU/mL, and when the diameter of a nodule was ≥18 mm. On Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis, the NC group, RFA alone without TACE, and male gender were significant independent variables. CONCLUSION TACE followed by RFA under CBCT and ultrasound guidance improves the reliability of ablation of target HCC nodules, reduces the need for additional treatment sessions, and prevents local tumor progression.","Kato, Keizo; Abe, Hiroshi; Ika, Makiko; Yonezawa, Takeshi; Sato, Yoshiyuki; Hanawa, Noriko; Shimizu, Shohei; Endo, Shinji; Matsuo, Ryota; Tsubota, Akihito",Oncology,378,17

METHODS We randomly enrolled 100 children pre-screened by traditional in the outpatient department of Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine from February 6th to 16th, 2020, and another 100 children by the intelligent three-in-one mode from February 17th to 27th, 2020. The traditional triage was conducted by nurses based on face-to-face, one-by-one interview of the epidemiological history and consultation department, and the temperature was measured before manual triage. The intelligent three-in-one model of pre-inspection and triage combined online rapid pre-inspection and triage, on-site manual confirmation, as well as synchronized online health education system. For on-line registered patients, the system automatically sent the COVID-19 epidemiological pre-screening triage questionnaire one hour before the appointment, requiring parents to complete and submit online before arriving at the hospital. The on-site registered patients were controlled at 100 m outside of the hospital entrance. The nurses guided the parents to scan the QR code and fill in the COVID-19 epidemiological pre-examination triage questionnaire. At the entrance of the hospital, the nurse checked the guide sheet and took the temperature again. The children with red guidance sheet for isolation clinic were checked again and confirmed by pre-examination nurses, and accompanied to the isolation clinic by a special channel. The children with yellow guidance sheet were guided to fever clinic; parents with green guidance sheet took their children to the designated area by themselves, and then went to the corresponding consultation area after on-site manual pre inspection and registration. The whole process of health education was associated with outpatient notes, and the system automatically posted the corresponding outpatient instructions and education courses. Parents would read the courses on their mobile phones and counsel online. The time of pre-examination and the coincidence rate of triage were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The three-in-one intelligent pre-inspection mode took an average of (25.6±8.0) seconds for each child, which was significantly shorter than the traditional pre-inspection mode (74.8±36.4 seconds) (t=13.182, P<0.01). The triage coincidence rate of the intelligent pre-inspection model was 98%, which was similar to that of traditional model (97%, χ2=0.251, P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS The three-in-one intelligent pre-inspection model can effectively shorten the patient pre-check time, with similar triage coincidence rate to traditional model.","Shen, Meiping; Tong, Lin; Fu, Cangcang; Dong, Shuai; Wang, Tianlin; Zhu, Guohong; Xu, Hongzhen",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Nude mice implanted s.c. with TROP-2-expressing PC3 human prostate tumor cells or with PC3 metastases in the scapular and suprarenal region were injected i.v. with 1 mg of TF12 and, after 16 hours of tumor accumulation and blood clearance, were subsequently injected with 10 MBq, 0.2 nmol/mouse of either (111)In-RDC018 or (111)In-IMP288 as a control. Two hours after injection, both microSPECT/CT and fluorescence images were acquired, both before and after resection of the tumor nodules. After image acquisition, the biodistribution of (111)In-RDC018 and (111)In-IMP288 was determined and tumors were analyzed immunohistochemically. The biodistribution of the dual-label RDC018 showed specific accumulation in the TROP-2-expressing PC3 tumors (12.4 ± 3.7% ID/g at 2 hours postinjection), comparable with (111)In-IMP288 (9.1 ± 2.8% ID/g at 2 hours postinjection). MicroSPECT/CT and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging confirmed this TROP-2-specific uptake of the dual-label (111)In-RDC018 in both the s.c. and metastatic growing tumor model. In addition, PC3 metastases could be visualized preoperatively with SPECT/CT and could subsequently be resected by image-guided surgery using intraoperative NIRF imaging, showing the preclinical feasibility of pretargeted dual-modality imaging approach in prostate cancer.","Lütje, Susanne; Rijpkema, Mark; Goldenberg, David M; van Rij, Catharina M; Sharkey, Robert M; McBride, William J; Franssen, Gerben M; Frielink, Cathelijne; Helfrich, Wijnand; Oyen, Wim J G; Boerman, Otto C",Cancer research,378,1

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the consequences of interrupting invasive procedures in patients with chronic cardiac diseases due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. METHODS The study population is comprised of 2,158 patients that were pending on elective cardiac invasive procedures in 37 hospitals in Spain on the 14th of March 2020, when a state of alarm and subsequent lockdown was declared in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These patients were followed-up until April 31th. RESULTS Out of the 2,158 patients, 36 (1.7%) died. Mortality was significantly higher in patients pending on structural procedures (4.5% vs. 0.8%, respectively; p < .001), in those >80 year-old (5.1% vs. 0.7%, p < .001), and in presence of diabetes (2.4% vs. 1.3%, p = .057), hypertension (2.0% vs. 0.6%, p = .014), hypercholesterolemia (2.0% vs. 0.9%, p = .036), chronic renal failure (6.0% vs. 1.2%, p < .001), NYHA > II (3.8% vs. 1.2%, p = .001), and CCS > II (4.2% vs. 1.4%, p = .013), whereas was it was significantly lower in smokers (0.5% vs. 1.9%, p = .013).

We report the clinical and biochemical features of liver involvement, and the comorbidities that present with hepatitis, in a substantial cohort of patients. METHODS & RESULTS This is a retrospective cohort study of 44 patients with MIS-C admitted at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian during April and May 2020. We evaluated the number of patients who developed hepatitis and examined both demographics and inflammatory laboratory values to ascertain those that were at higher risk for liver involvement and more severe disease. Hepatitis was present in 19 subjects (43%) and was associated with more severe disease. Individuals with hepatitis had significantly higher rates of shock at presentation (21.1% vs. 0%, p=0.008), greater respiratory support requirement (42.1% vs. 12%, p=0.005), and longer hospitalization times (median 7-days [IQR5,10] vs 4-days [IQR3.5,6.5], p<0.05). Patients with hepatitis also had significantly higher levels of ferritin (706.9 vs. 334.2 mg/mL, p<0.01), Interleukin-6 (233.9 vs. 174.7 pg/mL, p<0.05), troponin (83 vs. 28.5 ng/L, p<0.05) and B-type Natriuretic peptide (7424.5 vs. 3209.5 pg/mL, p<0.05). The single patient with liver failure also developed multiorgan failure requiring vasopressors, hemodialysis, and mechanical ventilation. All patients were discharged, though more than 50% had persistent hepatitis up to one month after discharge. CONCLUSION Hepatitis is common in children with MIS-C and is associated with a more severe presentation and persistent elevation of LFTs in many. Despite the positive outcomes reported here, close follow-up is warranted given the limited knowledge of the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver.","Cantor, Amanda; Miller, Jonathan; Zachariah, Philip; DaSilva, Bernardo; Margolis, Kara; Martinez, Mercedes",Hepatology,378,1

We tested the hypothesis that sociodemographic, access to health care, and presentation to care characteristics among individuals with diabetes in Mexico confer an additional risk of hospitalization with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study using public data from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Mexican Ministry of Health. We included individuals with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between 1 March and 31 July 2020. The primary outcome was the predicted probability of hospitalization, inclusive of 8.5% of patients who required intensive care unit admission. RESULTS Among 373,963 adults with COVID-19, 16.1% (95% CI 16.0-16.3) self-reported diabetes. The predicted probability of hospitalization was 38.4% (37.6-39.2) for patients with diabetes only and 42.9% (42.2-43.7) for patients with diabetes and one or more comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease). High municipality-level of social deprivation and low state-level health care resources were associated with a 9.5% (6.3-12.7) and 17.5% (14.5-20.4) increased probability of hospitalization among patients with diabetes, respectively. In age-, sex-, and comorbidity-adjusted models, living in a context of high social vulnerability and low health care resources was associated with the highest predicted probability of hospitalization.

In routine circumstances, ICU triage is premised on the best interests of an individual patient; however, when increased demand exceeds capacity, as during an infectious disease outbreak, healthcare providers need to make difficult decisions to benefit the broader community while still respecting individual interests. We are currently living through an unprecedented period, with South Africa (SA) facing the challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa (CCSSA) expedited the development of a triage guidance document to inform the appropriate and fair use of scarce ICU resources during this pandemic. Triage decision-making is based on the clinical odds of a positive ICU outcome, balanced against the risk of mortality and longer-term morbidity affecting quality of life. Factors such as age and comorbid conditions are considered for their potential impact on clinical outcome, but are never the sole criteria for denying ICU-level care. Arbitrary, unfair discrimination is never condoned. The CCSSA COVID-19 triage guideline is aligned with SA law and international ethical standards, and upholds respect for all persons. The Bill of Rights, however, does not mandate the level of care enshrined in the constitutional right to healthcare. ICU admission is not always appropriate, available or feasible for every person suffering critical illness or injury; however, everyone has the right to receive appropriate healthcare at another level. If ICU resources are used for people who do not stand to benefit, this effectively denies others access to potentially life-saving healthcare. Appropriate triaging can therefore be considered a constitutional imperative.","Morrow, B M; Gopalan, P D; Joubert, I; Paruk, F; Pope, A",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,378,19

A total of 14 animals were scanned in this study, and 70% of the diseased animals presented at least one cortical lesion on postmortem imaging. Cortical lesions identified on MRI were verified with myelin proteolipid protein immunostaining. An optimized T2*-weighted sequence was developed for in vivo imaging and shown to capture 65% of cortical lesions detected postmortem. Immunostaining confirmed extensive demyelination with preserved neuronal somata in several cortical areas of EAE animals.

Prospective data collection was undertaken including operating time, additional ports and additional procedures undertaken.In this series, median operative time was 60 (range 34-170) min. An additional port was placed in 15 patients (5%), including two conversions to four-port technique (0.7%). Of these patients (n = 15), the majority were male (p < 0.0001). Reasons for additional port placement included bleeding and anatomical abnormalities. Additional port placement occurred more often within the first 50 cases (5/50, 10% vs 10/225, 4%).

The aim of this randomized double-blinded, controlled, clinical trial is to compare fibrin glue with tacks fixation of mesh during TAPP. METHODS One hundred and twelve men with unilateral inguinal hernia were enrolled. Primary outcome was pain during coughing on postoperative day 1. Secondary outcomes were postoperative scores of pain at rest, discomfort, and fatigue (day 1 and cumulated day 0-3), incidence of moderate/severe nausea and/or vomiting, foreign-body sensation, and recurrence after 6 months. Outcome measures were assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-100 mm), verbal rating scale (no, light, moderate or severe) and numerical rating scales (NRS, 1-10). RESULTS One hundred patients were available for analysis. The fibrin group (n = 50) had significantly less pain during coughing on day 1 compared with the tacks group (n = 50) [median 23 (range 0-80) vs 35 (2-100) mm] (p = 0.020). Moreover, day 1 scores and all cumulated scores of pain during rest, discomfort, and fatigue were significantly lower in the fibrin group compared with the tacks group (all p-values ≤ 0.02). There was no significant difference in the incidence of nausea and/or vomiting (p > 0.05) or recurrence (fibrin glue n = 2, tacks n = 0, p = 0.241).

We aimed to develop and validate a prediction tool for 30-day mortality for these patients on admission. Methods Consecutive hospitalized patients admitted to Tongji Hospital and Hubei Xinhua Hospital from January 1 to March 10, 2020, were retrospective analyzed. They were grouped as derivation and external validation set. Multivariate Cox regression was applied to identify the risk factors associated with death, and a nomogram was developed and externally validated by calibration plots, C-index, Kaplan-Meier curves and decision curve. Results Data from 1,717 patients at the Tongji Hospital and 188 cases at the Hubei Xinhua Hospital were included in our study. Using multivariate Cox regression with backward stepwise selection of variables in the derivation cohort, age, sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as seven biomarkers (aspartate aminotransferase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, high-sensitivity troponin I, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, D-dimer, and procalcitonin) were incorporated in the model. An age, biomarkers, clinical history, sex (ABCS)-mortality score was developed, which yielded a higher C-index than the conventional CURB-65 score for predicting 30-day mortality in both the derivation cohort {0.888 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.869-0.907] vs. 0.696 (95% CI, 0.660-0.731)} and validation cohort [0.838 (95% CI, 0.777-0.899) vs. 0.619 (95% CI, 0.519-0.720)], respectively. Furthermore, risk stratified Kaplan-Meier curves showed good discriminatory capacity of the model for classifying patients into distinct mortality risk groups for both derivation and validation cohorts. Conclusions The ABCS-mortality score might be offered to clinicians to strengthen the prognosis-based clinical decision-making, which would be helpful for reducing mortality of COVID-19 patients.","Jiang, Meng; Li, Changli; Zheng, Li; Lv, Wenzhi; He, Zhigang; Cui, Xinwu; Dietrich, Christoph F",Annals of translational medicine,378,13

It applied the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS) and integrated the role of two negative emotions (i.e., fear and anger) and subjective norms into the framework. A survey of 627 South Korean adults was conducted in March 2020, when the country experienced an early but rapidly accelerating pandemic stage. The results of structural equation modeling demonstrated that in addition to confirming the major propositions of STOPS, three situational perception variables (i.e., problem recognition, involvement recognition, and constraint recognition) were highly associated with an individual's fear and anger regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. However, only fear significantly affected situational motivation in problem-solving and information behaviors (i.e., information-seeking, forwarding, and permitting).

METHODS Prospective cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program between 2005 and 2010. Complications in patients undergoing unilateral first-time, elective laparoscopic unilateral inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) were compared with open inguinal hernia repair (OIHR). RESULTS Of 37,645 identified patients, 6,356 (16.9%) underwent LIHR and 31,289 (83.1%) underwent OIHR. Both groups had similar 30-day overall complications, major complications, and mortality rates: 62 (1.0%) vs 307 (1.0%), P = 1.00; 31 (.5%) vs 173 (.5%), P = .57; and 1 (.02%) vs 16 (.05%), P = .34, respectively. Using multivariable logistic regression, overall complications showed no difference, OR 1.01 (95% CI .76 to 1.34; P = .94), as did major complications, OR .90 (95% CI .61 to 1.34; P = .62), although favoring the LIHR group, where OR and CI represent the odss ratio and confidence intervals.

Recently, it has been suggested that radiofrequency-assisted liver resection (RFALR) may be more advantageous, but sufficient evidence has yet to be accumulated. METHOD The control group was constituted by 32 patients undergoing CC liver transection. The study group included 13 patients undergoing RFALR with a new fully automated radiofrequency generator supplying a comb-shaped bipolar multielectrode device. RESULTS RFALR allowed a faster hepatic transection and reduced both surgical time and intraoperative blood loss. RFALR was the only independent prognostic indicator of bleeding during liver transection. No significant liver damage and postoperative complications, particularly biliary leakage and stenosis, were experienced in the RFALR group. CONCLUSION Compared with the CC procedure, this bipolar device was shown to be safe and effective in liver resections, allowing a very clean surgical field without increase of postoperative complications.","Galizia, Gennaro; Castellano, Paolo; Pinto, Margherita; Zamboli, Anna; Orditura, Michele; De Vita, Ferdinando; Pignatelli, Carlo; Lieto, Eva",Surgical innovation,378,31

HCoVs are not always confined to the upper respiratory tract and can invade the central nervous system (CNS) under still unclear circumstances. HCoV-induced neuropathologies in humans are difficult to diagnose early enough to allow therapeutic interventions. Making use of our already described animal model of HCoV neuropathogenesis, we describe the route of neuropropagation from the nasal cavity to the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex and then the brain stem. We identified neuron-to-neuron propagation as one underlying mode of virus spreading in cell culture. Our data demonstrate that both passive diffusion of released viral particles and axonal transport are valid propagation strategies used by the virus. We describe for the first time the presence along axons of viral platforms whose static dynamism is reminiscent of viral assembly sites. We further reveal that HCoV OC43 modes of propagation can be modulated by selected HCoV OC43 proteins and axonal transport. Our work, therefore, identifies processes that may govern the severity and nature of HCoV OC43 neuropathogenesis and will make possible the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent occurrences.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses may invade the CNS, disseminate, and participate in the induction of neurological diseases. Their neuropathogenicity is being increasingly recognized in humans, and the presence and persistence of human coronaviruses (HCoV) in human brains have been proposed to cause long-term sequelae. Using our mouse model relying on natural susceptibility to HCoV OC43 and neuronal cell cultures, we have defined the most relevant path taken by HCoV OC43 to access and spread to and within the CNS toward the brain stem and spinal cord and studied in cell culture the underlying modes of intercellular propagation to better understand its neuropathogenesis. Our data suggest that axonal transport governs HCoV OC43 egress in the CNS, leading to the exacerbation of neuropathogenesis. Exploiting knowledge on neuroinvasion and dissemination will enhance our ability to control viral infection within the CNS, as it will shed light on underlying mechanisms of neuropathogenesis and uncover potential druggable molecular virus-host interfaces.","Dubé, Mathieu; Le Coupanec, Alain; Wong, Alan H M; Rini, James M; Desforges, Marc; Talbot, Pierre J",Journal of virology,378,1

In addition, the present biologically permeable second near-infrared (NIR-II) light-induced nanocomplexes photo-thermally trigger calcium influx into target cells overexpressing the transient receptor potential vanilloid family type 2 (TRPV2). This combination of nanomaterial design and genetic engineering effectively eliminates cancer cells and suppresses stemness of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

Since the mammalian cell system is capable of post-translational modification, thus forming properly folded and glycosylated proteins, recombinant proteins expressed in mammalian cells have shown the greatest potential to maintain high antigenicity and immunogenicity. Although no new cases of SARS have been reported since 2004, future outbreaks are a constant threat; therefore, the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV is a prudent preventive step and should be carried out. The RBD of SARS-CoV S protein plays important roles in receptor binding and induction of specific neutralizing antibodies against virus infection. Therefore, in this protocol, we describe novel methods for developing a RBD-based subunit vaccine against SARS. Briefly, the recombinant RBD protein (rRBD) was expressed in culture supernatant of mammalian 293T cells to obtain a correctly folded protein with proper conformation and high immunogenicity. The transfection of the recombinant plasmid encoding RBD to the cells was then performed using a calcium phosphate transfection method with some modifications. Compared with the lipid transfection method, this modified calcium phosphate transfection method is cheaper, easier to handle, and has the potential to reach high efficacy once a transfection complex with suitable size and shape is formed. Finally, a SARS pseudovirus neutralization assay was introduced in the protocol and used to detect the neutralizing activity of sera of mice vaccinated with rRBD protein. This assay is relatively safe, does not involve an infectious SARS-CoV, and can be performed without the requirement of a biosafety-3 laboratory. The protocol described here can also be used to design and study recombinant subunit vaccines against other viruses with class I fusion proteins, for example, HIV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Ebola virus, influenza virus, as well as Nipah and Handra viruses. In addition, the methods for generating a pseudovirus and subsequently establishing a pseudovirus neutralization assay can be applied to all these viruses.","Du, Lanying; Zhang, Xiujuan; Liu, Jixiang; Jiang, Shibo",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,378,1

Developed in 2000, there have been calls for greater academic involvement in development of SROI, which to date has been more typically implemented in-house or by consultants. This protocol describes a systematic review of SROI analysis conducted on health and social care programmes which represent a significant sector of social enterprise internationally. The aims of the systematic review are to (1) identify the extent to which academics have adopted SROI methodology, (2) how academics have interpreted, used and developed SROI methodology and (3) to assess the quality of studies published under peer review. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The systematic review will include peer-reviewed studies since 2000 published in English. Search terms will be 'social return on investment' or 'SROI'. Health and social care interventions will be identified in the initial screening given the proliferation of possible key words in these areas. Databases to be searched include Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, Social Care Online and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Two reviewers will independently conduct initial screening based on titles and abstracts against the inclusion criteria. Data extracted will include date of intervention, country, study design, aim of intervention/programme, participants and setting, health and social care measures used, and SROI ratio. The quality of studies will be assessed by two reviewers using a SROI quality framework designed for the purpose of this study.

SETTING COVID wards in Acute Hospital in Brescia province, Northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS We used data from 627 subjects admitted to Acute Medical wards with COVID 19 pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS Clinical records of each patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis of dementia, modalities of onset of the COVID-19 infection, symptoms of presentation at the hospital and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS Dementia was diagnosed in 82 patients (13.1%). The mortality rate was 62.2% (51/82) among patients affected by dementia compared to 26.2% (143/545) in subjects without dementia (p<0.001, Chi-Squared test). In a logistic regression model age, and the diagnosis of dementia resulted independently associated with a higher mortality, and patients diagnosed with dementia presented an OR of 1.84 (95% CI: 1.09-3.13, p<0.05).

The German Lung cancer Screening Intervention (LUSI) is a randomized trial among 4,052 long-term smokers, 50-69 years of age, recruited from the general population, comparing five annual rounds of LDCT screening (screening arm; n = 2,029 participants) with a control arm (n = 2,023) followed by annual postal questionnaire inquiries. Data on lung cancer incidence and mortality and vital status were collected from hospitals or office-based physicians, cancer registries, population registers and health offices.

Yet, limited data, if any, are currently available on the role of ECMO in critically ill patients with COVID-19. We aimed at providing a snapshot analysis of ECMO for COVID-19 in Europe. METHODS Freely available data on ECMO in COVID-19 patients reported by the European Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (EuroELSO) were extracted and analyzed after conversion into long format. The primary outcome was the incidence of death during ECMO. Bootstrapping and logistic regression was used for inferential estimates. RESULTS Details from a total of 333 patients treated in 90 institutions spanning 17 countries were obtained, with 22% women and mean age of 52 years. Death rate was 17.1% (95% confidence interval: 13.1% to 21.1%), even if significant between-center differences were found, with some institutions reporting 100% case fatality. Exploratory inferential analysis showed no nominally statistically significant association between death and gender (p=0.788), but a significant association was found with age, mainly due to increased case fatality in subjects >60 years (odds ratio: 4.80 [95% confidence interval 1.64 to 14.04], p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS ECMO may play an important role in critically ill patients with COVID-19 refractory to less invasive treatments. The increased risk of early death in older patients may be used to prioritize ECMO indication in resource-conscious settings, if confirmed externally.","Marullo, Antonino G; Cavarretta, Elena; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Mancone, Massimo; Peruzzi, Mariangela; Piscioneri, Fernando; Sartini, Patrizio; Versaci, Francesco; Morelli, Andrea; Miraldi, Fabio; Frati, Giacomo",Minerva cardioangiologica,378,1

METHODS Marginal reflex distance 2 (MRD2), inferior scleral show, lateral canthal height, lateral canthal angle, horizontal palpebral aperture, and lateral scleral triangle area were measured preoperatively and at postoperative week 1, month 3, and the final follow-up visit. RESULTS Minimum follow-up time was 6 months (mean, 15.1 months). At the final follow-up visit, MRD2 decreased by 0.41 ± 0.14 mm, inferior scleral show decreased by 0.27 ± 0.05 mm, and lateral canthal height increased by 0.81 ± 0.15 mm. The overall function of time was found to be significant for change in MRD2 (P < 0.01). In multiple comparisons, all time point values were significantly different from one another (Bonferroni corrected, P < 0.05), except for 3 months and the final position, which were not. Similarly, the overall effect of time on lateral canthus position was also significant (P < 0.01). All time points were significantly different from one another (Bonferroni corrected, P < 0.05). The overall effect of time on inferior scleral show was also significant (P < 0.01). Differences were significant from preoperative to final postoperative position, although the other time points were not significant (Bonferroni corrected, P < 0.05). No complications were noted. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive lateral canthal resuspension provides durable, albeit modest, improvements in MRD2, inferior scleral show, and lateral canthal height without significantly changing lateral canthal angle, horizontal palpebral aperture, or lateral scleral triangle area.","Ramesh, Sathyadeepak; Gupta, Adit; Rootman, Daniel Benson; Goldberg, Robert Alan",Asia-Pacific journal of ophthalmology,378,31

It is unclear if patients who test positive for cocaine but have a normal electrocardiogram and vital signs have a greater percentage of hemodynamic events intraoperatively. METHODS A total of 328 patients with a history of cocaine use who were scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. Patients were categorized into cocaine-positive versus cocaine-negative groups based on the results of their urine cocaine toxicology test. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events, defined as (1) a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of <65 or >105 mm Hg and (2) a heart rate (HR) of <50 or >100 beats per minute (bpm) compared to cocaine-negative patients. The study was powered to assess if the 2 groups had an equivalent mean percent of intraoperative hemodynamic events within specific limits using an equivalence test of means consisting of 2 one-sided tests. RESULTS The cocaine-positive group had a blood pressure (BP) that was outside the set limits 19.4% (standard deviation [SD] 17.7%) of the time versus 23.1% (SD 17.7%) in the cocaine-negative group (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-7.0). The cocaine-positive group had a HR outside the set limits 9.6% (SD 16.2%) of the time versus 8.2% (SD 14.9%) in the cocaine-negative group (95% CI, 4.3-1.5). Adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and the presence of comorbid hypertension, renal disease, and psychiatric illness, the cocaine-positive and cocaine-negative patients were similar within a 7.5% margin of equivalence for MAP data (β coefficient = 2%, P = .003, CI, 2-6) and within a 5% margin of equivalence for HR data (βcoefficient = 0.2%, P < .001, CI, 4-3). CONCLUSIONS Asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia have similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events compared to cocaine-negative patients.","Moon, Tiffany S; Pak, Taylor J; Kim, Agnes; Gonzales, Michael X; Volnov, Yuri; Wright, Evan; Vu, Kevin Q; Lu, Rachael D; Sharifi, Arghavan; Minhajuddin, Abu; Chen, Joy L; Fox, Pamela E; Gasanova, Irina; Fox, Amanda A; Stewart, Jesse; Ogunnaike, Babatunde",Anesthesia and analgesia,378,19

MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-three patients (mean age 67 ± 10 years; 18 females, 35 males, TASC B and C, mean lesion length 7.9 ± 3.5 cm) with PAD (Rutherford 2-6) were enrolled into this prospective monocentric study. In total, 59 calcified lesions of the superficial femoral artery were treated with the Silverhawk atherectomy device (Covidien, Plymouth, MN, USA). Patients were followed-up for 36 months with a 6-month interval to perform clinical re-evaluation, including measurement of maximum walking distance and ankle-brachial index (ABI) as well as duplex-sonography. RESULTS The primary success rate of the procedure was 92 %. In five cases (8 %), additional balloon-PTA and/or stent-PTA was necessary. Procedure-related embolization occurred in seven cases (12 %), which were all successfully treated by aspiration. The primary patency rate after 3 years was 55 %. Median Rutherford score decreased significantly from 5 to 0 after 36 months (p < 0.001). At the same time, the ABI increased from 0.65 to 1.12 (not significant). The limb-salvage rate after 3 years was 87 %. CONCLUSION In this subgroup of patients with POD and calcified stenotic lesions, atherectomy was successfully applied to decrease the plaque burden. Results after 3 years showed a significant decrease of Rutherford score with persistent improvement of ABI and reasonable patency rate.","Minko, P; Buecker, A; Jaeger, S; Katoh, M",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,378,19

Nous avons voulu décrire les caractéristiques cliniques et les issues des patients gravement atteints de la maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) en contexte canadien. MÉTHODES: Nous avons procédé à l’étude rétrospective d’une série de cas graves d’infection au SRAS-CoV-2 confirmée en laboratoire hospitalisés dans l’une des 6 USI du Vancouver métropolitain, en Colombie-Britannique (Canada), entre le 21 février et le 14 avril 2020. Les données démographiques, les renseignements sur la prise en charge et les résultats ont été recueillis à partir des dossiers médicaux, électroniques ou non, des patients. RÉSULTATS: Entre le 21 février et le 14 avril 2020, 117 patients ont été admis dans une USI avec un diagnostic confirmé de COVID-19. L’âge médian était de 69 ans (écart interquartile [EI] 60–75 ans); et 38 (32,5 %) étaient des femmes. Au moins une comorbidité était présente chez 86 patients (73,5 %).

METHODS Cross-sectional data were from the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Survey (CPAS, N = 2365 parents of a child 0-18 years, 8-28th April 2020); and a pre-pandemic national database containing 18 years of annual surveys collected in 2002-2019 (N = 17,529 parents). RESULTS Levels of subjective wellbeing during the pandemic were considerably lower than ratings prior to the pandemic (Personal Wellbeing Index, mean[SD] = 65.3 [17.0]; compared to [SD] = 75.8 [11.9], p < 0.001). During the pandemic, lower subjective wellbeing was associated with low education (adjusted regression coefficient, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = -5.19, -0.93), language other-than-English (95% CI = -7.22, -1.30), government benefit (95% CI = -6.99, -0.96), single parents (95% CI = -8.84, -4.59), child neurodevelopmental condition (95% CI = -3.44, -0.76), parent physical/mental health problems (95% CI = -3.23, -0.67), COVID-environmental stressors (95% CI = -3.48, -2.44), and fear/worry about COVID-19 (95% CI = -8.13, -5.96). Unexpectedly, parent engagement with news media about the pandemic was associated with higher subjective wellbeing (95% CI = 0.35, 1.61). CONCLUSION Subjective wellbeing in parents raising children aged 0-18 years appears to be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions in Australia.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), a major ACH eliminating enzyme, is genetically deficient in 30-50% of Eastern Asians. In alcohol drinkers, ALDH2-deficiency is a well-known risk factor for upper aerodigestive tract cancers, i.e., head and neck cancer and esophageal cancer. However, there is only a limited evidence for stomach cancer. In this study we demonstrated for the first time that ALDH2 deficiency results in markedly increased exposure of the gastric mucosa to acetaldehyde after intragastric administration of alcohol. Our finding provides concrete evidence for a causal relationship between acetaldehyde and gastric carcinogenesis. A plausible explanation is the gastric first pass metabolism of ethanol. The gastric mucosa expresses alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzymes catalyzing the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, especially at the high ethanol concentrations prevailing in the stomach after the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The gastric mucosa also possesses the acetaldehyde-eliminating ALDH2 enzyme. Due to decreased mucosal ALDH2 activity, the elimination of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde is decreased, which results in its accumulation in the gastric juice. We also demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment, and L-cysteine cause independent changes in gastric juice and salivary acetaldehyde levels, indicating that intragastric acetaldehyde is locally regulated by gastric mucosal ADH and ALDH2 enzymes, and by oral microbes colonizing an achlorhydric stomach. Markedly elevated acetaldehyde levels were also found at low intragastric ethanol concentrations corresponding to the ethanol levels of many foodstuffs, beverages, and dairy products produced by fermentation. A capsule that slowly releases L-cysteine effectively eliminated acetaldehyde from the gastric juice of PPI-treated ALDH2-active and ALDH2-deficient subjects. These results provide entirely novel perspectives for the prevention of gastric cancer, especially in established risk groups.","Maejima, Ryuhei; Iijima, Katsunori; Kaihovaara, Pertti; Hatta, Waku; Koike, Tomoyuki; Imatani, Akira; Shimosegawa, Tooru; Salaspuro, Mikko",PloS one,378,1

Over the last 8 years, we have witnessed, in our institution, several cases of severe UPE requiring immediate postoperative extracorporeal life support after MICS. Reviewing the available literature, data regarding this complication after MICS are rare. Consequently, we decided to retrospectively analyse patients scheduled for MICS in our institution. METHODS After approval by our institutional review board, 256 MICS patients were analysed. As a primary end-point, we defined a newly developed UPE, radiographically evident within the first 24 h postoperatively. Secondary end-points were length of stay in the intensive care unit, length of stay in the hospital and in-hospital mortality. Chest radiographs were analysed by an independent consultant of radiology. RESULTS Fifty-one (19.9%) patients showed increased right-sided pulmonary vascular congestion in the 1st postoperative chest radiography performed in the intensive care unit. Five (1.95%) patients immediately required extracorporeal life support after admission to the intensive care unit. Cardiopulmonary bypass time was significantly longer in the UPE group [UPE vs non-UPE 213 (49) vs 196 (43) min; P = 0.013]. More patients with UPE showed a preoperative increase of C-reactive protein >0.4265 mg/dl (P = 0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified a preoperative increase in C-reactive protein >0.4265 mg/dl as well as a prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (odds ratio 1.009, 95% confidence level 1.002-1.016; P = 0.014) independent risk factors, significantly associated with the development of UPE (odds ratio 2.583, 95% confidence interval 1.275-5.233; P = 0.008), a prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (odds ratio 1.009, 95% confidence interval 1.002-1.016; P = 0.014). The presence of pulmonary hypertension (odds ratio 0.273, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.84; P = 0.02) seemed to be a protective factor regarding the genesis of UPE. CONCLUSIONS In accordance with the rarely available literature regarding UPE after MICS, our analysis led us to hypothesize the possibility of an inflammatory disposition for UPE. The role of pulmonary hypertension remains unclear in our patient population.

DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched up to 1 February 2020 with no restriction on the earliest date. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Observational cohort studies that reported either the risk of all-cause mortality, incidence of non-fatal cardiovascular events (CVE) or progression of kidney disease among adults with established CKD who have NAFLD compared with those without. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers extracted data and assessed bias independently. RESULTS Of 2604 records identified, 3 studies were included (UK (n=852), South Korea (n=1525) and USA (n=1413)). All were judged to have a low or moderate risk of bias. Data were insufficient for meta-analysis. Two studies examined the influence of NAFLD on all-cause mortality. One reported a significant positive association for NAFLD with all-cause mortality for individuals with CKD (p<0.05) (cardiovascular-related mortality p=ns), which was lost following adjustment for metabolic risk factors; the second reported no effect in adjusted and unadjusted models. The latter was the only study to report outcomes for non-fatal CVEs and observed NAFLD to be an independent risk factor for this (propensity-matched HR=2.00, p=0.02). Two studies examined CKD progression; in one adjusted rate of percentage decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate per year was found to be increased in those with NAFLD (p=0.002), whereas the other found no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS Few studies have examined the influence of NAFLD on prognosis and major adverse clinical outcomes within the CKD population. The studies identified were diverse in design and results were conflicting.

Cases were defined as women with diagnosed placenta praevia over 20 weeks' gestation and having had one or more prior caesarean sections. Risk factors assessed from the prior caesarean section were (i) type of suture used for hysterotomy closure; (ii) stage of labour; (iii) type of primary surgeon; and (iv) model of funding. Univariate and logistical regression analyses were performed. RESULTS Use of monofilament suture for hysterotomy closure in prior caesarean section significantly reduced the chance of having placenta praevia in the index pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.80), as did prior caesarean being performed in the first stage of labour (aOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.92).

Based on sequence similarity, human PP11 was included in a protein family whose characterized members are XendoU, a Xenopus laevis endoribonuclease involved in small nucleolar RNA processing, and Nsp15, an endoribonuclease essential for coronavirus replication. Here we show that the bacterially expressed human PP11 displays RNA binding capability and cleaves single stranded RNA in a Mn(2+)-dependent manner at uridylates, to produce molecules with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate ends. These features, together with structural and mutagenesis analyses, which identified the potential active site residues, reveal striking parallels to the amphibian XendoU and assign a ribonuclease function to PP11.

Many surgeons use clinical predictors to guide selective use of upper gastrointestinal imaging (UGI). The appropriate practice remains undefined. STUDY DESIGN A review of patients who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between January 2002 and December 2008 was conducted. All underwent routine UGI studies on postoperative day 1. Actual gastrojejunal leak within 7 days of surgery (actual leak [AL], radiologic leaks), operative reports, patient charts, and postoperative vital signs were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS There were 2,099 operations. Eight ALs (0.43%) occurred without associated mortality. UGI was positive in 7 AL patients and falsely positive in 6 patients. The AL patients underwent laparoscopy on postoperative days 1 and 3 (n = 5 and n = 1, respectively), laparotomy on postoperative day 3 (n = 1), and peritoneal drainage (n = 1). False-positive UGIs prompted laparoscopy (n = 3) and close observation (n = 3). Pulse was 100 to 120 beats per minute in 2 patients and fever (>38.5°C) was present in 0 AL patients. AL patients had osteogenesis imperfecta (n = 1), macronodular cirrhosis (n = 1), positive bubble test (n = 3), and concomitant splenectomy (n = 1). No jejunojejunostomy leaks were identified. CONCLUSIONS Routine UGI after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has greater sensitivity than clinical signs for detecting gastrojejunal leak. Delay in the diagnosis of leakage can impact mortality, and this suggests that indications for routine UGI might still exist. Tachycardia is not a reliable early marker of leak. There might be risk factors for leak in addition to vital signs, including patient medical history or intraoperative events, which should prompt routine UGI on postoperative day 1.","Leslie, Daniel B; Dorman, Robert B; Anderson, Joel; Serrot, Federico J; Kellogg, Todd A; Buchwald, Henry; Sampson, Barbara K; Slusarek, Bridget M; Ikramuddin, Sayeed",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,378,17

DATA SOURCES Recent, randomized controlled trials of endovascular interventions for acute ischemic stroke were identified. The search terms ""endovascular"" AND ""stroke"" were used and filter for ""randomized controlled trial"" was applied; the period searched was January 1, 2013, to October 31, 2015. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Randomized controlled trials of endovascular interventions in acute ischemic stroke published within the past 3 years (2013-2015). DATA SYNTHESIS A total of 8 trials are reviewed: 3 trials published in 2013 demonstrated neutral results for endovascular interventions, and 5 trials published in 2015 demonstrated positive results for endovascular interventions. Potential reasons for the change in outcomes include better patient selection and improvement indevice technology. Patient selection improvements included selecting patients with salvageable brain tissue with an identifiable thrombus on perfusion imaging. The major improvement in device technology was the introduction of the Solitaire Flow Restoration stent retriever and the Trevo stent retriever, both of which have improved recanalization rates compared with earlier devices. Adjunctive medication considerations include the mode of sedation (general or conscious), intraprocedural anticoagulation with heparin, and intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator. CONCLUSIONS The use of endovascular devices for treating acute ischemic stroke is likely to increase as more centers become capable of integrating them into their stroke programs. It is important for pharmacists to understand the trials that evaluated endovascular interventions because differences exist with respect to device, adjunctive medication, and patient selection, all of which affect patient outcomes.","Bishop, Bryan M",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,378,26

However, variability in evidence-based eye care delivery has been reported. Given the important role of optometrists in delivering primary eye care, a better understanding of the barriers and facilitators to providing optometric care is required. This systematic review aimed to identify determinants (barriers and facilitators) of eye care delivery by optometrists and interventions that may improve eye care delivery. RECENT FINDINGS PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, PsychINFO, ProQuest and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting barriers and facilitators to eye care delivery published between 1999 and 2020. The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was used to analyse data (quotations, interpretive summaries, survey result) with barriers and facilitators coded to one or more of the 14 domains, and used to identify the key behavioural domains influencing eye care delivery based on frequency of coding, elaboration and stated importance in the study. Influential domains were mapped to the Behaviour Change Wheel to identify potential interventions to improve eye care delivery. Of the 802 studies retrieved from the search, 30 were included. Frequently identified barriers were time constraints, resources and equipment issues, patient factors, lack of awareness, skill proficiency deficits and negative attitudes and beliefs. Frequently identified facilitators were adequate time, resources and equipment, education, skill proficiency and understanding the relevancy of the eye care provided. The key TDF domains influencing eye care delivery were 'environmental context and resources' (time, resources, equipment issues, patient factors), 'knowledge' (awareness issues), 'skills' (skills proficiency) and 'belief about consequences' (beliefs and relevancy). Intervention functions that may improve eye care delivery were education, training, restriction, environmental restructuring, enablement, persuasion and modelling. SUMMARY The barriers and facilitators identified in this review were diverse and located at both the practitioner and organisational levels. Four TDF domains were found to be influential determinants of eye care practice. Intervention functions identified in this study can be used to improve the appropriateness of primary eye care delivery.","Toomey, Melinda; Gyawali, Rajendra; Stapleton, Fiona; Ho, Kam Chun; Keay, Lisa; Jalbert, Isabelle",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,378,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic literature research for articles published between January 2010 and February 2020 was conducted in Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and Science Direct using a combination of the following MeSH/Emtree terms and keywords: sodium hypochlorite, alcohol, ethanol, povidone-iodine, dental ceramic, zirconia, lithium disilicate, and acrylic resin. RESULTS A total of 538 studies were identified in the search during initial screening, of which 44 were subject to full-text evaluation, and 24 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Seven articles on zirconia and lithium disilicate investigated the effect of NaOCl (0.5% and 1%), 96% isopropanol, and 80% ethanol on bond strength after saliva contamination. The remaining articles evaluated color alteration, surface roughness modifications, decrease in flexural strength, and bonding strength of all cleaning agents on acrylic resin. CONCLUSION NaOCl (1%) solution for 1 minute is recommended to reduce SARS-CoV infectivity and to minimize the risk of cross-contamination through prosthetic materials. The increase in surface roughness and color alteration were recorded using 1% NaOCl on acrylic resin, but this increase was not clinically significant. A decrease in bonding strength was determined after using 1% NaOCl, 96% isopropanol, and 80% ethanol solutions on lithium disilicate. Silanization before the try-in procedure and the application of the second layer of silane after cleaning methods are recommended to improve the bonding strength.","Di Fiore, Adolfo; Monaco, Carlo; Granata, Stefano; Stellini, Edoardo",The International journal of prosthodontics,378,19

DESIGN In vitro study (Canadian Task Force classification: II-1). SETTING Academic hospital simulation laboratory. INTERVENTION Beef tongue specimens weighing 400 to 500 g were stained using 5 mL indigo carmine dye and morcellated under laparoscopic guidance within a plastic box trainer. CTE was performed via 3 different techniques: a stitch-sealed rip-stop nylon bag and multi-port approach; a one-piece clear plastic 50 × 50-cm isolation bag and multi-port approach; or a 1-piece clear plastic 50 × 50-cm isolation bag and single-site approach. Four trials of each CTE method were performed and compared with an open morcellation control. All bags were insufflated to within 10 to 25 mmHg pressure with a standard CO2 insufflator. Visual evidence of spilled tissue or dye was recorded, and fluid washings of the box trainer were sent for cytologic analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Blue dye spill was noted in only 1 of 12 CTE trials. Spillage was visualized from a seam in 1 of the 4 stitch-sealed rip-stop nylon bags before morcellation of the specimen. The only trial in which gross tissue chips were visualized in the box trainer after morcellation was the open morcellation control. However, cytologic examination revealed muscle cells in the open morcellation washings and in the washings from the trial with dye spill. Muscle cells were not observed at cytologly in any of the other samples. CONCLUSION CTE did not result in any leakage or tissue dissemination with use of the single-site or multi-port approach when using a 1-piece clear plastic 50 × 50-cm isolation bag. Further studies are needed to corroborate these findings in an in vivo context and to evaluate use of alternate bag options for specimen containment.","Cohen, Sarah L; Greenberg, James A; Wang, Karen C; Srouji, Serene S; Gargiulo, Antonio R; Pozner, Charles N; Hoover, Nicholas; Einarsson, Jon I",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,378,1

AIM To assess effectiveness of vedolizumab for EIM in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a large real-life experience cohort. METHODS Between June and December 2014, 173 patients with Crohn's disease and 121 with ulcerative colitis were treated with vedolizumab. Patients were followed until week 54. EIM activity was assessed at weeks 0, 6, 14, 22, 30 and 54 by using a 3-step scale: complete remission, partial response and no response. RESULTS At baseline, 49 (16.7%) patients had EIMs of which 47 had inflammatory arthralgia/arthritis, four had cutaneous lesions and two had both rheumatologic and skin EIM. At week 54, 21 (44.7%) patients had complete remission for inflammatory arthralgia/arthritis and three (75%) for cutaneous EIM. In multivariate analysis, complete remission of inflammatory arthralgia/arthritis was associated with clinical remission of IBD (OR = 1.89, IC95% [1.05-3.41], P = .03) and recent onset of inflammatory arthralgia/arthritis (OR = 1.99, IC95% [1.12-3.52], P = .02). During the follow-up period, 34 (13.8%) patients without any EIM at baseline, developed incident cases of inflammatory arthralgia/arthritis consisting mostly of peripheral arthralgia without evidence of arthritis and 14 (4.8%) incident cases of paradoxical skin manifestation. CONCLUSION Vedolizumab therapy is commonly associated with improvement in EIM. This was associated with quiescent IBD and recent EIM. However, paradoxical skin manifestation and inflammatory arthralgia/arthritis may occur upon vedolizumab therapy.","Tadbiri, S; Peyrin-Biroulet, L; Serrero, M; Filippi, J; Pariente, B; Roblin, X; Buisson, A; Stefanescu, C; Trang-Poisson, C; Altwegg, R; Marteau, P; Vaysse, T; Bourrier, A; Nancey, S; Laharie, D; Allez, M; Savoye, G; Gilletta, C; Gagniere, C; Vuitton, L; Viennot, S; Aubourg, A; Pelletier, A-L; Bouguen, G; Abitbol, V; Fumery, M; Claudepierre, P; Bouhnik, Y; Amiot, A",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,378,1

This review focuses on the role of viruses as a cause of nosocomial pneumonia. RECENT FINDINGS Respiratory viruses may be responsible for healthcare-associated pneumonia, because affected patients and those with CAP have the same risk factors for viral disease. In mechanically ventilated patients, viruses belonging to the Herpesviridae family, namely herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus, can be reactivated and cause bronchopneumonitis or ventilator-associated pneumonia, respectively. Recent results confirmed the high rate of HSV reactivation in the distal airways of mechanically ventilated patients, and that patients with high virus loads (>10(5) copies/ml of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) have poorer outcomes than those with low or no virus load. However, the responsibility of mimivirus, initially described as a possible cause of pneumonia, was not confirmed for nosocomial pneumonia. SUMMARY Respiratory viruses are mainly responsible for CAP, but they may also cause healthcare-associated pneumonia. HSV bronchopneumonitis and cytomegalovirus pneumonia are not rare diseases, and patients with Herpesviridae lung infections have worse prognoses than those without. Whether or not those Herpesviridae infections are responsible for true morbidity or morbidity remains to be determined.","Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Bréchot, Nicolas; Chastre, Jean",Current opinion in infectious diseases,378,17

We studied the impact of smoking on long-term angiographic and clinical outcomes after flow-diverter treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed data from patients treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device and included in the International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device, the Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms Study, and the Aneurysm Study of Pipeline in an Observational Registry. Patients were stratified according to smoking status into 3 groups: 1) never smoker, 2) current smoker, and 3) former smoker. We studied angiographic and clinical outcomes. Outcomes were compared by using χ(2) and Student t tests. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine whether smoking was independently associated with poor outcomes. RESULTS Six hundred sixteen patients with 694 aneurysms were included. Current smokers had a smaller mean aneurysm size compared with the other 2 groups (P = .005) and lower rates of multiple Pipeline Embolization Device use (P = .015). On multivariate analysis, former smokers (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.43-2.71; P = .57) and current smokers (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.27-1.77; P = .38) had similar odds of long-term angiographic incomplete occlusion compared with never smokers. Former smokers (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.64-2.52; P = .25) and current smokers (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.37-1.46; P = .22) had similar odds of major morbidity and neurologic mortality compared with never smokers. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that smoking is not associated with angiographic and clinical outcomes among patients treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device. Nonetheless, patients with intracranial aneurysms should continue to be counseled about the risks of tobacco smoking.","Rouchaud, A; Brinjikji, W; Cloft, H J; Lanzino, G; Becske, T; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

113464,113464,113464,EAHP's 50th General Assembly designates András Süle as President-Elect.,18.439629,0.47450775,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND In epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general population, due to their contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Contact precautions by means of personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to remove PPE, and how to make sure HCW use PPE as instructed. OBJECTIVES To evaluate which type of full body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of self-contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols. SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE (PubMed up to 15 July 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Trials (CENTRAL up to 18 June 2019), Scopus (Scopus 18 June 2019), CINAHL (EBSCOhost 31 July 2018), and OSH-Update (up to 31 December 2018). We also screened reference lists of included trials and relevant reviews, and contacted NGOs and manufacturers of PPE. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all controlled studies that compared the effects of PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases with serious consequences, such as Ebola or SARS, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. This included studies that used simulated contamination with fluorescent markers or a non-pathogenic virus.We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training in PPE use on the same outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included trials. We planned to perform meta-analyses but did not find sufficiently similar studies to combine their results. MAIN RESULTS We included 17 studies with 1950 participants evaluating 21 interventions. Ten studies are Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), one is a quasi RCT and six have a non-randomised controlled design. Two studies are awaiting assessment.Ten studies compared types of PPE but only six of these reported sufficient data. Six studies compared different types of donning and doffing and three studies evaluated different types of training. Fifteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless viruses. In simulation studies, contamination rates varied from 10% to 100% of participants for all types of PPE. In one study HCW were exposed to Ebola and in another to SARS.Evidence for all outcomes is based on single studies and is very low quality.Different types of PPEPPE made of more breathable material may not lead to more contamination spots on the trunk (Mean Difference (MD) 1.60 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -0.15 to 3.35) than more water repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD -0.46; 95% CI -0.84 to -0.08, scale of 1 to 5).Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (MD large patches -1.36 95% CI -1.78 to -0.94).The use of a powered air-purifying respirator may protect better than a simple ensemble of PPE without such respirator (Relative Risk (RR) 0.27; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.43).Five different PPE ensembles (such as gown vs. coverall, boots with or without covers, hood vs. cap, length and number of gloves) were evaluated in one study, but there were no event data available for compared groups.Alterations to PPE design may lead to less contamination such as added tabs to grab masks (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31), a sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), or a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55) compared to standard PPE.Different methods of donning and doffing proceduresDouble gloving may lead to less contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.78).Following CDC recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (MD small patches -5.44; 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45).Alcohol-based hand rub used during the doffing process may not lead to less contamination than the use of a hypochlorite based solution (MD 4.00; 95% CI 0.47 to 34.24).Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4).Different types of trainingThe use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7).A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70; 95% CI 20.14,41.26) than a traditional lecture.Face to face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only.There were no studies on effects of training in the long term or on resource use.The quality of the evidence is very low for all comparisons because of high risk of bias in all studies, indirectness of evidence, and small numbers of participants. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found very low quality evidence that more breathable types of PPE may not lead to more contamination, but may have greater user satisfaction. Alterations to PPE, such as tabs to grab may decrease contamination. Double gloving, following CDC doffing guidance, and spoken instructions during doffing may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than video or folder based training. Because data come from single small studies with high risk of bias, we are uncertain about the estimates of effects.We still need randomised controlled trials to find out which training works best in the long term. We need better simulation studies conducted with several dozen participants to find out which PPE protects best, and what is the safest way to remove PPE. Consensus on the best way to conduct simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should have their use of PPE registered and should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection in the field.","Verbeek, Jos H; Rajamaki, Blair; Ijaz, Sharea; Tikka, Christina; Ruotsalainen, Jani H; Edmond, Michael B; Sauni, Riitta; Kilinc Balci, F Selcen",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,378,33

Previous research on assistive technology has focused on socioeconomic impacts such as education, employment and access to healthcare by people with intellectual disability. There is a need to consolidate evidence on the interaction between intellectual disability, assistive technology, community living and social inclusion. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The review will consider studies from all settings: geographical, socioeconomic and care (institutional and community care), published in English. Studies reported in other languages with abstracts in English will be included if they can be translated using Google Translate, otherwise such studies will be included in the appendix. The review will include both qualitative and quantitative studies. The intervention in this review refers to the use of assistive technology to promote community participation or interpersonal relationships (social inclusion) for people with intellectual disability. The outcomes will be behavioural and social benefits of using assistive technology by people with intellectual disability. Enhanced interpersonal relationships and community participation by people with intellectual disability. Data analysis will be in two phases. The first phase will involve analysis of individual study designs separately. The second phase will be narrative/thematic synthesis of all study groups. ETHICS The review will not create any ethical or safety concerns. DISSEMINATION At least one peer-reviewed article in a leading journal such as the BMJ is planned. The findings will also be disseminated through a seminar session involving internal audience at Trinity College Dublin and within the Assistive Technologies for people with Intellectual Disability and Autism research programme.

METHODS Radiology residency program directors across the United States were sent a 10-item survey and asked a series of qualitative questions regarding their opinions about HCD and current methods of implementation into their residency curriculum, in addition to demographic information such as program location and setting. RESULTS 73 out of 334 program directors responded. 49.3% were located in the Northeast, 16.4% in the Southeast, 16.4% in the Midwest, 12.3% in the Southwest, and 5.5% in the Pacific. Community programs made up 16.4% of respondents, while academic programs made up 76.7%. 6.8% identified as ""other"". 98.6% agreed with the provided definition of HCD. 83.6% agreed or strongly agreed that HCD present an obstacle to providing imaging care. 74.0% agreed or strongly agreed that HCD education is an essential component of residency training. However, 74.0% agreed or strongly agreed that HCD education is difficult to implement due to competing educational requirements. Only 16.4% agreed or strongly agreed that they had sufficient material on HCD to train residents. CONCLUSION Although many radiology residency programs agree that HCD education is essential in residency training, the majority feel that a curriculum is difficult to implement and that they lack sufficient resources. This study confirms the need to address this gap with a standardized curriculum which has been developed and is discussed.","Song, Alexander; Americo, Lisa; Myers, Hannah; DeBenedectis, Carolynn; Slanetz, Priscilla J; Sarkany, David",Academic radiology,378,5

METHODS RSV-seronegative children ages 6-24 months received one intranasal dose of 105 plaque forming units (PFU) of LID/ΔM2-2/1030s (n=21) or placebo (n=11) (NCT02952339/ NCT02794870). RSV serum antibodies, vaccine shedding, and reactogenicity were assessed. During the following RSV season, medically-attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) and pre- and post-surveillance serum antibody titers were monitored. RESULTS Eighty-five percent of vaccinees shed LID/ΔM2-2/1030s vaccine (median peak nasal wash titers: 3.1 log10 PFU/mL by immuno-plaque assay; 5.1 log10 copies/mL by RT-qPCR) and had ≥4-fold rise in serum neutralizing antibodies. Respiratory symptoms and fever were common (60% vaccinees and 27% placebo recipients). One vaccinee had grade 2 wheezing with rhinovirus but without concurrent LID/ΔM2-2/1030s shedding. Five of 19 vaccinees had >4-fold increases in antibody titers post-surveillance without RSV-MAARI, indicating anamnestic responses without significant illness following infection with community-acquired RSV.

High transpulmonary driving pressure during laparoscopic surgery is associated with increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.Intraoperative positive end-expiratory pressure prevents atelectasis, but may also cause overdistension. WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW This single-center study found that titrating intraoperative positive end-expiratory pressure in relation to observed intraabdominal pressure may counterbalance pneumoperitoneum-related rises in transpulmonary driving pressure during laparoscopic cholecystectomies. BACKGROUND Pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopic surgery is associated with a rise of driving pressure. The authors aimed to assess the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on driving pressure at varying intraabdominal pressure levels. It was hypothesized that PEEP attenuates pneumoperitoneum-related rises in driving pressure. METHODS Open-label, nonrandomized, crossover, clinical trial in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ""Targeted PEEP"" (2 cm H2O above intraabdominal pressure) was compared with ""standard PEEP"" (5 cm H2O), with respect to the transpulmonary and respiratory system driving pressure at three predefined intraabdominal pressure levels, and each patient was ventilated with two levels of PEEP at the three intraabdominal pressure levels in the same sequence. The primary outcome was the difference in transpulmonary driving pressure between targeted PEEP and standard PEEP at the three levels of intraabdominal pressure. RESULTS Thirty patients were included and analyzed. Targeted PEEP was 10, 14, and 17 cm H2O at intraabdominal pressure of 8, 12, and 15 mmHg, respectively. Compared to standard PEEP, targeted PEEP resulted in lower median transpulmonary driving pressure at intraabdominal pressure of 8 mmHg (7 [5 to 8] vs. 9 [7 to 11] cm H2O; P = 0.010; difference 2 [95% CI 0.5 to 4 cm H2O]); 12 mmHg (7 [4 to 9] vs.10 [7 to 12] cm H2O; P = 0.002; difference 3 [1 to 5] cm H2O); and 15 mmHg (7 [6 to 9] vs.12 [8 to 15] cm H2O; P < 0.001; difference 4 [2 to 6] cm H2O). The effects of targeted PEEP compared to standard PEEP on respiratory system driving pressure were comparable to the effects on transpulmonary driving pressure, though respiratory system driving pressure was higher than transpulmonary driving pressure at all intraabdominal pressure levels. CONCLUSIONS Transpulmonary driving pressure rises with an increase in intraabdominal pressure, an effect that can be counterbalanced by targeted PEEP. Future studies have to elucidate which combination of PEEP and intraabdominal pressure is best in term of clinical outcomes.","Mazzinari, Guido; Diaz-Cambronero, Oscar; Alonso-Iñigo, Jose Miguel; Garcia-Gregorio, Nuria; Ayas-Montero, Begoña; Ibañez, Jose Luis; Serpa Neto, Ary; Ball, Lorenzo; Gama de Abreu, Marcelo; Pelosi, Paolo; Maupoey, Javier; Argente Navarro, Maria Pilar; Schultz, Marcus J",Anesthesiology,378,28

Applying pleural manometry, we found small pleural pressure curve oscillations resembling the pulse tracing line. The aim of our study was to characterize the oscillations of pleural pressure curve (termed here as the pleural pressure pulse, PPP) and to establish their origin and potential significance. This was an observational cross-sectional study in adult patients with pleural effusion who underwent thoracentesis with pleural manometry. The pleural pressure curves recorded prior to and during fluid withdrawal were analyzed. The presence of PPP was assessed in relation to the withdrawn pleural fluid volume, lung expandability, vital and echocardiographic parameters, and pulmonary function testing. A dedicated device was developed to compare the PPP to the pulse rate. Fifty-four patients (32 women) median age 66.5 (IQR 58.5-78.7) years were included. Well visible and poorly visible pressure waves were detected in 48% and 35% of the patients, respectively. The frequency of PPP was fully concordant with the pulse rate and the peaks of the oscillations reflected the period of heart diastole. PPP was more visible in patients with a slower respiratory rate (p = 0.008), a larger amount of pleural effusion, and was associated with a better heart systolic function assessed by echocardiography (p < 0.05). This study describes a PPP, a new pleural phenomenon related to the cyclic changes in the heart chambers volume. Although the importance of PPP remains largely unknown, we hypothesize that it could be related to lung atelectasis or lower lung and visceral pleura compliance.","Grabczak, Elzbieta M; Michnikowski, Marcin; Styczynski, Grzegorz; Zielinska-Krawczyk, Monika; Stecka, Anna M; Korczynski, Piotr; Zielinski, Krzysztof; Palko, Krzysztof J; Rahman, Najib M; Golczewski, Tomasz; Krenke, Rafal",Journal of clinical medicine,378,23

Although noninvasive ventilation reduces desaturation during intubation of severely hypoxemic patients, it does not allow for per-procedure oxygenation and has not been evaluated in mild-to-moderate hypoxemic patients for whom high-flow nasal cannula oxygen may be an alternative. We sought to compare pre- and per-procedure oxygenation with either a nonrebreathing bag reservoir facemask or a high-flow nasal cannula oxygen during tracheal intubation of ICU patients. DESIGN Prospective quasi-experimental before-after study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01699880). SETTING University hospital medico-surgical ICU. PATIENTS All adult patients requiring tracheal intubation in the ICU were eligible. INTERVENTIONS In the control (before) period, preoxygenation was performed with a nonrebreathing bag reservoir facemask and in the change of practice (after) period, with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Primary outcome was median lowest SpO2 during intubation, and secondary outcomes were SpO2 after preoxygenation and number of patients with saturation less than 80%. One hundred one patients were included. Median lowest SpO2 during intubation were 94% (83-98.5) with the nonrebreathing bag reservoir facemask versus 100% (95-100) with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (p < 0.0001). SpO2 values at the end of preoxygenation were higher with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen than with nonrebreathing bag reservoir facemask and were correlated with the lowest SpO2 reached during the intubation procedure (r = 0.38, p < 0.0001). Patients in the nonrebreathing bag reservoir facemask group experienced more episodes of severe hypoxemia (2% vs 14%, p = 0.03). In the multivariate analysis, preoxygenation with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen was an independent protective factor of the occurrence of severe hypoxemia (odds ratio, 0.146; 95% CI, 0.01-0.90; p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS High-flow nasal cannula oxygen significantly improved preoxygenation and reduced prevalence of severe hypoxemia compared with nonrebreathing bag reservoir facemask. Its use could improve patient safety during intubation.","Miguel-Montanes, Romain; Hajage, David; Messika, Jonathan; Bertrand, Fabrice; Gaudry, Stéphane; Rafat, Cédric; Labbé, Vincent; Dufour, Nicolas; Jean-Baptiste, Sylvain; Bedet, Alexandre; Dreyfuss, Didier; Ricard, Jean-Damien",Critical care medicine,378,10

Here, four HI patterns after CP resection based on endoscopic observation were introduced. A total of 131 CP cases treated with endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) were reviewed retrospectively and divided into four HI patterns: no-HI, mild-HI, unilateral-HI and bilateral-HI, according to intraoperative findings. The outcomes were evaluated and compared between groups in terms of weight gain, endocrine status, electrolyte disturbance and neuropsychological function before and after surgery. A systematic correlation was found between CP origin and subsequent HI patterns. The majority of intrasellar and suprasellar stalk origins lead to a no-HI pattern, the central-type CP mainly develops a mild or bilateral HI pattern, and the majority of tumors with hypothalamic stalk origins result in unilateral HI and sometimes bilateral HI patterns. The proportion of tumors with a maximum diameter >3 cm in the no-HI group was higher than that in the mild-HI group, BMI and quality of life in the no-HI group showed better results than those in the other groups. The incidence of new-onset diabetes insipidus in the bilateral-HI group was significantly higher than that in the other groups. Memory difficulty was observed mainly in the unilateral-HI and bilateral-HI groups. However, the outcomes of electrolyte disturbance, sleep, and cognitive disorder in the unilateral-HI group were significantly better than those in the bilateral-HI group. This study suggests the possibility of using pre- and intraoperative observation of CP origin to predict four HI patterns and even subsequent outcomes after tumor removal.","Yang, Le; Xie, ShenHao; Tang, Bin; Wu, Xiao; Tong, ZhiGao; Fang, Chao; Ding, Han; Bao, YouYuan; Zheng, SuYue; Hong, Tao",Cancer medicine,378,1

Younger patients may be more sensitive to the effects of alcohol than their adult counterparts, and toxicity has been known to occur at lower doses. Respiratory depression is a serious adverse effect of alcohol intoxication; however, current monitoring practices may not adequately detect respiratory depression. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to determine the frequency of hypoventilation as measured by capnography among adolescents with acute alcohol intoxication. Our secondary objective was to determine if an association exists between alcohol levels and incidence of hypoventilation. METHODS This was a prospective observational pilot study of patients 14-20 years of age with acute alcohol intoxication. Blood or breath alcohol measurements were obtained on arrival. Hourly measurements of vital signs including capnography were recorded. RESULTS Sixty-five subjects were analyzed. Mean alcohol level was 185 mg/dL. Twenty-eight percent of subjects had episodes of hypoventilation. Episodes occurred in similar proportions on arrival and during the first 5 h of measurements. There was no difference in alcohol levels between subjects who did and did not hypoventilate (185 mg/dL vs. 186 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval -29 to 25). Oxygen desaturations occurred in 14 subjects and were associated with hypoventilation (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS Hypoventilation is common among adolescents who are acutely intoxicated with alcohol. It is independent of alcohol level and occurs at a steady rate during the first several hours of intoxication. Capnography should be considered as an additional monitoring device to detect these episodes and enhance patient safety.","Langhan, Melissa L",The Journal of emergency medicine,378,17

In the U.S., the primary fate of processed sewage sludge (class B biosolids) is application to agricultural land as a soil amendment. To characterize and understand infectious risks associated with land application, and to describe the diversity of viruses in human populations, shotgun viral metagenomics was applied to 10 sewage sludge samples from 5 wastewater treatment plants throughout the continental U.S, each serving between 100,000 and 1,000,000 people. Nearly 330 million DNA sequences were produced and assembled, and annotation resulted in identifying 43 (26 DNA, 17 RNA) different types of human viruses in sewage sludge. Novel insights include the high abundance of newly emerging viruses (e.g., Coronavirus HKU1, Klassevirus, and Cosavirus) the strong representation of respiratory viruses, and the relatively minor abundance and occurrence of Enteroviruses. Viral metagenome sequence annotations were reproducible and independent PCR-based identification of selected viruses suggests that viral metagenomes were a conservative estimate of the true viral occurrence and diversity. These results represent the most complete description of human virus diversity in any wastewater sample to date, provide engineers and environmental scientists with critical information on important viral agents and routes of infection from exposure to wastewater and sewage sludge, and represent a significant leap forward in understanding the pathogen content of class B biosolids.","Bibby, Kyle; Peccia, Jordan",Environmental science & technology,378,11

To better understand long-term health outcomes after combat injury, a large, prospective observational cohort collecting both subjective and objective health data is needed. Given that a study of this nature would be costly and face many logistical challenges, we first conducted a pilot to assess the feasibility of a larger, definitive study. MATERIALS AND METHODS We ran a prospective, observational pilot study of 119 combat-injured service members and veterans who completed (1) at least one set of laboratory measurements (blood and urine sample collection and vitals measurements) at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of 1988 compliant laboratory locations and (2) at least one online assessment for the Wounded Warrior Recovery Project (WWRP), a 15-year examination of patient-reported outcomes among service members injured on combat deployment. We recruited the pilot study cohort from WWRP participants who met eligibility criteria and indicated interest in additional research opportunities. We collected laboratory values and patient-reported outcomes at baseline and again 1 year later, and obtained demographic, injury, and military service data from the Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database. The David Grant USAF Medical Center Institution Review Board (IRB) and the Naval Health Research Center IRB reviewed and approved the study protocols. RESULTS During recruitment for the pilot study, 624 study candidates were identified from WWRP. Of the 397 candidates we contacted about the pilot study, 179 (45.1%) enrolled and 119 (66.4%) of those who enrolled completed the first year of participation. The second study year was suspended due to the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic. At the time of suspension, 72 (60.5%) participants completed follow-up laboratory appointments, and 111 (93.3%) completed second-year WWRP assessments. Participants in the pilot study were predominately male (95.0%) and non-Hispanic White (55.5%), with a median (interquartile range) age of 38.3 (34.1-45.4) years.

Specifically, we draw on a representative Australian sample (N = 2575) to examine the interplay between age, education, income, dispositional desire for privacy and political ideology on download behaviour. We examine trust in government as a mediating mechanism between profiles and download behaviour. RESULTS Our analysis produces seven profiles. Trust in government mediates the relationship between most profiles and download behaviour. A combination of wealth and education appear to be key explanatory factors of CTMA download behaviour. Two profiles -- comprising individuals with high income and education -- had the highest rates of download behaviour. Profiles with low download percentages comprised politically left-leaning participants with average to low income and education.

ABCA1 promotes cholesterol efflux, reduces cellular cholesterol accumulation, and regulates anti-inflammatory activities in an apoA-I- or ANXA1-dependent manner. The latter activity occurs by mediating the efflux of ANXA1, which plays a critical role in anti-inflammatory effects, cholesterol transport, exosome and microparticle secretion, and apoptotic cell clearance. ApoA-I increases ANXA1 expression via the ERK, p38MAPK, AKT, and PKC pathways. ApoA-I regulates the signaling pathways by binding to ABCA1, suggesting that apoA-I increases ANXA1 expression by binding to ABCA1. Furthermore, ANXA1 may increase ABCA1 expression. ANXA1 increases PPARγ expression by modulating STAT6 phosphorylation. PPARγ also increases ANXA1 expression by binding to the promoter of ANXA1. Therefore, ABCA1, PPARγ, and ANXA1 may form a feedback loop and regulate each other. Interestingly, the ANXA1 needs to be externalized to the cell membrane or secreted into the extracellular fluids to exert its anti-inflammatory properties. ABCA1 transports ANXA1 from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane by regulating lipidization and serine phosphorylation, thereby mediating ANXA1 efflux, likely by promoting microparticle and exosome release. The direct role of ABCA1 expression and ANXA1 release in atherosclerosis has been unclear. In this review, we focus on the role of ANXA1 in atheroprogression and its novel interaction with ABCA1, which may be useful for providing basic knowledge for the development of novel therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.","Shen, Xin; Zhang, Shun; Guo, Zhu; Xing, Dongming; Chen, Wujun",Molecular medicine,378,17

METHODS We sent questionnaires to health care workers in seven public hospitals. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. We asked about mental health training and exposure to work-related and personal crises. We measured resiliency using a pilot 5-point Likert questionnaire reflecting resistance and resilience constructs. RESULTS We received 496 responses, a response rate of 58%. More than 70% of hospital staff experienced aggression or violence from patients and relatives, and about a third experienced significant personal crises, most commonly interpersonal conflicts. Those with mental health training were twice as likely to be resistant (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7) and resilient (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.7) and also more likely to have experienced sudden/unexpected patient deaths (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.9-4.0) and aggression or violence from patients and relatives (OR = 5.1, 95% CI 3.0-8.7).

For epitope mapping, in this study, a series of 51 partially overlapping fragments covering entire NS1 protein were expressed with a GST-tag and then screened by a monoclonal antibody (mAb). Through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), linear epitope-containing fragment, the overlapping region of NS1-18 and NS1-19 (residues 145-152), was located. Then a set of peptides derived from that overlapping region with deletions were expressed and subjected to ELISA and Western blot for further mapping purpose. Results indicated that the motif of (146)EHARW(150) is the minimal unit of the linear epitope recognized by that monoclonal antibody (mAb). Western blot showed that this epitope could be recognized by JEV-positive serum from pigs. Furthermore, it was found that the epitope is highly conserved among JEV strains through sequence alignments analysis. Notably, none of the homologous regions on NS1 proteins of other flavivirus could react with the mAb when they were tested for cross-reactivity, suggesting the potential clinical application of this epitope in differential diagnosis.","Wang, Bin; Hua, Rong-Hong; Tian, Zhi-Jun; Chen, Na-Sha; Zhao, Fu-Rong; Liu, Tian-Qiang; Wang, Yun-Feng; Tong, Guang-Zhi",Virus research,378,29

As with other weight loss interventions, some patients end up requiring revision to another procedure for insufficient weight loss or weight regain, discomfort, and procedure-related adverse events. OBJECTIVES In this paper, we report our technique and short-term outcomes of revisional sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) after ESG. SETTING Specialized medical center with standardized multidisciplinary protocols for medical, surgical, and endoscopic management of obesity. METHODS A combined laparoscopic-endoscopic technique that identifies plication orientation and the location of anchors and sutures was employed. This prepares the stomach for safe stapling, excluding sutures and anchors from the staple line and the retained sleeve. Hereby, we report this technique with its short-term safety and efficacy outcomes. RESULTS Twenty patients (16 female; mean age 40 ± 6 years) underwent revisional LSG from a total of 1665 (1.2%) who underwent primary ESG. Mean body mass index at the time of primary and revision procedures were 35.0 ± 4.0 and 35.2 ± 3.8 kg/m2, respectively. Nadir % total weight loss (%TWL) after primary ESG was 7.7 ± 3.5%. %TWL at 6 and 12 months after LSG was 21.0 ± 2.7 (n = 11) and 25.6 ± 4.1 (n = 8), respectively. There were no missed follow-up visits. Additionally, there was no mortality, prolonged hospital stay, adverse events, reoperations, or readmissions. CONCLUSIONS Based on this combined laparoscopic-endoscopic technique, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a safe and feasible revision option for patients who fail ESG.","Alqahtani, Aayed R; Elahmedi, Mohamed; Alqahtani, Yara A; Al-Darwish, Abdullah",Obesity surgery,378,1

Patterns of infection are dictated by the cell type infected, but cell type-specific factors and how they impact tropism for specific cell types is poorly understood. Previous studies in primary endothelial cells showed that HCMV infection induces large multivesicular-like bodies (MVBs) that incorporate viral products, including dense bodies (DBs) and virions. Here we define the nature of these large vesicles using a recombinant virus where UL32, encoding the pp150 tegument protein, is fused in frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP, TB40/E-UL32-GFP). In fibroblasts, UL32-GFP-positive vesicles were marked with classical markers of MVBs, including CD63 and lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), both classical MVB markers, as well as the clathrin and LAMP1. Unexpectedly, UL32-GFP-positive vesicles in primary human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) were not labeled by CD63, and LBPA was completely lost from infected cells. We defined these UL32-positive vesicles in endothelial cells using markers for the cis-Golgi (GM130), lysosome (LAMP1), and autophagy (LC3B). These findings suggest that UL32-GFP containing MVBs in fibroblasts are derived from the canonical endocytic pathway and takeover classical exosomal release pathway. However, UL32-GFP containing MVBs in HMVECs are derived from the early biosynthetic pathway and exploit a less characterized early Golgi-LAMP1-associated non- canonical secretory autophagy pathway. These results reveal striking cell-type specific membrane trafficking differences in host pathways that are exploited by HCMV, which may reflect distinct pathways for virus egress.ImportanceHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus that, like all herpesvirus, that establishes a life-long infection. HCMV remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised and HCMV seropositivity is associated with age-related pathology. HCMV infects many cells in the human host and the biology underlying the different patterns of infection in different cell types is poorly understood. Endothelial cells are important target of infection that contribute to hematogenous spread of the virus to tissues. Here we define striking differences in the biogenesis of large vesicles that incorporate virions in fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In fibroblasts, HCMV is incorporated into canonical MVBs derived from an endocytic pathway, whereas HCMV matures through vesicles derived from the biosynthetic pathway in endothelial cells. This work defines basic biological differences between these cell types that may impact how progeny virus is trafficked out of infected cells.","Momtaz, Samina; Molina, Belen; Mlera, Luwanika; Goodrum, Felicia; Wilson, Jean M",Journal of virology,378,28

However, case series on its feasibility and safety in Saudi Arabia are lacking. OBJECTIVE Evaluate the operative results and clinical outcome of single-port laparoscopic procedures in colorectal surgeries. DESIGN Retrospective. SETTING This study was conducted at King Khalid university Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS Demographic and clinical data, including pathology, and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes, were prospectively collected in patients undergoing SILS. This study was conducted during the period from January 2010 and October 2014. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Demographic and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing SILS colectomies. RESULTS Thirty-three (33) patients underwent SILS. The mean (SD) age was 51 years (18.2 years), and the average body mass index was 26.6 (6.9) kg/m2. Patients were primarily diagnosed with cancer (n=20/33, 61%), inflammatory bowel disease (n=12/33, 36%) and diverticulitis (n=1/33, 3%). Procedures included anterior resection (n=9/33, 27%), ileocecal resection (n=8/33 24%), hemicolectomy (n=7/33, 21%), extended right hemicolectomy (n=5/33, 15%) and total colectomy (n=4/33, 12%). The mean SD operative time was 212 minutes (76.4 minutes). The mean SD size of the extraction incision was 4.2 (1.7) cm. Six percent of the cases were converted to open (n=2/33), and 9% required placement of an extra port (n=3/33). Four (12%) patients had intraoperative complications, and 30% experienced postoperative complications. The average length of hospital stay was 6.4 (4.3) days. COCNLUSIONS SILS is technically feasible and safe for patients undergoing colorectal surgery with no unusual complications. However, comparative studies are necessary to validate the potential benefits of SILS over conventional colorectal laparoscopic surgery. LIMITATIONS The study lacked a comparison to conventional open procedures.

Stability of the prodrug and solubility and dissolution characteristics of both abiraterone and abiraterone acetate were monitored in vitro. Moreover, the in vivo intraluminal concentrations of abiraterone and abiraterone acetate upon intake of one tablet of 250 mg abiraterone acetate were assessed in healthy volunteers. The intestinal absorption resulting from the intraluminal behavior of the ester prodrug was determined using the rat in situ intestinal perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling. Simulated and aspirated human intestinal fluids of the fasted state were used as solvent systems. Upon incubation of abiraterone acetate in human intestinal fluids in vitro, rapid hydrolysis of the prodrug was observed, generating abiraterone concentrations largely exceeding the apparent solubility of abiraterone, suggesting the existence of intestinal supersaturation. These findings were confirmed in vivo, by intraluminal sampling of duodenal fluids upon oral intake of an abiraterone acetate tablet by healthy volunteers. Rat in situ intestinal perfusion experiments performed with suspensions of abiraterone and abiraterone acetate in human intestinal fluids of the fasted state revealed significantly higher flux values upon perfusion with the prodrug than with abiraterone. Moreover, rat in situ intestinal perfusion with abiraterone acetate suspensions in simulated fluids of the fasted state in presence or absence of esterases demonstrated that increased hydrolytic activity of the perfusion medium was beneficial to the intestinal absorption of abiraterone. In conclusion, the rapid hydrolysis of abiraterone acetate in the intraluminal environment appears to result in fast and extensive generation of abiraterone supersaturation, creating a strong driving force for abiraterone absorption.","Stappaerts, Jef; Geboers, Sophie; Snoeys, Jan; Brouwers, Joachim; Tack, Jan; Annaert, Pieter; Augustijns, Patrick",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,378,0

(Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a cosmopolitan pest of stored cereal grains and other commodities globally. Infestations caused by S. oryzae makes grains unsuitable for consumption, processing, and export. Deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is widely used in major grain storages in India as a prophylactic treatment to control this pest. However, recurrent use of this insecticide had led to genetic resistance in S. oryzae, questioning its ongoing use at the current recommended concentration. RESULTS Dose response analysis of resistant (Delta-R) and susceptible (Lab-S) strains of S. oryzae collected from grain storages across southern India, revealed that Delta-R was 134-fold more resistant than the Lab-S at LC50 . A concentration of 180 ppm over 48 h effectively discriminated 16 resistant field populations from Lab-S with per cent resistance ranging from 8.72 to 75.86%. Exposing all the resistant populations to 1000 ppm over 48 h identified twelve populations with strongly resistant individuals and confirmed the existence of two distinct resistance phenotypes, 'weak' and 'strong' in S. oryzae. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the vgsc gene in Delta-R identified a single target site mutation, T929I conferring resistance in S. oryzae. CAPS marker analysis of this allele confirmed that frequency of resistance is high (up to 0.96) supporting the results of phenotypic analysis. CONCLUSION Both phenotype and molecular marker analyses clearly demonstrated that deltamethrin at 180 and 1000 ppm can be used to discriminate weakly and strongly resistant populations in S. oryzae, respectively. Resistance diagnostics based on the mutation, T929I, supports our phenotypic data and indicates that resistance to deltamethrin in S. oryzae is prevalent in southern parts of India, stressing the need to identify a synergist or suitable alternatives.

One of the main causes of these clinical syndromes is thrombosis in placental and spinal cord vessels, however the mechanism for thrombus formation is unknown. Platelets form part of the thrombus and amplify and propagate thrombin generation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that EHV-1 activates platelets. We found that two EHV-1 strains, RacL11 and Ab4 at 0.5 or higher plaque forming unit/cell, activate platelets within 10 minutes, causing α-granule secretion (surface P-selectin expression) and platelet microvesiculation (increased small events double positive for CD41 and Annexin V). Microvesiculation was more pronounced with the RacL11 strain. Virus-induced P-selectin expression required plasma and 1.0 mM exogenous calcium. P-selectin expression was abolished and microvesiculation was significantly reduced in factor VII- or X-deficient human plasma. Both P-selectin expression and microvesiculation were re-established in factor VII-deficient human plasma with added purified human factor VIIa (1 nM). A glycoprotein C-deficient mutant of the Ab4 strain activated platelets as effectively as non-mutated Ab4. P-selectin expression was abolished and microvesiculation was significantly reduced by preincubation of virus with a goat polyclonal anti-rabbit tissue factor antibody. Infectious virus could be retrieved from washed EHV-1-exposed platelets, suggesting a direct platelet-virus interaction. Our results indicate that EHV-1 activates equine platelets and that α-granule secretion is a consequence of virus-associated tissue factor triggering factor X activation and thrombin generation. Microvesiculation was only partly tissue factor and thrombin-dependent, suggesting the virus causes microvesiculation through other mechanisms, potentially through direct binding. These findings suggest that EHV-1-induced platelet activation could contribute to the thrombosis that occurs in clinically infected horses and provides a new mechanism by which viruses activate hemostasis.","Stokol, Tracy; Yeo, Wee Ming; Burnett, Deborah; DeAngelis, Nicole; Huang, Teng; Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Catalfamo, James",PloS one,378,1

Mode epoch count proportions were examined using Chi squared and Fisher exact tests as appropriate on an inter-unit basis with outlier detection for two test cases via post hoc pairwise analyses of a binomial regression model. RESULTS Final analysis included 559,734 mode epoch values. Significant heterogeneity was demonstrated between individual units (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). One unit demonstrated heightened utilization of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, and three units demonstrated frequent synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation utilization. Assist control ventilation was the most commonly recorded mode (51%), followed by adaptive support ventilation (23.1%). Volume-controlled modes were about twice as common as pressure-controlled modes (64.4% versus 35.6%).

This has been a crucial opportunity to study the coping strategies that people put in place to adapt their lives and habits to such a unique condition. For this reason, we have investigated both emotion-focused and problem-oriented coping strategies among the Italian population by relating them to other structural factors, such as social, economic and cultural conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS More than 140,000 online interviews were collected in Italy from March 22 to April 2, 2020. This large dataset was used to carry out multivariate statistical data analysis with the aim of creating behavioral profiles, starting from coping parameters and other information. This technique has produced an association, showing a good level of statistical significance, between coping strategies and reactions to social distancing, due to the health emergency, during the data collection phase. RESULTS Two coping indicators - problem-oriented and focused on positive emotions coping strategies - were selected as objective variables in a ""decision tree"" modelling. The results have shown a link between individual factors (i.e., atmosphere at home) and educational and social factors (i.e., compliance with restrictions during the health emergency). CONCLUSIONS The reduction of social interaction had quite a significant impact on people's behavior; furthermore, coping strategies have played a crucial role in facing this stressor. For both the selected coping indicators, the best predictor was the atmosphere perceived at home. Moreover, the respondents' previous experiences have played a relevant role in the acceptance of new rules imposed by the government.

Combining confocal microscopy with biochemical analysis and studies of infection requirements using pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNAs, we show here that engagement of CD81 activates the Rho GTPase family members Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 and that the block of these signaling pathways drastically reduces HCV infectivity. Activation of Rho GTPases mediates actin-dependent relocalization of the HCV E2/CD81 complex to cell-cell contact areas where CD81 comes into contact with the tight-junction proteins occludin, ZO-1, and claudin-1, which was recently described as an HCV coreceptor. Finally, we show that CD81 engagement activates the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade and that this pathway affects postentry events of the virus life cycle. In conclusion, we describe a range of cellular events that are manipulated by HCV to coordinate interactions with its multiple coreceptors and to establish productive infections and find that CD81 is a central regulator of these events.","Brazzoli, Michela; Bianchi, Alessia; Filippini, Sara; Weiner, Amy; Zhu, Qing; Pizza, Mariagrazia; Crotta, Stefania",Journal of virology,378,1

For orthopaedic procedures, where postoperative infections can have significant consequences, the existing evidence for this recommendation is widely debated. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES Is there a difference in postoperative infection risk when utilizing a single dose of preoperative antibiotics compared with multiple doses of perioperative antibiotics for orthopaedic procedures where implants are placed? METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane were systematically reviewed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of a single dose of preoperative antibiotics compared with pre- and postoperative prophylaxis from 1980 to 2017 for all orthopaedic procedures where implants were being placed. Infection (both superficial and deep) as a primary outcome through all available followup was required for inclusion. Fourteen RCTs detailing 9691 orthopaedic procedures were included for analysis, including seven arthroplasty, one spine, and six general orthopaedic trials (two specific to hip fracture fixation). Pooled infection outcomes were analyzed with random-effects modeling in light of study heterogeneity. Bias was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool as well as a funnel plot for publication bias, and quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Bias was largely uncertain; however, a high risk of bias was noted in four studies. No significant overall publication bias was noted. The quality of evidence was determined to be very low based on the GRADE tool, downgraded based on risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Despite the quality of evidence, the data were pooled in light of the current recommendations from the CDC to critically evaluate the recommendation that a single dose of antibiotics be utilized. RESULTS There were no differences in infection risk between single- versus multiple-dose groups (single: 83 of 4263 [2%], multiple: 101 of 5428 [2%]; odds ratio, 0.92 [95% confidence interval, 0.56-1.51]; p = 0.740, I = 36% for statistical heterogeneity). CONCLUSIONS There is no difference in infection risk between a single dose and multiple doses of perioperative antibiotics for orthopaedic procedures where implants are utilized, consistent with recent recommendations. However, the quality of evidence for orthopaedic procedures is low, and a randomized study with a sufficient sample size is needed to examine the issue before universal adoption of a single antibiotic dose.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort. ANIMALS Female cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) (n = 21). METHODS Cheetahs were randomly divided to receive either ovariectomy (n = 11) or salpingectomy (n = 10). The use and complications of a SILS port was evaluated in all of cheetahs. Surgery duration and insufflation volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) were recorded and compared across procedures. RESULTS Laparoscopic ovariectomy and salpingectomy were performed without complications using a SILS port. The poorly-developed mesosalpinx and ovarian bursa facilitated access to the uterine tube for salpingectomy in the cheetah. The median surgery duration for ovariectomy was 24 minutes (interquartile range 3) and for salpingectomy was 19.5 minutes (interquartile range 3) (P = .005). The median volume of CO2 used for ovariectomy was 11.25 L (interquartile range 3.08) and for salpingectomy was 4.90 L (interquartile range 2.52), (P = .001) CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic ovariectomy and salpingectomy can be performed in the cheetah using SILS without perioperative complications. Salpingectomy is faster than ovariectomy and requires less total CO2 for insufflation.","Hartman, Marthinus J; Monnet, Eric; Kirberger, Robert M; Schmidt-Küntzel, Anne; Schulman, Martin L; Stander, Jana A; Stegmann, George F; Schoeman, Johan P",Veterinary surgery : VS,378,8

This has resulted in increased outsourcing of laboratory services which can jeopardize a hospital systems ability to respond to a health care crisis. Objectives: To demonstrate investment in a core laboratory serving an academic medical center equipped a regional health system to respond to the pandemic. Design: COVID-19 diagnostic testing data was analyzed. Volumes were evaluated by result date (3/16/2020 - 5/6/2020) and the average of received to verified turn-around-time (TAT) was calculated and compared for in-house and send-out testing, and different in-house testing methodologies. Results: Daily viral diagnostic testing capacity increased by greater than 3000 % (from 21 tests per day to 658 tests per day). Total viral diagnostic testing resulted by the core lab increased by 128 times over 22 days of test method validation and 826 times over the analysis period while average turn-around-time per day for send-out testing increased from 3.7 days to 21 days. Decreased overall average TAT was observed at the core laboratory (0.45 days) verses send-out testing (7.63 days) (P < .001). Conclusions: Investment in a core laboratory provided the health system with the necessary expertise and resources to mount a robust response to the pandemic. Local access to testing allowed rapid triage of patients and conservation of scarce personal protective equipment. In addition, the core laboratory was able to support regional health departments and several hospitals outside of the system.","Paczos, Tamera A",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,378,19

There is an urgent need for a simple and rapid serological diagnostic assay which can differentiate between antibodies to seasonal and H5N1 strains and that could provide surveillance tools not dependent on virus isolation and nucleic acid technologies. Here we describe the establishment of H5N1 SeroDetect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and rapid test assays based on three peptides in HA2 (488-516), PB1-F2 (2-75), and M2e (2-24) that are highly conserved within H5N1 strains. These peptides were identified by antibody repertoire analyses of H5N1 influenza survivors in Vietnam using whole-genome-fragment phage display libraries (GFPDLs). To date, both platforms have demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and specificity in detecting H5N1 infections (clade 1 and clade 2.3.4) in Vietnamese patients as early as 7 days and up to several years postinfection. H5N1 virus-uninfected individuals in Vietnam and the United States, including subjects vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccines or with confirmed seasonal virus infections, did not react in the H5N1-SeroDetect assays. Moreover, sera from individuals vaccinated with H5N1 subunit vaccine with moderate anti-H5N1 neutralizing antibody titers did not react positively in the H5N1-SeroDetect ELISA or rapid test assays. The simple H5N1-SeroDetect ELISA and rapid tests could provide an important tool for large-scale surveillance for potential exposure to HP H5N1 strains in both humans and birds.","Khurana, Surender; Sasono, Pretty; Fox, Annette; Nguyen, Van Kinh; Le, Quynh Mai; Pham, Quang Thai; Nguyen, Tran Hien; Nguyen, Thanh Liem; Horby, Peter; Golding, Hana",Journal of virology,378,16

Informed patient counseling regarding likely clinical outcomes is therefore important. In this systematic review we aimed to identify all external validations of tools that are used to predict clinical outcomes in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and evaluate which are optimum for clinical implementation. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from 2007 to 2016. Search terms related to the inclusion criteria were: prostate cancer, clinical outcomes, radical prostatectomy, and prognosis. Titles and abstracts were screened and relevant studies were advanced to full-text review. Reference lists were reviewed for further studies. The Centre for Evidence Based Medicine prognostic tool was used for critical appraisal. Seventy-three studies externally validated 13 pre- and 41 postoperative tools for the prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR), aggressive BCR, metastasis, and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Recommendations for clinical implementation were made on the basis of accuracy, cohort sizes, and consistency. The accuracy of recommended tools ranged from 68% to 79% and 72% to 92% among the largest validation cohorts for pre- and postoperative tools. For preoperative prognosis we recommended the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) and Stephenson nomograms for BCR, the CAPRA nomogram for aggressive BCR as well as metastasis, and the D'Amico criteria for PCSM. For postoperative prognosis we recommended the CAPRA-Surgery (CAPRA-S), Stephenson, Kattan, Duke prostate cancer (DPC), and the Suardi nomograms for the prediction of BCR, the DPC nomogram for aggressive BCR, the CAPRA-S and Eggener nomograms for metastasis, and the Eggener nomogram for PCSM.

Social distancing rules and the fear of infection have greatly reduced face-to-face interactions, increased loneliness, reduced ties to helping institutions, and may also have disrupted the opioid use behaviors of people who use drugs. This research used Reddit to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the social networks and social processes of people who use opioids. METHODS Data were collected from the social media forum, Reddit.com. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. (March 5, 2020, to May 13, 2020), 2,000 Reddit posts were collected from the two most popular opioid subreddits (r/OpiatesRecovery, r/Opiates). Posts were reviewed for relevance to COVID-19 and opioid use resulting in a final sample of 300. Thematic analysis was guided by the Big Events framework. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic was found to create changes in the social networks and daily lives among persons who use opioids. Adaptions to these changes shifted social networks leading to robust social support and mutual aid on Reddit, including sharing and seeking advice on facing withdrawal, dealing with isolation, managing cravings, and accessing recovery resources. CONCLUSIONS Reddit provided an important source of social support and mutual aid for persons who use opioids. Findings indicate online social support networks are beneficial to persons who use opioids, particularly during big events where isolation from other social support resources may occur.","Bunting, Amanda M; Frank, David; Arshonsky, Joshua; Bragg, Marie A; Friedman, Samuel R; Krawczyk, Noa",Drug and alcohol dependence,378,1

METHODS Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of PDM patients. Includes patients fulfilling the strict histologic criteria for PDM (N = 9) and patients who did not, but clinically, unequivocally had an intradermal melanoma-clinical PDM (cPDM; N = 17).Histopathology slides were re-examined. Prognosticators and outcome measures were compared between groups. Sentinel nodes' retrieval and wide local excision (WLE) were offered to all patients as primary treatment. RESULTS 26 patients identified, 15 females with a median age of 69 years (range 3.5-85). Mean Breslow was 7.9 ± 5.7 mm (median 5.8, range 1.8-25.0), and the mean mitotic rate was 4.9 ± 3.8/mm2 (median 4.0, range 0-17). Initial treatment and follow-up were as for cutaneous melanoma. One patient in each group with a palpable stage III underwent primary radical dissection. Sentinel nodes were retrieved in all 20 lymphatic mappings performed and found to be metastatic in 5 (25%) patients. Treatment consisted of completion lymph-node dissection. At a median postoperative follow-up of 62 months (range 8-132), 20 patients were disease-free, including 6 of 7 patients with stage III disease at presentation. Six patients died all of cPDM; 5 of 6 patients had primary ulcerated or epidermal-abutting melanomas. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to highlight cPDM. Diagnosis requires expert pathology review and a tight correlation to the clinical parameters. Patients seem to benefit from WLE with sentinel node retrieval and complete dissection when appropriate. However, clinical guidelines for dissection have changed since the time period of this retrospective review. Based on this series, complete nodal dissection in these melanomas is associated with better than expected outcome, for stage III disease.","Zamir, Hadas; Feinmesser, Meora; Gutman, Haim",Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery,378,1

Their added protection through herd effects is a key part in the considerations on optimal pneumococcal vaccination strategies. Yet, little is currently known about the main transmission pathways to this vulnerable age group. Methods and findings: We conducted a nested cross-sectional contact and nasopharyngeal swabbing survey in randomly selected infants across all 27 communes of Nha Trang, Vietnam. Bayesian logistic regression models were used to estimate age specific carriage prevalence in the population, a proxy for the probability that a contact of a given age could lead to pneumococcal exposure for the infant. We used another Bayesian logistic regression model to estimate the correlation between infant carriage and the probability that at least one of their reported contacts carried pneumococci, controlling for age and locality. In total 1583 infants between 4 and 13 months old participated, with 7428 contacts reported. Few infants (5%) attended day care and carriage prevalence was 22%. Most infants (61%) had less than a 25% probability to have had close contact with a pneumococcal carrier on the surveyed day. Pneumococcal infection risk and contact behaviour were highly correlated: if adjusted for age and locality the odds of an infant's carriage increased by 22% (95%CI:15-29) per 10 percentage points increase in the probability to have had close contact with at least one pneumococcal carrier. Two to six year old children contributed 51% (95%CI: 39-63) to the total pneumococcal exposure risks to infants in this setting. Conclusions: Cross-sectional contact and infection studies can help identify pneumococcal transmission routes. In Nha Trang, preschool age children are the largest reservoir for pneumococcal transmission to infants.","Qian, G.; Toizumi, M.; Clifford, S.; Le, L. T.; Papastylianou, T.; Quilty, B.

The conflict in Yemen deteriorated the already fragile health system and lead to the collapse of more than half of the health facilities. Health system fragmentation is also a problem in Yemen, which is complicated by the existence of two health ministries with different strategies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of health system fragmentation on the implementation of health policies in Yemen across the global agendas of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), Health Security (GHS) and Health Promotion (HP) in the context of WHO priorities achieving universal health coverage, addressing health emergencies and promoting healthier populations. Methods The study is qualitative research using key informant in-depth interviews and documents analysis. Results There are many health stakeholders in Yemen, including the public, private, and NGO sectors - each with different priorities and interests, which did not always align with national policies and strategies. The WHO and Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP) are the main supporters to implement all policies related to the UHC, GHS and HP agendas. Interestingly, initiatives initially pursuing a health security approach to control the cholera epidemic realigned with the UHC concept and moved from an initial focus on health security, to propose a minimum health service package, a classical UHC intervention. Overall, Universal Health Coverage is the most adapted agenda, health security agendas were highly disrupted due to conflicts and health staffs were caught unprepared for emerging outbreaks. The health promotion agenda was largely ignored. Conclusion Restoring peace, building on synergies between the three health agendas through joint planning between the MoPHP and other health actors are highly recommended.","Hussein, T.; Dureab, F.; Al-Waziza, R.; Noman, H.; Hennig, L.; Jahn, A.",,378,17

Here, the vaccinia virus-based, replication-defective Sementis Copenhagen Vector (SCV) was used to develop a first-generation COVID-19 vaccine encoding the spike glycoprotein (SCV-S). Vaccination of mice rapidly induced polyfunctional CD8 T cells with cytotoxic activity and robust Th1-biased, spike-specific neutralizing antibodies, which are significantly increased following a second vaccination, and contained neutralizing activity against the alpha and beta variants of concern. Longitudinal studies indicated neutralizing antibody activity was maintained up to 9 months post-vaccination in both young and aging mice, with durable immune memory evident even in the presence of pre-existing vector immunity. This immunogenicity profile suggests a potential to expand protection generated by current vaccines in a heterologous boost format, and presents a solid basis for second-generation SCV-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates incorporating additional SARS-CoV-2 immunogens.","Eldi, Preethi; Cooper, Tamara H.; Prow, Natalie A.; Liu, Liang; Heinemann, Gary K.; Zhang, Voueleng J.; Trinidad, Abigail D.; Guzman-Genuino, Ruth Marian; Wulff, Peter; Hobbs, Leanne M.; Diener, Kerrilyn R.; Hayball, John D.",bioRxiv,378,10

Pulmonary fibrosis destroys the patient's lungs, preventing oxygenation of the blood. Modern methods of treatment are not highly effective even with access to a patient's CT scan. The problem of predicting the prognosis of pulmonary fibrosis is extremely important, since its solution will make it possible to organize clinical trials to study methods of treating patients with fibrosis more effectively. This article proposes a method for predicting the prognosis of pulmonary fibrosis progression as the volume of inhaled and exhaled air to the individual patient based on tabular patient data using an ensemble of four machine learning algorithms. This solution also provides a forecast accuracy because it is useful in medical applications to assess the 'confidence' of the model in its predictions.

This study uses Respondent-Driven Sampling and Snowball Sampling to collect 432 respondents via social media and the internet. This study used a structural equation model (SEM) to examine risk perceptions of risk-averse attitudes by mediating knowledge of pandemic risk, tourism travel, and travel intentions. The results showed that most of the prospective tourists showed a preference for tourism. Tourists pay attention to the dangers of performance, costs, time, tourism destinati ons, while the social-psychological risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic have a low impact. The nature and behaviour of tourists to avoid pandemic risk cause pandemic risk to be less effective in reducing tourists' intention to travel. Understanding pandemic risk effectively reduces risk perceptions that potential tourists have on tourism travel.

However there has been little focus on sub-Saharan Africa, as few African cities have air quality monitors and if they do, these data are often not publicly available. Spatial differentials of changes in PM2.5 concentrations as a result of COVID also remain largely unstudied. To address this gap, we use a serendipitous mobile air quality monitoring deployment of eight Sensirion SPS 30 sensors on motorbikes in the city of Nairobi starting on 16 March 2020, before a COVID-19 curfew was imposed on 25 March and continuing until 5 May 2020. We developed a random-forest model to estimate PM2.5 surfaces for the entire city of Nairobi before and during the COVID-19 curfew. The highest PM2.5 concentrations during both periods were observed in the poor neighborhoods of Kariobangi, Mathare, Umoja, and Dandora, located to the east of the city center. Changes in PM2.5 were heterogeneous over space. PM2.5 concentrations increased during the curfew in rapidly urbanizing, the lower-middle-class neighborhoods of Kahawa, Kasarani, and Ruaraka, likely because residents switched from LPG to biomass fuels due to loss of income. Our results indicate that COVID-19 and policies to address it may have exacerbated existing air pollution inequalities in the city of Nairobi. The quantitative results are preliminary, due to sampling limitations and measurement uncertainties, as the available data came exclusively from low-cost sensors. This research serves to highlight that spatial data that is essential for understanding structural inequalities reflected in uneven air pollution burdens and differential impacts of events like the COVID pandemic. With the help of carefully deployed low-cost sensors with improved spatial sampling and at least one reference-quality monitor for calibration, we can collect data that is critical for developing targeted interventions that address environmental injustice in the African context.","deSouza, P.

For some viruses, the genome is the only viral mRNA and expression is regulated primarily at the translational level and by limited proteolysis of polyproteins. Other virus groups also generate subgenomic mRNAs later in the reproductive cycle. For nidoviruses, subgenomic mRNA synthesis (transcription) is discontinuous and yields a 5' and 3' coterminal nested set of mRNAs. Nidovirus transcription is not essential for genome replication, which relies on the autoprocessing products of two replicase polyproteins that are translated from the genome. We now show that the N-terminal replicase subunit, nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), of the nidovirus equine arteritis virus is in fact dispensable for replication but crucial for transcription, thereby coupling replicase expression and subgenomic mRNA synthesis in an unprecedented manner. Nsp1 is composed of two papain-like protease domains and a predicted N-terminal zinc finger, which was implicated in transcription by site-directed mutagenesis. The structural integrity of nsp1 is essential, suggesting that the protease domains form a platform for the zinc finger to operate in transcription.","Tijms, M A; van Dinten, L C; Gorbalenya, A E; Snijder, E J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,378,16

These measures had a profound impact on the healthcare system and community, and were associated with significant disruptions to normal life, business and social intercourse. An assessment of the relative effectiveness of the various control measures is critical in preparing for future outbreaks of a similar nature. The very ""wide-net"" surveillance, isolation and quarantine policy adopted was effective in ensuring progressively earlier isolation of probable SARS cases. However, it resulted in nearly 8000 contacts being put on home quarantine and 4300 on telephone surveillance, with 58 individuals eventually being diagnosed with probable SARS. A key challenge is to develop very rapid and highly sensitive tests for SARS infection, which would substantially reduce the numbers of individuals that need to be quarantined without decreasing the effectiveness of the measure. Daily temperature monitoring of all healthcare workers (HCWs) in hospitals was useful for early identification of HCWs with SARS. However, daily temperature screening of children in schools failed to pick up any SARS cases. Similarly, temperature screening at the airport and other points of entry did not yield any SARS cases.

To date, there is no published literature on the accuracy of the database for neurosurgeons or any physician specialty. OBJECTIVE To study the accuracy of published records and scope of industry-neurosurgeon relationships between neurosurgeons and industry within the OPD. METHODS We searched 4.3 million records in 2013 and 11.41 million records in 2014 in the OPD for board-certified neurosurgeons verified by the American Board of Neurological Surgery. Delimit software was used to condense these data, Microsoft Access for database queries, and STATA to perform descriptive analyses. RESULTS Of the 3240 neurosurgeons in the OPD in 2013, 2020 were identified correctly as neurosurgeons within the database (62%). Of the 3593 neurosurgeons in the OPD in 2014, 2433 were identified correctly as neurosurgeons (68%). Within the OPD in 2013, there were 72 066 attributed records for neurosurgeons; within the 2014 OPD, there were 160 563 attributed records for neurosurgeons.

Hence, randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials on the treatment of SARS were not possible. Our understanding was obtained from observational, cohort studies, case series and reports. Nevertheless, such information is useful in providing clinical management guidelines and directing future research in case SARS recurs. Early in the pandemic, a combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids was adopted as the standard treatment in Hong Kong, Canada and elsewhere because of the apparent good results of the first few patients. Subsequent reports showed that ribavirin was associated with a high rate of toxicity and lacked in vitro antiviral effect on SARS-coronavirus (SAR-CoV). The timing and dosage regimens of steroid in the treatment of SARS are controversial. Pulse methylprednisolone 250 to 500 mg/day for 3 to 6 days has been reported to have some efficacy in a subset of patients with ""critical SARS"", i.e., critically ill SARS patients with deteriorating radiographic consolidation, increasing oxygen requirement with PaO2 <10 kPa or SpO2 <90% on air, and respiratory distress (rate of 30/min). Prolonged therapy with high-dose steroids, in the absence of an effective antimicrobial agent, could predispose patients to complications such as disseminated fungal infection, and avascular necrosis. Kaletra (400 mg ritonavir and 100 mg lopinavir), a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection, may be considered for early treatment of SARS patients, preferably in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial setting. Interferon (IFN) is not recommended as standard therapy in SARS. However, there are enough data on in vitro activity of IFN preparations and a few clinical studies for these products to support a controlled trial if SARS recurs. Many other experimental treatments have been tried in an uncontrolled manner, and they should not be recommended as standard therapy.","Tai, Dessmon Y H","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",378,20

There is a need to broaden the focus on living well with kidney disease and re-engagement in life, including emphasis on patients being in control. The World Kidney Day (WKD) Joint Steering Committee has declared 2021 the year of ""Living Well with Kidney Disease"" in an effort to increase education and awareness on the important goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This calls for the development and implementation of validated patient-reported outcome measures to assess and address areas of life participation in routine care. It could be supported by regulatory agencies as a metric for quality care or to support labelling claims for medicines and devices. Funding agencies could establish targeted calls for research that address the priorities of patients. Patients with kidney disease and their care-partners should feel supported to live well through concerted efforts by kidney care communities including during pandemics. In the overall wellness program for kidney disease patients, the need for prevention should be reiterated. Early detection with prolonged course of wellness despite kidney disease, after effective secondary and tertiary prevention programs, should be promoted. WKD 2021 continues to call for increased awareness of the importance of preventive measures throughout populations, professionals and policy makers, applicable to both developed and developing countries.","Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar; Li, Philip Kam-Tao; Tantisattamo, Ekamol; Kumaraswami, Latha; Liakopoulos, Vassilios; Lui, Siu-Fai; Ulasi, Ifeoma; Andreoli, Sharon; Balducci, Alessandro; Dupuis, Sophie; Harris, Tess; Hradsky, Anne; Knight, Richard; Kumar, Sajay; Ng, Maggie; Poidevin, Alice; Saadi, Gamal; Tong, Allison",Iranian journal of kidney diseases,378,1

Here, we report a previously unknown reovirus (named ""Melaka virus"") isolated from a 39-year-old male patient in Melaka, Malaysia, who was suffering from high fever and acute respiratory disease at the time of virus isolation. Two of his family members developed similar symptoms approximately 1 week later and had serological evidence of infection with the same virus. Epidemiological tracing revealed that the family was exposed to a bat in the house approximately 1 week before the onset of the father's clinical symptoms. Genome sequence analysis indicated a close genetic relationship between Melaka virus and Pulau virus, a reovirus isolated in 1999 from fruit bats in Tioman Island, Malaysia. Screening of sera collected from human volunteers on the island revealed that 14 of 109 (13%) were positive for both Pulau and Melaka viruses. This is the first report of an orthoreovirus in association with acute human respiratory diseases. Melaka virus is serologically not related to the different types of mammalian reoviruses that were known to infect humans asymptomatically.

A previous genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model host, identified five host genes, including XRN1, encoding a 5'-3' exoribonuclease, whose absence led to an approximately 10- to 50-fold enhancement of RNA recombination in Tomato bushy stunt virus (E. Serviene, N. Shapka, C. P. Cheng, T. Panavas, B. Phuangrat, J. Baker, and P. D. Nagy, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102:10545-10550, 2005). In this study, we found abundant 5'-truncated viral RNAs in xrn1delta mutant strains but not in the parental yeast strains, suggesting that these RNAs might serve as recombination substrates promoting RNA recombination in xrn1delta mutant yeast. This model is supported by data showing that an enhanced level of viral recombinant accumulation occurred when two different 5'-truncated viral RNAs were expressed in the parental and xrn1delta mutant yeast strains or electroporated into plant protoplasts. Moreover, we demonstrate that purified Xrn1p can degrade the 5'-truncated viral RNAs in vitro. Based on these findings, we propose that Xrn1p can suppress viral RNA recombination by rapidly removing the 5'-truncated RNAs, the substrates of recombination, and thus reducing the chance for recombination to occur in the parental yeast strain. In addition, we show that the 5'-truncated viral RNAs are generated by host endoribonucleases. Accordingly, overexpression of the Ngl2p endoribonuclease led to an increased accumulation of cleaved viral RNAs in vivo and in vitro. Altogether, this paper establishes that host ribonucleases and host-mediated viral RNA turnover play major roles in RNA virus recombination and evolution.","Cheng, Chi-Ping; Serviene, Elena; Nagy, Peter D",Journal of virology,378,1

While HE may provide a strong selective advantage during natural infection, many laboratory strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) fail to produce the protein. Apparently, their HE genes were inactivated during cell culture adaptation. For this report, we have studied the molecular basis of this phenomenon. By using targeted RNA recombination, we generated isogenic recombinant MHVs which differ exclusively in their expression of HE and produce either the wild-type protein (HE+), an enzymatically inactive HE protein (HE0), or no HE at all. HE expression or the lack thereof did not lead to gross differences in in vitro growth properties. Yet the expression of HE was rapidly lost during serial cell culture passaging. Competition experiments with mixed infections revealed that this was not due to the enzymatic activity: MHVs expressing HE+ or HE0 propagated with equal efficiencies. During the propagation of recombinant MHV-HE+, two types of spontaneous mutants accumulated. One produced an anchorless HE, while the other had a Gly-to-Trp substitution at the predicted C-terminal residue of the HE signal peptide. Neither mutant incorporated HE into virion particles, suggesting that wild-type HE reduces the in vitro propagation efficiency, either at the assembly stage or at a postassembly level. Our findings demonstrate that the expression of ""luxury"" proteins may come at a fitness penalty. Apparently, under natural conditions the costs of maintaining HE are outweighed by the benefits.","Lissenberg, A; Vrolijk, M M; van Vliet, A L W; Langereis, M A; de Groot-Mijnes, J D F; Rottier, P J M; de Groot, R J",Journal of virology,378,30

Thus, distance-based learning platforms such as online lectures and case-based teaching were increasingly adopted in place of bedside and face-to-face tutorials. While interactive virtual case-based discussions are generally useful in imparting clinical reasoning skills to medical students, they are unfortunately not able to fully replicate the experience of clerking, examining and managing real patients in the wards, which is a quintessential process towards building clinical acumen and attaining core clinical competencies.

The degree of protection correlated well with the levels of pre-challenge VNAb and, in particular, with levels of virus excretion.

The unique short gene product US2 is a 199-amino acid type I endoplasmic reticulum glycoprotein that modulates surface expression of class I MHC products by targeting class I heavy chains for dislocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol, where they undergo proteasomal degradation. Although the mechanism by which this viral protein targets class I heavy chains for destruction remains unclear, the putative US2 cytoplasmic tail comprised of only 14 residues is known to play a functional role. To determine the specific residues critical for mediating class I degradation, a mutagenesis analysis of the cytoplasmic tail of US2 was performed. Using truncation mutants, the removal of only 4 residues (mutant US2(195)) from the US2 carboxyl terminus completely abolishes class I destruction. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of the US2 cytoplasmic tail revealed that the most critical residues for class I-induced destruction, cysteine 187, serine 190, tryptophan 193, and phenylalanine 196, occurs every third residue. This experimental data supports a model that the US2 cytoplasmic tail is in a 3(10) helical configuration. Such a secondary structure would predict that one side of the 3(10) helical cytoplasmic tail would interact with the extraction apparatus to facilitate the dislocation and subsequent destruction of class I heavy chains.","Oresic, Kristina; Noriega, Vanessa; Andrews, Laura; Tortorella, Domenico",The Journal of biological chemistry,378,1

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 is a recently identified protein that is highly expressed in the kidney and results in formation of angiotensin-(1-7). This manuscript highlights current information on the localization and function of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 in the kidney, along with recent studies on the role of the enzyme in hypertension, glomerulosclerosis, and diabetic nephropathy. RECENT FINDINGS Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 is expressed in relative abundance in the proximal tubule and metabolizes angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7). Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 also catalyzes conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin-(1-9), which is cleaved to angiotensin-(1-7) by angiotensin-converting enzyme. In mice, gene deletion of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 elevates blood pressure responses to angiotensin II, and increases renal angiotensin II levels. Male angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-deficient mice exhibit accelerated glomerulosclerosis. In early diabetic nephropathy, proximal tubular angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 expression and activity are increased, suggesting that the enzyme may counterregulate the effects of local angiotensin II. SUMMARY Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 appears to be critical in determining the balance between the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7). Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 could thereby represent a target for novel therapeutic approaches in a variety of kidney disorders.","Burns, Kevin D",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,378,5

METHODS 101 SARS-CoV 5'UTR were aligned. One typical sequence containing full 264 nt was then subjected to be predicted its secondary structure. The pGL3-5'UTR and pGL3-a-5'UTR were constructed by substitution of SV40 promoter with SARS-CoV 5'UTR cDNA or its antisense sequence. Then the recombinant plasmids were transfected into HepG2 cells and the luciferase activities were detected. A set of deletion mutant plasmids, of which pGL3-5' UTR-1, pGL3-5' UTR-2, pGL3-5'UTR-3 and pGL3-5'UTR-4 are with 3, 2, 1, and 0 residual stem-loops of 3' termini respectively,were constructed from pGL3-5'UTR and were transfected into HepG2 cells to express reporter gene luc+, with pGL3-5'UTR containing full sequence as control. The luciferase activities expressed by the plasmids were measured. And then the total RNA of the transfected cells was extracted. Subsequently, by 5' Rapid Amplication of cDNA Ends (5'RACE), the PCR product was sequenced. The luciferase expressed by pGL3-5'UTR in various cells, the lung carcinoma cell line A549, hepatoma cell line HepG2, kidney cell Vero E6, cervical cancer cell line HeLa and human umbilical vein endothelial cell line ECV304 were measured and compared with each other. RESULTS The full sequence of the SARS-CoV 5' UTR is a 264nt, and 18 deletion mutants were found. Totally, 5 site substitutions were found in 101 5'UTR sequences. The SARS-CoV 5'UTR RNA folded to form a stable secondary structure containing four stem-loop domains. The biggest and most complex one is the stem-loop II appearing a pseudoknot. Comparing with pGL3-a-5'UTR, pGL3-5'UTR expressed luciferase obviously. Both pGL3-5'UTR containing full sequence and pGL3-5'UTR-1 containing three stem-loops of 3' termini expressed the luciferase well. However, when lost stem-loop I and II , the pGL3-5'UTR-2, pGL3-5'UTR-3 and pGL3-5'UTR-4 almost didn't express luciferase. The 56th nucleotide of SARS-CoV 5'UTR was found to be the initiation site for transcription. Transfected with expression luciferase plasmid pGL3-5' UTR in which SARS-CoV 5' UTR acts as the promoter, the luciferase could express in five cell lines in different degrees. Ranked by the luciferase activity from the highest to the lowest, the order is A549, HepG2, ECV304, HeLa and Vero E6. CONCLUSIONS A: The 5'UTR sequences of different SARS-CoV isolates are relatively conserved, and a full sequence would form a secondary structure containing four stem-loop domains. B: The cDNA sequence corresponding to SARS-CoV 5'UTR possessed a promoter activity in eukaryotic cells. C: The promoter domain of the SARS-CoV 5'UTR contains both stem-loop I and II. D: The 56th nucleotide and its down stream TRS of SARS-CoV 5'UTR plays a key role in regulating transcription. E: Cells sourced from various tissues can provide efficient accessory factors for SARS-CoV 5'UTR sequence that acts as a promoter, and the lung-sourced cells may be the most suitable.","Zhang, Jian-jun; Huang, Ai-long; Shi, Xiao-ling; Zhang, Xiao-feng",Sichuan da xue xue bao.

However, the majority of studies were conducted at large scales (e.g., across farms), while few studies examined drivers of L. monocytogenes prevalence at smaller scales (e.g., within a single field). This study was performed to address this knowledge gap by (i) tracking L. monocytogenes distribution in two fields on one farm over a growing season, and (ii) identifying factors associated with L. monocytogenes isolation from drag swab, soil, and agricultural water samples. Overall, L. monocytogenes was detected in 78% (21/27), 19% (7/36), and 8% (37/486) of water, drag swab, and soil samples, respectively. All isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Of the 43 PFGE types identified, 14 were isolated on multiple sampling visits and/or from multiple sample types, indicating persistence in or repeated introduction into the farm environment during the study. Our findings also suggest that L. monocytogenes prevalence, even at the small spatial scale studied here, (i) was not uniform, and (ii) varied more within fields than between fields or over time. This is illustrated by the fact that plot (in-field variation), field (between field variation), and sampling visit (time) accounted for 18%, 2% and 3% of variance in odds of isolating L. monocytogenes, respectively. Moreover, according to random forest analysis, water-related factors were among the top-ranked factors associated with L. monocytogenes isolation from all sample types. For example, the likelihood of isolating L. monocytogenes from drag and soil samples increased monotonically as rainfall increased. Overall, findings from this single-farm study suggests that mitigation strategies for L. monocytogenes in produce fields should focus on water-associated risk factors (e.g., rain, distance to water), and be tailored to specific high-risk in-field areas.","Harrand, A Sophia; Strawn, Laura; Illas-Ortiz, Paloa Mercedes; Wiedmann, Martin; Weller, Daniel",J. foof prot,378,10

IgG titers peaked around day 60, and then began gradually to drop, decreasing by approximately 50% on the 180th day, while the IgM titers progressively decreased as early as the tenth day, but they could be detected even at later time points. Despite the small number of individuals, some peculiar characteristics of the humoral response in COVID-19 emerged. We observed a high inter-individual variability, an ephemeral IgG half-life in several patients, and a persistence of IgM in others.","De Donno, Antonella; Lobreglio, Giambattista; Panico, Alessandra; Grassi, Tiziana; Bagordo, Francesco; Bozzetti, Maria Pia; Massari, Serafina; Siculella, Luisa; Damiano, Fabrizio; Guerra, Francesco; Greco, Marilena; Chicone, Michele; Lazzari, Roberta; Alifano, Pietro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),378,24

Methods: An interdisciplinary Task Force was constructed to develop innovative strategies for management of a novel disease. A single-institution prospective non-randomized cohort study was then conducted on patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure who underwent tracheostomy using an induced bedside apneic technique at a tertiary care academic institution between April 27th, 2020, and June 30th, 2020. Results: 28 patients underwent tracheostomy with induced apnea. The median lowest procedural oxygen saturation was 95%. The median number of ventilated days following tracheostomy was 11. There were 3 mortalities (11%) due to sepsis and multiorgan failure; of 25 surviving patients, 100% were successfully discharged from the hospital and 76% are decannulated, with a median time of 26 days from tracheostomy to decannulation (range 12 - 57). There was no symptomatic disease transmission to healthcare personnel on the COVID-19 Tracheostomy Team. Conclusions: Patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 disease may benefit from tracheostomy. This can be completed effectively and safely, without viral transmission to healthcare personnel. Performing tracheostomies earlier in the course of disease may expedite patient recovery and improve ICU resource utilization. Creation of a collaborative Task Force is an effective strategic approach for management of novel disease.","Weiss, Kathleen D; Coppolino, Antonio; Wiener, Daniel C; McNamee, Ciaran; Riviello, Robert; Ng, Ju-Mei; Jaklitsch, Michael T; Marshall, Margaret B; Rochefort, Matthew M",,378,24

OBJECTIVE: To develop a clinical instrument for evaluating symptoms of COVID-19 mild-to-moderate forms. METHODS: COVID-19 patients were recruited from EpiCURA Hospital (Belgium). They completed the COVID-19 Symptom Index (CSI) twice to assess the test-retest reliability. The internal consistency was evaluated with Cronbach's alpha. CSI was completed by healthy subjects to assess the internal validity. Patients completed CSI 6 weeks after the COVID-19 resolution to evaluate the responsiveness to change. RESULTS: Ninety-four COVID-19 patients and 55 healthy individuals completed the evaluations. Symptoms associated with the higher severity score were fatigue, headache and myalgia. The Cronbach's alpha value was 0.801, indicating high internal consistency. The test-retest reliability was adequate (rs = 0.535, p = .001). The correlation between CSI total score and SNOT-22 was high (rs = 0.782; p < .001), supporting a high external validity. COVID-19 patients reported significant higher CSI score than healthy individuals, suggesting an adequate internal validity.

Of the included trainees, 48% were doctoral students, 17% were interns, and 35% were postdoctoral residents (50% of resident respondents were in their first year).Results: The majority of neuropsychology trainees reported some impact of the pandemic on their professional and/or personal life. Overall, the impact did not differ by training level, geographic location, or demographic factors. Trainees' primary professional concerns included uncertainty about the impact of the pandemic on their professional future, loss of clinical hours, and desire for increased and ongoing communication from their leadership. A notable percentage of trainees reported increased personal mental health symptoms (i.e. anxiety/depression; 74%/54%), as well as a number of other personal stressors. Despite the transition to telehealth (mostly interviews/feedback sessions), few trainees have prior training or experience in providing neuropsychological services via phone or video platform. A limited proportion of trainees (approximately 10%) were still seeing patients face-to-face for neuropsychological evaluations during the COVID-19 pandemic as of 14 April 2020.Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting neuropsychological training and the well-being of trainees. This survey highlights the importance of communication with trainees during uncertain times.

Models in published literature have suggested that digital rather than manual contact tracing might be more effective in containing the pandemic. This article seeks to examine the forms of contact tracing that Singapore, a highly dense city-state, adopts with a focus on new innovations including the use of digital technology. METHODS: An exploratory literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies reviewing technological approaches and responses to COVID-19 was performed. Information published by national agencies was also analysed to ascertain how technology was utilised in contact tracing. RESULTS: Contact tracing in Singapore is overseen by the Ministry of Health (MOH). COVID-19 cases are interviewed on their whereabouts during a backward and forward activity mapping process to identify close contacts. Extensive contact tracing even involving the police and serological tools have helped to establish links between cases and closed several local clusters. Examination of patient's digital footprint has helped in contact tracing. Other digital technology introduced includes SafeEntry and TraceTogether. SafeEntry is a cloud-based visitor registration system while TraceTogether is a mobile phone application which operates by exchanging anonymised identifiers between nearby phones via Bluetooth connection. CONCLUSION: Digital contact tracing is likely to expand and continue to complement human-based contact tracing for the current and future pandemics. However, at this juncture, it is not ready to replace the manual and meticulous work that only Singapore contact tracers can achieve.","Lai, Sean Han Sheng; Tang, Camelia Qian Ying; Kurup, Asok; Thevendran, Gowreeson",Int. orthop,378,24

The first outbreak of infection (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV virus occurred in the fall of 2002 in China (Guangdong Province). A second outbreak (MERS) associated with the new MERS-CoV virus appeared in Saudi Arabia in autumn 2012. The third epidemic, which turned into a COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged in China (Hubei Province) in the autumn 2019. This review focuses on ecological and genetic aspects that lead to the emergence of new human zoanthroponous coronaviruses. The main mechanism of adaptation of zoonotic betacoronaviruses to humans is to changes in the receptor-binding domain of surface protein (S), as a result of which it gains the ability to bind human cellular receptors of epithelial cells in respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. This process is caused by the high genetic diversity and variability combined with frequent recombination, during virus circulation in their natural reservoir - bats (Microchiroptera, Chiroptera). Appearance of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (subgenus Sarbecovirus), and MERS (subgenus Merbecovirus) viruses is a result of evolutionary events occurring in bat populations with further transfer of viruses to the human directly or through the intermediate vertebrate hosts, ecologically connected with bats.

The allograft injury has various histopathological manifestations. Our case illustrates the unusual combination of allograft rejection, acute kidney injury secondary to oxalate nephropathy and SARS CoV-2 nephropathy as the cause of irreversible allograft failure. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56 year old renal allograft recipient presented with a history of fever and diarrhoea for the preceding 4 weeks, tested positive for Sars-CoV2 on nasal swab and was found to have severe allograft dysfunction, necessitating haemodialysis. He subsequently underwent an allograft biopsy, which demonstrated antibody mediated rejection along with the presence of extensive oxalate deposition in the tubules. Ultrastructural examination demonstrated spherical spiked particles in the glomerular capillary endothelium and the presence of tubulo-reticular inclusions suggestive of an active COVID-19 infection within the kidney. The intra-tubular oxalate deposition was considered to be the result of high dose, supplemental Vitamin C used as an immune booster in many patients with COVID - 19 infection in India. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the complex pathology that may be seen in following COVID-19 disease and the need for kidney biopsies in these patients to better understand the aetiology of disease.","Anandh, Urmila; Gowrishankar, Swarnalata; Sharma, Alok; Salama, Alan; Dasgupta, Indranil",BMC Nephrol,378,21

Based on the Japanese depopulation context and the country's National Spatial Strategy, the compact scenario predicts the formation of medium-scale regional urban areas (population centers located across Japan) and the concentration of people on high-density population areas within municipalities. Meanwhile, the dispersed scenario predicts the formation of more but smaller regional urban areas and the dispersion of the population to low-density areas. The simulated population distribution for 2050 reveals spatial change in population density and age structure, as well as an abundance of areas that were inhabited in 2015 but will be zero population areas by 2050. Overlay analysis of future land use maps and the simulated population distribution maps can contribute toward identifying areas where natural capital such as farmland and forest plantation should be managed but where there will be significant population loss by 2050.","Hori, Keiko; Saito, Osamu; Hashimoto, Shizuka; Matsui, Takanori; Akter, Rumana; Takeuchi, Kazuhiko",Sustain Sci,378,15

METHODS: We searched Embase, Medline, bioRxiv, and medRxiv up to 22 June 2020. We included cohorts or cross-sectional studies which systematically tested populations regardless of symptoms for COVID-19, or case series of any size reporting contact investigations of asymptomatic index patients. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed quality using pre-specified criteria. Only moderate/high quality studies were included. The main outcomes were proportion of asymptomatic infection among COVID-19 positive persons at testing and through follow-up, and secondary attack rate among close contacts of asymptomatic index patients. A qualitative synthesis was performed. Where appropriate, data were pooled using random effects meta-analysis to estimate proportions and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Of 6,137 identified studies, 71 underwent quality assessment after full text review, and 28 were high/moderate quality and were included. In two general population studies, the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection at time of testing was 20% and 75%, respectively; among three studies in contacts it was 8.2% to 50%. In meta-analysis, the proportion (95% CI) of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in obstetric patients was 95% (45% to 100%) of which 59% (49% to 68%) remained asymptomatic through follow-up; among nursing home residents, the proportion was 54% (42% to 65%) of which 28% (13% to 50%) remained asymptomatic through follow-up. Transmission studies were too heterogenous to meta-analyse. Among five transmission studies, 18 of 96 (18.8%) close contacts exposed to asymptomatic index patients were COVID-19 positive. CONCLUSIONS: Despite study heterogeneity, the proportion of asymptomatic infection among COVID-19 positive persons appears high and transmission potential seems substantial. To further our understanding, high quality studies in representative general population samples are required.","Yanes-Lane, Mercedes; Winters, Nicholas; Fregonese, Federica; Bastos, Mayara; Perlman-Arrow, Sara; Campbell, Jonathon R; Menzies, Dick",PLoS One,378,21

In contrast to other dental clinics, the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Germany) decided not to limit dental treatment to emergencies alone, but to continue dental care for all patients, with increased safety measures. As such, health care professionals may be exposed to additional physical and mental stress. The aim of this study was to assess the perspectives of all persons involved in dental care (dentists, dental assistants, students, and patients) regarding the aspects of safety measures, anxiety about self-infection and infecting others, and other prospects in the period March to December 2020 using a questionnaire. Data collection was performed between 14 December 2020 and 23 January 2021. A total of 35 dentists (response rate of 79.5%), 23 dental assistants (65.7%), 84 students (80%), and 51 patients (21.8%) completed the survey. The patients did not notice any changes in the care received. Dentists and dental assistants reported a higher workload due to additional safety measures. The majority of dentists, students, and patients agreed that normal patient care was maintained. One-third of dental assistants would have preferred emergency treatment alone and expressed significantly higher anxiety about COVID-19 infection than all other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, all groups showed a predominantly positive perspective on dental care, and anxiety about self-infection and infecting others was especially low. However, additional measures are time-consuming and compound daily patient care. This concept, based on well-established infection control, might be a viable proposal for current and future pandemics.","Schlenz, Maximiliane Amelie; Schmidt, Alexander; Wöstmann, Bernd; May, Andreas; Howaldt, Hans-Peter; Albert, Dennis; Ziedorn, Doreen; Krämer, Norbert; Schulz-Weidner, Nelly",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),378,16

Much of the concern boils down to the question-just how effective are face coverings? One means to address this question is to review our understanding of the physical mechanisms by which masks and coverings operate-steric interception, inertial impaction, diffusion, and electrostatic capture. We enquire as to what extent these can be used to predict the efficacy of coverings. We combine the predictions of the models of these mechanisms which exist in the filtration literature and compare the predictions with recent experiments and lattice Boltzmann simulations, and find reasonable agreement with the former and good agreement with the latter. Building on these results, we explore the parameter space for woven cotton fabrics to show that three-layered cloth masks can be constructed with comparable filtration performance to surgical masks under ideal conditions. Reusable cloth masks thus present an environmentally friendly alternative to surgical masks so long as the face seal is adequate enough to minimize leakage.","Robinson, J.

We describe a new service, HealthLink BC Emergency iDoctor-in-assistance (HEiDi), that partnered physicians available by videoconferencing with 8-1-1 registered nurses to support callers. METHODS: From Apr. 6 to Aug. 2, 2020, all callers to the 8-1-1 telephone service (available to anyone in BC) categorized as ""seek care within 24 hours"" by registered nurses were eligible for referral to HEiDi. HEiDi physicians (""virtual physicians"") connected directly with callers via desktop videoconferencing software, assessed their health complaint, provided advice and suggested care disposition. We conducted a descriptive study and collected demographic characteristics, health concern and disposition determined by the virtual physician. RESULTS: HEiDi virtual physicians provided 7687 consultations. Most patients (n = 4439, 57.8%) were in the 20-64 age range, and 4814 (62.9%) were female. Common health concerns were related to gastroenterology (n = 1275, 16.6%), respiratory (n = 877, 11.4%) and dermatology (n = 874, 11.4%).

This situation has been investigated within the theoretical frameworks of athletic identity and cognitive emotion regulation. Objectives: The objectives of our investigation were to: (a) validate the athletic identity measurement scale (AIMS) for use in Italian language; and (b) explore differences by gender, typology of sport (individual vs. team), and competitive level (elite vs. non-elite) in athletic identity and in cognitive emotion regulation during the Covid-19 lockdown period. Methods: To achieve these objectives, the reliability and construct validity of the Italian version of the AIMS have been tested in Study 1. Multivariate and univariate analyses were run to evaluate differences between different groups of athletes in Study 2. Results: Results from Study 1 suggest a 3-factor higher order model of athletic identity. Results from Study 2 highlight that, during this lockdown period, elite athletes and team sports athletes show higher athletic identity. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies are different for gender and for competitive level. Finally, athletes with higher athletic identity tend to ruminate and catastrophize more. Conclusions: The present multi-study paper contributes to the theoretical field with a validated measure of athletic identity in Italian language. It also provides some practical implications that could apply in this situation of isolation and can be extended to cases such as those of injury or illness.","Costa, Sergio; Santi, Giampaolo; di Fronso, Selenia; Montesano, Cristina; Di Gruttola, Francesco; Ciofi, Edoardo Giorgio; Morgilli, Luana; Bertollo, Maurizio",Sport Sci Health,378,21

There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. There were three (18.8%) and three (16.7%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during hospital stay. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal complications. CONCLUSION: Severe maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal delivery or caesarean section. Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.","Li, Na; Han, Lefei; Peng, Min; Lv, Yuxia; Ouyang, Yin; Liu, Kui; Yue, Linli; Li, Qiannan; Sun, Guoqiang; Chen, Lin; Yang, Lin",Clin. infect. dis,378,29

Descreveu-se o modelo atual de defesa animal, tendo como enfoque as dimensões organizacional, procedimental e operacional, precedida de uma recuperação histórica da sua formação. A defesa animal ocupou diferentes posições na estrutura organizacional da Secretaria, em função dos diferentes objetivos dos diferentes grupos governantes. Passou, de coadjuvante nos projetos de melhoramento animal, a instrumento dos controles legais. Este papel passou a ter maior nitidez, a partir de 1969, com a implantação da Campanha de Combate à Febre Aftosa. Consolidou-se, a partir da década de 1990, com a nova agenda do comércio internacional, do acordo constitutivo da Organização Mundial do Comércio e dos acordos e instrumentos jurídicos conexos que o compõem, especialmente com a adoção do Acordo sobre Aplicação de Medidas Sanitárias e Fitossanitárias. Constatou-se que as estratégias e políticas estabelecidas nos programas de defesa estão baseadas no marco referencial da epidemiologia tradicional. Este enfoque impede que se caracterizem e interpretem o papel que a organização sócio-econômica da produção possui na determinação dos problemas produtivos. A estreita aproximação entre os objetivos da defesa animal em São Paulo e os conteúdos das normas internacionais, coloca em segundo plano as prioridades internas.

We model the datasets as distributions supported on common data graph that is derived from the affinity matrix computed on the combined data. In such cases where the graph is a discretization of an underlying Riemannian closed manifold, we prove that Diffusion EMD is topologically equivalent to the standard EMD with a geodesic ground distance. Diffusion EMD can be computed in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time and is more accurate than similarly fast algorithms such as tree-based EMDs. We also show Diffusion EMD is fully differentiable, making it amenable to future uses in gradient-descent frameworks such as deep neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate an application of Diffusion EMD to single cell data collected from 210 COVID-19 patient samples at Yale New Haven Hospital. Here, Diffusion EMD can derive distances between patients on the manifold of cells at least two orders of magnitude faster than equally accurate methods. This distance matrix between patients can be embedded into a higher level patient manifold which uncovers structure and heterogeneity in patients. More generally, Diffusion EMD is applicable to all datasets that are massively collected in parallel in many medical and biological systems.","Tong, Alexander; Huguet, Guillaume; Natik, Amine; MacDonald, Kincaid; Kuchroo, Manik; Coifman, Ronald; Wolf, Guy; Krishnaswamy, Smita",,378,16

Rotaviruses are divided into 10 serogroups (A-J) and each group is based on genetic properties of major structural protein VP6. We designed a novel VP6 sequence optimization to increase the expression level of this protein. Numerous factors such as codon adaptation index, codon pair bias, and guanine-cytosine content were adapted based on Escherichia coli codon usage. In addition, the ribosome binding site (RBS) of pET-15b was redesigned by the RBS calculator and the secondary structure of VP6 messenger RNA was optimized in the whole length of the coding sequence. Various factors including isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) concentration, temperature, and induction time were analyzed for the optimization of the best expression in E. coli by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting. The recombinant VP6 (rVP6) protein was purified by the Ni-sepharose and then the hyperimmune sera were generated against rVP6 in rabbits. Among three different temperatures, IPTG concentrations, and postinductions, the level of rVP6 was higher at 37°C, 1 mM of IPTG, and 8 h, respectively. Also, the high expression level of rVP6 was obtained in the insoluble aggregate form (43.8 g/L). After purification, the yield of rVP6 was 10.83 g/L. The rVP6 specific antiserum was confirmed by both immunofluorescent and western blotting. The versatile sequence optimization was the reason to produce a high level of rVP6 compared to other reports and can potentially apply to produce cheaper commercial kits to diagnose serological tests and new rotavirus vaccines.","Masoudi, Maha; Teimoori, Ali; Tabaraei, Alijan; Shahbazi, Majid; Divbandi, Marzieh; Lorestani, Nazanin; Yamchi, Ahad; Nikoo, Hadi Razavi",J. med. virol,378,24

One trial reported that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery, while the other two showed no benefit of the treatment under investigation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to, from a statistical perspective, identify several key issues in the design and analysis of three COVID-19 trials and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves in the three trials using more appropriate statistical methods. METHODS: The lopinavir-ritonavir trial enrolled 39 additional patients due to insignificant results after the sample size reached the planned number, which led to inflation of the type I error rate. The remdesivir trial of Wang et al failed to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients, and the bootstrap method was used to predict the quantity of clinical interest conditionally and unconditionally if the trial had continued to reach the originally planned sample size. Moreover, we used a terminal (or cure) rate model and a model-free metric known as the restricted mean survival time or the restricted mean time to improvement (RMTI) to analyze the reconstructed data. The remdesivir trial of Beigel et al reported the median recovery time of the remdesivir and placebo groups, and the rate ratio for recovery, while both quantities depend on a particular time point representing local information. We use the restricted mean time to recovery (RMTR) as a global and robust measure for efficacy. RESULTS: For the lopinavir-ritonavir trial, with the increase of sample size from 160 to 199, the type I error rate was inflated from 0.05 to 0.071. The difference of RMTIs between the two groups evaluated at day 28 was -1.67 days (95% CI -3.62 to 0.28; P=.09) in favor of lopinavir-ritonavir but not statistically significant. For the remdesivir trial of Wang et al, the difference of RMTIs at day 28 was -0.89 days (95% CI -2.84 to 1.06; P=.37). The planned sample size was 453, yet only 236 patients were enrolled. The conditional prediction shows that the hazard ratio estimates would reach statistical significance if the target sample size had been maintained. For the remdesivir trial of Beigel et al, the difference of RMTRs between the remdesivir and placebo groups at day 30 was -2.7 days (95% CI -4.0 to -1.2; P<.001), confirming the superiority of remdesivir. The difference in the recovery time at the 25th percentile (95% CI -3 to 0; P=.65) was insignificant, while the differences became more statistically significant at larger percentiles. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the statistical issues and lessons learned from the recent three clinical trials on COVID-19 treatments, we suggest more appropriate approaches for the design and analysis of ongoing and future COVID-19 trials.","Yin, Guosheng; Zhang, Chenyang; Jin, Huaqing",JMIR Public Health Surveill,378,2

In addition to physical limitations, they often lead to cognitive deficits that make active participation in professional and social life difficult. Due to physical and cognitive deficits, it is often difficult for neurological patients to gain access to specialized knowledge or to receive specialized treatment and is associated with greatly increased effort. Neurological diseases account for 11.6% of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs, a measure for quantifying disease burden) and 16.5% of deaths, and remain the leading cause of DALYs and the second leading cause of death worldwide. Neurorehabilitation encompasses the goal of reintegrating patients with neurological dysfunctions into everyday life. The ongoing situation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges for the healthcare system. Social distancing and quarantine have deprived many people with neurological disorders of access to routine medical care. The corona pandemic is a catalyst for the widespread use of telemedicine in the field of neurology and neurorehabilitation. Projects such as the Brunei project of the Nordwest Krankenhaus Frankfurt as well as an MS clinic in Canada show that highly specialized medicine and neurorehabilitation can be delivered to remote areas or in the living room of patients or any doctor's office.

To address this, the present meta-analysis examined the predictive validity of Harkin and Kessler's (2011b) executive function, binding complexity, and memory load (EBL) Classification System concerning affected versus unaffected memory performance in OCD. We employed a multilevel meta-analytic approach (Viechtbauer, 2010) to accommodate the interdependent nature of the EBL model and interdependency of effect sizes (305 effect sizes from 144 studies, including 4,424 OCD patients). Results revealed that the EBL model predicted memory performance; that is, as EBL demand increases, those with OCD performed progressively worse on memory tasks. Executive function was the driving mechanism behind the EBL's impact on OCD memory performance, as it negated binding complexity, memory load, and visual or verbal task differences. Comparisons of subtask effect sizes were also generally in accord with the cognitive parameters of the EBL taxonomy. We conclude that standardized coding of tasks along individual cognitive dimensions and multilevel meta-analyses provides a new approach to examine multidimensional models of memory and cognitive performance in OCD and other disorders.

We compare the demographics and outcomes of patients treated during lockdown to a matched period from 2019. Findings have important implications for service development. Methods: A split-site service was introduced, with a COVID-19 free site treating the majority of trauma patients. Polytrauma, spinal, and paediatric trauma patients, plus COVID-19 confirmed or suspicious cases, were managed at another site. Prospective data on all trauma patients undergoing surgery at either site between 16 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 was collated and compared with retrospective review of the same period in 2019. Patient demographics, injury, surgical details, length of stay (LOS), COVID-19 status, and outcome were compared. Results: There were 1,004 urgent orthopaedic trauma patients (604 in 2019; 400 in 2020). Significant reductions in time to theatre and LOS stay were observed. COVID-19 positive status was confirmed in 4.5% (n = 18). The COVID-19 mortality rate was 1.8% (n = 7). Day-case surgery comprised 47.8% (n = 191), none testing positive for COVID-19 or developing clinically significant COVID-19 symptoms requiring readmission, at a minimum of 17 days follow-up. Conclusion: The novel split-site service, segregating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, minimized onward transmission and demonstrated improved outcomes regarding time to surgery and LOS, despite altered working patterns and additional constraints.

False news, conspiracy theories, and magical cures were shared with the general public at an alarming rate, which may lead to increased anxiety and stress levels and associated debilitating consequences. OBJECTIVES: To measure the level of COVID-19 information overload (COVIO) and assess the association between COVIO and sociodemographic characteristics among the general public. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between April and May 2020 using a modified Cancer Information Overload scale. The survey was developed and posted on four social media platforms. The data were only collected from those who consented to participate. COVIO score was classified into high vs. low using the asymmetrical distribution as a guide and conducted a binary logistic regression to examine the factors associated with COVIO. RESULTS: A total number of 584 respondents participated in this study. The mean COVIO score of the respondents was 19.4 (± 4.0). Sources and frequency of receiving COVID-19 information were found to be significant predictors of COVIO. Participants who received information via the broadcast media were more likely to have high COVIO than those who received information via the social media (adjusted odds ratio ([aOR],14.599; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.608-132.559; p = 0.017). Also, participants who received COVID-19 information every minute (aOR, 3.892; 95% CI, 1.124-13.480; p = 0.032) were more likely to have high COVIO than those who received information every week. CONCLUSION: The source of information and the frequency of receiving COVID-19 information were significantly associated with COVIO. The COVID-19 information is often conflicting, leading to confusion and overload of information in the general population. This can have unfavorable effects on the measures taken to control the transmission and management of COVID-19 infection.","Mohammed, Mustapha; Sha039,; aban, Abubakar; Jatau, Abubakar Ibrahim; Yunusa, Ismaeel; Isa, Abubakar Musa; Wada, Abubakar Sadiq; Obamiro, Kehinde; Zainal, Hadzliana; Ibrahim, Baharudin",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),378,13

These fungal cupping erosions emit a characteristic fluorescent orange-yellow color when the wing membrane is transilluminated with 385 nm UV light. The purpose of this study was to create and validate the R package, countcolors, for quantifying the distinct orange-yellow ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence in bat-wing membrane lesions caused by P. destructans. Validation of countcolors was completed by first quantifying the percent area of 20, 2.5 cm2 images. These generated images were of two known pixel colors ranging from 0% to 100% of the pixels. The countcolors package accurately measured the known proportion of a given color in each image. Next, 40, 2.5 cm2 sections of UV transilluminated photographs of little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) wings were given to a single evaluator. The area of fluorescence was both manually measured and calculated using image analysis software and quantified with countcolors. There was good agreement between the two methods (Pearson's correlation=0.915); however, the manual use of imaging software showed a consistent negative bias. Reproducibility of the analysis methods was tested by providing the same images to naive evaluators who previously never used the software; no significant difference (P=0.099) was found among evaluators. Using the R package countcolors takes less time than does manually measuring the fluorescence in image analysis software, and our results showed that countcolors can improve the accuracy when quantifying the area of P. destructans infection in bat wing-membranes.","Hooper, Sarah E; Weller, Hannah; Amelon, Sybill K",J. wildl. dis,378,12

METHODS: Aerosol generation during phacoemulsification was assessed using a model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Typical phacoemulsification settings were used and visible aerosol production was recorded using high-speed 4K camera. Aerosolisation was evaluated under various experimental settings: Two different phacoemulsification tip sizes (2.2, 2.75 mm), varying levels of corneal moisture, the use of suction and blowing air in the surgical field, the use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) coating of the cornea with a static and moving tip. RESULTS: This model demonstrates visible aerosol generation during phacoemulsification with a 2.75-mm phacoemulsification tip. No visible aerosol was noted with a 2.2-mm tip. The presence of visible aerosol was unrelated to corneal wetting. Suction in close proximity to the aerosol plume did not impact on its dispersion. Blowing air redirected the aerosol plume toward the ocular surface. Visible aerosol production was abolished when HPMC was used to coat the cornea. This effect lasted for an average of 67 ± 8 s in the static model. Visible aerosol generation was discerned during movement of the 2.2-mm tip toward the corneal wound. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate visible aerosol production in the setting of a model of clear corneal phacoemulsification. Visible aerosol can be reduced using a 2.2-mm phacoemulsification tip and reapplying HPMC every minute during phacoemulsification.","Darcy, Kieren; Elhaddad, Omar; Achiron, Asaf; Keller, Johannes; Leadbetter, Duncan; Tole, Derek; Liyanage, Sidath",,378,26

In fact, Italy ranks 24th amongst the 27-EU member countries in digital competitiveness which testifies to the significant delays and gaps in basic digital skills amongst the population. Based on the difficulties encountered in organizing distance learning, we assumed that teachers' perceived stress increased. Given that transversal skills can be associated with this relationship, we hypothesized that among these skills, self-efficacy mediated the relationship between the difficulties in organizing distance learning and perceived stress. Since we targeted teachers from Italy and other European countries, we also hypothesized that this mediator effect would be different for both samples. Our sample was composed of a total of 366 primary/middle school teachers of which 86% female. After doing a mediation analyses with Process, Hayes' Model 4, we confirmed H1 but not H2: resulting in a partial mediation effect of self-efficacy for each individual group of teachers. Since difficulties of distance learning can affect the perception of stress, we believe that the promotion of transversal skills, such as self-efficacy, can better equip teachers when facing stressful situations.","Rabaglietti, E.; Lattke, L.

Presenting antigens on synthetic Biotin-PA nanofibers generated a higher immune response than the free antigens delivered with a cytosine-phosphate-guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) (TLR9 agonist) adjuvant. Antigen attached Biotin-PA nanofibers trigger splenocytes to produce high levels of cytokines (IFN-Î³, IL-12, TNF-&#945;, and IL-6) and to exhibit a superior cross-presentation of the antigen. Both Biotin-PA nanofibers and CpG ODN induce a Th-1-biased IgG subclass response; however, delivering the antigen with Biotin-PA nanofibers induce significantly greater production of total IgG and subclasses of IgG compared to delivering the antigen with CpG ODN. Contrary to CpG ODN, Biotin-PA nanofibers also enhance antigen-specific splenocyte proliferation and increase the proportion of the antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. Given their biodegradability and biocompatibility, Biotin-PA nanofibers have a significant potential in immunoengineering applications as a biomaterial for the delivery of a diverse set of antigens derived from intracellular pathogens, emerging viral diseases such as COVID-19, or cancer cells to induce humoral and cellular immune responses against the antigens.","Demircan, Muhammed Burak; Tohumeken, Sehmus; Gunduz, Nuray; Khalily, Mohammad Aref; Tekinay, Turgay; Guler, Mustafa O; Tekinay, Ayse B",Biotechnol J,378,16

Results: Smoker-athletes had higher resting heart rate (76 ± 9bpm vs. 72 ± 10bpm, p<0.05), maximum heart rate (154 ± 18bpm vs. 147 ± 17bpm, p<0.05) and recovery time (7min 25sec ± 6min 31sec vs. 4min 21sec ± 4min 30sec, p<0.05) than non-smoker athletes. Scores from the IPAQ were approximately the same (M=7927 ± 10303, M= 6380 ± 4539, p<0.05). Conclusion: Smoking was found to affect athletes' cardiovascular fitness. The change of the athletes' heart rate recovery and recovery time contributes to the adaptation of cardiovascular function in training requirements.","Pepera, Garyfallia; Panagiota, Zogka",Afr Health Sci,378,29

To develop vaccines against TW-like IBV strains and investigate the critical genes associated with their virulence, GD strain was attenuated by 140 serial passages in specific-pathogen-free embryonated eggs and the safety and efficacy of the attenuated GD strain (aGD) were examined. The genome sequences of GD and aGD were also compared and the effects of mutations in the S gene were observed. The results revealed that aGD strain showed no obvious pathogenicity with superior protective efficacy against TW-like and QX-like virulent IBV strains. The genomes of strains aGD and GD shared high similarity (99.87 %) and most of the mutations occurred in S gene. Recombinant IBV strain rGDaGD-S, in which the S gene was replaced with the corresponding regions from aGD, showed decreased pathogenicity compared with its parental strain. In conclusion, attenuated TW-like IBV strain aGD is a potential vaccine candidate and the S gene is responsible for its attenuation. Our research has laid the foundation for future exploration of the attenuating molecular mechanism of IBV.","Xu, Gang; Ma, Shuhui; Cheng, Jinlong; Zhao, Ye; Zhang, Guozhong",Vet Microbiol,378,3

Institutions that rely on test scores have been forced to adapt, and in many cases this means using scores from a different test, or a new online version of an existing test, that can be taken at home. The switch to accepting at-home proficiency tests for high-stakes decisions raises many concerns for stakeholders, such as technological demands, exam security, and validity of score use. Along these lines, this thematic review addresses such concerns and features brief reviews of seven options in at-home proficiency testing: ACTFL Assessments, Duolingo English Test, IELTS Indicator, LanguageCert, TEF Express, TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition, and Versant. Considering at-home testing more broadly, we discuss key considerations for selecting an at-home test. We close with speculation on how at-home tests may shape language testing going forward: Beyond adapting to the current pandemic, at-home testing might address longstanding issues in access to language testing services and the representation of real-world communication practices in language tests.","Isbell, Daniel R.; Kremmel, Benjamin",Lang.

The data collection was performed through a questionnaire applied to primary care patients. The sample consisted of 149 people, the majority of whom were elderly and with a low level of schooling. Regarding the generation of waste, 88.64% of the deponents declared the use of one syringe per day, performing 1 to 4 applications. The reuse of the material was reported by 66.67% of the declarants. After being used, the waste was stored - with higher prevalence - in plastic bags (20.8%), plastic bottles, clothes softener and mayonnaise containers, etc. (46.98%). Ordinary household waste was the main disposal site for the perforating waste. Furthermore, it was revealed that those people who did not receive instructions regarding appropriate waste disposal discarded their waste incorrectly. Based on the results, the conclusion drawn is that the diabetics who participated in this study fail to discard and dispose of the perforating waste appropriately due to the lack of adequate guidelines and public programs.","Santos, Luciana Nunes Dos; Ruiz, Juliana Bueno",Cien Saude Colet,378,20

Currently, no specific prophylactic and therapeutic treatment is available. No evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that a treatment may ameliorate the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 exists with the only exception of preliminary evidence from remdesivir trials. Here, we present evidence from the literature and a compelling hypothesis on the potential immunomodulatory, iron chelating and anti-oxidant effects of iron chelators in the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications. Interestingly, iron chelation has been shown in vitro to suppress endothelial inflammation in viral infection, which is the main pathophysiologic mechanism behind systemic organ involvement induced by SARS-CoV-2, by inhibiting IL-6 synthesis through decreasing NF-kB. Iron chelators exhibit iron chelating, antiviral and immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, particularly against RNA viruses. These agents could attenuate ARDS and help control SARS-CoV-2 via multiple mechanisms including: 1) inhibition of viral replication; 2) decrease of iron availability; 3) upregulation of B cells; 4) improvement of the neutralizing anti-viral antibody titer; 5) inhibition of endothelial inflammation and 6) prevention of pulmonary fibrosis and lung decline via reduction of pulmonary iron accumulation. Both retrospective analyses of data in electronic health records, as well as proof of concept studies in humans and large RCTs are needed to fully elucidate the efficacy and safety of iron chelating agents in the therapeutic armamentarium of COVID-19, probably as an adjunctive treatment.","Dalamaga, Maria; Karampela, Irene; Mantzoros, Christos S",Metabolism,378,20

However, the colonization of South America by bats has been poorly studied, even though they are the second most speciose order of mammals. A review of taxonomy, systematics, distribution, and the fossil record suggest that there were several dispersals to South America within 3 superfamilies of bats (Emballonuroidea, Noctilionoidea, and Vespertilionoidea). The reconstruction of ancestral areas based on a phylogeny of bats infers that Africa is the geographic area of origin for most basal nodes. This implies that the diversification of Neotropical species in Noctilionoidea occurred after a single colonization of South America from Africa in the Eocene by an ancestor of the New World families Furipteridae, Mormoopidae, Noctilionidae, Phyllostomidae, and Thyropteridae. Within Emballonuroidea, a similar trans-Atlantic dispersal in the Oligocene gave rise to the New World tribe Diclidurini in the family Emballonuridae. The situation for Vespertilionoidea is more complex with multiple dispersals in 3 families (Molossidae, Natalidae, and Vespertilionidae).

However, when it comes to creative ideation, it is unclear how the demographic cues of one's peers can influence the network dynamics and the associated performance outcomes of people. In this paper, we ask: (1) Given the task of creative idea generation, how do social network connectivities adapt to people's demographic cues? (2) How are creative outcomes influenced by such demography-informed network dynamics? We find that link formations in creativity-centric networks are primarily guided by the creative performances of one's peers. However, in the presence of demographic information, the odds of same-gender links to persist increase by 82.03%, after controlling for merit-based link persistence. In essence, homophily-guided link persistence takes place when demographic cues are available. We further find that the semantic similarities between socially stimulated idea-sets increase significantly in the presence of demographic cues (P<1e-4), which is counter-productive for the purposes of divergent creativity. This result can partly be explained by the observation that people's ideas tend to be more homogeneous within demographic groups than between demographic groups (P<1e-7). Therefore, choosing to maintain connections based on demographic similarity can negatively impact one's creative inspiration sources by taking away potential diversity bonuses. Our results can inform intelligent intervention possibilities towards maximizing a social system's creative outcomes.","Baten, Raiyan Abdul; Ghoshal, Gourab; Hoque, Mohammed Ehsan",,378,21

RESULTS: Since COVID, Indigenous Australians and persons with less severe suicidal and self-harm presentations had significantly reduced presentations, while persons younger than 18 years had more presentations. Less suicidal presentations resulted in an admission to inpatient care.

We do not know exactly whether this virus can stimulate our immune system to react against platelets and red blood cells. Herein, we report a case of COVID-19 pneumonia associated with two severe blood diseases, immune thrombocytopenia, which causes platelet destruction, and hemolytic anemia, which causes red cell destruction. An 83-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of both difficulty in breathing and diffuse bleeding in mucosae and skin. Exams revealed hemolytic anemia, severe immune thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia in both lungs. Molecular testing confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 1,965 American adults using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Participants reporting household food insecurity prior to the pandemic were excluded from analyses. RESULTS: 1,250 participants reported household food security before the COVID-19 outbreak. Among this subset, 41% were identified as at risk for food insecurity after COVID-19, 55% were women and 73% were white. On multivariable analysis, race, income, relationship status, living situation, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with incident risk for food insecurity. Black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino respondents, respondents with annual income less than $100,000, and those living with children or others were significantly more likely to be newly at risk for food insecurity. Individuals at risk for food insecurity were 2.60 (95% CI 1.91-3.55) times more likely to screen positively for anxiety and 1.71 (95% CI 1.21-2.42) times more likely to screen positively for depression. CONCLUSIONS: Increased risk for food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic is common, and certain populations are particularly vulnerable. There are strong associations between being at risk for food insecurity and anxiety/depression. Interventions to increase access to healthful foods, especially among minority and low-income individuals, and ease the socioemotional effects of the outbreak are crucial to relieving the economic stress of this pandemic.","Lauren, Brianna N; Silver, Elisabeth R; Faye, Adam S; Rogers, Alexandra M; Woo Baidal, Jennifer A; Ozanne, Elissa M; Hur, Chin",Public Health Nutr,378,16

However, few analyses are specifically dedicated to quantifying the financial impact of the pandemic on practicing neurosurgeons. The authors present a survey analysis to address this need. METHODS: The authors distributed a 19-question survey to practicing neurosurgeons in the United States and its territories. The questions evaluated respondents' assessments of changes in patient and procedural volume, salary and benefits, practice expenses, staffing, applications for government assistance, and stroke management. Responses were stratified by geographic region. RESULTS: The response rate was 5.1% (267/5224). Most respondents from each region noted a >50% decrease in clinic volume. Respondents from the Northeast observed a 76% decrease in procedure volume, which was significantly greater than that of other regions (p=0.003). Northeast respondents were also significantly more likely to have been re-assigned to non-neurosurgical clinical duties during the pandemic (p<0.001). Most respondents also noted decreased salary and benefits however experienced no changes in overall practice expenses, and most respondents have not experienced significant reductions in nursing or midlevel staffing. These trends were not significantly different between regions. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to decreases in patient and procedural volume and physician compensation despite stable practice expenses. Significantly more respondents in the Northeast region noted decreases in procedural volume and re-assignment to non-neurosurgical COVID-related medical duties. Future analysis is necessary as the pandemic evolves and the long-term clinical and economic implications become clear.","Caruso, James P; Swartz, Karin; Mazzola, Catherine; Ban, Vin Shen; Singh, Ravi; Eldridge, Cody; Schirmer, Clemens; Cheng, Joseph; Bauer, Andrew M; Steinmetz, Michael; Adogwa, Owoicho",World neurosurgery (Online),378,24

In order to reduce the spread of Sars-CoV-2 virus, governments of several countries have adopted social isolation as a strategy. However, social isolation has culminated in deleterious effects for the population's health, including increased physical inactivity, stress and, consequently, adverse changes in body composition, cardiorespiratory capacity, muscle strength, physical functionality, and vascular events, which are increasingly pointed out as the main determinants of cardiovascular health. Staying physically active during lockdown is a challenge, especially for the population with a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19 who are still encouraged to maintain social distance until there is a vaccine available. Strategies to avoid physical inactivity, and reduce stress levels can promote cardiovascular protection, and must be considered during COVID-19 time. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to discuss the risks of physical inactivity and stress for the cardiovascular system during the COVID-19 pandemic and propose strategies to protect cardiovascular health. CONCLUSION: A home-based training protocol could be an interesting and effective strategy for the population who need to remain physically active and safe at home.","Ruberti, Olívia Moraes; Telles, Guilherme Defante; Rodrigues, Bruno",Current cardiology reviews (Online),378,16

Nonhuman primates (NHPs), including cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, are considered the gold standard animal model to interrogate mechanisms of EBOV pathogenesis. However, despite significant genetic similarity (>90%), NHP species display different clinical presentation following EBOV infection, notably a â¼1-2 days delay in disease progression. Consequently, evaluation of therapeutics is generally conducted in rhesus macaques, whereas cynomolgus macaques are utilized to determine efficacy of preventative treatments, notably vaccines. This observation is in line with reported differences in disease severity and host responses between these two NHP following infection with simian varicella virus, influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. However, the molecular underpinnings of these differential outcomes following viral infections remain poorly defined. In this study, we compared published transcriptional profiles obtained from cynomolgus and rhesus macaques infected with the EBOV-Makona Guinea C07 using bivariate and regression analyses to elucidate differences in host responses. We report the presence of a shared core of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) reflecting EVD pathology, including aberrant inflammation, lymphopenia, and coagulopathy. However, the magnitudes of change differed between the two macaque species. These findings suggest that the differential clinical presentation of EVD in these two species is mediated by altered transcriptional responses.","Pinski, Amanda N; Maroney, Kevin J; Marzi, Andrea; Messaoudi, Ilhem",Emerg Microbes Infect,378,20

So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from The Netherlands (n [Formula: see text] 350,000). We use the fact that national examinations took place before and after lockdown and compare progress during this period to the same period in the 3 previous years. The Netherlands underwent only a relatively short lockdown (8 wk) and features an equitable system of school funding and the world’s highest rate of broadband access. Still, our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations. The effect is equivalent to one-fifth of a school year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60% larger among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll of the pandemic on children and families. Investigating mechanisms, we find that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum-entropy weights or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family. The findings imply that students made little or no progress while learning from home and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures.","Engzell, Per; Frey, Arun; Verhagen, Mark D.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,378,1

Since this pathogen may possess a latent period after infection, which sometimes leads to misdiagnosis by traditional diagnosis methods, the establishment of a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method is crucial for transmission prevention and timely treatment. Herein, a novel detection method was established for M. pneumoniae detection. The method, which improves upon a denaturation bubble-mediated strand exchange amplification (SEA) that we developed in 2016, is called accelerated SEA (ASEA). The established ASEA achieved detection of 1% M. pneumoniae genomic DNA in a DNA mixture from multiple pathogens, and the limit of detection (LOD) of ASEA was as low as 1.0 × 10(−17) M (approximately 6.0 × 10(3) copies/mL). Considering that the threshold of an asymptomatic carriage is normally recommended as 1.0 × 10(4) copies/mL, this method was able to satisfy the requirement for practical diagnosis of M. pneumoniae. Moreover, the detection process was finished within 20.4 min, significantly shorter than real-time PCR and SEA. Furthermore, ASEA exhibited excellent performance in clinical specimen analysis, with sensitivity and specificity of 96.2% and 100%, respectively, compared with the “gold standard” real-time PCR. More importantly, similar to real-time PCR, ASEA requires only one pair of primers and ordinary commercial polymerase, and can be carried out using a conventional fluorescence real-time PCR instrument, which makes this method low-cost and easy to accomplish. Therefore, ASEA has the potential for wide use in the rapid detection of M. pneumoniae or other pathogens in large numbers of specimens.

METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed in Pubmed, Embase and PsychINFO on 2 February 2021. Quantitative studies, qualitative studies, clinical lessons and case reports were considered eligible designs. RESULTS: In total, nine articles were included in this literature review. The frequency of persistent symptoms in patients after mild COVID-19 infection ranged between 10% and 35%. Symptoms persisting after a mild COVID-19 infection can be distinguished into physical, mental and social symptoms. Fatigue was the most frequently described persistent symptom. Other frequently occurring persistent symptoms were dyspnoea, cough, chest pain, headache, decreased mental and cognitive status and olfactory dysfunction. In addition, it was found that persisting symptoms after a mild COVID-19 infection can have major consequences for work and daily functioning. CONCLUSION: There is already some evidence that symptoms of mild COVID-19 persist after 3 weeks in a third of patients. However, there is a lack of data about symptoms persisting after 3 months (long-COVID). More research is needed to help GPs in managing long-COVID.","van Kessel, Sophie A M; Olde Hartman, Tim C; Lucassen, Peter L B J; van Jaarsveld, Cornelia H M",Fam Pract,378,1

The aim of the study was to examine the influence of early CDV infection on leukocyte depletion, lymphopenia and virus-induced cell death in dogs infected with a virulent CDV strain. From 10 infected dogs, peripheral blood leukocytes were harvested periodically, phenotyped and analyzed for CDV antigen content and apoptosis using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide labeling. CDV infection induced a severe CD3(+) T cell and CD21(+) B cell depletion in all animals at 3 days post-infection (d.p.i.). For dogs with severe distemper, developing virus persistence in the lymphoid tissue and central nervous system, this lymphopenia lasted until the end of the experiment. Increased levels of lymphocyte apoptosis were found at 3 d.p.i., and monocyte apoptosis at 6 d.p.i. This was more prominent in the group of animals with severe distemper. At 3 d.p.i. no leukocyte infection was detectable indicating that the early lymphocyte depletion and apoptosis was not a direct consequence of virus infection. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CDV-induced lymphopenia is an early event and that the degree of lymphocyte depletion correlates with the severity of disease and virus persistence in the lymphoid tissue and central nervous system.","Schobesberger, Martina; Summerfield, Artur; Doherr, Marcus G.; Zurbriggen, Andreas; Griot, Christian",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,378,16

There has been growing interest regarding the harmful effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. This systematic review aims to systematically analyze papers reporting echocardiographic findings in hospitalized COVID-19 subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included prospective and retrospective studies reporting echocardiography data in >10 hospitalized adult subjects with COVID-19; from 1st February 2020 to 15th January 2021. RESULTS: The primary electronic search identified 1120 articles. Twenty-nine studies were finally included, enrolling 3944 subjects. Overall the studies included a median of 68.0% (45.5–100.0) of patients admitted to ICU. Ten studies (34.4%) were retrospective, and 20 (68.9%) single-centred. Overall enrolling 1367 subjects, three studies reported normal echocardiographic findings in 49 ± 18% of cases. Seven studies (24.1%) analyzed the association between echocardiographic findings and mortality, mostly related to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Data regarding the use of echocardiography on hospitalized, predominantly ICU, COVID-19 patients were retrieved from studies with heterogeneous designs, variable sample sizes, and severity scores. Normal echocardiographic findings were reported in about 50% of subjects, with LVEF usually not affected. Overall, RV dysfunction seems more likely associated with increased mortality.

This document aims to provide scientifically available evidence-based information in a transparent interpretation, to subsidize decisions related to the pharmacological therapy of COVID-19 in Brazil. METHODS: A group of 27 experts and methodologists integrated a task-force formed by professionals from the Brazilian Association of Intensive Care Medicine (Associação de Medicina Intensiva Brasileira - AMIB), the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases (Sociedad Brasileira de Infectologia - SBI) and the Brazilian Society of Pulmonology and Tisiology (Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisiologia - SBPT). Rapid systematic reviews, updated on April 28, 2020, were conducted. The assessment of the quality of evidence and the development of recommendations followed the GRADE system. The recommendations were written on May 5, 8, and 13, 2020. RESULTS: Eleven recommendations were issued based on low or very-low level evidence. We do not recommend the routine use of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, corticosteroids, or tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19. Prophylactic heparin should be used in hospitalized patients, however, no anticoagulation should be provided for patients without a specific clinical indication. Antibiotics and oseltamivir should only be considered for patients with suspected bacterial or influenza coinfection, respectively. CONCLUSION: So far no pharmacological intervention was proven effective and safe to warrant its use in the routine treatment of COVID-19 patients; therefore such patients should ideally be treated in the context of clinical trials. The recommendations herein provided will be revised continuously aiming to capture newly generated evidence.","Falavigna, Maicon; Colpani, Verônica; Stein, Cinara; Azevedo, Luciano Cesar Pontes; Bagattini, Angela Maria; de Brito, Gabriela Vilela; Chatkin, José Miguel; Cimerman, Sergio; Corradi, Mirian de Freitas Dal Ben; da Cunha, Clovis Arns; de Medeiros, Flávia Cordeiro; de Oliveira Junior, Haliton Alves; Fritscher, Leandro Genehr; Gazzana, Marcelo Basso; Gräf, Débora Dalmas; Marra, Lays Pires; Matuoka, Jessica Yumi; Nunes, Michelle Silva; Pachito, Daniela Vianna; Pagano, Cássia Garcia Moraes; Parreira, Patrícia do Carmo Silva; Riera, Rachel; Silva Júnior, Amilton; Tavares, Bruno de Melo; Zavascki, Alexandre Prehn; Rosa, Regis Goulart; Dal-Pizzol, Felipe",Rev Bras Ter Intensiva,378,16

METHODS: A content analysis of MPH programs in Canada was conducted from July 2019 to November 2019. A sampling frame of programs was obtained from a list from the PHAC Web site. Program information, including mandatory and elective course descriptions, was extracted from each program's Web site and analyzed in NVivo 12. Course descriptions were independently categorized by 2 researchers into 1 or more of the 7 categories of the core competencies outlined by the PHAC. RESULTS: We identified 18 universities with MPH programs with 267 courses across Canada. Thematic analysis revealed that 100% of programs had coursework that addressed the “Public Health Sciences” and “Assessment and Analysis” categories; 93% addressed “Policy and Program Planning, Implementation, and Evaluation”; 67% addressed each of “Communication,” “Leadership,” and “Partnerships, Collaboration, and Advocacy”; and only 56% had course descriptions addressing “Diversity and Inclusiveness.” CONCLUSIONS: We find that Canadian MPH programs may lack course offerings addressing core competency categories relating to diversity and inclusiveness, communication, and leadership. Our findings were limited in scope as we relied on program Web sites; thus, further research should explore course content in more depth than this course description analysis allowed and identify ways to close the MPH curricular gaps we identified.","Apatu, Emma; Sinnott, Will; Piggott, Thomas; Butler-Jones, David; Anderson, Laura N.; Alvarez, Elizabeth; Dobbins, Maureen; Harrison, Leila; Neil-Sztramko, Sarah E.",J Public Health Manag Pract,378,20

METHODS: Cancer patient who required treatment, were evaluated for potential COVID-19 infection in a 90-day period, starting from beginning of this epidemic in Iran, January, to April 19, 2020. For treatment of solid tumor patients, if they did not have symptoms related to COVID-19, just chest X-ray was requested. If they showed COVID-19 related symptoms, high resolution CT scan of lungs was requested. For hematology cancer patients, PCR test for COVID-19 infection was requested as well. Protection measures were considered for personnel of oncology wards. RESULTS: 279 Patients were followed up in this 90-day period. No COVID-19 infection was observed in 92 cases of breast cancer, 14 cases of gastric cancer and 12 cases of pancreaticobiliary cancer. However, in 72 cases of colon cancer, 11 cases of lung cancer, 5 cases brain tumors and 12 cases ovarian cancer; 4 cases of COVID-19 were observed. In the hematology cancers group, which included 14 cases of Hodgkin’s disease, 23 cases of lymphoproliferative disorder, 12 cases of acute leukemia and 12 cases of multiple myeloma; 3 cases of COVID-19 were observed. CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer who need treatment can be treated by taking some measures. These measures include observing individual and collective protection principles in patients and health-care personnel, increasing patients’ awareness particularly about self-care behavior, performing a COVID-19 test, and taking a chest X-ray, before the treatment starts","Aznab, Mozaffar",Int J Clin Oncol,378,18

Recent studies show multiorgan involvement during infection, with direct insult to the heart. Worsening of the heart function serves as a predictor of an adverse outcome. This finding raises a particular concern in high risk population, such as those with history of preexisting heart failure with or without implantable device. Lower baseline and different clinical characteristic might raise some challenge in managing either exacerbation or new onset heart failure that might occur as a consequence of the infection. A close look of the inflammatory markers gives an invaluable clue in managing this condition. Rapid deterioration might occur anytime in this setting and the need of cardiopulmonary support seems inevitable. However, the use of cardiopulmonary support in this patient is not without risk. Severe inflammatory response triggered by the infection in combination with the preexisting condition of the worsening heart and implantable device might cause a hypercoagulability state that should not be overlooked. Moreover, careful selection and consideration have to be met before selecting cardiopulmonary support as a last resort due to limited resource and personnel. By knowing the nature of the disease, the interaction between the inflammatory response and different baseline profile in heart failure patient might help clinician to salvage and preserve the remaining function of the heart.","Raffaello, Wilson Matthew; Huang, Ian; Budi Siswanto, Bambang; Pranata, Raymond",World J Cardiol,378,26

Apart from the issues surrounding COVID-19 itself, care for existing patients has met many challenges. One such challenge is caring for patients who are on clozapine treatment and have been confirmed positive for COVID-19. Schizophrenia has been considered to have a deep connection with the immune system, and clozapine can induce further changes in this system. COVID-19 can ravage the compromised immune system and aggravate tissue damage. The intricate relations between schizophrenia, clozapine, and COVID-19 make it difficult to predict the clinical course of COVID-19 in clozapine-treated patients. However, the rigid prohibition on using clozapine if COVID-19 is confirmed may harm patients. Patients who have to use clozapine are often refractory cases with no alternatives. Therefore, the decision to maintain or stop clozapine must be made after a comprehensive review of the patient’s unique situation. To do this, theoretical and practical issues surrounding the use of clozapine in COVID-19 should be reviewed and discussed. In this review, we gather useful information surrounding this issue and present an overview. Focusing on the immune system, various theoretical possibilities that could arise from schizophrenia, clozapine, and COVID-19 were carefully examined, and practical checklists for the care of these patients were explored. It is hoped that this review will convince many clinicians to pay attention to this momentous issue and facilitate more active sharing of clinical experiences.","Jeong, Seong Hoon; Kim, Yong Sik",Clin Psychopharmacol Neurosci,378,16

METHODS: PAP usage data in children with SDB aged 1 to 18 years old at The Hospital for Sick Children, Canada, were analyzed. The PAP usage data were recorded for 3 months prior to and 3 months following the COVID-19 lockdown in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcomes of interest were (i) percentage of days that PAP was used for ≥ 4 h and (ii) average daily usage of PAP based on days when PAP was used. RESULTS: A total of 151 children were included. The mean (± SD) age and BMI were 12.6 ± 4.1 years and 28.7 ± 12.4 kg/m(2), respectively. The median (IQR) percentage of days of PAP usage for ≥ 4 h and average nightly PAP usage was significantly higher during compared with prior to the pandemic (76.7 [19.0–94.0] vs 62.0 [15.5–89.0]%, p = 0.02, and 406.0 [244.0–525.0] vs 367.0 [218.0–496.0] min, p = 0.006, respectively). Within this cohort, 95/151 (63%) children with SDB showed increased PAP usage and 56/151 (37%) either decreased the amount of time they used PAP or stopped PAP use altogether. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has provided opportunities for increased PAP usage in a significant number of children with SDB. A subset of children with prior evidence for suboptimal PAP usage showed further decreases in PAP usage during the pandemic.

Despite recent advancements in machine learning and computer vision, the development of computer-aided diagnostic systems for radiographs remains a challenging and unsolved problem, particularly in the context of veterinary medicine. In this study, a novel method, based on multi-label deep convolutional neural network (CNN), for the classification of thoracic radiographs in dogs was developed. All the thoracic radiographs of dogs performed between 2010 and 2020 in the institution were retrospectively collected. Radiographs were taken with two different radiograph acquisition systems and were divided into two data sets accordingly. One data set (Data Set 1) was used for training and testing and another data set (Data Set 2) was used to test the generalization ability of the CNNs. Radiographic findings used as non mutually exclusive labels to train the CNNs were: unremarkable, cardiomegaly, alveolar pattern, bronchial pattern, interstitial pattern, mass, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and megaesophagus. Two different CNNs, based on ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121 architectures respectively, were developed and tested. The CNN based on ResNet-50 had an Area Under the Receive-Operator Curve (AUC) above 0.8 for all the included radiographic findings except for bronchial and interstitial patterns both on Data Set 1 and Data Set 2. The CNN based on DenseNet-121 had a lower overall performance.

Clinical practice has demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific antibodies and viral antigens can be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers of COVID-19. However, the popular point-of-care biomarker detection technologies, such as the lateral-flow test strips, provide only yes/no information and have very limited sensitivities. Thus, it has a high false negative rate and cannot be used for the quantitative evaluation of patient’s immune response. Conventional ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), on the other hand, can provide quantitative, accurate, and sensitive results, but it involves complicated and expensive instruments and long assay time. In addition, samples need to be sent to centralized labs, which significantly increases the turn-around time. Here, we present a microfluidic ELISA technology for rapid (15-20 minutes), quantitative, sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers using SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and viral antigen – S protein in serum. We also characterized various humanized monoclonal IgG, and identified a candidate with a high binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein that can serve as the calibration standard of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG in serological analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our microfluidic ELISA platform can be used for rapid affinity evaluation of monoclonal anti-S1 antibodies. The microfluidic ELISA device is highly portable and requires less than 10 μL of samples for each channel. Therefore, our technology will greatly facilitate rapid and quantitative analysis of COVID-19 patients and vaccine recipients at point-of-care.","Tan, Xiaotian; Lin, Cory; Zhang, Jie; Khaing Oo, Maung Kyaw; Fan, Xudong",bioRxiv,378,16

CONCLUSION: Patients with a high viral load, of older age, and with diarrhea had a higher mortality and shorter survival time.","Li, Jin; Duan, Hui-Juan; Chen, Hao-Yang; Ji, Ying-Jie; Zhang, Xin; Rong, Yi-Hui; Xu, Zhe; Sun, Li-Jian; Zhang, Ji-Yuan; Liu, Li-Ming; Jin, Bo; Zhang, Jian; Du, Ning; Su, Hai-Bin; Teng, Guang-Ju; Yuan, Yue; Qin, En-Qiang; Jia, Hong-Jun; Wang, Shu; Guo, Tong-Sheng; Wang, Ye; Mu, Jin-Song; Yan, Tao; Li, Zhi-Wei; Dong, Zheng; Nie, Wei-Min; Jiang, Tian-Jun; Li, Chen; Gao, Xu-Dong; Ji, Dong; Zhuang, Ying-Jie; Li, Lei; Wang, Li-Fu; Li, Wen-Gang; Duan, Xue-Zhang; Lu, Yin-Ying; Sun, Zhi-Qiang; Kanu, Alex B.J.; Koroma, Sheku M.; Zhao, Min; Ji, Jun-Sheng; Wang, Fu-Sheng",Int J Infect Dis,378,30

In addition, the mechanisms causing these perturbations have not been fully elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to assess acid–base changes in puppies suffering from CPV enteritis, using a modified strong ion model (SIM). The hypothesis of the study was that severe acid–base disturbances would be present and that the SIM would provide insights into pathological mechanisms, which have not been fully appreciated by the Henderson–Hasselbalch model. The study analysed retrospective data, obtained from 42 puppies with confirmed CPV enteritis and 10 healthy control dogs. The CPV-enteritis group had been allocated a clinical score, to allow classification of the data according to clinical severity. The effects of changes in free water, chloride, l-lactate, albumin and phosphate were calculated, using a modification of the base excess algorithm. When the data were summated for each patient, and correlated to each individual component, the most important contributor to the metabolic acid–base changes, according to the SIM, was chloride (P < 0.001). Severely-affected animals tended to demonstrate hypochloraemic alkalosis, whereas mildly-affected puppies had a hyperchloraemic acidosis (P = 0.007). In conclusion, the acid–base disturbances in CPV enteritis are multifactorial and complex, with the SIM providing information in terms of the origin of these changes.","Burchell, Richard K.; Schoeman, Johan P.; Leisewitz, Andrew L.",Vet J,378,16

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the virus surface. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients suffering from stroke are particularly susceptible to severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus forming a defined risk group. However, a mechanistic explanation for this finding is lacking. Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce lymphocytopenia and systemic inflammation that might modulate the expression levels of surface proteins in distant organs. Whether systemic inflammation following stroke can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in the lung has not been investigated. Methods Mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min and sacrificed after 24 h and 72 h for analysis of brain and lung tissues. Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1β were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results Strikingly, 24 h after stroke, we observed a substantial increase in the expression of ACE2 both on the transcriptional and protein levels in the lungs of MCAO mice compared to sham-operated mice. This increased expression persisted until day 3 after stroke. In addition, MCAO increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β in the lungs. Higher gene expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β was found in ischemic brain hemispheres and a reduced number of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression. Conclusions We demonstrate significantly augmented ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke. These pre-clinical findings might explain the clinical observation that patients with pre-existing stroke represent a high-risk group for the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our studies call for further investigations into the underlying signaling mechanisms and possible therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: In Italy, a strict lockdown was imposed from 8 March 2020 to stop the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). PURPOSE: To explore the effect of this lockdown on data transmitted by remote monitoring (RM) of implantable cardioverter and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (ICDs/CRT-Ds). METHODS: RM daily transmissions from ICDs and CRT-Ds were analyzed and compared in two consecutive 1-month frames pre- and post-lockdown: Period I (7 February–7 March 2020) and Period II (8 March–7 April 2020). RESULTS: The study cohort included 180 patients (81.1% male, 63.3% ICDs and 36.7% CRT-Ds) with a median age of 70 (interquartile range 62-78) years. The median value of physical activity provided by accelerometric sensors showed a significant reduction between Period I and II (13.1% [8.2-18.1%] versus 9.4% [6.3-13.8%], p < 0.001]. Eighty-nine percent of patients decreased their activity, for 43.3% the relative reduction was ≥25%. The mean heart rate decreased significantly (69.2 [63.8-75.6] bpm vs 67.9 [62.7- 75.3] bpm, p < 0.001), but with greater reduction (≈3 beats/minute) in patients aged < 70 years. Resting heart rate and thoracic impedance showed minor variations. No differences were observed in device pacing percentages and arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: In cardiac patients, the lockdown imposed to contain COVID-19 outbreak significantly reduced the amount of physical activity and the mean heart rate. These side effects of in-home confinement quarantine should be taken in consideration for frail patients.","Mascioli, G; Lucca, E; Napoli, P; Giacopelli, D",Europace,378,16

Currently, it has been reported that some comorbidities are linked with an increased rate of severity and mortality among COVID-19 patients. To assess the role of comorbidity in COVID-19 progression, we performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis on the relationship of COVID-19 severity with 8 different underlying diseases. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI were searched for articles investigating the prevalence of comorbidities in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. A total of 41 studies comprising 12,526 patients were included. RESULTS: Prevalence of some commodities was lower than that in general population such as hypertension (19% vs 23.2%), diabetes (9% vs 10.9%), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (2% vs 9.5%), chronic liver diseases (CLD) (3% vs 24.8%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (3% vs 8.6%), while some others including cancer (1% vs 0.6%), cardiovascular disease (6% vs 1.8%) and cerebrovascular disease (2% vs 0.9%) exhibited greater percentage in COVID-19. Cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.70, 95%CI 2.51–5.45) was found to be the strongest risk factor in disease exacerbation, followed by CKD (OR = 3.60, 95%CI 2.18–5.94), COPD (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 2.35–4.19), cardiovascular disease (OR = 2.76, 95% CI 2.18–3.49), malignancy (OR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.75–3.95), diabetes (OR = 2.49, 95% CI 2.10–2.96) and hypertension (OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.81–2.51). We found no correlation between CLD and increased disease severity (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 0.96–1.82). CONCLUSION: The impact of all eight underlying diseases on COVID-19 deterioration seemed to be higher in patients outside Hubei. Based on different comorbidities, COVID-19 patients tend to be at risk of developing poor outcomes to a varying degree. Thus, tailored infection prevention and monitoring and treatment strategies targeting these high-risk subgroups might improve prognosis during the COVID-19 pandemic.
