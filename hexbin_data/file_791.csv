58561,A Tertiary Care Centre Experience on the Management of Paediatric Tracheobronchial Foreign Body During the COVID 19 Pandemic,2021-10-05,This essay contrasts Nietzsche’s remarks on elite education with W.E.B. Du Bois’ demand for democratized education. The essay takes their remarks as springboards for a twenty-first century philosophy of education rather than an historical account of their philosophies. Both thinkers cultivated Kant and Hegel’s dream that the spirit of freedom guided by reason would unite all the world’s peoples. Both held that education was key to realizing the dream. Their judgments about qualifying for education separated them. Nietzsche insisted that only the elite should receive the fullest measure of education. Du Bois believed that in the future virtually every human being would receive a university-level education. The essay’s principal point is to show how contemporary technology can make Du Bois’ dream a reality. An African philosopher’s working model demonstrates a path to universal university education.,"Verharen, Charles C.",Stud Philos Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8490138/,791
61387,Evolving Nurse Leadership Role in 2020.,2020-12-01,"Rhesus macaque is a unique nonhuman primate model for human evolutionary and translational study, but the error-prone gene models critically limit its applications. Here, we de novo defined full-length macaque gene models based on single molecule, long-read transcriptome sequencing in four macaque tissues (frontal cortex, cerebellum, heart and testis). Overall, 8 588 227 poly(A)-bearing complementary DNA reads with a mean length of 14 106 nt were generated to compile the backbone of macaque transcripts, with the fine-scale structures further refined by RNA sequencing and cap analysis gene expression sequencing data. In total, 51 605 macaque gene models were accurately defined, covering 89.7% of macaque or 75.7% of human orthologous genes. Based on the full-length gene models, we performed a human-macaque comparative analysis on polyadenylation (PA) regulation. Using macaque and mouse as outgroup species, we identified 79 distal PA events newly originated in humans and found that the strengthening of the distal PA sites, rather than the weakening of the proximal sites, predominantly contributes to the origination of these human-specific isoforms. Notably, these isoforms are selectively constrained in general and contribute to the temporospatially specific reduction of gene expression, through the tinkering of previously existed mechanisms of nuclear retention and microRNA (miRNA) regulation. Overall, the protocol and resource highlight the application of bioinformatics in integrating multilayer genomics data to provide an intact reference for model animal studies, and the isoform switching detected may constitute a hitherto underestimated regulatory layer in shaping the human-specific transcriptome and phenotypic changes.","Li, Yumei; Shen, Qing Sunny; Peng, Qi; Ding, Wanqiu; Zhang, Jie; Zhong, Xiaoming; An, Ni A; Ji, Mingjun; Zhou, Wei-Zhen; Li, Chuan-Yun",Briefings in bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973996/,791
65245,Characteristics of Patients Presenting with COVID-19 from Balochistan Province and Lessons Learnt.,2021-07-01,"Today, tremendous attention has been devoted to a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV), due to severe effects on the global public in all over the world. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of 2019-nCoV are important for early treatment and cutting off epidemic transmission. In this regard, laboratory detection protocols, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and computed tomography (CT) examination, have been utilized broadly for 2019-nCoV detection. Recently, nano-based methods for 2019-nCoV diagnoses are rapidly expanding and declaring comparable results with PCR and CT. In this review, recent advances in nano-based techniques have been highlighted and compared briefly with PCR and CT as well-known methods for 2019-nCoV detection.","Rahimkhoei, Vahid; Rezaie, Jafar; Akbari, Ali; Nourani, Aynaz; Jabbari, Nassrollah; Lighvan, Zohreh Mehri; Amini, Mojtaba",Cell biochemistry and function,https://doi.org/10.1002/cbf.3606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33319383/,791

While the methodology aims to foster partnerships throughout all phases, the literature suggests that in the field of mental health some phases are often completed without participant involvement. AIMS This paper elaborates on how the PhotoVoice method was used to engage service users and family members around their experience of involvement in a co-produced and co-facilitated mental health education intervention, in order to enhance public and policy makers knowledge of the project. METHODS Ten participants were recruited and trained in the PhotoVoice method. Participants documented, through photography, their experiences of involvement in the education intervention. Following this, participants came together to co-produce and disseminate the photography exhibition to the public. RESULTS PhotoVoice proved to be a flexible and creative method by which to include marginalized groups. By adhering to the collaborative principles of the methodology, service users and family members can retain decision making power from the project's inception to its conclusion. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE PhotoVoice is ideal for use within mental health nursing as it coincides with the recovery principle of promoting collaborative partnership between service users, family members and clinicians.","Barry, Jennifer; Monahan, Christine; Monahan, Mark; Murphy, Rebecca; Ferguson, Sharon; Lee, Kelley; Bennett, Anna; Gibbons, Patrick; Higgins, Agnes",Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141981/,791
71804,The Rapid COVID Screening (RCS) Tool.,2020-06-01,"The objective of the study was to assess the knowledge and perception of COVID-19 and relevant universal safety measures among the Nepalese population. A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Nepalese adults from March 29 to April 07, 2020. A 13- and 15- items structured questionnaire assessed the COVID-19 related knowledge and perception of the universal safety measure. Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test evaluated the differences in knowledge between the groups. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 21.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). Of the 884 surveys accessed, a total of 871 consented (electronically) and completed the online survey (response rate 98.52%). The median knowledge score of the participants was 10.0 (± 3.0 IQR). Although participants' overall knowledge score was high, only about half of the participants knew about the concept of quarantine and the ideal distance to be maintained between individuals to prevent the transmission. Though the majority of the participants had positive perception towards universal safety measure of COVID-19, about 18% perceived that coronavirus infected only older people, 11% opined that the infection was highly fatal with no chances of survival and 70% considered that limiting consumptions of poultry and meat would prevent the spread of COVID-19. A statistically significant difference in knowledge was noted by participants' age, educational status, occupational type, and household monthly income. This study found optimal knowledge and perception of universal safety measures of COVID-19 among the Nepalese population, but misinformation and misunderstanding prevailed.","Singh, Devendra Raj; Sunuwar, Dev Ram; Karki, Kshitij; Ghimire, Saruna; Shrestha, Naveen",Journal of community health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00839-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410756/,791
74229,Evolving Otolaryngology Resident Roles and Concerns at the Peak of the US COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-09-14,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric illness that results in an increased risk for a variety of inflammatory diseases. The exact etiology of this increased risk is unknown, and thus, several animal models have been developed to investigate the neuroimmune interactions of PTSD. Repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) is an established preclinical model of psychological trauma that recapitulates certain behavioral and inflammatory aspects of human PTSD. Furthermore, RSDS has been utilized to subgroup animals into susceptible and resilient populations based on one specific behavioral phenotype (i.e., social interaction). Herein, we conducted an extensive investigation of circulating inflammatory proteins after RSDS and found significant elevations in various cytokines and chemokines after exposure to RSDS. When categorizing animals into either susceptible or resilient populations based on social interaction, we found no inflammatory or other behavioral differences between these subgroups. Furthermore, correlative analyses found no significant correlation between social interaction parameters and inflammation. In contrast, parameters from the elevated zero maze (EZM) demonstrated significant associations and clustering to 5 circulating cytokines. When animals were subdivided into susceptible and resilient populations solely based upon combined EZM performance, significant inflammatory differences were evident between these groups. Strikingly, these circulating inflammatory proteins displayed a stronger predictive ability of EZM performance compared to social interaction test performance. These findings provide new insights into inflammatory markers associated with RSDS, and the utility of EZM to effectively group RSDS-exposed mice into populations with differential levels of peripheral inflammation.","Elkhatib, Safwan K; Moshfegh, Cassandra M; Watson, Gabrielle F; Case, Adam J","Brain, behavior, and immunity",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.08.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890698/,791
78808,Student-Centred or Teacher-Centred: Promises and Pitfalls of Online Medical Education.,2021-09-01,"One of harm reduction's most salient features is its pragmatism. Harm reduction purports to distinguish itself from dominant prohibitionist and abstinence-based policy paradigms by being grounded in what is realistic, in contrast with the moralism or puritanism of prohibition and abstention. This is reflected in the meme ""harm reduction works"", popular both in institutional and grassroots settings. The idea that harm reduction is realistic and effective has meant different things among the main actors who seek to shape harm reduction policy. Drawing on scholarly literature about harm reduction, as well as examples from recent harm reduction advocacy efforts in relation to drug policy in Canada, this paper argues that harm reduction distinguishes itself through a unique ""way of knowing"". Grassroots harm reduction advocates, particularly as they argue through human rights frameworks, do more than simply make claims for the provision of particular services-like needle exchange, safe consumption sites, safe supply and the like-on the basis that these are realistic paths toward the health and well-being of people who use drugs. Rather, as they marshal lived experience in support of these policy changes through peer-driven initiatives in contexts of prohibition, they make particular claims about what constitute valid, methodologically rigorous evidence bases for action in contexts where policies to date have been driven by ideology and have developed in ways that have excluded and marginalized those most affected from policymaking. In doing so, they advocate for the centrality of people who use drugs not only in policy-making processes, but in evidence production itself.","Klein, Alana",Health care analysis : HCA : journal of health philosophy and policy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10728-020-00406-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079317/,791

91364,High Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratios in Symptomatic Pediatric COVID-19 Patients.,2021-07-01,"Electrical impedance tomography is clinically used to trace ventilation related changes in electrical conductivity of lung tissue. Estimating regional pulmonary perfusion using electrical impedance tomography is still a matter of research. To support clinical decision making, reliable bedside information of pulmonary perfusion is needed. We introduce a method to robustly detect pulmonary perfusion based on indicator-enhanced electrical impedance tomography and validate it by dynamic multidetector computed tomography in two experimental models of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The acute injury was induced in a sublobar segment of the right lung by saline lavage or endotoxin instillation in eight anesthetized mechanically ventilated pigs. For electrical impedance tomography measurements, a conductive bolus (10% saline solution) was injected into the right ventricle during breath hold. Electrical impedance tomography perfusion images were reconstructed by linear and normalized Gauss-Newton reconstruction on a finite element mesh with subsequent element-wise signal and feature analysis. An iodinated contrast agent was used to compute pulmonary blood flow via dynamic multidetector computed tomography. Spatial perfusion was estimated based on first-pass indicator dilution for both electrical impedance and multidetector computed tomography and compared by Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. Strong correlation was found in dorsoventral (r = 0.92) and in right-to-left directions (r = 0.85) with good limits of agreement of 8.74% in eight lung segments. With a robust electrical impedance tomography perfusion estimation method, we found strong agreement between multidetector computed and electrical impedance tomography perfusion in healthy and regionally injured lungs and demonstrated feasibility of electrical impedance tomography perfusion imaging.","Kircher, Michael; Elke, Gunnar; Stender, Birgit; Mesa, Maria Hernandez; Schuderer, Felix; Dossel, Olaf; Fuld, Matthew K; Halaweish, Ahmed F; Hoffman, Eric A; Weiler, Norbert; Frerichs, Inez",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2020.3025080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32956046/,791

93593,COVID19: A Matter of State and Faith.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND Cimicifuga rhizome, Meliae cortex, Coptidis rhizome and Phellodendron cortex have been previously shown to exhibit anti-coronavirus activity. Here, an additional 19 traditional medicinal herbal extracts were evaluated for antiviral activities in vitro. METHODS A plaque assay was used to evaluate the effects of 19 extracts, and the concentration of extract required to inhibit 50% of the replication (EC(50)) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 strain (MHV-A59) was determined. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) of each extract was also determined. Northern and western blot analyses were conducted to evaluate antiviral activity on viral entry, viral RNA and protein expression, and release in MHV-infected DBT cells. RESULTS Sophorae radix, Acanthopanacis cortex and Torilis fructus reduced intracellular viral RNA levels with comparable reductions in viral proteins and MHV-A59 production. The extracts also reduced the replication of the John Howard Mueller strain of MHV, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus and vesicular stomatitis virus in vitro. Sanguisorbae radix reduced coronavirus production, partly as a result of decreased protein synthesis, but without a significant reduction in intracellular viral RNA levels. The EC(50) values of the four extracts ranged from 0.8 to 3.7 microg/ml, whereas the CC(50) values ranged from 156.5 to 556.8 microg/ml. Acanthopanacis cortex and Torilis fructus might exert their antiviral activities in MHV-A59-infected cells by inducing cyclooxygenase-2 expression via the activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and p38 or ERK alone, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Sophorae radix, Acanthopanacis cortex, Sanguisorbae radix and Torilis fructus might be considered as promising novel anti-coronavirus drug candidates.","Kim, Hye-Young; Eo, Eun-Young; Park, Hyun; Kim, Youn-Chul; Park, Sun; Shin, Ho-Joon; Kim, Kyongmin",Antiviral therapy,https://doi.org/10.3851/imp1615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20710051/,791
97587,Atherosclerotic Diseases Championing Death Toll: Instituting Pediatric Hyperlipidemia Screening Programme.,2020-11-01,"The calibration method based on integrated modeling with intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is widely used for star sensors. However, the unified optimization of parameters results in the coupling between intrinsic and extrinsic parameters in this method, further influencing the calibration accuracy of the intrinsic parameters and causing certain limitations for the practical applications involving precise extrinsic parameters. A novel calibration method for star sensors with separation of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is proposed in this paper to solve the issue. Firstly, the coupling form of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters in the integrated calibration model is analyzed, and the coupling degree is analyzed through the partial correlation coefficient (PCC). Then, on the basis of the analysis results, combined with the applications of star sensors in satellites and missiles, the extrinsic parameters coupled with the intrinsic parameters are separated individually, and the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters without coupling are optimized nonlinearly as a whole. The experimental results verify the validity of the proposed method.","Fan, Qiaoyun; He, Kangkang; Wang, Gangyi",Optics express,https://doi.org/10.1364/oe.396996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680176/,791

108932,Call to Thwart XDR Typhoid: Beyond Futile Efforts.,2021-06-01,"OBJECTIVEParaclinoid aneurysms represent approximately 5% of intracranial aneurysms (Drake et al. [1968]). Visual impairment, which occurs in 16%-40% of patients, is among the most common presentations of these aneurysms (Day [1990], Lai and Morgan [2013], Sahlein et al. [2015], and Silva et al. [2017]). Flow-diverting stents, such as the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED), are increasingly used to treat these aneurysms, in part because of their theoretical reduction of mass effect (Fiorella et al. [2009]). Limited data on paraclinoid aneurysms treated with a PED exist, and few studies have compared outcomes of patients after PED placement with those of patients after clipping or coiling.METHODSThe authors performed a retrospective analysis of 115 patients with an aneurysm of the cavernous to ophthalmic segments of the internal carotid artery treated with clipping, coiling, or PED deployment between January 2011 and March 2017. Postoperative complications were defined as new neurological deficit, aneurysm rupture, recanalization, or other any operative complication that required reintervention.RESULTSA total of 125 paraclinoid aneurysms in 115 patients were treated, including 70 with PED placement, 23 with coiling, and 32 with clipping. Eighteen (14%) aneurysms were ruptured. The mean aneurysm size was 8.2 mm, and the mean follow-up duration was 18.4 months. Most aneurysms were discovered incidentally, but visual impairment, which occurred in 21 (18%) patients, was the most common presenting symptom. Among these patients, 15 (71%) experienced improvement in their visual symptoms after treatment, including 14 (93%) of these 15 patients who were treated with PED deployment. Complete angiographic occlusion was achieved in 89% of the patients. Complications were seen in 17 (15%) patients, including 10 (16%) after PED placement, 2 (9%) after coiling, and 5 (17%) after clipping. Patients with incomplete aneurysm occlusion had a higher rate of procedural complications than those with complete occlusion (p = 0.02). The rate of postoperative visual improvement was significantly higher among patients treated with PED deployment than in those treated with coiling (p = 0.01). The significant predictors of procedural complications were incomplete occlusion (p = 0.03), hypertension, (p = 0.04), and diabetes (p = 0.03).CONCLUSIONSIn a large series in which patient outcomes after treatment of paraclinoid aneurysms were compared, the authors found a high rate of aneurysm occlusion and a comparable rate of procedural complications among patients treated with PED placement compared with the rates among those who underwent clipping or coiling. For patients who presented with visual symptoms, those treated with PED placement had the highest rate of visual improvement. The results of this study suggest that the PED is an effective and safe modality for treating paraclinoid aneurysms, especially for patients who present with visual symptoms.","Silva, Michael A; See, Alfred P; Khandelwal, Priyank; Mahapatra, Ashutosh; Frerichs, Kai U; Du, Rose; Patel, Nirav J; Aziz-Sultan, Mohammad A",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2018.1.jns171774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29932380/,791

The present study aimed to perform a survival analysis according to the patients' QOL to elucidate its impact on survival. METHODS Patients with GOO who underwent either palliative gastrectomy or gastrojejunostomy were included in this study. A validated QOL instrument (EQ-5D) was used to assess QOL at baseline and 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months following surgical palliation. Postoperative improvement in oral intake was also evaluated using the GOO scoring system (GOOSS). Thereafter, univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed to determine independent prognostic factors. RESULTS The median survival time of the 104 patients included herein was 11.30 months. Patients who received postoperative chemotherapy, PS 0/1, baseline EQ-5D ≥ 0.75, improved or stable EQ-5D, and improved oral intake expressed as GOOSS = 3 had significantly better survival. Multivariate analysis identified postoperative chemotherapy, a better baseline PS, a better baseline EQ5D, improved or stable EQ5D scores, and improved oral intake 3 months after surgical palliation as independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSION Apart from preoperative PS and postoperative chemotherapy, the present study identified better baseline QOL, improvement in postoperative QOL, and improvement in oral intake as prognostic factors among patients who underwent palliative surgery for advanced gastric cancer with GOO.","Terashima, Masanori; Fujitani, Kazumasa; Ando, Masahiko; Sakamaki, Kentaro; Kawabata, Ryohei; Ito, Yuichi; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Kondo, Masato; Kodera, Yasuhiro; Kaji, Masahide; Oka, Yoshio; Imamura, Hiroshi; Kawada, Junji; Takagane, Akinori; Shimada, Hideaki; Tanizawa, Yutaka; Yamanaka, Takeharu; Morita, Satoshi; Ninomiya, Motoki; Yoshida, Kazuhiro",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-020-01114-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789710/,791

METHOD Patients who underwent LADG at the Cancer Institute Hospital between April 2006 and October 2008 were recruited for this study. Early surgical outcomes were compared between patients who underwent complete D2 dissection (complete D2 group; n = 42) and those who underwent D1 + beta dissection (D1 + beta group; n = 179) to determine the feasibility of laparoscopic D2 lymph node dissection. RESULTS In complete D2 group, the operation time was longer (253 +/- 10 vs 224 +/- 4 min; P = 0.005), and the number of retrieved lymph nodes was larger (41 +/- 2 vs 35 +/- 1; P = 0.002) compared with those in D1 + beta group. The other early surgical outcomes monitored for the two groups were not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS LADG with complete D2 lymph node dissection can be performed safely if the procedure is standardized and an experienced laparoscopic surgeon performs the surgery.

According to the WHO reports, murder is fourth leading cause of death among young people. The aim of this study was applying joint point regression model to study trend of homicide mortality in Iran, 2006-2016. STUDY DESIGN A cross-sectional panel (pseudo-panel) study. METHODS Homicide data during 2006 to 2016 were extracted from Iranian legal medicine organization. Trends of homicide incidence were summarized by annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC) using non-linear segmented regression model. RESULTS Totally, 26918 homicide cases occurred during the period from 2006 to 2016. The highest and lowest frequency was related to the 15-29 yr (46.5%) and 0-4 yr (1.5%) age groups, respectively. The homicide incidence rate of the country in 2016 was 2.81 per 100,000. The four provinces of Sistan & Baluchistan, Khuzestan, Kerman and Ilam had the highest incidence rate in 2016, respectively. During the study period, the incidence rate of homicide in Iran and men have been significantly decreased (APC: -2.8% (95% CI: -3.9, -1.7) and -3.2% (95% CI: - 4.5, -1.8) respectively (P<0.001)). CONCLUSION The pattern of homicide rate has a downward trend in the country. Moreover, the varying observed trends in some provinces can be due to the variability in mental, geographical, socio-economic and cultural conditions in each region.","Nazari Kangavari, Hajar; Barzegar, Abdolrazagh; Mirtorabi, Seyed Davood; Ghadirzadeh, Mohammad Reza; Forouzesh, Mehdi; Taherpour, Niloufar; Shahbazi, Fatemeh; Hashemi Nazari, Seyed Saeed",Journal of research in health sciences,https://doi.org/10.34172/jrhs.2020.12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814698/,791
136606,Therapeutic challenges in radiation-induced salivary gland cancers.,2020-12-29,"OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of an institution-wide infection control education program on the rate of transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). DESIGN Before-and-after study. SETTING A 472-bed, urban, university-affiliated hospital.Intervention. During the period March-May 2004, all hospital staff completed a mandatory infection control education program, including the receipt of hospital-specific MRSA data and case-based practice with additional precautions. OUTCOME MEASURE The rate of nosocomial MRSA acquisition was calculated as the number of cases of nosocomial MRSA acquisition per 100 days that a person with MRSA colonization or infection detected at admission is present in the hospital (""admission MRSA"" exposure-days) for 3 time periods: June 2002-February 2003 (before the Toronto outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]), June 2003-February 2004 (after the outbreak of SARS), and June 2004-February 2005 (after education). A case of nosocomial acquisition of MRSA colonization or infection represented a patient first identified as colonized or infected more than 72 hours after admission or at admission after a previous hospitalization. RESULTS The rate of nosocomial acquisition of MRSA colonization or infection was 8.8 cases per 100 admission MRSA exposure-days for the period before SARS, 3.8 cases per 100 admission MRSA exposure-days for the period after SARS (P<.001 for before SARS vs after SARS), and 1.9 cases per 100 admission MRSA exposure-days for the period after education (P=.02 for after education vs before education). The volume of alcohol-based handrub purchased was apparently stable, with 4,010 L during fiscal year 2003-2004 (April 2003-March 2004) compared with 3,780 L during fiscal year 2004-2005. The observed rate of compliance with hand washing did not change significantly (40.9% during education vs 44.2% after education; P=.23).

One such entity is takotsubo cardiomyopathy. We sought to review the various cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy reported during the COVID-19 pandemic and consolidate the information available on its clinical features, evaluation and treatment. We performed a PubMed search using the MeSH terms ""Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy"" or ""Stress Cardiomyopathy"" and ""COVID-19"", and identified 16 case reports, two case series, and one retrospective cohort study. There was a total of 24 reported patients with COVID-19 infection, who developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and two patients without COVID-19 who developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to the emotional stress associated with the global pandemic. The mean age of the patients was 67.19 years (SD 15.83) and 16(59.3%) were women. Chest pain was reported in only ten patients (38.46 %) and ST-elevation was seen in 11 patients (42.3%). While most patients had typical takotsubo cardiomyopathy, four patients had inverted(reverse) takotsubo cardiomyopathy, two had bi-ventricular involvement, one had median takotsubo and another had global takotsubo with apical sparing variant. Most patients had a positive outcome with complete or near-complete reversal of cardiac dysfunction at the time of discharge. Five deaths (19.23%) were reported. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a rare, but increasingly reported reversible cardiomyopathy that can be seen in patients with COVID-19 infection and the diagnosis must be actively sought for in these patients.","John, Kevin; Lal, Amos; Mishra, Ajay",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2021.1710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759445/,791

With multiple mechanisms for genetic variability, they are successful conformists, adapting to changes in their habitat. The evolution of polioviruses may occur with generation of point mutations followed by genetic drift and selection. The mutation rate of polioviruses based on several studies is approximately 3 × 10(-2) mutations/synonymous site/year in the gene encoding viral protein 1. Genetic variation in polioviruses may also be increased by sharing of genetic data of two different poliovirus lineages by means of homologous recombination. According to the current view, recombination is considered usually to occur by strand-switching, but a non-replicative model has also been described. In recombination, polioviruses may either gain a set of advantageous mutations selected and fixed in previous generations of the parental viruses or get rid of deleterious ones. The prerequisites and constraints of the evolution mechanisms will be discussed. Furthermore, consequences of poliovirus evolution will be reviewed in the light of observations made on currently circulating polioviruses. We will also describe how polioviruses strike back: as wild type polioviruses approach eradication, vaccine derived strains increase their occurrence and genetic variability.","Savolainen-Kopra, Carita; Blomqvist, Soile",Reviews in medical virology,https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20949639/,791

Participants in 8 Italian CF centers with a prescription of dry-powder antibiotic choose whether to be supervised at home (PT-FU) or not (non-PT-FU), in adjunct to routine clinic visits. PTs assisted participants with their inhaled therapies regimen and reviewed the airway clearance program in use. Mixed-effect regression models were fitted to evaluate the variation of selected endpoints over time. A total of 163 participants were included. Lung function declined over time in both groups, at higher extent in the non-PT-FU group at 6 months (-1.8, 95%CI: -4.4 to 0.7 % predicted), without reaching statistical significance, whereas in the PT-FU group only, nearly one visit less was recorded (p=0.027). Regardless the type of supervision adopted, the number of antibiotic courses did not change compared to the previous year. We counted 19/90 (21.1%) drop-out in the PT-FU, double compared to the group followed up at the clinics (p=0.065).

It offers different solutions and has shown effectiveness in managing many psychological issues. Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has critically influenced health care systems and health care workers (HCWs). HCWs are working under hard conditions, and are suffering from different psychological issues, including anxiety, stress, and depression. Consequently, there is an undeniable need of mental care interventions for HCWs. Under the circumstances caused by COVID-19, e-health interventions can be used as tools to assist HCWs with their mental health. These solutions can provide mental health care support remotely, respecting the recommended safety measures. Materials and Methods: This study aims to identify e-mental health interventions, reported in the literature, that are developed for HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA protocol by searching the following digital libraries: IEEE, ACM, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and PubMed. Results and Discussion: Eleven publications were selected. The identified e-mental health interventions consisted of social media platforms, e-learning content, online resources and mobile applications. Only 27% of the studies included empirical evaluation of the reported interventions, 55% listed challenges and limitations related to the adoption of the reported interventions. And 45% presented interventions developed specifically for HCWs in China. The overall feedback on the identified interventions was positive, yet a lack of empirical evaluation was identified, especially regarding qualitative evidence. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance and need for e-mental health solutions for HCWs.","Drissi, Nidal; Ouhbi, Sofia; Marques, Gonçalo; de la Torre Díez, Isabel; Ghogho, Mounir; Janati Idrissi, Mohammed Abdou",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970532/,791
183321,[Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system : brief history and questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic].,2020,"Measles virus (MeV) is the most contagious human virus, but we do not fully understand why. Unlike most respiratory viruses, MeV does not infect the airway epithelium immediately. MeV traverses the epithelium within immune cells that carry it to lymphatic organs where amplification occurs. Infected immune cells then synchronously deliver large amounts of virus to the airways. However, our understanding of MeV replication in airway epithelia is limited. To model it, we use well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells (HAE) from lung donors. In HAE, MeV spreads directly cell-to-cell forming infectious centers that grow for ∼3-5 days, are stable for a few days, and then disappear. Transepithelial electrical resistance remains intact during the entire course of HAE infection, thus we hypothesized that MeV infectious centers may slough off while preserving epithelial function. After documenting by confocal microscopy that infectious centers progressively detach from HAE, we recovered apical washes and separated cell-associated from cell-free virus by centrifugation. Virus titers were about 10 times higher in the cell-associated fraction than in the supernatant. In sloughed infectious centers, ciliary beating persisted and apoptotic markers were not readily detected, suggesting that they retain functional metabolism. Cell-associated MeV infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, modeling the first stage of infection in a new host. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified wound healing, cell growth, and cell differentiation as biological processes relevant for infectious center sloughing. 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining located proliferating cells underneath infectious centers. Thus, cells located below infectious centers divide and differentiate to repair the extruded infected epithelial patch. As an extension of these studies, we postulate that expulsion of infectious centers through coughing and sneezing could contribute to MeV’s strikingly high reproductive number by allowing the virus to survive longer in the environment and by delivering a high infectious dose to the next host. AUTHOR SUMMARY Measles virus (MeV) is a respiratory pathogen that infects millions worldwide each year. Although sometimes mischaracterized as an innocuous childhood disease, measles remains a leading cause of death for children under five. MeV is the most contagious human virus and requires vaccination rates above 90% to maintain herd immunity. Global decreases in vaccination rates over the past ten years contributed to recent, widespread MeV outbreaks. We uncover here a novel mechanism by which MeV exits the human airways that may explain why it is much more contagious than other viruses. We document that infected cells containing cell-associated virus slough en masse from the airway epithelial sheet. These expelled infectious centers are metabolically active and can transmit infection to primary human monocyte-derived macrophages more efficiently than cell-free virus particles. Thus, cell-associated MeV can transmit host-to-host, a new paradigm for efficient respiratory virus transmission.","Hippee, Camilla E.; Singh, Brajesh K.; Thurman, Andrew L.; Cooney, Ashley L.; Pezzulo, Alejandro A.; Cattaneo, Roberto; Sinn, Patrick L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.09.434554,791

Methods Nitazoxanide is a mild uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, which is modulating the ATP production in cells. ATP is an essential component of viral replication, and we have evaluated the effect of tizoxanide (TIZ), the active circulating metabolite of NTZ, on ATP in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and in MDCK cells infected with influenza A and B viruses. Results TIZ decreased cellular ATP in a dose-dependent manner in MDCK cells and in MDCK cells infected with influenza A and B viruses. Maximum inhibition of ATP in influenza infected or uninfected MDCK cells reached up to 45% after 6 and 24 hours of exposure to 100µM TIZ. The decrease in cellular ATP did not affect cell viability and was reversible after eliminating TIZ from the culture. Conclusion The concentrations of TIZ required to decrease cellular ATP levels were similar to those reported to inhibit replication of influenza A and B viruses in our laboratory. A decrease in ATP triggers activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which is known to suppress the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate the effect of TIZ on mitochondrial function.","Rossignol, J.F.; Tijsma, A.S.L.; van Baalen, C.A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.30.454324,791

Electron microscopy suggested that HCV infection induces autophagic vacuole formation in IHH. Fluorescence microscopy displayed localization of autophagic markers, microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3 and Apg5, on the vacuoles of HCV-infected hepatocytes.

195486,[The first wave of COVID-19 in Intensive care].,2020,"Analyses of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected macrophage-derived J774.1 cell line showed activation of two MAPKs, p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Activation of MAPKs was evident by 6 h postinfection. However, UV-irradiated MHV failed to activate MAPKs, which demonstrated that MHV replication was necessary for their activation. Several other MHV-permissive cell lines also showed activation of both p38 MAPK and JNK, which indicated that the MHV-induced stress-kinase activation was not restricted to any particular cell type. The upstream kinase responsible for activating MHV-induced p38 MAPK was the MAPK kinase 3. Experiments with a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB 203580, demonstrated that MHV-induced p38 MAPK activation resulted in the accumulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNAs and an increase in the production of IL-6, regardless of MHV-induced general host protein synthesis inhibition. Furthermore, MHV production was suppressed in SB 203580-treated cells, demonstrating that activated p38 MAPK played a role in MHV replication. The reduced MHV production in SB 203580-treated cells was, at least in part, due to a decrease in virus-specific protein synthesis and virus-specific mRNA accumulation. Interestingly, there was a transient increase in the amount of phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in infected cells, and this eIF4E phosphorylation was p38 MAPK dependent; it is known that phosphorylated eIF4E enhances translation rates of cap-containing mRNAs. Furthermore, the upstream kinase responsible for eIF4E phosphorylation, MAPK-interacting kinase 1, was also phosphorylated and activated in response to MHV infection. Our data suggested that host cells, in response to MHV replication, activated p38 MAPK, which subsequently phosphorylated eIF4E to efficiently translate certain host proteins, including IL-6, during virus-induced severe host protein synthesis inhibition. MHV utilized this p38 MAPK-dependent increase in eIF4E phosphorylation to promote virus-specific protein synthesis and subsequent progeny virus production. Enhancement of virus-specific protein synthesis through virus-induced eIF4E activation has not been reported in any other viruses.","Banerjee, Sangeeta; Narayanan, Krishna; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Makino, Shinji",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12021326/,791

Both viruses caused enteritis and growth depression in SPF turkey embryos and poults. The TAstV2001 did not induce macroscopic or microscopic lesions in thymuses and bursas of embryos or poults. No macroscopic changes were observed in thymuses and bursas of embryos and poults inoculated with TAstV1987, and no statistically significant differences in bursa weight/ body weight ratios (P > 0.05) were detected.

The need to restore the assistance activity has led us to adopt new individual prophylaxis and hygiene measures. METHODS: Doctors and staff must wear dedicated clothes. Mask and gloves are mandatory for patients. A visit is scheduled every 60 minutes to allow the sanitation of the rooms. The day before the visit patients are contacted by telephone for the Covid-19 risk triage. In the presence of symptoms the visit is postponed. In the presence of other risk factors a IgG/IgM Rapid Test for Covid-19 is performed on admission to the clinic. In the presence of fever, if an extraordinary rapid test cannot be performed, the visit must be postponed. Rapid test positive patients cannot be visited: they are placed in solitary confinement at their home waiting for a nasopharyngeal swab for Covid-19. When the rapid test is positive, immediate room sanitation also occurs. The rooms dedicated to the outpatient clinic as well as medical and not medical instruments are disinfected.

This essay explores the possibility that the heightened risk may involve activation of the ""extended autonomic system"" (EAS). Traditionally, the autonomic nervous system has been viewed as consisting of the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, and the enteric nervous system. Over the past century, however, neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems have come to the fore, justifying expansion of the meaning of ""autonomic."" Additional facets include the sympathetic adrenergic system, for which adrenaline is the key effector; the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis; arginine vasopressin (synonymous with anti-diuretic hormone); the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, with angiotensin II and aldosterone the main effectors; and cholinergic anti-inflammatory and sympathetic inflammasomal pathways. A hierarchical brain network-the ""central autonomic network""-regulates these systems; embedded within it are components of the Chrousos/Gold ""stress system."" Acute, coordinated alterations in homeostatic settings (allostasis) can be crucial for surviving stressors such as traumatic hemorrhage, asphyxiation, and sepsis, which throughout human evolution have threatened homeostasis; however, intense or long-term EAS activation may cause harm. While required for appropriate responses in emergencies, EAS activation in the setting of chronically decreased homeostatic efficiencies (dyshomeostasis) may reduce thresholds for induction of destabilizing, lethal vicious cycles. Testable hypotheses derived from these concepts are that biomarkers of EAS activation correlate with clinical and pathophysiologic data and predict outcome in COVID-19 and that treatments targeting specific abnormalities identified in individual patients may be beneficial.","Goldstein, David S",Clin Auton Res,,791

Data on five air pollutants, namely, PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2, from five monitoring stations located in five regions in Jakarta (West, East, Central, North, and South Jakarta) were utilized. We analyzed the changes in the concentrations of outdoor air pollutants before lockdown from January 1 to April 9, 2020, and during lockdown from April 10 to June 4, 2020. Overall, the CO concentration (39.9%) demonstrated the most significant reduction during lockdown, followed by NO2 (7.5%) and then SO2 (5.7%).

253567,[Six cases of acute pulmonary embolism associated with COVID-19],2020,"BACKGROUND: On April 17, 2020, the State of New York (NY) implemented an Executive Order that requires all people in NY to wear a face mask or covering in public settings where social distancing cannot be maintained. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended face mask use by the general public, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of face mask policies on the spread of COVID-19 at the state level. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the Executive Order on face mask use on COVID-19 cases and mortality in NY. DESIGN: A comparative interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the impact of the Executive Order in NY with Massachusetts (MA) as a comparison state. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data on COVID-19 in NY and MA from March 25 to May 6, 2020. INTERVENTION: The Executive Order on face mask use in NY. MAIN MEASURES: Daily numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. KEY RESULTS: The average daily number of confirmed cases in NY decreased from 8549 to 5085 after the Executive Order took effect, with a trend change of 341 (95% CI, 187-496) cases per day. The average daily number of deaths decreased from 521 to 384 during the same two time periods, with a trend change of 52 (95% CI, 44-60) deaths per day. Compared to MA, the decreasing trend in NY was significantly greater for both daily numbers of confirmed cases (P = 0.003) and deaths (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The Executive Order on face mask use in NY led to a significant decrease in both daily numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Findings from this study provide important evidence to support state-level policies that require face mask use by the general public.","Li, Lihua; Liu, Bian; Liu, Shelley H; Ji, Jiayi; Li, Yan",J. gen. intern. med,,791

262011,Anosmia and the Need for COVID-19 Screening during the Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Poor housing conditions have been linked with worse health outcomes and infectious disease spread. Since the relationship of poor housing conditions with incidence and mortality of COVID-19 is unknown, we investigated the association between poor housing condition and COVID-19 incidence and mortality in US counties. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional analysis of county-level data from the US Centers for Disease Control, US Census Bureau and John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center for 3135 US counties. The exposure of interest was percentage of households with poor housing conditions (one or greater of: overcrowding, high housing cost, incomplete kitchen facilities, or incomplete plumbing facilities). Outcomes were incidence rate ratios (IRR) and mortality rate ratios (MRR) of COVID-19 across US counties through 4/21/2020. Multilevel generalized linear modeling (with total population of each county as a denominator) was utilized to estimate relative risk of incidence and mortality related to poor housing conditions with adjustment for population density and county characteristics including demographics, income, education, prevalence of medical comorbidities, access to healthcare insurance and emergency rooms, and state-level COVID-19 test density. We report incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and mortality ratios (MRRs) for a 5% increase in prevalence in households with poor housing conditions. RESULTS: Across 3135 US counties, the mean percentage of households with poor housing conditions was 14.2% (range 2.7% to 60.2%). On April 21st, the mean (SD) number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 were 255.68 (2877.03) cases and 13.90 (272.22) deaths per county, respectively. In the adjusted models standardized by county population, with each 5% increase in percent households with poor housing conditions, there was a 50% higher risk of COVID-19 incidence (IRR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.38-1.62) and a 42% higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (MRR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.25-1.61). Results remained similar using earlier timepoints (3/31/2020 and 4/10/2020). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Counties with a higher percentage of households with poor housing had higher incidence of, and mortality associated with, COVID-19. These findings suggest targeted health policies to support individuals living in poor housing conditions should be considered in further efforts to mitigate adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19.","Ahmad, Khansa; Erqou, Sebhat; Shah, Nishant; Nazir, Umair; Morrison, Alan R; Choudhary, Gaurav; Wu, Wen-Chih",PLoS One,,791
264783,A Guiding Principles Checklist for Otolaryngologic Surgery in the COVID-19 Era,2020,"The increase in online activity during the COVID 19 pandemic has generated a surge in network traffic capable of expanding the scope of DDoS attacks. Cyber criminals can now afford to launch massive DDoS attacks capable of degrading the performances of conventional machine learning based IDS models. Hence, there is an urgent need for an effective DDoS attack detective model with the capacity to handle large magnitude of DDoS attack traffic. This study proposes a deep learning based DDoS attack detection system using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The proposed model was evaluated on UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD intrusion datasets, whereby twenty-three (23) and twenty (20) attack features were extracted from UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD, respectively using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The results from the proposed model show significant improvement when compared with results from some conventional machine learning techniques such as Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with accuracies of 94.28% and 90.59% on both datasets, respectively. Furthermore, comparative analysis of LSTM with other deep learning results reported in literature justified the choice of LSTM among its deep learning peers in detecting DDoS attacks over a network. © 2021 IEEE.","Ugwu, C.

Objective: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine is an efficacious treatment for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted at 34 hospitals in the US. Adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were enrolled between April 2 and June 19, 2020, with the last outcome assessment on July 17, 2020. The planned sample size was 510 patients, with interim analyses planned after every 102 patients were enrolled. The trial was stopped at the fourth interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 479 patients. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg twice daily for 8 doses) (n = 242) or placebo (n = 237). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was clinical status 14 days after randomization as assessed with a 7-category ordinal scale ranging from 1 (death) to 7 (discharged from the hospital and able to perform normal activities). The primary outcome was analyzed with a multivariable proportional odds model, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) greater than 1.0 indicating more favorable outcomes with hydroxychloroquine than placebo. The trial included 12 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality. Results: Among 479 patients who were randomized (median age, 57 years; 44.3% female; 37.2% Hispanic/Latinx; 23.4% Black; 20.1% in the intensive care unit; 46.8% receiving supplemental oxygen without positive pressure; 11.5% receiving noninvasive ventilation or nasal high-flow oxygen; and 6.7% receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), 433 (90.4%) completed the primary outcome assessment at 14 days and the remainder had clinical status imputed. The median duration of symptoms prior to randomization was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3 to 7 days). Clinical status on the ordinal outcome scale at 14 days did not significantly differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (median [IQR] score, 6 [4-7] vs 6 [4-7]; aOR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.42]). None of the 12 secondary outcomes were significantly different between groups. At 28 days after randomization, 25 of 241 patients (10.4%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 25 of 236 (10.6%) in the placebo group had died (absolute difference, -0.2% [95% CI, -5.7% to 5.3%]; aOR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.54 to 2.09]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults hospitalized with respiratory illness from COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve clinical status at day 14. These findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.

To meaningfully inform clinicians and patients core outcome sets (COS), determined via a recognised methodology, are needed. Following our previous work that identified hearing, physical, economic and psychosocial as core areas of a future COS, the AURONET group reviewed hearing outcome measures used in existing literature and assigned them into different domains within the hearing core area. DESIGN: Scoping review. STUDY SAMPLE: Literature including hearing outcome measurements for the treatment of conductive and/or mixed hearing loss. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1434 studies, with 278 subsequently selected for inclusion. A total of 837 hearing outcome measures were reported and grouped into nine domains. The largest domain constituted pure-tone threshold measurements accounting for 65% of the total outcome measures extracted, followed by the domains of speech testing (20%) and questionnaires (9%). Studies of hearing implants more commonly included speech tests or hearing questionnaires compared with studies of middle ear surgery. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of outcome measures are currently used, highlighting the importance of developing a COS to inform individual practice and reporting in trials/research.","Hill-Feltham, Penny R; Johansson, Martin L; Hodgetts, William E; Ostevik, Amberley V; McKinnon, Brian J; Monksfield, Peter; Sockalingam, Ravi; Wright, Tracy; Tysome, James R",Int J Audiol,,791
284678,Guidance for otolaryngology health care workers performing aerosol generating medical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a public health crisis, infected millions of people, and caused a significant number of deaths. SARS-CoV-2 transmits from person to person through several routes, mainly via respiratory droplets, which makes it difficult to contain its spread into the community. Here, we provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: Direct person-to-person respiratory transmission has rapidly amplified the spread of coronavirus. In the absence of any clinically proven treatment options, the current clinical management of COVID-19 includes symptom management, infection prevention and control measures, optimized supportive care, and intensive care support in severe or critical illness. Developing an effective vaccine is now a leading research priority. Some vaccines have already been approved by the regulatory authorities for the prevention of COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: General prevention and protection measures regarding the containment and management of the second or third waves are necessary to minimize the risk of infection. Until now, four vaccines reported variable efficacies of between 62-95%, and two of them (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) received FDA emergency use authorization. Equitable access and effective distribution of these vaccines in all countries will save millions of lives.","Rahman, Sayeeda; Montero, Maria Teresa Villagomez; Rowe, Kherie; Kirton, Rita; Kunik, Frank",Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,,791
285082,The Potential for Telemedicine to Reduce Bias in Patients Seeking Facial Plastic Surgery,2020,"PURPOSE: To analyze the change in utilization of healthcare resources through a review of ultrasound examinations performed in the emergency department of an urban healthcare system in NYC during the time of peak COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This is a retrospective review analyzing ED ultrasound exams performed by the radiology department of an urban healthcare system during the 8-week time period of the peak COVID-19 outbreak in NYC, compared to a time-matched period one year prior. Data regarding the examination type and indication were obtained in addition to patient demographics and indicators of outcomes including admission, length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS: There was a 58% decrease in ED ultrasounds performed by the radiology department during the COVID-19 time period. Exams performed during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period were more likely to be performed on men (28.3 vs 18.0%, p < 0.01), older patients (36 vs. 35 years, p = 0.02), and patients subsequently admitted (17.8 vs. 13.4%, p = 0.03). There was also a difference in the distribution of exam type (p = 0.01). There was no difference in death, rate of surgery/intervention performed, or distribution of clinical indication. When correcting for gender, there was only an increase in studies leading to hospital admission in the female-only group (14.9 vs. 10.7%, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 had a drastic impact on the utilization of emergency department ultrasounds performed by the radiology department, with a decrease in total exams performed and changes in patient demographics, including a higher proportion of male patients and increases in some markers of disease severity, including rate of hospital admission.","Messina, Mark D; Stein, Marjorie W; Armstrong, Ian J; Wolf, Ellen L",Emerg. radiol,,791

A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and EMBASE was performed up to July 25, 2020. The pooled prevalence of the GI presentations was estimated using the random-effects model. Pairwise comparison for the outcomes was performed according to the GI manifestations' presentation and the pandemic wave of infection. Data were reported as relative risk (RR), or odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Of 125 articles with 25,252 patients, 20.3% presented with GI manifestations. Anorexia (19.9%), dysgeusia/ageusia (15.4%), diarrhea (13.2%), nausea (10.3%), and hematemesis (9.1%) were the most common. About 26.7% had confirmed positive fecal RNA, with persistent viral shedding for an average time of 19.2 days before being negative. Patients presenting with GI symptoms on admission showed a higher risk of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (RR = 8.16), acute cardiac injury (RR = 5.36), and acute kidney injury (RR = 5.52), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR = 2.56), and mortality (RR = 2.01). Although not reach significant levels, subgroup-analysis revealed that affected cohorts in the first wave had a higher risk of being hospitalized, ventilated, ICU admitted, and expired. This meta-analysis suggests an association between GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients and unfavorable outcomes.

Limited resources for cancer control are one of the contributors to cancer health disparities. We explored the feasibility and benefit of conducting outreaches in partnership with local communities using the ""asset-based community development (ABCD)"" model. METHODS: We analyzed the quarterly Uganda cancer institute (UCI) community outreach cancer health education and screening output reported secondary data without individual identifiers from July 2016 to June 2019 to compare the UCI-hospital-based and community outreach cancer awareness and screening services based on the ABCD model. RESULTS: From July 2016 to June 2019, we worked with 107 local partners and conducted 151 outreaches. Of the total number of people who attended cancer health education sessions, 201 568 (77.9%) were reached through outreaches. Ninety-two (95%) cancer awareness TVs and radio talk-shows conducted were sponsored by local partners. Of the total people screened; 22 795 (63.0%) cervical, 22 014 (64.4%) breast, and 4904 (38.7%) prostate screening were reached through community outreach model. The screen-positive rates were higher in hospital-based screening except for Prostate screening; cervical, 8.8%, breast, 8.4%, prostate, 7.1% than in outreaches; cervical, 3.2%, breast, 2.2%, prostate, 8.2%. Of the screened positive clients who were eligible for precancer treatment like cryotherapy for treatment of precervical cancer lesions, thousands-folds monetary value and productive life saved relative to the market cost of cancer treatment and survival rate in Uganda. When the total number of clients screened for cervical, breast, and prostate cancer are subjected to the incremental cost of specific screening, a greater portion (98.7%) of the outreach cost was absorbed through community partnership. CONCLUSIONS: Outreaching and working in collaboration with communities as partners through asset-based community development model are feasible and help in cost-sharing and leverage for scarce resources to promote primary prevention and early detection of cancer. This could contribute to bridging the cancer health disparities in the target populations.","Jatho, Alfred; Mugisha, Noleb M; Kafeero, James; Holoya, George; Okuku, Fred; Niyonzima, Nixon",Cancer med,,791
377318,Addressing the Impact of COVID-19 on the Residency Application Process Through a Virtual Subinternship,2020,"Two experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of enzyme supplementation (xylanase + -glucanase) of diets based on corn and soybean meal on: performance in initial (1-14 days) and growing (15-35 days) phases, and nutrient metabolization of meat-type quails. The treatments were: positive control to meet the nutritional requirements of the specie; positive control supplemented with enzyme complex; and negative controls with two reduced supplementation levels of metabolizable energy and amino acids (by 2% and 4%). In the initial phase, the negative control treatment reduced by 4% of metabolizable energy and amino acids increased feed intake (p 0.05), compared to positive controls. In the growing phase, there were no differences (p > 0.05) in feed intake, feed conversion ratio and carcass traits. In conclusion, this supplementation can be used successfully in diets with reduced metabolizable energy and amino acid contents for meat-type quails. In the metabolism trial, there were no differences (p > 0.05) in metabolizable coefficients of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and gross energy among treatments. The metabolization coefficient of NDF improved (p 0.05) with enzyme supplementation.","Shigueki Iwahashi, Alexandre; Claudio Furlan, Antônio; Scherer, Carina; Paula Silva Ton, Ana; Lorençon, Leticia; Scapinello, Cláudio",Acta Sci.

Eighty-two Australian early years primary teachers involved in a professional learning initiative focused on teaching mathematics through sequences of challenging tasks completed a questionnaire inviting them to compare the two settings. Drawing on a mixed-methods approach, we found that teachers were more positive about the value of student struggle in classroom-based settings compared with remote learning settings. Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses revealed four themes capturing why teachers viewed efforts to support productive struggle in a remote learning setting as potentially problematic: absence of a teacher-facilitated, synchronous, learning environment;parents' negative attitudes towards struggle when learning mathematics;lack of social connection and peer-to-peer collaboration;and difficulties accessing learning materials. Suggestions for mitigating some of these challenges in the future are put forward.","Russo, James Bobis Janette Downton Ann Livy Sharyn Sullivan Peter",Education Sciences,,791

The external signals are sensed by various G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and transmitted into G-proteins consisting of the &#945;, ß, and Î³ subunits. Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGSs) are the key controllers of G-protein signaling pathways. GPCRs, G-proteins, and RGSs are the primary upstream components of the G-protein signaling pathway, and they are highly conserved in most filamentous fungi, playing diverse roles in biological processes. Recent studies characterized the G-protein signaling components in the opportunistic pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. In this review, we have summarized the characteristics and functions of GPCRs, G-proteins, and RGSs, and their regulatory roles in governing fungal growth, asexual development, germination, stress tolerance, and virulence in A. fumigatus.","Park, Hee-Soo; Kim, Min-Ju; Yu, Jae-Hyuk; Shin, Kwang-Soo",,,791

Using a national sample of Americans, this research observes factors that influence people's likelihood of developing a household emergency plan. Based on the analysis, people's efficacy in preparedness activities, previous exposure to disasters and preparedness information positively influence the likelihood that someone will have developed a household emergency plan. Alternatively, demographic variables such as being Hispanic/Latino, identifying as Asian, and being a renter decrease the likelihood that someone will have developed a plan in the American context.

431039,Exoscope and Personal Protective Equipment Use for Otologic Surgery in the Era of COVID-19,2020,"Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has abruptly and undoubtedly changed the world as we know it at the end of the 2nd decade of the 21st century. COVID-19 is extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early diagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health care professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test, however, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity. Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other hand, reveal specific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung infections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging. Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases. CNNs, however, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and require large datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of handling small datasets, which is of significant importance due to sudden and rapid emergence of COVID-19. Our results based on a dataset of X-ray images show that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous CNN-based models. COVID-CAPS achieved an Accuracy of 95.7%, Sensitivity of 90%, Specificity of 95.8%, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97, while having far less number of trainable parameters in comparison to its counterparts. To potentially and further improve diagnosis capabilities of the COVID-CAPS, pre-training and transfer learning are utilized based on a new dataset constructed from an external dataset of X-ray images. This is in contrary to existing works on COVID-19 detection where pre-training is performed based on natural images. Pre-training with a dataset of similar nature further improved accuracy to 98.3% and specificity to 98.6%.","Afshar, Parnian; Heidarian, Shahin; Naderkhani, Farnoosh; Oikonomou, Anastasia; Plataniotis, Konstantinos N; Mohammadi, Arash",Pattern recognition letters,,791
432201,Impact of the COVID-19 Global Pandemic on the Otolaryngology Fellowship Application Process,2020,"In January 2020, anthropogenic emissions in Northeast Asia reduced due to the COVID-19 outbreak. When outdoor activities of the public were limited, PM2.5 concentrations in China and South Korea between February and March 2020 reduced by - 16.8 µg/m3 and - 9.9 µg/m3 respectively, compared with the average over the previous three years. This study uses air quality modeling and observations over the past four years to separate the influence of reductions in anthropogenic emissions from meteorological changes and emission control policies on this PM2.5 concentration change. Here, we show that the impacts of anthropogenic pollution reduction on PM2.5 were found to be approximately - 16% in China and - 21% in South Korea, while those of meteorology and emission policies were - 7% and - 8% in China, and - 5% and - 4% in South Korea, respectively. These results show that the influence on PM2.5 concentration differs across time and region and according to meteorological conditions and emission control policies. Finally, the influence of reductions in anthropogenic emissions was greater than that of meteorological conditions and emission policies during COVID-19 period.","Kang, Yoon-Hee; You, Seunghee; Bae, Minah; Kim, Eunhye; Son, Kyuwon; Bae, Changhan; Kim, Yoonha; Kim, Byeong-Uk; Kim, Hyun Cheol; Kim, Soontae",Sci Rep,,791

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the delivery of clinical placements in primary care; GPs are currently delivering the majority of consultations using telephone or video methods and difficulties in attaining placement experience are being encountered by medical students. Virtual remote consultations are an appropriate adjunct to conventional face-to-face patient encounters and could facilitate students to attain core learning outcomes. This article describes some of the approaches that enable remote (home) virtual patient encounters in Primary Care for medical students. These are categorised as methods that a) enable remote access into GP clinical systems, b) enable remote access into individual patient consultations and c) enable an observational-only experience. Key considerations are highlighted to enable safe and effective implementation of remote virtual consultations, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each method. These include patient consent, confidentiality, data sharing and protection, professionalism, student agreements and data gathering templates. It is hoped that sharing of these methods of virtual consulting will support the ongoing delivery of Primary Care education across medical schools.","Taggar, Jaspal; Saha, Runa; Hopwood-Carr, Paula; Patel, Bakula; Johnson, Christine",Educ Prim Care,,791

Passenger volume data for the domestic public transportation network in Japan and the time at which the first confirmed COVID-19 case was observed in each prefecture were extracted from public data sources. A survival approach in which a hazard was modeled as a function of the closeness centrality on the network was utilized to estimate the risk of importation of COVID-19 in each prefecture. A total of 46 prefectures with imported cases were identified. Hypothetical scenario analyses indicated that both strategies of locking down the metropolitan areas and restricting domestic airline travel would be equally effective in reducing the risk of importation of COVID-19. While caution is necessary that the data were limited to June 2020 when the pandemic was in its initial stage and that no other virus spreading routes have been considered, domestic travel restrictions were effective to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on public transportation network in Japan.

459340,Effects of Prolonged Use of Facemask on Healthcare Workers in Tertiary Care Hospital During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The scale and quality of the global scientific response to the COVID-19 pandemic have unquestionably saved lives. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered an unprecedented ""infodemic""; the velocity and volume of data production have overwhelmed many key stakeholders such as clinicians and policy makers, as they have been unable to process structured and unstructured data for evidence-based decision making. Solutions that aim to alleviate this data synthesis-related challenge are unable to capture heterogeneous web data in real time for the production of concomitant answers and are not based on the high-quality information in responses to a free-text query. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this project is to build a generic, real-time, continuously updating curation platform that can support the data synthesis and analysis of a scientific literature framework. Our secondary objective is to validate this platform and the curation methodology for COVID-19-related medical literature by expanding the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset via the addition of new, unstructured data. METHODS: To create an infrastructure that addresses our objectives, the PanSurg Collaborative at Imperial College London has developed a unique data pipeline based on a web crawler extraction methodology. This data pipeline uses a novel curation methodology that adopts a human-in-the-loop approach for the characterization of quality, relevance, and key evidence across a range of scientific literature sources. RESULTS: REDASA (Realtime Data Synthesis and Analysis) is now one of the world's largest and most up-to-date sources of COVID-19-related evidence; it consists of 104,000 documents. By capturing curators' critical appraisal methodologies through the discrete labeling and rating of information, REDASA rapidly developed a foundational, pooled, data science data set of over 1400 articles in under 2 weeks. These articles provide COVID-19-related information and represent around 10% of all papers about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This data set can act as ground truth for the future implementation of a live, automated systematic review. The three benefits of REDASA's design are as follows: (1) it adopts a user-friendly, human-in-the-loop methodology by embedding an efficient, user-friendly curation platform into a natural language processing search engine; (2) it provides a curated data set in the JavaScript Object Notation format for experienced academic reviewers' critical appraisal choices and decision-making methodologies; and (3) due to the wide scope and depth of its web crawling method, REDASA has already captured one of the world's largest COVID-19-related data corpora for searches and curation.","Vaghela, Uddhav; Rabinowicz, Simon; Bratsos, Paris; Martin, Guy; Fritzilas, Epameinondas; Markar, Sheraz; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Stringer, Karl; Singh, Harshdeep; Llewellyn, Charlie; Dutta, Debabrata; Clarke, Jonathan M; Howard, Matthew; Serban, Ovidiu; Kinross, James",J Med Internet Res,,791

We study teachers' beliefs as part of their identities and assessment as a fundamental variable of beliefs. A qualitative content analysis of the open-ended answers to an online questionnaire is carried out to understand the main characteristics associated with assessment by teachers and the obstacles to overcome in the context of long distance learning (LDL). The data show that teachers did not identify valid assessment methods for LDL during the lockdown, especially due to the lack of control over the students. A misconception emerges concerning the definition of formative assessment together with a new awareness of the possibilities offered by digital technologies regarding the individualization of didactics.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in a PICU in Brazil. All patients aged 6 months to 18 years admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis were eligible for inclusion. Those with ferritin and C-reactive protein measured within 48â¯h and lactate and leukocytes within 24â¯h of admission were included in the prognostic performance analysis. RESULTS: Of 350 eligible patients with sepsis, 294 had undergone all measurements required for analysis and were included in the study. PIM2, ferritin, lactate, and CRP had good discriminatory power for mortality, with PIM2 and ferritin being superior to CRP. The cutoff values for PIM2 (> 14%), ferritin (> 135â¯ng/mL), lactate (> 1.7â¯mmol/L), and CRP (> 6.7â¯mg/mL) were associated with mortality. The combination of ferritin, lactate, and CRP had a positive predictive value of 43% for mortality, similar to that of PIM2 alone (38.6%). The combined use of the three biomarkers plus PIM2 increased the positive predictive value to 76% and accuracy to 0.945. CONCLUSIONS: PIM2, ferritin, lactate, and CRP alone showed good prognostic performance for mortality in pediatric patients older than 6 months with sepsis. When combined, they were able to predict death in three-fourths of the patients with sepsis. Total leukocyte count was not useful as a prognostic marker.","Tonial, Cristian Tedesco; Costa, Caroline Abud Drumond; Andrades, Gabriela Rupp Hanzen; Crestani, Francielly; Bruno, Francisco; Piva, Jefferson Pedro; Garcia, Pedro Celiny Ramos",,,791

This model and simulation tool dramatically increase the efficiency and efficacy of the tests in a large population at a low cost. The proposed method combines statistical modeling with numerical methods to solve nonlinear equations and obtain optimal batch sizes at each step of tests, with the flexibility to incorporate geographic and demographic information. We also conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to verify this theory. Our simulation results show that our method reduces the false negative rate by 80%. Our method substantially improves the false positive rate and positive predictive value as well. The proposed method will be particularly useful for the prevention of a second wave of the coronavirus outbreaks, and more generally for the early stages of future pandemics.

520161,Implications of Change to USMLE Step 1 Scoring for Otolaryngology Residency Programs,2020,"Importance: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, yet many individuals with OUD do not receive treatment. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of OUD treatments and association of these treatments with outcomes in the US. Design and Setting: This model-based cost-effectiveness analysis included a US population with OUD. Interventions: Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with buprenorphine, methadone, or injectable extended-release naltrexone; psychotherapy (beyond standard counseling); overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND); and contingency management (CM). Main Outcomes and Measures: Fatal and nonfatal overdoses and deaths throughout 5 years, discounted lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs. Results: In the base case, in the absence of treatment, 42 717 overdoses (4132 fatal, 38 585 nonfatal) and 12 660 deaths were estimated to occur in a cohort of 100 000 patients over 5 years, and 11.58 discounted lifetime QALYs were estimated to be experienced per person. An estimated reduction in overdoses was associated with MAT with methadone (10.7%), MAT with buprenorphine or naltrexone (22.0%), and when combined with CM and psychotherapy (range, 21.0%-31.4%). Estimated deceased deaths were associated with MAT with methadone (6%), MAT with buprenorphine or naltrexone (13.9%), and when combined with CM, OEND, and psychotherapy (16.9%). MAT yielded discounted gains of 1.02 to 1.07 QALYs per person. Including only health care sector costs, methadone cost $16â¯000/QALY gained compared with no treatment, followed by methadone with OEND ($22â¯000/QALY gained), then by buprenorphine with OEND and CM ($42â¯000/QALY gained), and then by buprenorphine with OEND, CM, and psychotherapy ($250â¯000/QALY gained). MAT with naltrexone was dominated by other treatment alternatives. When criminal justice costs were included, all forms of MAT (with buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone) were associated with cost savings compared with no treatment, yielding savings of $25â¯000 to $105â¯000 in lifetime costs per person. The largest cost savings were associated with methadone plus CM. Results were qualitatively unchanged over a wide range of sensitivity analyses. An analysis using demographic and cost data for Veterans Health Administration patients yielded similar findings. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, expanded access to MAT, combined with OEND and CM, was associated with cost-saving reductions in morbidity and mortality from OUD. Lack of widespread MAT availability limits access to a cost-saving medical intervention that reduces morbidity and mortality from OUD. Opioid overdoses in the US likely reached a record high in 2020 because of COVID-19 increasing substance use, exacerbating stress and social isolation, and interfering with opioid treatment. It is essential to understand the cost-effectiveness of alternative forms of MAT to treat OUD.","Fairley, Michael; Humphreys, Keith; Joyce, Vilija R; Bounthavong, Mark; Trafton, Jodie; Combs, Ann; Oliva, Elizabeth M; Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D; Asch, Steven M; Brandeau, Margaret L; Owens, Douglas K",JAMA Psychiatry,,791
592389,Tracheostomy in COVID-19 Patients: Experience at a Tertiary Center in the First 11 Months of the Pandemic,2021-08-15,"The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the musculoskeletal system represents a dangerous knowledge gap. Aging patients are at added risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; therefore, a greater understanding of the resulting musculoskeletal sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection may help guide clinical strategies. This study examined fundamental bone parameters among mice treated with escalating viral loads. Male C57BL/6J (WT, n=17) and B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J mice (K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, n=21) expressing human ACE2 (TG) were divided into eight groups (n=4-6/group) and subjected to intranasal dosing of 0, 1x10(3), 1x10(4), and 1x10(5) PFU (plaque forming units) of human SARS-CoV-2. Animal health was assessed daily by veterinary staff using established and validated scoring criteria (activity, posture, body condition scores and body weight). We report here that mock and WT infected mice were healthy and completed the study, surviving until 12-14 days post infection (dpi). In contrast, the TG mice infected with 1x10(5) PFU all experienced severe health declines that necessitated early euthanasia (6-7 dpi). For TG mice infected with 1x10(4) PFU, 2 mice were also euthanized after 7 dpi, while 3 mice showed signs of moderate disease at day 6 dpi, but recovered fully by day 11 dpi. Four of the 5 TG mice that were infected with 1x10(3) PFU remained healthy throughout the study. This suggests that our study mimics what is seen during human disease, where some patients develop severe disease resulting in death, while others have moderate to severe disease but recover, and others are asymptomatic. At necropsy, femurs were extracted and analyzed by μCT. No difference was found in μCT determined bone parameters among the WT groups. There was, however, a significant 24.4% decrease in trabecular bone volume fraction (p=0.0009), 19.0% decrease in trabecular number (p=0.004), 6.2% decrease in trabecular thickness (p=0.04), and a 9.8% increase in trabecular separation (p=0.04) among surviving TG mice receiving any viral load compared to non-infected controls. No differences in cortical bone parameters were detected. TRAP staining revealed surviving infected mice had a significant 64% increase in osteoclast number, a 27% increase in osteoclast surface, and a 38% increase in osteoclasts per bone surface. While more studies are needed to investigate the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on skeletal health, this study demonstrates a significant reduction in several bone parameters and corresponding robust increases in osteoclast number observed within 2 weeks post-infection in surviving asymptomatic and moderately affected mice.","Awosanya, Olatundun D.; Dalloul, Christopher E.; Blosser, Rachel J.; Dadwal, Ushashi C.; Carozza, Mariel; Boschen, Karen; Klemsz, Michael J.; Johnston, Nancy A.; Bruzzaniti, Angela; Robinson, Christopher M.; Srour, Edward F.; Kacena, Melissa A.",Bone,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S8756328221003938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34607050/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bone.2021.116227; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8756328221003938?v=s5,791

596202,Challenges Faced by an Otolaryngology Resident During Covid-19 Pandemic: An Indian Perspective,2020-09-01,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) assemble by budding into the lumen of the intermediate compartment (IC) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi interface. However, why CoVs have chosen the IC as their intracellular site of assembly and how progeny viruses are delivered from this compartment to the extracellular space has remained unclear. Here we address these enigmatic late events of the CoV life cycle in light of recently described properties of the IC. Of particular interest are the emerging spatial and functional connections between IC elements and recycling endosomes (REs), defined by the GTPases Rab1 and Rab11, respectively. The establishment of IC-RE links at the cell periphery, around the centrosome and evidently also at the noncompact zones of the Golgi ribbon indicates that—besides traditional ER-Golgi communication—the IC also promotes a secretory process that bypasses the Golgi stacks, but involves its direct connection with the endocytic recycling system. The initial confinement of CoVs to the lumen of IC-derived large transport carriers and their preferential absence from Golgi stacks is consistent with the idea that they exit cells following such an unconventional route. In fact, CoVs may share this pathway with other intracellularly budding viruses, lipoproteins, procollagen, and/or protein aggregates experimentally introduced into the IC lumen.","Saraste, Jaakko; Prydz, Kristian",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33652973/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10030503,791

Previous studies focused on the IFN system of megabats (suborder Yinpterochiroptera). We present statistically robust RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data on transcriptomes of cells from the “microbat” Myotis daubentonii (suborder Yangochiroptera) responding at 6 and 24 h to either an IFN-inducing virus or treatment with IFN. Our data reveal genes triggered only by virus, either in both humans and Myotis (CCL4, IFNL3, CH25H), or exclusively in Myotis (STEAP4). Myotis cells also express a series of conserved IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and an unusually high paralog number of the antiviral ISG BST2 (tetherin) but lack several ISGs that were described for megabats (EMC2, FILIP1, IL17RC, OTOGL, SLC24A1). Also, in contrast to megabats, we detected neither different IFN-alpha subtypes nor an unusually high baseline expression of IFNs.

We examine the relationship between country-level rankings on these two indices, along with two additional indices (the Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index and World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicator (n = 195)) and compared them to the country-level reported COVID-19 cases and deaths (Johns Hopkins University (JHU) COVID-19 Dashboard) through 17 June 2020. Ordinary least squares regression models were used to compare weekly reported COVID-19 case and death rates per million in the first 12 weeks of the pandemic between countries classified as low, middle, and high ranking on each index, while controlling for country socio-demographic information. Countries with higher GHSI and IHR-SPAR index scores experienced fewer reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, but only for the first 8 weeks after the country's first case. For the GHSI, this association was further limited to countries with populations below 69.4 million. For both the GHSI and IHR-SPAR, countries with a higher sub-index score in human resources for pandemic preparedness reported fewer COVID-19 cases and deaths in the first 8 weeks after the country's first reported case. The UHC-SCI and WGI country-level rankings were not associated with COVID-19 outcomes. The associations between GHSI and IHR-SPAR scores and COVID-19 outcomes observed in this study demonstrate that these two indices, although imperfect, may have value, especially in countries with a population under 69.4 million people for the GHSI.

AIMS: To describe how to rapidly convert general wards to intensive care units for critically ill patients with COVID‐19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comprehensive assessment and analysis of available resources and standard requirements. RESULTS: The ICUs were successfully assembled in 4 days. The conversion included environment reconstruction, configuration and management of equipment, information system construction and human resource allocation. A total of 172 critically ill patients had been admitted to the contemporary ICUs and none medical staff was infected. DISCUSSION: The epidemic situation of COVID‐19 poses a great challenge to various management departments of the hospital, especially for critically ill patients with a high mortality rate. To save more critically ill patients, the conversion of a general ward to a quarantine ICU ward must be completed in a short time, and the optimal allocation of resources must be appropriate to ensure that the medical team works effectively and is of high quality. In face of the overloaded medical system, the ideal non‐negative pressure ward is hard to achieve. However, we have demonstrated with evidence that our conversions are effective in both providing care to critical patients and protecting the safety of our staff.

The immune response of the vaccinated animals was controlled by challenge infection via aerosol technique and by examination of HAI antibodies in the serum and in the washings of lungs. After a single aerosol vaccination a weak protection was observed only, if the vaccines contained BPE. But a second immunization with a vaccine containing BPE induced a high degree of immunity, even if a reduced amount of antigen was used for booster vaccination. After three aerosol vaccine doses in two-weeks intervals, however, we were unable to infect the immunized animals even with largest amounts of challenge virus (approximately 50000 LD50). The addition of BPE as an adjuvant induced a significantly better protection and resulted in much higher titres of HAI antibodies in the serum and in the respiratory tract compared to mice vaccinated by the same procedure but without BPE.","Neukirch, Manfred; Bauer, Kurt","Zentralblatt für Bakteriologie. 1.

In the COVID-19 pandemic we have witnessed a sudden surge in these cases. We aimed to evaluate the disease presentation, patterns of spread, and any association with the COVID-19 virus. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted on mucormycosis patients operated between March and July 2021. The diagnosis was confirmed either on KOH staining, fungal culture or histopathological examination. RESULTS: Thirty one cases (21 males, 10 females) with a mean age of 53.3 years were included, of which 9 (29.1%) were COVID positive on presentation, 17 (54.8%) were post-COVID, while 5 (16.1%) had radiological evidence of COVID sequelae. Most common symptoms were cheek numbness (87.1%), headache (83.9%), visual disturbances (77.4%), and palate involvement (58.1%). Blackening of turbinates was uncommon (22.6%). Ethmoid sinus was involved in all patients. Pterygopalatine fossa involvement was present in 77.4%, and was accurately diagnosed on contrast enhanced MRI scan. There were 8 (25.8%) deaths, while the remaining are discharged or under treatment. CONCLUSION: An increase in the incidence of mucormycosis in the COVID-19 pandemic is probably due to a compromise in host immunity along with a synergistic effect in thrombotic microangiopathy. Spread of infection to the soft tissues of the infratemporal fossa, orbit or palate occur via neurovascular structures rather than by bone erosion.

639579,The untimely demise of the TB Free block model in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019 in India,2020-08-14,"Even though the healthcare industry is usually considered a rather traditional and slowly evolving sector, change is happening. Digitalization is transforming the way of obtaining medical advice and treatment and the Internet has become a key source for the seeking of healthcare information. It has allowed people to turn into more active collaborators in matters of their own health by enabling them to easily search and share information with other patients. Although research points out the growing importance of user-generated content in many sectors and its positive impact on information credibility, trust, engagement, and, ultimately, customer behavior (Malthouse et al., 2016), there is a lack of attention to this topic in healthcare. In this brief review, we address this gap by analyzing the role of health e-mavens, which are a particular type of influencers that possesses both expertise and online social influence. We lastly illustrate possible benefits of their impact on other to the different parties involved and affected by this phenomenon.","Díaz-Martín, Ana M.; Schmitz, Anne; Yagüe Guillén, María Jesús",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32390921/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00779,791
668571,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Pattern of Patient Care in Otorhinolaryngology Practice in a Tertiary Referral Centre,2021-01-08,"Aims: This study aimed to assess the number of patients with acute stroke seeking medical emergency care since the declaration of the state of emergency in the COVID-19 pandemic in the Tokyo metropolitan area of Japan. Methods: In this combined retrospective and prospective multicenter survey, data on the numbers of hospital admissions due to acute ischemic stroke, of large vessel occlusion (LVO) cases, and of reperfusion therapies performed from February to July 2020, restrictions of the medical care system, and comprehensive stroke center (CSC) scale scores were collected in 19 stroke centers in Tokyo. Results: In the survey period, 3,456 patients were admitted with acute stroke. There was a decrease in the number of admissions (−22%), LVO (−22%), thrombolysis (−6%), and thrombectomy (−23%) during the state of emergency, but the ratio of thrombectomy to LVO cases was not different. The acceptance of acute stroke cases by emergency transport and emergent operations in the central eastern area of Tokyo, was also significantly decreased to <50% and remains <60%. According to CSC scores, each hospital restricted their infrastructure or educational activities according to their medical resources. There was only one stroke case with COVID-19 (thrombectomy case) in all 3,456 patients in this study. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on stroke care in Tokyo, including stroke admissions and medical care systems, resulting in a significant reduction in thrombolysis and thrombectomy. The extent of the drop may be the result of the number of COVID-19 patients.","Ota, Takahiro; Shiokawa, Yoshiaki; Hirano, Teruyuki",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.601652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424751/,791
668859,Tele-Otolaryngology at a Tertiary Care Center in North India During COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown: A Validated Patient Feedback Questionnaire Based Study,2021-06-04,"The covid-19 pandemic led to rapid and large-scale government intervention in economies and societies. A common policy response to covid-19 outbreaks has been the lockdown or quarantine. Designed to slow the spread of the disease, lockdowns have unintended consequences for the environment. This article examines the impact of Colombia’s lockdown on forest fires, motivated by satellite data showing a particularly large upsurge of fires at around the time of lockdown implementation. We find that Colombia’s lockdown is associated with an increase in forest fires compared to three different counterfactuals, constructed to simulate the expected number of fires in the absence of the lockdown. To varying degrees across Colombia’s regions, the presence of armed groups is correlated with this fire upsurge. Mechanisms through which the lockdown might influence fire rates are discussed, including the mobilisation of armed groups and the reduction in the monitoring capacity of state and conservation organisations during the covid-19 outbreak. Given the fast-developing situation in Colombia, we conclude with some ideas for further research.","Amador-Jiménez, Mónica; Millner, Naomi; Palmer, Charles; Pennington, R.
