129,129,129,Avian influenza outbreak in Turkey through health personnel's views: a qualitative study,21.237095,1.7728689,2007-11-15,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza threatens public health worldwide because it is usually associated with severe illness and, consequently, a higher risk of death. During the first months of 2006, Turkey experienced its first human avian influenza epidemic. A total of 21 human cases were identified, 12 of which were confirmed by the National Institute for Medical Research. Nine of the cases, including the four fatal ones, were from the Dogubeyazit-Van region. This study aims to evaluate the efforts at the avian influenza outbreak control in the Van-Dogubeyazit region in 2006 through the experiences of health personnel. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with seventeen key informants who took active roles during the avian influenza outbreak in East Turkey during the first months of 2006. We gathered information about the initial responses, the progress and management of the outbreak control, and the reactions of the health professionals and the public. The findings of the study are reported according to the topics that appeared through thematic analysis of the interview transcripts. RESULTS: Following the first suspected avian influenza cases, a Van Crisis Coordination Committee was formed as the coordinating and decision-making body and played an important role in the appropriate timing of decisions. The health and agriculture services could not be well coordinated owing to the lack of integrated planning in preparation for outbreak and of integrated surveillance programs. Traditional poultry practice together with the low socio-economic status of the people and the lack of health care access in the region seemed to be a major risk for animal to animal and animal to human transmission. The strengths and weaknesses of the present health system – primary health care services, national surveillance and notification systems, human resource and management – affected the inter organizational coordination during the outbreak. Open communication between the government and the public played an important part in overcoming difficulties. CONCLUSION: Although there were problems during the avian influenza outbreak in Turkey, the rapid responses of the central and regional health authorities and the performance of the health workers were the key points in controlling the epidemic. The lessons from this outbreak should provide an opportunity for integrating the preparation plans of the health and agricultural organizations, and for revising the surveillance system and enhancing the role of the primary health care services in controlling epidemic disease. Developing successful strategies based on knowledge and experience may play a valuable role in delaying an avian influenza pandemic.","Sarikaya, Ozlem; Erbaydar, Tugrul",BMC Public Health,83,30
812,812,812,Community responses to communication campaigns for influenza A (H1N1): a focus group study,21.213167,1.7585362,2012-03-19,"BACKGROUND: This research was a part of a contestable rapid response initiative launched by the Health Research Council of New Zealand and the Ministry of Health in response to the 2009 influenza A pandemic. The aim was to provide health authorities in New Zealand with evidence-based practical information to guide the development and delivery of effective health messages for H1N1 and other health campaigns. This study contributed to the initiative by providing qualitative data about community responses to key health messages in the 2009 and 2010 H1N1 campaigns, the impact of messages on behavioural change and the differential impact on vulnerable groups in New Zealand. METHODS: Qualitative data were collected on community responses to key health messages in the 2009 and 2010 Ministry of Health H1N1 campaigns, the impact of messages on behaviour and the differential impact on vulnerable groups. Eight focus groups were held in the winter of 2010 with 80 participants from groups identified by the Ministry of Health as vulnerable to the H1N1 virus, such as people with chronic health conditions, pregnant women, children, Pacific Peoples and Māori. Because this study was part of a rapid response initiative, focus groups were selected as the most efficient means of data collection in the time available. For Māori, focus group discussion (hui) is a culturally appropriate methodology. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of data identified four major themes: personal and community risk, building community strategies, responsibility and information sources. People wanted messages about specific actions that they could take to protect themselves and their families and to mitigate any consequences. They wanted transparent and factual communication where both good and bad news is conveyed by people who they could trust. CONCLUSIONS: The responses from all groups endorsed the need for community based risk management including information dissemination. Engaging with communities will be essential to facilitate preparedness and build community resilience to future pandemic events. This research provides an illustration of the complexities of how people understand and respond to health messages related to the H1N1 pandemic. The importance of the differences identified in the analysis is not the differences per se but highlight problems with a ""one size fits all"" pandemic warning strategy.","Gray, Lesley; MacDonald, Carol; Mackie, Brenda; Paton, Douglas; Johnston, David; Baker, Michael G",BMC Public Health,83,30
1317,1317,1317,Multi-criteria decision analysis as an innovative approach to managing zoonoses: results from a study on Lyme disease in Canada,21.332422,1.7408952,2013-09-30,"BACKGROUND: Zoonoses are a growing international threat interacting at the human-animal-environment interface and call for transdisciplinary and multi-sectoral approaches in order to achieve effective disease management. The recent emergence of Lyme disease in Quebec, Canada is a good example of a complex health issue for which the public health sector must find protective interventions. Traditional preventive and control interventions can have important environmental, social and economic impacts and as a result, decision-making requires a systems approach capable of integrating these multiple aspects of interventions. This paper presents the results from a study of a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach for the management of Lyme disease in Quebec, Canada. MCDA methods allow a comparison of interventions or alternatives based on multiple criteria. METHODS: MCDA models were developed to assess various prevention and control decision criteria pertinent to a comprehensive management of Lyme disease: a first model was developed for surveillance interventions and a second was developed for control interventions. Multi-criteria analyses were conducted under two epidemiological scenarios: a disease emergence scenario and an epidemic scenario. RESULTS: In general, we observed a good level of agreement between stakeholders. For the surveillance model, the three preferred interventions were: active surveillance of vectors by flagging or dragging, active surveillance of vectors by trapping of small rodents and passive surveillance of vectors of human origin. For the control interventions model, basic preventive communications, human vaccination and small scale landscaping were the three preferred interventions. Scenarios were found to only have a small effect on the group ranking of interventions in the control model. CONCLUSIONS: MCDA was used to structure key decision criteria and capture the complexity of Lyme disease management. This facilitated the identification of gaps in the scientific literature and enabled a clear identification of complementary interventions that could be used to improve the relevance and acceptability of proposed prevention and control strategy. Overall, MCDA presents itself as an interesting systematic approach for public health planning and zoonoses management with a “One Health” perspective.","Aenishaenslin, Cécile; Hongoh, Valérie; Cissé, Hassane Djibrilla; Hoen, Anne Gatewood; Samoura, Karim; Michel, Pascal; Waaub, Jean-Philippe; Bélanger, Denise",BMC Public Health,83,30
1685,1685,1685,"“Only your blood can tell the story” – a qualitative research study using semi- structured interviews to explore the hepatitis B related knowledge, perceptions and experiences of remote dwelling Indigenous Australians and their health care providers in northern Australia",21.305956,1.8703109,2014-11-28,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B is endemic in the Indigenous communities of the Northern Territory of Australia and significantly contributes to liver-related morbidity and mortality. It is recognised that low health literacy levels, different worldviews and English as a second language all contribute to the difficulties health workers often have in explaining biomedical health concepts, relevant to hepatitis B infection, to patients. The aim of this research project was to explore the knowledge, perceptions and experiences of remote dwelling Indigenous adults and their health care providers relating to hepatitis B infection with a view to using this as the evidence base to develop a culturally appropriate educational tool. METHODS: The impetus for this project came from health clinic staff at a remote community in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, in partnership with a visiting specialist liver clinic from the Royal Darwin Hospital. Participants were clinic patients with hepatitis B (n = 12), community members (n = 9) and key informants (n = 13); 25 were Indigenous individuals. A participatory action research project design was used with purposive sampling to identify participants. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken to explore: current understanding of hepatitis B, desire for knowledge, and perspectives on how people could acquire the information needed. All individuals were offered the use of an interpreter. The data were examined using deductive and inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Low levels of biomedical knowledge about Hepatitis B, negative perceptions of Hepatitis B, communication (particularly language) and culture were the major themes that emerged from the data. Accurate concepts grounded in Indigenous culture such as “only your blood can tell the story” were present but accompanied by a feeling of disempowerment due to perceived lack of “medical” understanding, and informed partnerships between caregiver and patient. Culturally appropriate discussions in a patient’s first language using visual aids were identified as vital to improving communication. CONCLUSIONS: Having an educational tool in Indigenous patient’s first language is crucial in developing treatment partnerships for Indigenous patients with hepatitis B. Using a culturally appropriate worldview as the foundation for development should help to reduce disempowerment and improve health literacy.","Davies, Jane; Bukulatjpi, Sarah; Sharma, Suresh; Davis, Joshua; Johnston, Vanessa",BMC Public Health,83,5

Our aim was to track the current status of progress towards measles control and elimination milestones across 15 west African countries between 2001 and 2019. METHODS: We did a retrospective multicountry series analysis of national immunisation coverage and case surveillance data from Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2019. Our analysis focused on the 15 west African countries that constitute the Economic Community of West African States. We tracked progress in the coverage of measles-containing vaccines (MCVs), measles supplementary immunisation activities, and measles incidence rates. We developed a country-level measles summary scorecard using eight indicators to track progress towards measles elimination as of the end of 2019. The summary indicators were tracked against measles control and elimination milestones. FINDINGS: The weighted average regional first-dose MCV coverage in 2019 was 66% compared with 45% in 2001. 73% (11 of 15) of the west African countries had introduced second-dose MCV as of December, 2019. An estimated 4 588 040 children (aged 12–23 months) did not receive first-dose MCV in 2019, the majority (71%) of whom lived in Nigeria. Based on the scorecard, 12 (80%) countries are off-track to achieving measles elimination milestones; however, Cape Verde, The Gambia, and Ghana have made substantial progress. INTERPRETATION: Measles will continue to be endemic in west Africa after 2020. The regional measles incidence rate in 2019 was 33 times the 2020 elimination target of less than 1 case per million population. However, some hope exists as countries can look at the efforts made by Cape Verde, The Gambia, and Ghana and learn from them.

Although the survival rate after devastating burn injuries has continued to increase in previous decades due to medical advances in burn wound care, nutritional and fluid resuscitation and improved infection control practices, there are still large numbers of patients at a high risk of death. One of the most common complications of burn is sepsis, which is defined as “severe organ dysfunction attributed to host's disordered response to infection” and is the primary cause of death in burn patients. Indeed, burn injuries are accompanied by a series of events that lead to sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, such as a hypovolaemic state, immune and inflammatory responses and metabolic changes. Therefore, clear diagnostic criteria and predictive biomarkers are especially important in the prevention and treatment of sepsis and septic shock. In this review, we focus on the pathogenesis of burn wound infection and the post-burn events leading to sepsis. Moreover, the clinical and promising biomarkers of burn sepsis will also be summarized.","Zhang, Pengju; Zou, Bingwen; Liou, Yih-Cherng; Huang, Canhua",Burns Trauma,83,30

However, an individual state of the art strategy, with precise adjustment to the patient’s characteristics, is still far from being part of the everyday care of pwMS. The development of digital twins could decisively advance the necessary implementation of an individualized innovative management of MS. Through artificial intelligence-based analysis of several disease parameters – including clinical and para-clinical outcomes, multi-omics, biomarkers, patient-related data, information about the patient’s life circumstances and plans, and medical procedures – a digital twin paired to the patient’s characteristic can be created, enabling healthcare professionals to handle large amounts of patient data. This can contribute to a more personalized and effective care by integrating data from multiple sources in a standardized manner, implementing individualized clinical pathways, supporting physician-patient communication and facilitating a shared decision-making. With a clear display of pre-analyzed patient data on a dashboard, patient participation and individualized clinical decisions as well as the prediction of disease progression and treatment simulation could become possible. In this review, we focus on the advantages, challenges and practical aspects of digital twins in the management of MS. We discuss the use of digital twins for MS as a revolutionary tool to improve diagnosis, monitoring and therapy refining patients’ well-being, saving economic costs, and enabling prevention of disease progression. Digital twins will help make precision medicine and patient-centered care a reality in everyday life.","Voigt, Isabel; Inojosa, Hernan; Dillenseger, Anja; Haase, Rocco; Akgün, Katja; Ziemssen, Tjalf",Front Immunol,83,30

The development of fast, affordable and effective diagnostic solutions capable of discriminating between antibiotic-resistant and susceptible S. aureus strains would be of huge benefit for effective disease detection and treatment. Here we develop a diagnostics solution that uses Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation–Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and machine learning, to identify signature profiles of antibiotic resistance to either multidrug or benzylpenicillin in S. aureus isolates. Using ten different supervised learning techniques, we have analysed a set of 82 S. aureus isolates collected from 67 cows diagnosed with bovine mastitis across 24 farms. For the multidrug phenotyping analysis, LDA, linear SVM, RBF SVM, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, MLP neural network and QDA had Cohen’s kappa values over 85.00%. For the benzylpenicillin phenotyping analysis, RBF SVM, MLP neural network, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, linear SVM, QDA, LDA, and random forests had Cohen’s kappa values over 85.00%. For the benzylpenicillin the diagnostic systems achieved up to (mean result ± standard deviation over 30 runs on the test set): accuracy = 97.54% ± 1.91%, sensitivity = 99.93% ± 0.25%, specificity = 95.04% ± 3.83%, and Cohen’s kappa = 95.04% ± 3.83%. Moreover, the diagnostic platform complemented by a protein-protein network and 3D structural protein information framework allowed the identification of five molecular determinants underlying the susceptible and resistant profiles. Four proteins were able to classify multidrug-resistant and susceptible strains with 96.81% ± 0.43% accuracy. Five proteins, including the previous four, were able to classify benzylpenicillin resistant and susceptible strains with 97.54% ± 1.91% accuracy. Our approach may open up new avenues for the development of a fast, affordable and effective day-to-day diagnostic solution, which would offer new opportunities for targeting resistant bacteria.","Esener, Necati; Maciel-Guerra, Alexandre; Giebel, Katharina; Lea, Daniel; Green, Martin J.; Bradley, Andrew J.; Dottorini, Tania",PLoS Comput Biol,83,30

The distribution of TW I-type IBV in China has increased in recent years, becoming a widespread genotype. We previously isolated a TW I-type IBV strain termed CK/CH/GD/GZ14 in 2014, but its pathogenicity and possibility for vaccine development were not explored. Therefore, this research aimed to develop a live-attenuated virus vaccine based on the CK/CH/GD/GZ14 strain. The wild type IBV CK/CH/GD/GZ14 strain was serially passaged in SPF embryos for 145 generations. The morbidity and mortality rate of wild-type strain in 14 day-old chickens is 100% and 80% respectively, while the morbidity rate in the attenuated strain was 20% in the 95th and 105th generations and there was no death. Histopathological observations showed that the pathogenicity of the 95th and 105th generations in chickens was significantly weakened. Further challenge experiments confirmed that the attenuated CK/CH/GD/GZ14 strain in the 95th and 105th generations could resist CK/CH/GD/GZ14 (5th generation) infection and the protection rate was 80%. Tracheal cilia stagnation, virus shedding, and viral load experiments confirmed that the 95th and 105th generations provide good immune protection in chickens, and the immunogenicity of the 105th generation is better than that of the 95th generation. These data suggest that the attenuated CK/CH/GD/GZ14 strain in the 105th generation may be applied as a vaccine candidate against TW I-type IBV.

I argue that international human rights NGOs should retain a focus on civil and political rights for three reasons. The COVID-19 pandemic has (1) revealed and reinforced the vast repressive power of the state and consequent serious risks to civil and political rights in the global North and (2) demonstrated that human rights NGOs are often alone in challenging restrictions to civil and political rights, especially during crises. I further suggest that, in contrast to the civil and political rights sphere, (3) human rights NGOs offer little ‘value added’ in the field of economic and social rights in the global North. I conclude by proposing that human rights serve their most useful function when they protect those who few others are willing to defend, such as the vector of disease, the terrorist and the criminal.","Seyhan, Eda",J Hum Rights Pract,83,5

At the end of May, Italy reported more than 27.000 cases among healthcare professionals and 163 deaths among physicians. The National Health Systems from almost all over the world, including Italy’s, were unprepared for this pandemic, and this generated important consequences of organizational nature. All elective and urgent specialized activities were completely reorganized, and many hospital units were partially or completely converted to the care of the COVID-19 patients. A significant reduction in hospital admissions for acute heart disease were recorded during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and, in order to gradually resume hospital activities, the Italian National Phase 2 Plan for the partial recovery of activities, must necessarily be associated with a Phase 2 Health Plan. In regards to the cardiac outpatient activities we need to identify short term goals, i.e. reschedule the suspended outpatient activities, revise the waiting lists, review the ‘timings’ of the bookings. This will reduce the number of available examinations compared to the pre-Covid-19 era. The GP’s collaboration could represent an important resource, a structured telephone follow-up plan is advisable with the nursing staff’s involvement. It is equally important to set medium-long term goals, the pandemic could be an appropriate moment for making a virtue of necessity. It is time to reason on prescriptive appropriateness, telemedicine implementation intended as integration to the traditional management. It is time to restructure the cardiological units related to the issue of structural adjustment to the needs for functional isolation. Moreover, the creation of ‘grey zones’ with multidisciplinary management according to the intensity of care levels seems to be necessary as well as the identification of Covid dedicated cardiologies.

Second, how families impact health during the COVID-19 pandemic is conditional on public policies, organizational decisions, and concurrent events. Third, many health inequalities driven by racism, sexism, classism, and other oppressive societal force are amplified during COVID-19, but the extent to which this is occurring is shaped by families and by the public policies, organizational decisions, and concurrent events that also impact families and health.

In 2011, the diagnosis of DES was refined based on the occurrence of premature (rather than rapid) contractions by high-resolution manometry. New therapeutic options have also been recently proposed. Thus, a review on DES incorporating publications since 2012 is timely because of these revisions in definition and management. RECENT FINDINGS DES remains a heterogeneous clinical disorder. Its pathophysiology is still debated and DES might be related to achalasia. Alternatively, it might be secondary to medications, especially opiates. Endoscopic ultrasound might be informative diagnostically by demonstrating muscularis propria hypertrophy and thickening. Botulinum toxin injection in the esophageal body has been shown superior to placebo to relieve symptoms associated with DES. Finally, per oral endoscopic myotomy is a promising therapeutic approach, but may be less effective in DES than in achalasia. SUMMARY The diagnosis of DES should lead to a systematic search for medication that might promote the occurrence of esophageal dysmotility. Endoscopic treatment of DES (botulinum toxin injection or per oral endoscopic myotomy) should be further evaluated in controlled studies using current diagnostic criteria by high-resolution manometry.","Roman, Sabine; Kahrilas, Peter J",Current opinion in gastroenterology,83,1

Due to the rising popularity of vaping among adolescents, it is crucial to understand the relationships between vaping and illicit drug use. Objectives: This paper examined the prevalence and trends of using vaping devices, marijuana vaping, marijuana products, synthetic cannabinoids and mist contents among youth. Methods: The study utilized 5 sets of public cross-sectional national data from the ""Monitoring the Future"" surveys during 2014-2018. It employed logistic regression to analyze the data. Results: There was an increase from 10.5% in 2017 to 20.8% in 2018 for the past 30-day use of vaping devices among 12th graders. Furthermore, there was an increase from 21.6% in 2017 to 34.5% in 2018 for the past 12-month use of marijuana via vaping device among 12th-grade marijuana users. Additionally, there were significant associations between vaping device use and marijuana vaping, between vaping device use and marijuana use, between vaping device use and synthetic cannabinoids use, and between marijuana use and synthetic cannabinoids use from 2016 to 2018. Conclusions: Vaping emerged as another major route of marijuana administration among youth. Adolescent marijuana users had higher odds of using synthetic cannabinoids. This finding highlighted the importance of understanding what adolescent substance consumption pattern would be where marijuana was legalized. It also supported the hypothesis that vaping devices use correlates with, or is associated with, marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids use.","Tai, Hsiangyi; Swartz, Michael D; Marsden, David; Perry, Cheryl L",Substance use & misuse,83,1

In this study, we evaluated proliferation and osteogenic potential of mouse osteoblasts using the MTT assay and Alizarin red staining. The levels of alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and adiponectin in culture supernatants were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Osteoclast bone resorbing activity was evaluated by toluidine staining and the number and area of bone resorption pits were determined. We observed increased osteogenesis in osteoblasts co-cultured with the BM-derived myeloid cells compared to the osteoblasts cultured alone. Mice with global Lrp5 deletion had a relatively higher bone density compared to the mice carrying osteoblast/osteocyte-specific Lrp5 deletion. An increased frequency of M2 macrophages and reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines were detected in the myeloid cells derived from the bone marrow of mice with global Lrp5 deletion. Higher adipogenic potential and elevated levels of adiponectin in the global Lrp5 deletion mice contributed to the preferential M2 macrophage polarization. Here, we identified a novel systemic regulatory mechanism of bone formation and degradation in mice with global Lrp5 deletion. This mechanism depends on a crosstalk between the adipocytes and M2 macrophages in the bone marrow and is responsible for partly rescuing osteopenia developed as a result of decreased Wnt signaling.","Li, Lisha; Qiu, Xuemin; Zhang, Na; Sun, Yan; Wang, Yan; Wang, Ling",Experimental biology and medicine,83,16

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR)-related measures can effectively improve the ICU-AW situation, but in the specific implementation actions, many obstacles have been produced, and the treatment effect has been controversial, especially in the application process of mechanically ventilated patients. This study aims to confirm the efficacy of using MV alongside PR for patients with ICU-AW. METHODS We obtained related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from Chinese and English databases. All RCTs relevant to the use of PR in ICU-AW patients were retrieved from the following databases from their date of inception through January 31th, 2021: PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI), Web of Science, The Wanfang Database, and CNKI. This literature underwent screening, quality evaluation, and index data extraction by two independent researchers. The evaluation data were meta-analyzed with RevMan 5.3 software (Cochrane, London, UK). RESULTS In total, we analyzed 15 articles which included 1,710 patients. We found that using PR alongside MV can effectively improve a patient's Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength score [mean difference (MD) =4.92, P=0.07], reduce the prevalence of ICU-AW [odds ratio (OR) =0.24, P<0.001], and shorten both MV duration [standardized mean difference (SMD) =-1.50, P<0.001] and ICU stay (SMD =-0.68, P=0.03). DISCUSSION Implementing PR alongside MV can effectively reduce ICU-AW in patients. However, our standardized cluster PR study still requires further clarification to confirm how various intervention methods can reduce ICU-AW.","Huang, Di; Zhao, Wenying; Chen, Yanru; Shen, Binfen; Wang, Yaling; Guan, Hua; Luo, Weixiang",Annals of palliative medicine,83,28

Prior studies have identified markers of initial injury (arrival NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) or infarct volume) as predictive of outcome after these procedures. We sought to define the role of collateral flow at the time of presentation in determining the extent of initial ischemic injury and its influence on final outcome. METHODS Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data were prospectively collected on a consecutive cohort of patients who received endovascular therapy for acute cerebral ischemia at a single tertiary referral center from September 2004 to August 2010. RESULTS Higher collateral grade as assessed by the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology (ASITN/SIR) grading scheme on angiography at the time of presentation was associated with improved reperfusion rates after endovascular intervention, decreased post-procedural hemorrhage, smaller infarcts on presentation and discharge, as well as improved neurological function on arrival to the hospital, discharge, and 90 days later. Patients matched by vessel occlusion, age, and time of onset demonstrated smaller strokes on presentation and better functional and radiographic outcome if found to have superior collateral flow. In multivariate analysis, lower collateral grade independently predicted higher NIHSS on arrival. CONCLUSIONS Improved collateral flow in patients with AIS undergoing endovascular therapy was associated with improved radiographic and clinical outcomes. Independent of age, vessel occlusion and time, in patients with comparable ischemic burdens, changes in collateral grade alone led to significant differences in initial stroke severity as well as ultimate clinical outcome.","Sheth, Sunil A; Sanossian, Nerses; Hao, Qing; Starkman, Sidney; Ali, Latisha K; Kim, Doojin; Gonzalez, Nestor R; Tateshima, Satoshi; Jahan, Reza; Duckwiler, Gary R; Saver, Jeffrey L; Vinuela, Fernando; Liebeskind, David S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,83,11

Materials and Methods The relevant literature data from 1900 to 2019 was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. After manual selection, each document record includes title, author, keywords, abstract, year, organization, and citation. We imported the downloaded data into CiteSpace V (version 5.5R2) to draw the knowledge map and conduct cooperative network analysis, discipline and journal analysis, cluster analysis, and burst keyword analysis. Results After manual screening, there were 285 relevant papers published in the last 28 years (from 1991 to 2019), and the number is increasing year by year. The publications of conjunctival bacteria were dedicated by 1381 authors of 451 institutions in 56 countries/regions. The United States dominates this field (82 literatures), followed by Germany (23 literatures) and Japan (23 literatures). Overall, most cited papers were published with a focus on molecular biology, genetics, nursing, and toxicology. Most papers fall into the category of ophthalmology, veterinary sciences, and pharmacology and pharmacy. The only organized cluster is the ""postantibiotic effect,"" and the top 5 keywords with the strongest citation bursts include ""postoperative endophthalmiti(s),"" ""infectious keratoconjunctiviti(s),"" ""conjunctiviti(s),"" ""resistance,"" and ""diversity"". Conclusion The global field of conjunctival bacteria has expanded in the last 28 years. The United States contributes most. However, there are little cooperation among authors and institutions. Overall, this bibliometric study organized one cluster, ""postantibiotic effect"", and identified the top 5 hotspots in conjunctival bacteria research: ""postoperative endophthalmiti(s),"" ""infectious keratoconjunctiviti(s),"" ""conjunctiviti(s),"" ""resistance,"" and ""diversity"". Thus, further research focuses on these topics that may be more helpful to prevent ocular infection and improve prophylaxis strategies to bring a benefit to patients in the near future.","Wang, Zhenyu; Huang, Chen; Li, Xuemin",BioMed research international,83,10

Here, we show dynamic changes in the buoyant density and abundance of EVs that are secreted by PC12 cells stimulated with nerve growth factor (NGF), N2A cells treated with retinoic acid to induce neural differentiation, and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) differentiated into neuronal cells. EVs secreted from in vitro differentiated cells promote neural induction of mESCs. Cyclin D1 enriched within the EVs derived from differentiated neuronal cells contributes to this induction. EVs purified from cells overexpressing cyclin D1 are more potent in neural induction of mESC cells. Depletion of cyclin D1 from the EVs reduced the neural induction effect. Our results suggest that EVs regulate neural development through sorting of cyclin D1.","Song, Lu; Tian, Xinran; Schekman, Randy",The Journal of cell biology,83,8

The transmissibility and pathogenesis of HCoV-EMC remain poorly understood, and elucidating its cellular tropism in human respiratory tissues will provide mechanistic insights into the key cellular targets for virus propagation and spread. We utilized ex vivo cultures of human bronchial and lung tissue specimens to investigate the tissue tropism and virus replication kinetics following experimental infection with HCoV-EMC compared with those following infection with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The innate immune responses elicited by HCoV-EMC were also investigated. HCoV-EMC productively replicated in human bronchial and lung ex vivo organ cultures. While SARS-CoV productively replicated in lung tissue, replication in human bronchial tissue was limited. Immunohistochemistry revealed that HCoV-EMC infected nonciliated bronchial epithelium, bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. Transmission electron microscopy showed virions within the cytoplasm of bronchial epithelial cells and budding virions from alveolar epithelial cells (type II). In contrast, there was minimal HCoV-229E infection in these tissues. HCoV-EMC failed to elicit strong type I or III interferon (IFN) or proinflammatory innate immune responses in ex vivo respiratory tissue cultures. Treatment of human lung tissue ex vivo organ cultures with type I IFNs (alpha and beta IFNs) at 1 h postinfection reduced the replication of HCoV-EMC, suggesting a potential therapeutic use of IFNs for treatment of human infection.","Chan, Renee W Y; Chan, Michael C W; Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Chan, Louisa L Y; Kuok, Denise I T; Fong, Joanne H M; Guan, Y; Poon, Leo L M; Baric, Ralph S; Nicholls, John M; Peiris, J S Malik",Journal of virology,83,23

This prospective randomized trial compared suture materials for closure of the fascia after abdominal surgery. METHODS In 456 patients the abdominal fascia was closed with either non-absorbable (polypropylene; Prolene(®)) or absorbable (polydioxanone; PDS(®)) suture material. Follow-up was by clinical examination and ultrasonography at 6-month intervals. Outcome measures were incisional hernia, surgical-site infection and suture sinus. RESULTS Some 223 patients were analysed after closure with Prolene(®) and 233 after PDS(®) . Median follow-up was 32 and 31 months respectively. There was no significant difference in the incidence of incisional hernia between the groups: 20·2 per cent (45 of 223) for Prolene(®) and 24·9 per cent (58 of 233) with PDS(®) (P = 0·229). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a cumulative rate after 4 years of 23·7 and 30·2 per cent for Prolene(®) and PDS(®) respectively (P = 0·222).

We compared the clinical and angiographic characteristics and procedural outcomes of patients with versus without history of PAD. Patients with PAD were older (67 ± 9 vs 64 ± 10 years, P < .001) and had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. They also had more complex lesions as illustrated by higher Japanese CTO score (2.7 ± 1.2 vs 2.4 ± 1.3, P < .001). In patients with PAD, the final crossing technique was less often antegrade wire escalation (40% vs 51%, P < .001) and more often the retrograde approach (23 vs 20%, P < .001) and antegrade dissection/reentry (20% vs 16%, P < .001).

OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of Evicel Fibrin Sealant (Human) to prevent CSF leakage using a 2.0-cm durotomy mongrel dog repair model and to compare the tissue response with Tisseel (a fibrin sealant) and Duraseal (a synthetic polyethylene glycol [PEG] hydrogel sealant). METHODS The canine durotomy repair model was used. This well-characterized model assesses the ability of sealants to achieve intraoperative watertight seals of the dura mater, as well as long-term safety and efficacy. This study included 27 mongrel dogs and had a 28-day duration. RESULTS The 3 sealants were 100% effective in preventing CSF leakage intraoperatively at 15 mm Hg. The 2 fibrin sealants were 100% effective in postoperative sealing; the PEG hydrogel was not. Microscopically, the tissue changes induced by Evicel at the durotomy site were similar in nature except for foamy macrophages seen only with the PEG hydrogel. The extent and severity of adhesions at 28 days were less with the fibrin sealants than with the PEG hydrogel. CONCLUSION Evicel, a fibrin sealant, was safe and effective in achieving and maintaining a watertight seal of the dura. The performance of the fibrin sealants was similar to that of the synthetic PEG hydrogel sealant with the exception of a Duraseal seal, which leaked.","Hutchinson, Richard W; Mendenhall, Vince; Abutin, Randolph M; Muench, Tim; Hart, James",Neurosurgery,83,29

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S identified from memory B cells of an individual who was infected with SARS-CoV in 2003. One antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 by engaging the S receptor-binding domain. Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants.

METHODS Surrogates of potential biological warfare agents and bacterial pathogens associated with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) were spotted on test surfaces, with and without an artificial test soil (sebum), allowed to dry, and then cleaned with different commercially available cleaning and disinfecting wipes or sterile gauze soaked in water, bleach (diluted 1:10), or 70% isopropanol. The percentage of microbial survival and an analytical estimation of remaining test soil on devices were determined. RESULTS Wipes containing sodium hypochlorite as the active ingredient and gauze soaked in bleach (1:10) were the most effective in removing both vegetative bacteria and spores. In the presence of selective disinfectants, sebum had a protective effect on vegetative bacteria, but not on spores. CONCLUSIONS The presence of sebum reduces the cleaning efficiency of some commercially available wipes for some select microbes. Various commercial wipes performed significantly better than the designated cleaning agent (70% isopropanol) in disinfecting the oximetry sensor.

This study aimed to assess the impact of anterior choroidal artery infarction in pretreatment DWI on the outcome of patients with acute intracranial ICA occlusion who underwent thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study included 113 patients with acute intracranial ICA occlusion who underwent DWI followed by thrombectomy between January 2011 and July 2016. Characteristics and outcomes were compared between the groups positive and negative for anterior choroidal artery infarction and patients with good outcomes (90-day mRS 0-2) and poor outcomes (mRS 3-6). Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of a good outcome. RESULTS On pretreatment DWI, anterior choroidal artery infarction was observed in 60 patients (53.1%). Good outcomes were significantly less frequent in the group positive for anterior choroidal artery infarction than in the group negative for it (25% versus 49.1%, P = .008). Parenchymal hemorrhage occurred only in the group positive for anterior choroidal artery infarction (13.3% versus 0%, P = .007). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of good outcome were an absence of anterior choroidal artery infarction (OR, 0.333; 95% CI, 0.135-0.824; P = .017) and successful reperfusion (OR, 5.598; 95% CI, 1.135-27.604; P = .034).

PURPOSE Cost-avoidance studies of pharmacist interventions are common and often the first type of study conducted by investigators to quantify the economic impact of clinical pharmacy services. The purpose of this primer is to provide guidance for conducting cost-avoidance studies pertaining to clinical pharmacy practice. SUMMARY Cost-avoidance studies represent a paradigm conceptually different from traditional pharmacoeconomic analysis. A cost-avoidance study reports on cost savings from a given intervention, where the savings is estimated based on a counterfactual scenario. Investigators need to determine what specifically would have happened to the patient if the intervention did not occur. This assessment can be fundamentally flawed, depending on underlying assumptions regarding the pharmacists' action and the patient trajectory. It requires careful identification of the potential consequence of nonaction, as well as probability and cost assessment. Given the uncertainty of assumptions, sensitivity analyses should be performed. A step-by-step methodology, formula for calculations, and best practice guidance is provided. CONCLUSIONS Cost-avoidance studies focused on pharmacist interventions should be considered low-level evidence. These studies are acceptable to provide pilot data for the planning of future clinical trials. The guidance provided in this article should be followed to improve the quality and validity of such investigations.","Patanwala, Asad E; Narayan, Sujita W; Haas, Curtis E; Abraham, Ivo; Sanders, Arthur; Erstad, Brian L",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,83,8

This analysis compared the safety of deutetrabenazine during titration versus maintenance. METHODS Safety was assessed during titration versus maintenance using integrated data from two 12-week placebo-controlled studies (ARM-TD and AIM-TD) and the open-label extension study. Rates were compared for overall and serious adverse events (AEs), AEs leading to discontinuation, treatment-related AEs, common AEs (≥4%), and specific AEs (parkinsonism, suicidal ideation, akathisia, restlessness). RESULTS In titration versus maintenance, AE rates with placebo (n=130) were: overall, 43.1% vs 25.4%; serious, 4.6% vs 2.3%; leading to discontinuation, 3.1% vs 0; treatment-related, 26.9% vs 10.0%. For placebo, common AEs during titration were somnolence, headache, nausea, fatigue, and dry mouth; none occurred during maintenance. In titration versus maintenance, AE rates in fixed-dose deutetrabenazine 12-36 mg (n=216) were: overall, 33.3-38.9% vs 22.2-29.2%; serious, 2.8-6.9% vs 0-1.4%; leading to discontinuation, 2.8-5.6% vs 0; treatment-related, 8.3-16.7% vs 8.3-13.9%. For fixed-dose deutetrabenazine, common AEs during titration were headache, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, depression, hypertension, and dry mouth; headache was the only common AE during maintenance. In titration versus maintenance, AE rates with flexible-dose deutetrabenazine (n=168) were: overall, 49.4% vs 32.7%; serious, 3.6% vs 2.4%; leading to discontinuation, 2.4% vs 0.6%. For flexible-dose deutetrabenazine, the only common AE during titration was somnolence; none occurred during maintenance. Rates of parkinsonism, suicidal ideation, akathisia, and restlessness were low and comparable in titration and maintenance. CONCLUSIONS Deutetrabenazine was well-tolerated, with AE rates similar to placebo during both phases; AE rates were higher during titration and decreased during maintenance.

These new predictive analytics tools are starting to change various facets of our clinical care domains including the practice of laboratory medicine. Many of these ML tools and studies are also starting to populate our literature landscape as we know it but unfamiliarity of the average reader to the basic knowledge and critical concepts within AI/ML is now demanding a need to better prepare our audience to such relatively unfamiliar concepts. A fundamental knowledge of such platforms will inevitably enhance cross-disciplinary literacy and ultimately lead to enhanced integration and understanding of such tools within our discipline. In this review, we provide a general outline of AI/ML along with an overview of the fundamental concepts of ML categories, specifically supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, since the vast majority of our current approaches within ML in laboratory medicine and health care involve supervised algorithms, we will predominantly concentrate on such platforms. Finally, the need for making such tools more accessible to the average investigator is becoming a major driving force for the need of automation within these ML platforms. This has now given rise to the automated ML (Auto-ML) world which will undoubtedly help shape the future of ML within health care. Hence, an overview of Auto-ML is also covered within this manuscript which will hopefully enrich the reader's understanding, appreciation, and the need for embracing such tools.","Rashidi, Hooman H; Tran, Nam; Albahra, Samer; Dang, Luke T",International journal of laboratory hematology,83,10

Headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique was used for the extraction and concentration of volatile compounds and the analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS Alcohols were the volatile compounds most abundantly isolated in the headspace of pumpkin purée (control and processed purées had ranges between 43-56%), followed by aldehydes (14-28%), hydrocarbons (8-13%) and terpenes (7-10%). Lipid oxidation, Maillard reaction and carotenoids degradation were the main chemical routes of formation of volatile compounds after HPT processing. Initial temperature or pressure intensity of HPT processing, within the ranges tested in this study, did not affect the initial levels of volatile compounds of pumpkin purée. CONCLUSION HPT processing is an effective technology for the preservation of the original aroma of low acid vegetables such as pumpkin. This article is protected by copyright.

It is of interest in Pediatrics because of its implications for perinatal and postnatal morbidity and mortality. Predicting birth length will be useful in anticipating and managing possible complications associated with pregnancy and birth of babies with abnormal birth length. Objective The aim was to identify easily accessible parental determinants of baby's birth length in Lagos, Nigeria, using a sample of patients attending a government hospital. Methods Parental anthropometrics and other data were obtained from 250 couples by actual measurements, oral interviews and questionnaires. Baby's birth length was measured immediately after delivery by qualified, a well-trained obstetric nurse, and association between parental and offspring parameters were assessed. Results Weight gain, maternal weight, parity and mid-parental height were the significant parental explanatory variables of offspring birth length. They were the most suitable variables for a generated model for predicting babies' birth length from parental variables in the study. Conclusion A model that might be useful for predicting babies' birth length from easily accessible parental variables was produced. This model may complement ultrasonographic data for predicting baby's birth length with a view to achieving better perinatal and postnatal care.","Taiwo, Idowu Adewumi; Adeleye, Adenike; Uzoma, Ijeoma Chinwe",African health sciences,83,1

A portion of these patients underwent dissection with a flexible endoscope in the peritoneal cavity. This pilot study mainly focused on the technical aspects and immediate results. METHODS From November 2009 to September 2010, 10 patients with cirrhosis and hypersplenism were entered into this pilot study. They were indicated to undergo laparoscopic splenectomy to treat portal hypertension and to facilitate initiation and completion of either interferon therapy for liver cirrhosis or anticancer therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. To dissect the upper end of the gastrosplenic ligament and the marginal region between the left diaphragm and upper pole of the spleen, a flexible single-channel endoscope was introduced into the peritoneal cavity simultaneously with the use of a rigid laparoscope. Dissection with the flexible endoscope in the peritoneal cavity was performed using an insulation-tipped electrosurgical knife through the channel of the flexible endoscope. RESULTS The flexible endoscope offered a magnified operative view, a water-jet lens cleaner, and a powerful lavage and suction capability. The upper end of the gastrosplenic ligament and the marginal region between the left diaphragm and upper pole of the spleen were easily seen, and dissection of these critical regions was smoothly conducted with articulation of the tip of the flexible endoscope, even in patients with splenomegaly. No patient experienced major intraoperative complications or required conversion to open surgery. CONCLUSIONS Dissection with a flexible endoscope in the peritoneal cavity may be an effective tactic for laparoscopic megasplenectomy, and significant implications for pure natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery have been raised. Although future randomized controlled prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings, surgeons might find this to be a typical example of an appropriate strategy for high-risk patients.","Tomikawa, Morimasa; Akahoshi, Tomohiko; Kinjo, Nao; Uehara, Hideo; Hashimoto, Naotaka; Nagao, Yoshihiro; Kamori, Masahiro; Kumashiro, Ryuichi; Maehara, Yoshihiko; Hashizume, Makoto",Surgical endoscopy,83,1

Oral health services were limited to only essential services. Non-urgent treatments were postponed. This study described the management of urgent dental care in northern Italy during the lockdown, with a particular focus on the Province of Brescia. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was administered to Italian dentists at the end of the lockdown (May 3, 2020). A total of 1,407 dentists answered the survey. RESULTS A total of 1,205 dentists were included. Most of the respondents were dental owners (73.6%). About 79.7% of the dentists handled urgencies during the lockdown. The number of urgencies treated weekly was lower than that generally handled before the COVID-19 outbreak (p < 0.001). Many dentists (81.2%) provided telephone consultations to evaluate symptoms. Pulpitis and abscesses were the most common urgencies (44.7% and 40.2%, respectively). Furthermore, 95% of dentists wore masks, protective eyewear, and surgical gloves while delivering non-postponable treatments. The FFP2 mask was used by 41.8% and 41.7% of owners and dental assistants respectively. Financial concerns, risk of contagion, and PPE supply were indicated as the main current concerns. CONCLUSIONS Our survey showed that Italian dentists took protective measures during the lockdown, thus minimizing risk of contagion for dental healthcare personnel and patients. Many precautionary guidelines are now available, but a high uncertainty persists about dental health delivery during the pandemic.","Salgarello, Stefano; Salvadori, Matteo; Mazzoleni, Francesco; Salvalai, Viviana; Francinelli, Jacopo; Bertoletti, Paolo; Lorenzi, Daniele; Audino, Elisabetta; Garo, Maria Luisa",Journal of endodontics,83,1

METHODS To compare the outcomes between the open and SILTEP groups, we performed propensity score matching to adjust for significant differences in patient characteristics. The outcomes were compared between the matched groups. RESULTS Record review identified 477 patients who had undergone inguinal hernia repair from November 2016 to November 2018. Seventy-one patients were excluded from the propensity score matching because of age <18, femoral hernia, conventional 3-port laparoscopic repair, incarcerated hernia, and combined operation. SILTEP in 142 and open repair in 264 patients were identified. After propensity score matching, these individuals were grouped into 82 pairs. Spinal anesthesia was administered more often in the open group than in the SILTEP group. Operation time was significantly longer in the SILTEP group than in the open group (49.6 ± 17.4 vs. 64.8 ± 28.4 min, p < 0.001). However, urinary retention rates of the open group were significantly higher than that of the SILTEP group (11.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.003). The SILTEP group showed significantly lower pain scores at postoperative 6, 12, and 24 hours, and significantly lower rates of intravenous analgesic requirements through postoperative day 1 (30.5% vs. 13.4%, p = 0.008) compared with the open group. CONCLUSION The outcomes of SILTEP repair were comparable to those of open repair. SILTEP repair may have advantages over open repair for reducing immediate postoperative pain (≤24 hours).","Lee, Kanghee; Lee, Jin Ho; Nam, Soomin; Chong, Jae Uk; Lee, Hyung Soon",PloS one,83,26

Base changes, deletions and compensatory alteration constructed in and around the hairpin in the region of the turnip crinkle virus genomic RNA involved in recombination support the importance of the hairpin for normal crossover site selection.

We assessed the association of COVID-19 with ageing and non-communicable diseases. METHODS: We extracted data regarding non-communicable disease, particularly cardiovascular disease, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE) from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2017. We obtained data of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and tests from the Our World in Data database as of May 28, 2020. Potential confounders of pandemic outcomes analyzed include institutional lockdown delay, hemispheric geographical location, and number of tourists. We compared all countries according to GBD classification and World Bank income level. We assessed the correlation between independent variables associated with COVID-19 caseload and mortality using Spearman's rank correlation and adjusted mixed model analysis. FINDINGS: High-income had the highest, and the Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania region had the least cases per million population (3050.60 vs. 63.86). Sub-saharan region has reported the lowest number of COVID-19 mortality (1.9). Median delay to lockdown initiation varied from one day following the first case in Latin America and Caribbean region, to 34 days in Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania. Globally, non-communicable disease DALYs were correlated with COVID-19 cases (râ¯=â¯0.32, p<0.001) and deaths (râ¯=â¯0.37, p<0.001). HALE correlated with COVID-19 cases (râ¯=â¯0.63, p<0.001) and deaths (râ¯=â¯0.61, p<0.001). HALE was independently associated with COVID-19 case rate and the number of tourists was associated with COVID-19 mortality in the adjusted model. INTERPRETATION: Preventive measures against COVID-19 should protect the public from the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, particularly in the elderly. In addition to active COVID-19 surveillance, policymakers should utilize this evidence as a guide for prevention and coordination of health services. This model is timely, as many countries have begun to reduce social isolation.","Azarpazhooh, M Reza; Morovatdar, Negar; Avan, Abolfazl; Phan, Thanh G; Divani, Afshin A; Yassi, Nawaf; Stranges, Saverio; Silver, Brian; Biller, José; Tokazebani Belasi, Masoud; Kazemi Neya, Sepideh; Khorram, Bita; Frydman, Asher; Nilanont, Yongchai; Onorati, Elisa; Di Napoli, Mario",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,83,33

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses able to infect a great number of hosts. Entrance of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the surface (S) protein interaction with host ACE2 protein and cleavage by TMPRSS2. ACE2 could be a species-specific barrier that interferes with bat-to-human coronavirus cross-species transmission. Molecular analysis supported bats as natural hosts for SARS-CoV and involved them in MERS-CoV origin. The genomic similarity between bat RaTG13 CoV strain and SARS-CoV-2 implicates bats in the origin of the new outbreak. Additionally, there is a hypothesis for the zoonotic transmission based on contact with Malayan pangolins by humans in Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, China. To investigate bats and pangolin as hosts in SARS-CoV-2 cross-species transmission, we perform an evolutionary analysis combining viral and host phylogenies and divergence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 amino acid sequences between CoV hosts. Phylogeny showed SARS-like-CoV-2 strains that infected pangolin and bats are close to SARS-CoV-2. In contrast to TMPRSS2, pangolin ACE2 amino acid sequence has low evolutionary divergence compared with humans and is more divergent from bats. Comparing SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 origins, pangolin has yet lower ACE2 evolutionary divergence with humans than civet-the main intermediary host of SARS-CoV. Thus, pangolin has become an opportune host to intermediates bat-to-human SARS-CoV-2 jump and entry.","Lopes, Luciano Rodrigo; de Mattos Cardillo, Giancarlo; Paiva, Paulo Bandiera",Braz J Microbiol,83,30

To conserve PPE, reduce the spread of the virus, and keep student learners safe, leaders of medical schools across the country made the difficult decision to suspend in-person clinical experiences. As medical students were sent home and hospital systems ramped up their response to the virus, many essential health care workers (HCWs) faced an immediate challenge. As ""non-essential"" services such as schools and daycare centers abruptly closed, HCWs serving on the frontlines in inpatient settings needed a way to both fight the pandemic and care for their children. APPROACH: Medical students at Oregon Health & Science University were able to rapidly organize to provide childcare for essential HCWs. For roughly eight weeks following the state of emergency (March 13 through May 15, 2020) students used Twitter and emerging technology to match families in need of childcare with a trainee volunteer. OUTCOMES: By May 15th, the service had successfully fulfilled 181 of the 202 requests for childcare (90%) over the course of 8 weeks. Of the 181 completed childcare requests, 172 (95%) were fulfilled by an individual (1:1 volunteer-to-household pairing), and 9 (5%) were fulfilled by two or more volunteers. NEXT STEPS: The trainees who provided childcare will apply the skills learned (e.g., clear communication, grassroots organizing, triaging, leveraging new technology) to patient care. Broader applications for this system include organizing volunteers to conduct contract tracing or to provide public health information in languages other than English. Future research includes examining the effect of the service on the productivity, morale, and mental health of both those who provided and received childcare.","Lane, Emily C A; Tran, Audrey A; Graulty, Christian J; Bumsted, Tracy",Acad. med,83,16

There is an urgent need for developing therapeutic drugs and (or) biologics to prevent the spread of the virus. The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 shows that the virus enters host cells by first binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Therefore, blocking the binding between of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD can inhibit the virus infection in the host cells. In this study, by grafting the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of developed SARS-CoV, MERS-CoVs specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as SARS-CoV-2 mAbs onto a known stable nanobody (Nb) scaffold, and a total of 16 Nbs sequences were designed. Five Nbs, namely CS01, CS02, CS03, CS10, and CS16, were selected based on the free energy landscape of protein docking verified by the recently reported Nb-RBD cocrystal structures. CS01, CS02, and CS03 occupied the ACE2 binding site of RBD, while CS10 and CS16 were proposed to inhibit the interaction between RBD and ACE2 through an allosteric mechanism. Based on the structures of the five Nbs in complex with RBD, seven brand-new Nbs with enhanced binding affinities (CS02_RD01, CS03_RD01, CS03_RD02, CS03_RD03, CS03_RD04, CS16_RD01, and CS16_RD02) were generated by redesign of residues on the interface of the five Nbs contact with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. In addition, the identified ""hot spots"" on the interface of each complex provide useful information to understand the binding mechanism of designed Nbs to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. In sum, the predicted stabilities and high binding affinities of the 11 (re)designed Nbs indicating the potential of the developed computational framework in this work to design effective agents to block the infection of SARS-CoV-2.","Yang, Jingyi; Zhang, Zhao; Yang, Fengyuan; Zhang, Haiwei; Wu, Haibo; Zhu, Feng; Xue, Weiwei",Chem Biol Drug Des,83,29

We propose to improve telehealth systems' features to include the ability to serve patients with their needs, operating as human caregivers. The objective is to support the independent living of patients at home without losing the opportunity to monitor their health status. Application scenarios are several, and they spread from simple clinical assisting scenarios to an emergency one. For instance, in the case of a nursing home, the system would support in continuously monitoring the elderly patients. In contrast, in the case of an epidemic diffusion, such as COVID-19 pandemic, the system may help in all the early triage phases, significantly reducing the risk of contagion. However, the system has to let medical assistants perform actions remotely such as changing therapies or interacting with patients that need support. The paper proposes and describes a multi-agent architecture for intelligent medical care. We propose to use the beliefs-desires-intentions agent architecture, part of it is devised to be deployed in a robot. The result is an intelligent system that may allow robots the ability to select the most useful plan for unhandled situations and to communicate the choice to the physician for his validation and permission.","Lanza, Francesco; Seidita, Valeria; Chella, Antonio",J Biomed Inform,83,24

A nationwide snapshot of the management of HPB minimally invasive surgery activity during COVID-19 pandemic is provided: a survey was developed and conducted within AICEP (Italian Association of HepatoBilioPancreatic Surgeons) with the final aim of conveying the experience, knowledge, and opinions into a unitary report enabling more efficient crisis management. Results from the survey (81 respondents) show that, in Italian hospitals, minimally invasive surgery maintains its role despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with the registered reduction of cases being proportional to the overall reduction of the HPB surgical activity. Respondents agree that the switch from minimally invasive to open technique can be considered as a valid option for cases with a high technical complexity. Several issues merit specific attention: screening for virus positivity should be universally performed; only expert surgical teams should operate on positive patients and specific technical measures to lower the biological risk of contamination during surgery must be followed. Future studies specifically designed to establish the true risks in minimally invasive surgery are suggested. Furthermore, a standard and univocal process of prioritization of patients from Regional Healthcare Systems is advisable.","Aldrighetti, Luca; Boggi, Ugo; Falconi, Massimo; Giuliante, Felice; Cipriani, Federica; Ratti, Francesca; Torzilli, Guido",Updates surg.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: As part of a multi-institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID-19 infections who had undergone chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher's exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions. RESULTS: Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill-defined and were composed of mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground-glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p < 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground-glass opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had normal chest radiographs.","Yoon, Soon Ho; Lee, Kyung Hee; Kim, Jin Yong; Lee, Young Kyung; Ko, Hongseok; Kim, Ki Hwan; Park, Chang Min; Kim, Yun Hyeon",Korean J Radiol,83,25

Under low energy demand, the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) is particularly sensitive to added energy supply (i.e., reductive stress) which exponentially increases the rate of H2O2 (JH2O2) production. H2O2 is reduced to H2O by electrons supplied by NADPH. NADP+ is reduced back to NADPH by activation of mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT). The coupling of reductive stress-induced JH2O2 production to NNT-linked redox buffering circuits provides a potential means of integrating energy balance with energy expenditure. To test this hypothesis, energy supply was manipulated by varying flux rate through ß-oxidation in muscle mitochondria minus/plus pharmacological or genetic inhibition of redox buffering circuits. Here we show during both non-ADP and low-ADP stimulated respiration that accelerating flux through ß-oxidation generates a corresponding increase in mitochondrial JH2O2 production, that the majority (â¼70-80%) of H2O2 produced is reduced to H2O by electrons drawn from redox buffering circuits supplied by NADPH, and that the rate of electron flux through redox buffering circuits is directly linked to changes in oxygen consumption mediated by NNT. These findings provide evidence that redox reactions within ß-oxidation and the ETS serve as a barometer of substrate flux relative to demand, continuously adjusting JH2O2 production and, in turn, the rate at which energy is expended via NNT-mediated proton conductance. This variable flux through redox circuits provides a potential compensatory mechanism for fine-tuning energy expenditure to energy balance in real-time.","Smith, Cody D; Schmidt, Cameron A; Lin, Chien-Te; Fisher-Wellman, Kelsey H; Neufer, P Darrell",J. biol. chem,83,30

Yet little research provides evidence of the effectiveness of a green stimulus. We begin by summarizing recent research on the effectiveness of the green portion of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on employment growth. Green investments are most effective in communities whose workers have the appropriate ""green"" skills. We then provide new evidence on the skills requirements of both green and brown occupations, as well as from occupations at risk of job losses due to COVID-19, to illustrate which workers are most likely to benefit from a pandemic-related green stimulus. We find similarities between some energy sector workers and green jobs, but a poor match between green jobs and occupations at risk due to COVID-19.

Because seminal plasma creates the environment for the proper functioning of spermatozoa, in this study, we verified the associations among standard spermiograms, seminal biochemical parameters (neutral alpha-glucosidase, fructose, and citric acid) and oxidative stress markers (total antioxidant capacity, catalase activity, superoxide dismutase activity, and malondialdehyde concentration) in distinct entities associated with male infertility with and without long-time exposure to local hyperthermia. We demonstrated that men exposed to prolonged environmental or clinically recognized local heat stress in adulthood may suffer from dysregulation of seminal antioxidant components, which can be directly associated with epididymal and prostate function. The comparative analysis of the studied parameters showed numerous correlations among all biochemical parameters (particularly neutral alpha-glucosidase) with low standard semen quality in almost all the investigated infertile groups. In light of the data obtained in this originally designed study, we conclude that more attention should be paid to the epididymis and accessory gland function in subfertile and infertile men exposed to genital heat stress, especially in the context of novel treatment algorithms (targeted therapies).","Fraczek, Monika; Wojnar, Lukasz; Kamieniczna, Marzena; Piasecka, Malgorzata; Gill, Kamil; Kups, Michal; Chopyak, Valentina; Havrylyuk, Anna; Nakonechnyy, Jozef; Nakonechnyy, Andrij; Wozniak, Tomasz; Kurpisz, Maciej",,83,14

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is an important factor that can affect the health and work quality of nurses. However, there is a lack of big-sample studies exploring factors that affect the insomnia of nurses fighting against COVID-19. METHOD: This cross-sectional study using the Ascension Insomnia Scale, Fatigue Scale-14 and Perceived Stress Scale took place in March 2020. Participants were 1,794 front-line nurses from four tertiary-level general hospitals. RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia among participants was 52.8%. Insomnia was predicted by gender, working experience, chronic diseases, midday nap duration, direct participation in the rescue of patients with COVID-19, frequency of night shifts, professional psychological assistance during the pandemic, negative experiences (such as family, friends or colleagues being seriously ill or dying due to COVID-19), the degree of fear of COVID-19, fatigue and perceived stress. CONCLUSION: The level of insomnia among participants was higher than the normal level. Interventions based on influencing factors should be implemented to ensure nurses' sleep quality. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: An in-depth understanding of the influencing factors of insomnia among front-line nurses can help nurse managers develop solutions to improve front-line nurses' sleep quality, which will enhance the physical and mental conditions of nurses and promote the quality of care.","Zhan, Yuxin; Liu, Yunfang; Liu, Huan; Li, Mei; Shen, Yue; Gui, Lingli; Zhang, Jun; Luo, Zhihua; Tao, Xiubin; Yu, Jiaohua",J Nurs Manag,83,24

What is needed is a discussion that considers the subjective reality and resources as well as risks. OBJECTIVE: The study focused on the perspectives of older people. The aim was to shed light on their subjective experience of the corona pandemic. The questions were how they experienced the pandemic, the risks, consequences and protective measures, to what extent these affected their everyday life and how they dealt with it. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 12 guideline-based telephone interviews were conducted in May and June 2020 with 9 women and 3 men between 77 and 91 years of age, who lived in their own homes, had impaired health and needed help and care. The data were evaluated by structuring content analysis. RESULTS: The respondents were generally concerned about the corona pandemic but considered their own risk to be low. They saw themselves as hardly affected by the immediate consequences of the crisis or severely restricted in their everyday lives. They experienced insecurity in social life and fear of loneliness was central. Overall, they considered the protective measures to be appropriate but criticized early cancelling, family contact restrictions and dealing with the dying.

The proposed approach is designed for the setting where both the response and covariates are themselves block maxima, and thus contrarily to standard regression methods it takes into account the key fact that the limiting distribution of suitably standardized componentwise maxima is an extreme value copula. An important target in the proposed framework is the regression manifold, which consists of a family of regression lines obeying the latter asymptotic result. To learn about the proposed model from data, we employ a Bernstein polynomial prior on the space of angular densities which leads to an induced prior on the space of regression manifolds. Numerical studies suggest a good performance of the proposed methods, and a finance real-data illustration reveals interesting aspects on the comovements of extreme losses between two leading stock markets.","Carvalho, Miguel de; Reis, Gonccalo dos; Kumukova, Alina",,83,30

Recently, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed to kill millions of people worldwide and is dangerous to society health, survival, and livelihood. The people with cardiovascular problems are noticed as most common patients of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a greater risk of mortality and morbidity in these patients than other patients of COVID-19. In the heart, expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and response effect of hyperactivity with angiotensin II associated to the renin-angiotensin mechanism are key factors of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and congestive heart failure. Recent Findings: Mortality rates have been observed about 10.5% cases in patients with cardiovascular disease; however, a mortality rate of 52% was recorded in patients with heart failure, while 12% recovered ultimately. The occupancy of intense injury controlled by troponin elevation was a noteworthy factor in relation to mortality. Among 187 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, about 35% were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD) history and 28% with raised troponin. Troponin elevation was identified more frequently (55%) in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Mortality rate in patients without cardiovascular diseases and normal troponin was 7.6%, normal troponin and cardiovascular disease with 13.3%, augmented troponin and without cardiovascular disease 37.5%, however 69.4% among cardiovascular disease and advanced troponin. Summary: The study reflected a significant association of case fatality rate (CFR) to COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular diseases which supposed to be the most common dangerous risk factor and health challenge during the current pandemic situation.","Dan, Siddhartha; Pant, Mohit; Upadhyay, Sushil Kumar",Curr Pharmacol Rep,83,16

However, its role in the regulation of lateral root formation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the apple SUMO E3 ligase MdSIZ1 promotes lateral root formation. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, the auxin response factor MdARF8 was screened out as a protein-protein interaction partner of the SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme MdSCE1, indicating that MdARF8 may be a substrate for MdSIZ1. The interaction between MdARF8 and MdSCE1 was confirmed by pull-down, Y2H, and Co-IP assays. MdSIZ1 enhanced the conjugating enzyme activity of MdSCE1 to form a MdSCE1-MdSIZ1-MdARF8 complex, thereby facilitating SUMO modification. We identified two arginine substitution mutations at K342 and K380 in MdARF8 that blocked MdSIZ1-mediated SUMOylation, indicating that K342 and K380 are the principal SUMOylation sites of the MdARF8 protein. Moreover, MdARF8 promoted lateral root formation in transgenic apple plants, and the phenotype of reduced lateral roots in the Arabidopsis siz1-2 mutant was restored in siz1-2/MdARF8 complementary plants. Our findings reveal an important role for sumoylation in the regulation of lateral root formation in plants.","Zhang, Chun-Ling; Wang, Gui-Luan; Zhang, Ya-Li; Hu, Xing; Zhou, Li-Jie; You, Chun-Xiang; Li, Yuan-Yuan; Hao, Yu-Jin",,83,20

The patient was diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection by a quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test. Three months after his clinic visit, he had regained most of his pre-COVID-19 level of health. However, qRT-PCR tests continued to be positive. At day 111, specimens from a nasopharyngeal swab and sputum were inoculated into VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.(1) Three to five days post-inoculation, cytopathic effects were observed, and viral RNA was detected in the culture supernatant by qRT-PCR (Ct values: 29-37). The culture supernatant of the VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells cocultured with the nasopharyngeal swab was passaged to the fresh VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, and after 3 days of the passage, cytopathic effect was observed again. In the supernatant of the passaged cell culture, viral RNA was detected by qRT-PCR (Ct value: 29). By sequencing the qRT-PCR product using Illumina iSEQ100, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence was verified. These results indicate the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal specimen even at day 111. Although SARS-CoV-2 was present, the patient developed neutralizing antibodies by a microtiter method. We tested but did not isolate SARS-CoV-2 in samples of saliva, urine, blood, or stool. Patients with ongoing symptoms of COVID-19, long-haulers, could be chronically infected with COVID-19, although they might be incapable of transmission.","Abe, Toshikazu; Ikeda, Terumasa; Tokuda, Yasuharu; Ito, Jumpei; Suzuki, Yutaka; Narahara, Chisato; Iriyama, Hiroki; Sato, Kei",QJM,83,6

The cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the status of dental caries and associated factors in Tibetan adults. METHODS: Participants aged 35-44, 55-64 and 65-74 years were selected. Decayed, missing, and filled tooth (DMFT), decayed and filled root (DF-Root) and root canal index (RCI) were used to evaluate dental caries. Questionnaire survey on demographic information, socioeconomic status, dietary habits, and oral health knowledge and behavior was conducted. Mann-Whitney U test, logistic regression were used for the statistical analyses. RESULTS: A total of 446 participants were enrolled in the survey. Of these: 222 (49.8%) were females, 224 (50.2%) were males; 149 (33.4%), 151 (33.9%), 146 (32.7%) were aged 35-44, 55-64 and 65-74 years respectively. The mean DMFT (SD) was 7.62 (4.84), 12.46 (8.16), and 21.38 (8.93). The filling rate was very low in all age groups (1.77%, 0.98%, 0.45%). The mean DF-Root (SD) was 0.50 (1.04), 1.04 (2.02), 1.32 (2.14), respectively. Root caries index was 42.27, 44.78 and 57.60%. Older age (65-74 age group) was positively associated with crown caries (odds ratio = 31.20, 95% confidence interval: 10.70-90.96). College degree and above and brushing teeth at least once a day were negatively associated with crown caries (odds ratio = 0.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.09-0.89; odds ratio = 0.39, 95% confidence interval: 0.21-0.72, respectively). Rural area, high income level and brushing teeth at least once a day were negatively and tooth with attachment loss was positively associated with root caries. CONCLUSIONS: The status of dental caries in the adults in Tibet is severe and the treatment rate is very low. The study suggests a correlation between crown caries and the variables age, level of education and frequency of tooth brushing; correlation between root caries and residence, income level, frequency of tooth brushing and exposed root surfaces. These findings could be as reference to develop community based interventions to reduce the prevalence of caries in Tibet.","Guan, Lingxia; Guo, Jing; Ban, Jinghao; Li, Gang; Tong, Juan; Chuan, Aiyun; Tian, Tian; Han, Bing; Xuan, Kun; Wang, Shengchao",BMC Oral Health,83,1

METHODS: We tested whether serologically proven prior DENV infection diagnosed in September-October 2019, before the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinically apparent COVID-19 over the next 13 months in a population-based cohort in Amazonian Brazil. Mixed-effects multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of infection and disease, adjusting for potential individual and household-level confounders. Virus genomes from 14 local SARS-CoV-2 isolates were obtained using whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: Anti-DENV IgG was found in 37.0% of 1,285 cohort participants (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.3% to 39.7%) in 2019, with 10.4 (95% CI, 6.7 to 15.5) seroconversion events per 100 person-years during the follow-up. In 2020, 35.2% of the participants (95% CI, 32.6% to 37.8%) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 57.1% of the 448 SARS-CoV-2 seropositives (95% CI, 52.4% to 61.8%) reported clinical manifestations at the time of infection. Participants aged >60 y were twice more likely to have symptomatic COVID-19 than under-five children. Locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates were assigned to the B.1.1.33 lineage. Contrary to the cross-protection hypothesis, prior DENV infection was associated with twice the risk of clinically apparent COVID-19 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, with P values between 0.025 and 0.039 after adjustment for identified confounders. CONCLUSION: Higher risk of clinically apparent COVID-19 among individuals with prior dengue has important public health implications for communities sequentially exposed to DENV and SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.","Nicolete, Vanessa C; Rodrigues, Priscila T; Johansen, Igor C; Corder, Rodrigo M; Tonini, Juliana; Cardoso, Marly A; de Jesus, Jaqueline G; Claro, Ingra M; Faria, Nuno R; Sabino, Ester C; Castro, Marcia C; Ferreira, Marcelo U",Clin. infect. dis,83,16

The virus acts on various systems of our body, and one of them is the ReninAngiotensin system. It is supposed that the virus causes cell injury by acting on Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors which causes an increase in the level of Angiotensin II, leading to inflammation and lung injury. An essential vitamin can prevent this in our body that is vitamin D. It acts on Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) by inhibiting the action of renin and also by increasing production of ACE2 and hence Angiotensin II level decreases which prevent inflammation and lung injury.

Rapid increases in cybercrime linked to the financial services market have driven financial market regulators to pass novel laws and regulations aimed at curbing the rate of occurrence of cybercrimes connected to personal data sharing. To that end, banks and/or financial services companies in Europe have swiftly moved to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. Whilst personal data protection regulation is not a new concept in Europe, most African countries (with exception of South Africa) do not have laws and regulations on personal data protection. With the financial services market being extremely vulnerable to cyber risks owing to the digitisation of the financial services sector, it is important to assess the suitability of South Africa's current regulatory framework concerning the protection of personal data. This article thus examines South Africa's Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 with a view to ascertaining its suitability and/or adequacy in protecting personal data in the country's financial services market. With the global Covid-19 pandemic bringing about concerns related to rapid increases in cyber-attacks in the financial services market owing to the increased sharing of the sensitive personal data of consumers, there is also need to test the POPIA's conformity with the strict European Union GDPR personal data protection guidelines. © 2021, North-West Unversity.

There are two ways in which they could work. Firstly, to protect the person wearing the mask, and secondly, to reduce the likelihood of the person wearing the mask passing the disease on to anyone else. This is not an easy issue to address and many factors come into play such as droplet size, aerosol transmission and the viral load, as well as the specific properties of any given mask. The method used in this study was to measure the change in relative humidity when wearing a mask, compared to no mask, in various scenarios, based on the assumption that as the virus is air-borne the smaller the increase in humidity the less the spread of the virus. The results above show that the use of a mask, excluding some simple home-made ones, significantly reduces the spread of humidity. However, their effectiveness is device specific and needs to be considered in greater detail for each type of mask, especially the direction of escaping air when forward flow is blocked.","Swain, Ian D",J Med Eng Technol,83,6

While many model interpretation approaches return top important features to help interpret model predictions, these top features may not be well-organized or intuitive to end users, which limits model adoption rates. In this paper, we propose Intellige, a user-facing model explainer that creates user-digestible interpretations and insights reflecting the rationale behind model predictions. Intellige builds an end-to-end pipeline from machine learning platforms to end user platforms, and provides users with an interface for implementing model interpretation approaches and for customizing narrative insights. Intellige is a platform consisting of four components: Model Importer, Model Interpreter, Narrative Generator, and Narrative Exporter. We describe these components, and then demonstrate the effectiveness of Intellige through use cases at LinkedIn. Quantitative performance analyses indicate that Intellige's narrative insights lead to lifts in adoption rates of predictive model recommendations, as well as to increases in downstream key metrics such as revenue when compared to previous approaches, while qualitative analyses indicate positive feedback from end users.","Yang, Jilei; Negoescu, Diana; Ahammad, Parvez",,83,16

These agents enable the automation of multiple tasks, saving time and (human) effort. However, their presence in social settings raises the need for a better understanding of their effect on social interactions and how they may be used to enhance cooperation towards the public good, instead of hindering it. To this end, we present an experimental study of human delegation to autonomous agents and hybrid human-agent interactions centered on a public goods dilemma shaped by a collective risk. Our aim to understand experimentally whether the presence of autonomous agents has a positive or negative impact on social behaviour, fairness and cooperation in such a dilemma. Our results show that cooperation increases when participants delegate their actions to an artificial agent that plays on their behalf. Yet, this positive effect is reduced when humans interact in hybrid human-agent groups. Finally, we show that humans are biased towards agent behaviour, assuming that they will contribute less to the collective effort.","Domingos, Elias Fern'andez; Terrucha, Ines; Suchon, R'emi; Gruji'c, Jelena; Burguillo, Juan C.; Santos, Francisco C.; Lenaerts, Tom",,83,6

The disease has since spread globally. Many countries have instated measures to slow the spread of the virus. Information about the spread of the virus in a country can inform the gradual reopening of a country and help to avoid a second wave of infections. Our study focuses on Denmark, which is opening up when this study is performed (end-May 2020) after a lockdown in mid-March. METHODS: We perform a phylogenetic analysis of 742 publicly available Danish SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and put them into context using sequences from other countries. RESULTS: Our findings are consistent with several introductions of the virus to Denmark from independent sources. We identify several chains of mutations that occurred in Denmark. In at least one case we find evidence that the virus spread from Denmark to other countries. A number of the mutations found in Denmark are non-synonymous, and in general there is a considerable variety of strains. The proportions of the most common haplotypes remain stable after lockdown. CONCLUSION: Employing phylogenetic methods on Danish genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2, we exemplify how genetic data can be used to trace the introduction of a virus to a country. This provides alternative means for verifying existing assumptions. For example, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the virus was brought to Denmark by skiers returning from Ischgl. On the other hand, we identify transmission routes which suggest that Denmark was part of a network of countries among which the virus was being transmitted. This challenges the common narrative that Denmark only got infected from abroad. Our analysis concerning the ratio of haplotypes does not indicate that the major haplotypes appearing in Denmark have a different degree of virality.","Bluhm, Andreas; Christandl, Matthias; Gesmundo, Fulvio; Ravn Klausen, Frederik; Mancinska, Laura; Steffan, Vincent; Stilck França, Daniel; Werner, Albert H",PLoS One,83,16

Evaluation of intra-operative surgical margins forms an important step especially in cases with planned close margins or intercalary resections. Techniques such as imprint cytology can be preferred over frozen sections for evaluation of the surgical margins especially in COVID-19 positive patients. The advantages it offers such as completion of the procedure within the operation room complex, no generation of aerosols, and almost equal sensitivity and specificity when compared with frozen section method do warrant a modification of current surgical practice in the current health crisis especially in resource-constrained nations.

The disinfection properties of Ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the 200-300 nm have been long known and documented. Many solutions using UV radiation, such as cavity disinfection and whole room decontamination between uses, are in use in various industries, including healthcare. Here we propose a portable wearable device which can safely, efficiently and economically, continuously disinfect inhaled/exhaled air using UV radiation with possible 99.99% virus elimination. We utilize UV radiation in the 260 nm range where no ozone is produced, and because of the self-contained UV chamber, there would be no UV exposure to the user. We have optimized the cavity design such that an amplification of 10-50 times the irradiated UV power may be obtained. This is crucial in ensuring enough UV dosage is delivered to the air flow during breathing. Further, due to the turbulent nature of airflow, a series of cavities is proposed to ensure efficient actual disinfection. The Personal Ultraviolet Respiratory Germ Eliminating Machine (PUR$\diamond$GEM) can be worn by people or attached to devices such as ventilator exhausts/intakes, or be used free-standing as a portable local air disinfection unit, offering modularity with multiple avenues of usage.

As people across the world adjust to social distancing measures, there is the need to understand consequences of social distancing measures on mental health. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the association between adherence to social distancing measures and feeling worried/anxious among female caregivers of children ages zero-to-five. Methods Data for this study came from an online survey that was administered between May and June 2020 to understand stress and mental health among caregivers of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 358 female caregivers was analyzed using binary logistic regression with feeling worried/anxious as the outcome variable. Results More than a third of the female caregivers (35.2%) reported feeling worried/anxious during the past month and about 42% reported strictly adhering to social distancing measures. Controlling for the effect of other factors, caregivers who reported strictly adhering to social distancing had 1.86 times higher odds of feeling worried/anxious when compared caregivers who were not strictly adhering to social distancing (AOR=1.86, 95% C.I.=1.07-3.24). Caregivers who felt bothered by withdrawal from activities of interest had 4.11 times higher odds of reporting feeling worried/anxious (AOR=4.11, 95% C.I.=2.32-7.24). Conclusions As COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it is important to build community response to better support caregivers of infants and young children. Implications for practice, policy, and research as they relate to caregiver's mental health are discussed.","Baiden, Philip LaBrenz Catherine A.; Findley, Erin",Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,83,16

The objective of this study was to determine the level of inactivation provided by hot-air drying on a Salmonella cocktail inoculated onto apple cubes and to evaluate the performance of Enterococcus faecium as a surrogate. A Salmonella cocktail ( S. Agona, S. Tennessee, S. Montevideo, S. Mbandaka and S.

Apple cubes were dried at 104°C or 135°C in ~1.5 kg batches using a hot-air dryer with a vertically directed heat source and without mixing. Three subsamples, consisting of 4 inoculated cubes, were enumerated at each time point (n &#8805; 5) from multiple product bed depths. Water activity decreased throughout the duration of the study with samples at 135°C drying faster than 104°C. Samples at the bottom bed depth, closer to the heat source, dried faster than those at the higher bed depth, regardless of temperature. Significant microbial inactivation was not seen immediately. It took >10 min at the bottom bed depth or > 40 min of drying at the top bed depth, regardless of temperature (p < 0.05). By the end of drying average Salmonella inactivation of greater than 5 log CFU/sample was achieved. At temperature conditions evaluated, E. faecium inactivation was slower than Salmonella , indicating that it would likely serve as a good surrogate for in-plant validation studies. Case hardening did not inhibit microbial inactivation in the conditions tested. Hot-air drying under the conditions evaluated may provide a preventive control in the production of dehydrated products, such as apples.","Grasso-Kelley, Elizabeth; Liu, Xiyang; Halik, Lindsay; Douglas, Becky",J. foof prot,83,16

In this paper, we explore the usage of deep learning models as a ubiquitous, low-cost, pre-testing method for detecting COVID-19 from audio recordings of breathing or coughing taken with mobile devices or via the web. We adapt an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks that utilise raw breathing and coughing audio and spectrograms to classify if a speaker is infected with COVID-19 or not. The different models are obtained via automatic hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimisation combined with HyperBand. The proposed method outperforms a traditional baseline approach by a large margin. Ultimately, it achieves an Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) of 74.9%, or an Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) of 80.7% by ensembling neural networks, considering the best test set result across breathing and coughing in a strictly subject independent manner. In isolation, breathing sounds thereby appear slightly better suited than coughing ones (76.1% vs 73.7% UAR).","Schuller, Bjorn W.; Coppock, Harry; Gaskell, Alexander",,83,20

Across all disciplines, unique and novel modes of presentation with substantial morbidity and mortality are being encountered, and growing evidence suggests that psychiatric comorbidity is likely among COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to broaden the current discussion on the psychiatric sequalae of COVID-19, which has largely focused on anxiety, and examine the recently documented psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 infection, the secondary effects of the pandemic on public mental health, and future psychiatric conditions that may arise due to COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an in-depth review of the current global psychiatric literature and describe the wide range of psychopathological presentations reported among past COVID-19 patients worldwide and those that are expected to emerge. RESULTS: Current discussions in the psychiatric literature on COVID-19 report anxiety and anxiety disorders as a predominant set of clinical presentations during the pandemic. The impacts of direct COVID-19 infection, associated psychopathological sequelae, and drastic lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa, are associated with a broad range of psychopathologies and other neuropsychiatric presentations. Pre-existing societal conditions and burdens on the health system in South Africa prompt healthcare providers and public health planners to accordingly prepare for the expected rise in new psychiatric presentations. CONCLUSION: Greater awareness of the various psychiatric conditions attributed to COVID-19 infection may allow for earlier screening, more effective treatment, and greater positive health outcomes and better prepare health systems to address the growing pandemic in South Africa.","Subramaney, U.; Kim, A.

This study examines a case of clustering that occurred in a courtroom, in which 5 of the 10 participants were tested positive within days of the hearing. Ventilation loss rates and dispersion of fine aerosols were measured through CO2 injections and lactose aerosol generation. Emission rate and influencing parameters were then computed using a well-mixed dispersion model. The emission rate from the index case was estimated at 130 quanta h-1 (interquartile (97-155 quanta h-1 ). Measured lactose concentrations in the room were found relatively homogenous (n = 8, mean 336 µg m-3 , SD = 39 µg m-3 ). Air renewal was found to play an important role for event durations greater than 0.5 h and loss rate below 2-3 h-1 . The estimated emission rate suggests a high viral load in the index case and/or a high SARS-CoV-2 infection coefficient. High probabilities of infection in similar indoor situations are related to unfavorable conditions of ventilation, emission rate, and event durations.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the number of shunt surgeries performed in a single institution during this time interval in comparison to equivalent periods in past years. METHODS: The numbers of elective and emergent/urgent shunt surgeries performed at a single institution were queried for a 28-d period starting on the third Monday of March, between years 2015 and 2020. These were further stratified by how they presented as well as the type of surgery performed. RESULTS: During the 28-d period of interest, in the years between 2015 and 2020, there was a steady increase in the number of shunt surgeries performed, with a maximum of 64 shunt surgeries performed in 2019. Of these, approximately 50% presented in urgent fashion in any given year.

The 674-685 fragment of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein is homologous to the fragment of &#945;-cobratoxin underlying its interaction with &#945;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The interaction of 674-685 peptide with &#945;7 nAChR has been predicted in silico. In the present paper we confirm this prediction experimentally and investigate the effect of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein peptide on mitochondria, which express &#945;7 nAChRs to regulate apoptosis-related events. We demonstrate that SARS-Cov-2 spike protein peptide 674-685 competes with the antibody against 179-190 fragment of &#945;7 nAChR subunit for the binding to &#945;7-expressing cells and mitochondria and prevents the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria in response to 0.5 mM H2O2 but does not protect intact U373 cells against apoptogenic effect of H2O2. Our data suggest that the &#945;7 nAChR-binding portion of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein prevents mitochondria-driven apoptosis when the virus is uncoated inside the cell and, therefore, supports the infected cell viability before the virus replication cycle is complete.","Kalashnyk, Olena; Lykhmus, Olena; Izmailov, Mykhailo; Koval, Lyudmyla; Komisarenko, Serhiy; Skok, Maryna",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,83,30

After the example of China, all the affected countries are taking hard-confinement measures to control the infection and to gain some time to reduce the significant amount of cases that arrive at the hospital. Although the measures in China reduced the percentages of new cases, this is not seen in other countries that have taken similar measures, such as Italy and Spain. After the first weeks, the worry was whether or not the healthcare system would collapse rather than its response to the patient's needs who are infected and require hospitalization. Using China as a mirror of what could happen in our countries and with the data available, we calculated a model that forecasts the peak of the curve of infection, hospitalization, and ICU bed numbers. We aimed to review the patterns of spread of the virus in the two countries and their regions, looking for similarities that reflect the existence of a typical path in this expansive virulence and the effects of the intervention of the authorities with drastic isolation measures, to contain the outbreak. A model based on Autorregressive and moving average models (ARMA) methodology and including Chinese disease pattern as a proxy, predicts the contagious pattern robustly. Based on the prediction, the hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) requirements were also calculated. Results suggest a reduction in the speed of contagion during April in both countries, earlier in Spain than in Italy. The forecast advanced a significant increase in the ICU needs for Spain surpassing 8,000 units by the end of April, but for Italy, ICU needs would decrease in the same period, according to the model.

Understanding the origin and mechanisms underlying NM-induced developmental toxicity will be a cornerstone in the protection of sensitive populations and the design of safe and sustainable nanotechnology applications. MAIN BODY: Direct toxicity originating from NMs crossing the placental barrier is frequently assumed to be the key pathway in developmental toxicity. However, placental transfer of particles is often highly limited, and evidence is growing that NMs can also indirectly interfere with fetal development. Here, we outline current knowledge on potential indirect mechanisms in developmental toxicity of NMs. SHORT CONCLUSION: Until now, research on developmental toxicity has mainly focused on the biodistribution and placental translocation of NMs to the fetus to delineate underlying processes. Systematic research addressing NM impact on maternal and placental tissues as potential contributors to mechanistic pathways in developmental toxicity is only slowly gathering momentum. So far, maternal and placental oxidative stress and inflammation, activation of placental toll-like receptors (TLRs), impairment of placental growth and secretion of placental hormones, and vascular factors have been suggested to mediate indirect developmental toxicity of NMs. Therefore, NM effects on maternal and placental tissue function ought to be comprehensively evaluated in addition to placental transfer in the design of future studies of developmental toxicity and risk assessment of NM exposure during pregnancy.","Dugershaw, Battuja Batbajar; Aengenheister, Leonie; Hansen, Signe Schmidt Kjølner; Hougaard, Karin Sørig; Buerki-Thurnherr, Tina",Part Fibre Toxicol,83,26

Due to the absence of specific antivirals or vaccine, mathematical modeling plays an important role in better understanding the disease dynamics and in designing strategies to control the rapidly spreading infectious disease. In our study, we developed a new compartmental model that explains the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We calibrated our proposed model with daily COVID-19 data for four Indian states, namely, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Chandigarh. We study the qualitative properties of the model, including feasible equilibria and their stability with respect to the basic reproduction number R0. The disease-free equilibrium becomes stable and the endemic equilibrium becomes unstable when the recovery rate of infected individuals increases, but if the disease transmission rate remains higher, then the endemic equilibrium always remains stable. For the estimated model parameters, R0>1 for all four states, which suggests the significant outbreak of COVID-19. Short-time prediction shows the increasing trend of daily and cumulative cases of COVID-19 for the four states of India.","Khajanchi, Subhas; Sarkar, Kankan",Chaos,83,1

The impact of social distancing on blood stocks was significant. Data on the use of blood products by patients with COVID-19 are scarce. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted by analysing the medical records of 3014 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in 16 Brazilian hospitals. Individual data related to clinical, laboratory and transfusion characteristics and outcomes of these patients were collected. Patients characteristics association with mortality and transfusion need were tested independently by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Patients mean age was 57·6 years. In 2298 (76·2%) patients, there was an underlying clinical comorbidity. A total of 1657 (55%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU), and 943 (31%) patients required ventilatory support and orotracheal intubation (OTI). There was a total of 471 (15·6%) deaths among all patients. 325 patients (10·7%) required blood transfusion; 3187 blood products were transfused: 1364 red blood cells in 303 patients, 1092 platelet units in 78 patients, 303 fresh frozen plasma in 49 patients and 423 cryoprecipitates in 21 patients. The mortality among patients who received transfusion was substantially higher than that among the total study population. CONCLUSION: Need for transfusion was low in COVID-19 patients, but significantly higher in patients admitted to ICU and in those who needed OTI.

METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 79 COVID-19 patients was retrospectively recruited from five independent institutions. For each presentation type, all patients were classified into atypical vs. typical groups (i.e., asymptomatic vs.symptomatic, CT imaging-negative vs. CT imaging-positive, and RP and non-RP,respectively). The chi-square test, Student’s t test, and Kruskal-Wallis H test were performed to compare CT imaging and clinical features of atypical vs. typical patients for all three presentation categories. RESULTS: In our COVID-19 cohort, we found 12.7% asymptomatic patients, 13.9% CT imaging-negative patients, and 8.9% RP patients. The asymptomatic patients had fewer hospitalization days (P=0.043), lower total scores for bilateral lung involvement (P< 0.001), and fewer ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the peripheral area (P< 0.001) than symptomatic patients. The CT imaging-negative patients were younger (P=0.002), had a higher lymphocyte count (P=0.038), had a higher lymphocyte rate (P=0.008), and had more asymptomatic infections (P=0.002) than the CT imaging-positive patients. The RP patients with moderate COVID-19 had lower total scores of for bilateral lung involvement (P=0.030) and a smaller portion of the left lung affected (P=0.024) than non-RP patients. Compared to their first hospitalization, RP patients had a shorter hospitalization period (P< 0.001) and fewer days from the onset of illness to last RNA negative conversion (P< 0.001) at readmission.

There are preliminary studies correlating qRT-PCR results from different materials to clinical outcomes, yet, comparability is limited due to the plethora of different assays used for diagnostics. In this study we evaluate clinical performance and linear range for the SARS-CoV-2 IVD (cobas6800/8800 system, a fully automated sample-to-result platform) in different clinically relevant matrix materials outside official specifications. METHODS: Assay performance was assessed in human plasma, BAL/BL and transport medium following chemical inactivation. For analytical evaluation, respective matrix materials were spiked with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ten-fold dilution series. The efficacy of chemical inactivation by guanidine hydrochloride solution was confirmed in cell culture infectivity experiments. For correlation, a total of 289 predetermined clinical samples including respiratory swabs, plasma and lower respiratory tract specimens were subjected to the SARS-CoV-2 IVD test and results were compared. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 IVD showed excellent linearity over four to six log steps depending on matrix material. Chemical inactivation resulted in a reduction in plaque forming units of at least 3.5 log steps, while having no significant impact on assay performance. Inter-run consistency from three different testing sites demonstrated excellent comparability of RT-PCR results (maximum deviation was 1.53 CT). Clinical evaluation for respiratory swabs showed very good agreement with the comparator assay (Positive agreement 95.7%, negative agreement 98.9%). CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 IVD test for the cobas6800/8800 systems offers excellent linear range and inter-run consistency for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different matrices outside official specifications.","Nörz, Dominik; Frontzek, André; Eigner, Ulriach; Oestereich, Lisa; Wichmann, Dominic; Kluge, Stefan; Fischer, Nicole; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Pfefferle, Susanne; Lütgehetmann, Marc",J Clin Virol,83,20

There are currently no specific registered antiviral drugs to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of ∼20 µM, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2-3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3) were treated. Time of addition and plaque reduction assays showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.","da Silva, Clarisse Salgado Benvindo; Thaler, Melissa; Tas, Ali; Ogando, Natacha S.; Bredenbeek, Peter J.; Ninaber, Dennis K.; Wang, Ying; Hiemstra, Pieter S.; Snijder, Eric J.; van Hemert, Martijn J.",bioRxiv,83,24

Methods: In a prospective performance evaluation study, RDT from three manufacturers (NADAL®, Panbio™, MEDsan®, conducted on different samples) were compared to quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in 5 068 oropharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital setting. Viral load was derived from standardised RT-qPCR Cycle threshold (C(t)) values. The data collection period ranged from November 12, 2020 to February 28, 2021. Findings: The sensitivity of RDT compared to RT-qPCR was 42·57% (95% CI 33·38%–52·31%). The specificity was 99·68% (95% CI 99·48%–99·80%). Sensitivity declined with decreasing viral load from 100% in samples with a deduced viral load of ≥10(8) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per ml to 8·82% in samples with a viral load lower than 10(4) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per ml.

Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of adult patients admitted to a quaternary care center in New York City between March 1st and April 3rd, 2020. Patients were included if they had a TTE performed during the hospitalization after a known positive diagnosis for COVID-19. Demographic and clinical data were obtained using chart abstraction from the electronic medical record. Results Of 749 patients, 72 (9.6%) had a TTE following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The most common clinical indications for TTE were concern for a major acute cardiovascular event (45.8%) and hemodynamic instability (29.2%). While most patients had preserved biventricular function, 34.7% were found to have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 50% and 13.9% had at least moderately reduced right ventricular function. Four patients had wall motion abnormalities suggestive of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Using Spearman rank correlation there was an inverse relationship between high sensitivity Troponin T and LVEF (rho = -0.34, p=0.006). Among 20 patients with prior echocardiograms, only two (10%) patients had a new reduction in LVEF of more than 10%. Clinical management was changed in eight (24.2%) of individuals who had a TTE ordered for concern for acute major cardiovascular event; and three (14.3%) in whom TTE was ordered for hemodynamic evaluation. Conclusions This study describes the clinical indications for usage and diagnostic performance, as well as findings seen on TTE in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In appropriately selected patients TTE can be an invaluable tool for guiding COVID-19 clinical management.","Jain, Sneha S.; Liu, Qi; Raikhelkar, Jayant; Fried, Justin; Elias, Pierre; Poterucha, Timothy J.; DeFilippis, Ersilia M.; Rosenblum, Hannah; Wang, Elizabeth Y.; Redfors, Bjorn; Clerkin, Kevin; Griffin, Jan M.; Wan, Elaine Y.; Abdalla, Marwah; Bello, Natalie A.; Hahn, Rebecca T.; Shimbo, Daichi; Weiner, Shepard D.; Kirtane, Ajay; Kodali, Susheel K.; Burkhoff, Daniel; Rabbani, LeRoy; Schwartz, Allan; Leon, Martin; Homma, Shunichi; DiTullio, Marco R.; Sayer, Gabriel; Uriel, Nir; Anstey, D.

We used a structured protocol based on clinical, biochemical, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) criteria for the identification of the subset of patients with CRS and analyzed the use of tocilizumab for their treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We did a retrospective case-control analysis of all COVID-19 patients between 15 March and 15 May 2020 with severe to critical disease in ICU. They were evaluated for CRS, and 22 patients who met the criterion were given tocilizumab. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of tocilizumab on escalation of respiratory support and ICU mortality. The secondary objectives were ICU length of stay, trends of inflammatory markers, and any adverse effects. RESULTS: The need for escalation of respiratory support was significantly lower in the tocilizumab group as compared to standard treatment (p = 0.001). The mortality at day 7 and 28 was also significantly lower in the tocilizumab group (p = 0.007 and p = 0.001 respectively). There was a significant reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP) who received tocilizumab (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: In our limited number of patients, timely intervention with tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients with CRS significantly improved overall ICU outcome by reducing the need for invasive ventilation and mortality.

While there are a host of antecedent circumstances the presence of a mood disorder, primarily depression, is the most common factor in suicide. While management of depression is recognized as important prevention strategy in depression, the means by which suicide occurs must be a critical element of prevention. Policies that lower access to the means for suicide will decrease the fatality. Guns are associated with half of suicides and the case fatality rate of gun associated suicide is over 90% compared to 7% for all other means. This emphasizes the importance of offering strategies that limit access to guns to those at higher risk for suicide. A declaration of formal self‐exclusion for access to firearms (guns and ammunition) offers the individual at greater risk for suicide to place themselves on an official list that would prevent them from purchasing lethal weapons. A person with depression, when well, might wish to enroll voluntarily to prevent themselves, when ill, from procuring a weapon to harm themselves or others. This recognizes the autonomy of the person and protects both the individual, the family, and society.","McInnis, Melvin G.; Thompson, Stephen B.; Merajver, Sofia D.; Schneider, Carl E.",Asia Pac Psychiatry,83,21

We hypothesized that the vascular permeability of endothelial cells (ECs) would be regulated by serotonin via serotonin-Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling. We aimed to determine the impact of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) on septic shock as a novel biomarker. Plasma 5-HIAA levels and disease severity indices were obtained from 47 patients with sepsis. The association between 5-HIAA levels and severity indices was analyzed. Permeability upon serotonin stimulation was determined using human pulmonary microvascular ECs. 5-HIAA were significantly higher in septic shock patients than in patients without shock or healthy controls (p = 0.004). These elevated levels were correlated with severity indexes (SOFA score [p < 0.001], APACHE II [p < 0.001], and PaO(2):FiO(2) [p = 0.02]), and longitudinally associated with worse clinical outcomes (mechanical ventilation duration [p = 0.009] and ICU duration [p = 0.01]). In the experiment, serotonin increased the permeability of ECs, which was inhibited by the ROCK inhibitor (p < 0.001). Serotonin increases vascular permeability of ECs via ROCK signaling. This suggests a novel mechanism by which serotonin disrupts endothelial barriers via ROCK signaling and causes the pathogenesis of septic shock with a vascular leak. Serotonin serves as a novel biomarker of vascular permeability.","Tanaka, Takeshi; Mori, Masahiko; Sekino, Motohiro; Higashijima, Ushio; Takaki, Masahiro; Yamashita, Yoshiro; Kakiuchi, Satoshi; Tashiro, Masato; Morimoto, Konosuke; Tasaki, Osamu; Izumikawa, Koichi",Sci Rep,83,2

DESIGN: Cross‐sectional analysis on Connecticut nursing home (n=215) COVID‐19 report, linked to other nursing home files and county counts of confirmed cases and deaths. Multivariable two‐part models determined the associations of key nursing home characteristics with the likelihood of at least 1 confirmed case (or death) in the facility, and with the count of cases (deaths) among facilities with at least 1 confirmed case (death). RESULTS: The average number of confirmed cases was 8 per nursing home (zero in 107 facilities), and the average number of confirmed deaths was 1.7 per nursing home (zero in 131 facilities). Among facilities with at least 1 confirmed case, every 20 minutes (per resident day) increase in RN staffing was associated with 22% fewer confirmed cases (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68‐0.89, p<0.001); compared to 1‐ to 3‐star facilities, 4‐ or 5‐star facilities had 13% fewer confirmed cases (IRR=0.87, 95% CI 0.78‐0.97, p<0.015); and facilities with high concentration of Medicaid residents (IRR=1.16, 95% CI 1.02‐1.32, p=0.025) or racial/ethnic minority residents (IRR=1.15, 95% CI 1.03‐1.29, p=0.026) had 16% and 15% more confirmed cases, respectively, than their counterparts. Among facilities with at least 1 death, every 20 minutes increase in RN staffing significantly predicted 26% fewer COVID‐19 deaths (IRR=0.74, 95% CI 0.55‐1.00, p=0.047). Other focused characteristics did not show statistically significant associations with deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing homes with higher RN staffing and quality ratings have the potential to better control the spread of the novel coronavirus and reduce deaths.

The exact pathogenesis of tissue pigmentation varies greatly and is not completely known. This systematic review aimed to present data on the causal association between medications and the development of oral/mucosal pigmentation as an adverse drug reaction. METHODS: A systematic review and analysis of literature were conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Science Direct, ProQuest, Web of Science, and Scopus. The systematic review included original articles written in English and published between January 1982 and June 2020. Following the PRISMA statement, eligible articles were systematically reviewed, and data were extracted from eligible studies and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 235 articles were identified, of which 57 met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. The mean age of included patients was 46.2±16.38 years (range: 10–90 years) with a male to female ratio of 1:1.45. Oral mucosal hyperpigmentation was reported following the use of several classes of medications such as antiviral (eg, zidovudine), antibiotic (eg, minocycline), antimalarial (eg, chloroquine), anti-fungal (eg, ketoconazole), antileprotic (eg, clofazimine), antihypertensive (eg, amlodipine), chemotherapeutic, and antineoplastic drugs. The risk of developing oral pigmentation was significantly higher with antimalarial medications, antibiotics, antineoplastic and chemotherapeutic agents. Medication-induced oral hyperpigmentation was most frequent among women and in the hard palate. CONCLUSION: Future research is warranted to better understand the pathogenesis and risk factors for medication-induced oral hyperpigmentation in order to reassure patients during prescription and management.","Binmadi, Nada O; Bawazir, Maram; Alhindi, Nada; Mawardi, Hani; Mansour, Ghada; Alhamed, Sana; Alfarabi, Sarah; Akeel, Sara; Almazrooa, Soulafa",Patient Prefer Adherence,83,16

In the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cytokines elicited by primary and secondary infections seem to exert subtle and sustained effects on behavioral, hormonal, and metabolic axes, and their combined effects on appetite and metabolism have been postulated to drive wasting. However, correlations of increased blood levels of a particular cytokine with wasting in AIDS have not been consistent observations, perhaps because cytokines act principally as paracrine and autocrine hormones, as well as indirectly by activating other systems. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the catabolic effects of cytokines is clearly needed if more efficacious strategies are to be developed for the prevention and treatment of wasting in AIDS. In this review we first examine the interacting factors contributing to the AIDS wasting syndrome. We then analyze the complex and overlapping role of cytokines in the pathophysiology of this condition, and put forward a number of hypotheses to explain some of the most important features of this syndrome.","Chang, Hernan R.; Dulloo, Abdul G.; Bistrian, Bruce R.",Nutrition,83,15

STUDY DESIGN: In our study, we have evaluated an in-house developed ELISA for the detection of the immunoglobulin classes A, G and M directed against the full-length spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2. For this analysis, we have included 110 sera from patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms or blood donors without symptoms collected at the Austrian Red Cross, Blood Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, Linz. In addition, we have selected four commercially available IgG-based ELISAs as well as one IgA/IgG-based ELISA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens as well as a multiplexed IgG-based micro-ELISA assay developed for rapid Point of Care testing applications. CONCLUSIONS: All assays evaluated in the course of this study demonstrated suitable sensitivity and specificity values for the identification of patients that have experienced a past infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Based on the structural decoding of the RBD of the spike protein, here we have generated a new set of small molecules that have strong inhibiting properties on the binding of the spike protein to ACE 2 receptors. These small-molecule inhibitors surprisingly show binding to the main protease, nucleoprotein, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which are the other responsible factors for the viral infection. The newly designed molecules show better performance than several existing repurposed drugs.

Many studies have attempted to improve patient–physician communication. Incorporating patient priorities into agenda setting and medical decision-making are fundamental to patient-centered communication. Efficient and scalable approaches are needed to empower patients to speak up and prepare physicians to respond. Leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) in engaging patients and health care teams has the potential to enhance the integration of patient priorities in clinical encounters. A systematic approach to eliciting and documenting patient priorities before encounters could facilitate effective communication in such encounters. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we report the design and implementation of a set of EHR tools built into clinical workflows for facilitating patient–physician joint agenda setting and the documentation of patient concerns in the EHRs for ambulatory encounters. METHODS: We engaged health information technology leaders and users in three health care systems for developing and implementing a set of EHR tools. The goal of these tools is to standardize the elicitation of patient priorities by using a previsit “patient important issue” questionnaire distributed through the patient portal to the EHR. We built additional EHR documentation tools to facilitate patient–staff communication when the staff records the vital signs and the reason for the visit in the EHR while in the examination room, with a simple transmission method for physicians to incorporate patient concerns in EHR notes. RESULTS: The study is ongoing. The anticipated completion date for survey data collection is November 2021. A total of 34,037 primary care patients from three health systems (n=26,441; n=5136; and n=2460 separately recruited from each system) used the previsit patient important issue questionnaire in 2020. The adoption of the digital previsit questionnaire during the COVID-19 pandemic was much higher in one health care system because it expanded the use of the questionnaire from physicians participating in trials to all primary care providers midway through the year. It also required the use of this previsit questionnaire for eCheck-ins, which are required for telehealth encounters. Physicians and staff suggested anecdotally that this questionnaire helped patient–clinician communication, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: EHR tools have the potential to facilitate the integration of patient priorities into agenda setting and documentation in real-world primary care practices. Early results suggest the feasibility and acceptability of such digital tools in three health systems. EHR tools can support patient engagement and clinicians’ work during in-person and telehealth visits. They could potentially exert a sustained influence on patient and clinician communication behaviors in contrast to prior ad hoc educational efforts targeting patients or clinicians.

Our public health system has been concerned about potential delays leading to a higher proportion of patients with advanced stages. Our cancer diagnosis fast-track program (CFP) in the Clinic-Malvarrosa Health department in Valencia (Spain) is connecting primary care (PC) with different specialists to speed cancer diagnosis and treatment upon well founded suspicion. A 10-year evaluation of our CFP has recently been published. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the CFP. Methods: We analysed the programme flow during the state of emergency starting on March 16, 2020 for one year. Results: During that year, 975 suspected cancer cases were submitted to the CFP. The submissions only decreased during the times of highest COVID-19 incidence and stricter lockdown (March, April and October 2020). However, referrals were slightly higher than in the two previous years (average 877). Of those 975 patients, 817 were seen by the corresponding specialist. A cancer diagnosis was confirmed in 197 (24.1%) with 33% urological, 23% breast, 16% gastrointestinal and 9% lung cancer. Median time from referral to the specialist visit was 13 (interquartile range, 8 to 22 days) days and a diagnosis was reached in a median of 18 days (interquartile range, 10 to 30 days). In cancer patients, treatment was started in around 30 days (interquartile range, 13.5 to 51 days) from the time of diagnosis. Sixty-one percent of cancers were found in an early stage, 20% in a locally advanced stage, and 19% in an advanced stage. These intervals and proportions were similar to the previous years.

The mainstream medical system is being handicapped with the challenge of patient management with no proven treatment at one end and the use of vaccine at the other with prevailing ambiguity in developing herd immunity and safety concerns of mass vaccinations amidst pandemic. Though vaccination is the only hope, fool proof evidences are absent on its efficacy. Also, adults of above 65 are of greater risk in terms of complications and death. China has already documented the use of traditional Chinese medicine against the pandemic with national participation rate of 90%. In this regard, the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) against COVID-19 is relevant, especially in a country like India where it is widely practised as Ayurveda.

Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of 45 articles that include a total of 42,120 COVID-19 patients from 17 different countries to demonstrate that severely ill or hospitalized COVID-19 patients have a lesser chance of experiencing LOS than non-severely ill or non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients (odds ratio = 0.527 [95% CI 0.373–0.744; p < 0.001] and 0.283 [95% CI 0.173–0.462; p < 0.001], respectively). We also proposed a possible mechanism underlying the association of COVID-19 severity with anosmia, which may explain why patients without sense of smell develop severe COVID-19. Variations in LOS according to the severity of COVID-19 is a global phenomenon, with few exceptions. Since severely ill patients have a lower rate of anosmia, patients without anosmia should be monitored more closely in the early stages of COVID-19, for early diagnosis of severity of illness. An understanding of how the severity of COVID-19 infection and LOS are associated has profound implications for the clinical management and mitigation strategies for the disease.

Currently, the most important method for definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 is identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab samples by RT-PCR. Nasopharyngeal swab sampling is a discomforting procedure sometimes with adverse effects, which also poses a risk for infection for the personnel performing the sampling. We have developed a new method for concentrating biological samples, which enabled us to use gargle and mouthwash samples to be used in RT-PCR, for the diagnosis of COVID-19, as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swab samples. We have analyzed nasopharyngeal and gargle and mouthwash samples, before and after concentration, of 363 patients by RT-PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Among 114 patients in which SARS-CoV-2 was identified in at least one of their samples, the virus was identified in 76 (66.7%), 67 (58.8%), and 101 (88.6%) of nasopharyngeal swab, gargle, and mouthwash samples before and after concentration, respectively. When concentrated by our new method, gargle and mouthwash samples can be used instead of nasopharyngeal samples in identification of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, with the same or better sensitivity. Eliminating the need for nasopharyngeal sampling will save the patients from an invasive and painful procedure and will lower the risk of infection for the healthcare personnel taking the sample. This easy sampling procedure may decrease the workload of hospitals, shorten the turnaround time of obtaining test results, and thus enable rapid isolation of infected patients.","Kocagoz, Tanil; Can, Ozge; Yurttutan Uyar, Neval; Aksoy, Ece; Polat, Tuba; Cankaya, Dilara; Karakus, Betul; Mozioglu, Erkan; Kocagoz, Sesin",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,83,1

Ainsi, des vaccins stimulant cette immunité locale sembleraient constituer une approche intéressante dans la prévention de ces infections. Après avoir détaillé les différents mécanismes mis en jeu dans cette immunité muqueuse, cette étude a pour but d’analyser le principe d’une telle vaccination et les différents vaccins administrables par voie respiratoire. Immunité muqueuse Les principaux anticorps sécrétés localement appartiennent à l’isotype IgA (S-IgA), les anticorps de type IgM (S-IgM) et IgG (S-IgG) ayant un rôle encore largement discuté. Les cellules effectrices qui dominent au niveau de la muqueuse ne sont pas des cellules IgA de type B, mais des lymphocytes T qui peuvent représenter jusqu’à 80 % de la totalité des populations lymphocytaires de la muqueuse. Immunoprophylaxie par voie respiratoire Des immunoglobulines spécifiques administrées localement peuvent prévenir des infections virales comme cela a été démontré pour le VRS ; mais les quantités d’anticorps nécessaires pour être actives sont très importantes et difficiles à obtenir. Parmi les facteurs susceptibles d’induire une réponse immune muqueuse et une immunité à médiation cellulaire, on retrouve la voie orale ou respiratoire et des virus réplicatifs. À ce jour, très peu de vaccins antiviraux muqueux ont vu le jour et le seul exemple pour les virus respiratoires reste le vaccin grippal atténué administré par voie nasale. D’autres vaccins commercialisés par voie parentérale ont été utilisés expérimentalement par voie nasale. Qu’il s’agisse de vaccins vivants (varicelle, rougeole) ou inactivés (grippe injectable), ils n’induisent par cette voie inhabituelle qu’une réponse locale modérée. Conclusion Il apparaît donc dans l’état actuel de nos connaissances et des vaccins disponibles que la voie muqueuse ne constitue pas une voie essentielle et incontournable pour élaborer un vaccin actif contre des virus respiratoires. Mais l’exemple du vaccin grippe atténué administré par voie nasale est à lui seul prometteur pour l’avenir de la vaccination par voie muqueuse et d’autres approches plus sophistiquées pourraient voir le jour dans les années à venir. Abstract Objective As the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract represent a major portal of entry for most human viruses and many bacteria, they seem to be a critical component of the mammalian immunologic repertoire. Thus, vaccines stimulating this local immunity could represent an interesting approach to prevent these infections. After detailing the different mechanisms implied in this mucosal immunity, the aim of this study is to analyze the basis of such a vaccination and the different vaccines available to mucosal respiratory tract use. Mucosal immunity The major antibody isotype in external secretions is secretory immunoglobin A (S-IgA); the role of IgM (S-IgM) and IgG (S-IgG) are actually questionned. It is, however, interesting that the major effector cells in the mucosal surfaces are not IgA B cells, but T lymphocytes that may represent up to 80% of the entire mucosal lymphoid cell population. Immunoprophylaxis by the mucosal route Passive antibodies were shown to protect against mucosal viral infections, such as those caused by RSV, but very high quantities of passive antibodies are needed to restrict virus replication on mucosal surface. In general, factors which favor development of mucosal antibody and cell mediated immune responses include the oral or respiratory immunization and the replicating nature of the vaccine agents. However, to date only a few vaccines have become available to mucosal respiratory tract use, and cold-adapted influenza virus vaccines is the only one available using nasal route. Other parenteral licensed vaccines have not been recommended for mucosal administration. Some of them have been experimentally used with nasal administration of replicating agents (varicella and measles vaccines) or non replicating agents (influenza inactivated vaccine), but have been found to induce a very low mucosal response. Conclusion Based on the experience with existing vaccines, the development of mucosal immunity or administration of vaccines via the mucosal route is clearly not a prerequisite today for control or prevention of most viral infectious respiratory diseases or diseases with respiratory tract as a route of contamination. But the example of live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine inducing both systemic and local immune response without immunopathology, is promising for the future of the mucosal immunization against respiratory viral infections.","Denis, F.; Hantz, S.; Alain, S.",Antibiotiques,83,2

Unexpected deaths, such as those occurring due to a deceased person under investigation for a highly infectious disease, are likely to fall under ME/C jurisdiction, thereby placing the ME/C and other morgue personnel at increased risk of contracting an occupationally acquired infection. This survey of U.S. ME/Cs′ capabilities to address highly infectious decedents aimed to determine opportunities for improvement at ME/C facilities serving a state or metropolitan area. Data for this study was gathered via an electronic survey. Of the 177 electronic surveys that were distributed, the overall response rate was N = 108 (61%), with 99 of those 108 respondents completing all the questions within the survey. At least one ME/C responded from 47 of 50 states, and the District of Columbia. Select results were: less than half of respondents (44%) stated that their office had been involved in handling a suspected or confirmed highly infectious remains case and responses indicated medical examiners. Additionally, ME/C altered their personal protective equipment based on suspected versus confirmed highly infectious remains rather than taking an all-hazards approach. Standard operating procedures or guidelines should be updated to take an all-hazards approach, best-practices on handling highly infectious remains could be integrated into a standardized education, and evidence-based information on appropriate personal protective equipment selection could be incorporated into a widely disseminated learning module for addressing suspected or confirmed highly infectious remains, as those areas were revealed to be currently lacking.","Le, Aurora B.; Brooks, Erin G.; McNulty, Lily A.; Gill, James R.; Herstein, Jocelyn J.; Rios, Janelle; Patlovich, Scott J.; Jelden, Katelyn C.; Schmid, Kendra K.; Lowe, John J.; Gibbs, Shawn G.",Forensic Sci Med Pathol,83,21

However, the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches continues to be one of much debate and there is a need for a rigorous framework for designing and interpreting mixed methods research. This paper explores the analytical approaches (i.e. parallel, concurrent or sequential) used in mixed methods studies within healthcare and exemplifies the use of triangulation as a methodological metaphor for drawing inferences from qualitative and quantitative findings originating from such analyses. DESIGN: This review of the literature used systematic principles in searching CINAHL, Medline and PsycINFO for healthcare research studies which employed a mixed methods approach and were published in the English language between January 1999 and September 2009. RESULTS: In total, 168 studies were included in the results. Most studies originated in the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. The analytic approach most widely used was parallel data analysis. A number of studies used sequential data analysis; far fewer studies employed concurrent data analysis. Very few of these studies clearly articulated the purpose for using a mixed methods design. The use of the methodological metaphor of triangulation on convergent, complementary, and divergent results from mixed methods studies is exemplified and an example of developing theory from such data is provided. CONCLUSION: A trend for conducting parallel data analysis on quantitative and qualitative data in mixed methods healthcare research has been identified in the studies included in this review. Using triangulation as a methodological metaphor can facilitate the integration of qualitative and quantitative findings, help researchers to clarify their theoretical propositions and the basis of their results. This can offer a better understanding of the links between theory and empirical findings, challenge theoretical assumptions and develop new theory.","Östlund, Ulrika; Kidd, Lisa; Wengström, Yvonne; Rowa-Dewar, Neneh",Int J Nurs Stud,83,3

This study aims to evaluate the representation of plastic surgery in commercial films that include a character with a link to plastic surgery, either as a patient or surgeon. METHODS: The international film databases Internet Movie Database (IMDb), The American Film Institute (AFI), and British Film Institute (BFI) were searched from 1919 to 2019 to identify feature-length films with a link to plastic surgery. Movies were visualized and analyzed to identify themes, and the portrayal of plastic surgery was rated negative or positive, and realistic or unrealistic. RESULTS: A total of 223 films were identified from 1919 to 2019, produced across 19 countries. Various genres were identified including drama (41), comedy (25), and crime (23). A total of 172 patient characters and 57 surgeon characters were identified as major roles, and a further 102 surgeons as minor roles. Disparities were noted in presentation of surgeons, both in terms of race and gender, with the vast majority of surgeons being white and male. In total only 11 female surgeons were portrayed and only one black surgeon. Thirteen themes emerged: face transplantation, crime, future society, surgeon mental status, body dysmorphic disorder, vanity, anti-aging, race, reconstructive surgery, deformity, scarring, burns, and gender transitioning. The majority of films (146/223) provide an unrealistic view of plastic surgery, painted under a negative light (80/146). Only 20 films provide a positive realistic image (24/77). CONCLUSIONS: There exists a complicated relationship between plastic surgery and its representation on film. Surgical and aesthetic interventions are portrayed unrealistically, with surgeons and patients presented negatively, perpetuating stigma, particularly with regard to cosmetic surgery. Cinema is also characterized by lack of representation of female and non-white surgeons. Recruitment of surgeons as technical advisors would help present a more realistic, representative view, without necessarily sacrificing creativity.

Objectives: To determine the frequency of detection of infectious agents in a population of hospitalized foals with diarrhea and to determine if detection of specific pathogens is associated with age, outcome, or clinicopathologic data. Animals: Two hundred and thirty‐three foals ≤ 10 months of age with diarrhea examined at a referral institution. Methods: Retrospective case series. Each foal was examined for Salmonella spp., viruses, Clostridium difficile toxins, Clostridium perfringens culture, C. perfringens enterotoxin, Cryptosporidium spp., and metazoan parasites in feces collected at admission or at the onset of diarrhea. Results: At least 1 infectious agent was detected in 122 foals (55%). Rotavirus was most frequently detected (20%) followed by C. perfringens (18%), Salmonella spp. (12%), and C. difficile (5%). Foals < 1 month of age were significantly more likely to be positive for C. perfringens (odds ratio [OR] = 15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.5–66) or to have negative fecal diagnostic results (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.7–5.2) than older foals.

Insights into AKI mechanisms may be provided by analyzing the temporal associations of clinical parameters reflecting disease processes and AKI development. METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study of 223 consecutive COVID-19 patients treated at 3 sites of a tertiary care referral center to describe the evolvement of severe AKI (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 3) and identify conditions promoting its development. Descriptive statistics and explanatory multivariable Cox regression modeling with clinical parameters as time-varying covariates were used to identify risk factors of severe AKI. RESULTS: Severe AKI developed in 70 of 223 patients (31%) with COVID-19, of which 95.7% required kidney replacement therapy. Patients with severe AKI were older, predominantly male, had more comorbidities, and displayed excess mortality. Severe AKI occurred exclusively in intensive care unit patients, and 97.3% of the patients developing severe AKI had respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, and inflammatory markers (serum procalcitonin levels and leucocyte count) were independent time-varying risk factors of severe AKI. Increasing inflammatory markers displayed a close temporal association with the development of severe AKI. Sensitivity analysis on risk factors of AKI stage 2 and 3 combined confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: Severe AKI in COVID-19 was tightly coupled with critical illness and systemic inflammation and was not observed in milder disease courses. These findings suggest that traditional systemic AKI mechanisms rather than kidney-specific processes contribute to severe AKI in COVID-19.","Hardenberg, Jan-Hendrik B.; Stockmann, Helena; Aigner, Annette; Gotthardt, Inka; Enghard, Philipp; Hinze, Christian; Balzer, Felix; Schmidt, Danilo; Zickler, Daniel; Kruse, Jan; Körner, Roland; Stegemann, Miriam; Schneider, Thomas; Schumann, Michael; Müller-Redetzky, Holger; Angermair, Stefan; Budde, Klemens; Weber-Carstens, Steffen; Witzenrath, Martin; Treskatsch, Sascha; Siegmund, Britta; Spies, Claudia; Suttorp, Norbert; Rauch, Geraldine; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Schmidt-Ott, Kai M.",Kidney Int Rep,83,24
