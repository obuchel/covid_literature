Because of the diverse phenotypes linked to RYR1 mutations it is fundamental to characterize their functional effects to classify variants carried by patients for future therapeutic interventions and identify non-pathogenic variants. Many laboratories have been interested in developing methods to functionally characterize RYR1 mutations expressed in patients' cells. This approach has numerous advantages, including: mutations are endogenously expressed, RyR1 is not over-expressed, use of heterologous RyR1 expressing cells is avoided. However, since patients may present mutations in different genes aside RYR1, it is important to compare results from biological material from individuals harboring the same mutation, with different genetic backgrounds. The present manuscript describes methods developed to study the functional effects of endogenously expressed RYR1 variants in: (a) Epstein Barr virus immortalized human B-lymphocytes and (b) satellite cells derived from muscle biopsies and differentiated into myotubes. Changes in the intracellular calcium concentration triggered by the addition of a pharmacological RyR1 activators are then monitored. The selected cell type is loaded with a ratiometric fluorescent calcium indicator and intracellular [Ca2+] changes are monitored either at the single cell level by fluorescence microscopy or in cell populations using a spectrofluorometer. The resting [Ca2+], agonist dose response curves are then compared between cells from healthy controls and patients harboring RYR1 variants leading to insight into the functional effect of a given variant.","Treves, Susan; Girard, Thierry; Zorzato, Francesco",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,829,5

Surgical evacuation is standard therapy for retained hemothorax to prevent secondary empyema, pulmonary compression, and development of fibrothorax. However, surgical interventions during ECLS are hazardous and place patients at increased risk for surgical site bleeding. Intrapleural fibrinolysis with tissue plasminogen activator may be used to facilitate nonsurgical evacuation of retained hemothorax. We present two pediatric patients who were safely and successfully managed with intrapleural fibrinolysis of retained hemothorax during ECLS.","Witt, Cordelie E; Mesher, Andrew L; Hermsen, Joshua L; Brogan, Thomas V; McMullan, David Michael",World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery,829,1

However, there has been little if any focus placed on the individual role of the ""nonlength"" HN features in EVAR outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate their individual and potentially predictive role in outcomes of EVAR under HN conditions. METHODS Data of 156 consecutive EVAR patients with short (<15 mm) HN, treated with the Endurant device (Medtronic Cardiovascular, Santa Rosa, Calif) at three European academic vascular centers between 2007 and 2015, were collected and retrospectively analyzed. All patients had at least one of the four well-known nonlength HN criteria (width >32 mm or bulge, angulation >60 degrees, reverse taper anatomy, and circumferential thrombus or calcification >50%) and underwent standard EVAR without additional techniques, such as use of chimney grafts or endoanchors. Primary end points were absence of type IA endoleak at 1 month and midterm follow-up and aneurysm sac stabilization or shrinkage. Secondary end points were 30-day mortality, overall survival, and secondary interventions related to EVAR. The study cohort was classified in two subgroups related to neck length (length <10 mm and length between 10 and 14 mm) as well as in two subgroups according to on-label or off-label stent graft use. RESULTS Mean clinical and radiologic follow-up was 41.1 ± 24.7 and 31.7 ± 19.0 months, respectively. Overall EVAR-related mortality was 1.9% (n = 3). The total type IA endoleak rate was 5.8% (n = 9). In four patients, the type IA endoleak was detected intraoperatively and solved by endovascular means. A type IA endoleak was detected in three patients at 1 month and in two patients at 2-year follow-up. During follow-up, five patients showed an increase of aneurysm diameter due to type II endoleak and were treated by secondary endovascular reinterventions. The total number of all EVAR-related secondary procedures in the midterm was 12 (7.7%). Univariate analysis showed that the center of treatment and the clinical or anatomic features were not associated with adverse outcomes. Multiple regression and Cox regression analysis of HN features revealed that reverse taper anatomy (conical neck) was the single and significantly associated predictor of proximal EVAR failure (P < .012). Width >32 mm, angulation >60 degrees, and calcification or thrombus were not associated with adverse outcomes. Analysis between HN length cohorts and between on-label and off-label subgroups revealed no difference in outcomes. CONCLUSIONS A conical neck in hostile anatomies represents the single strongest factor associated with proximal failure of standard EVAR. This finding should be considered and highlighted apart from the length of the infrarenal neck to prevent midterm failure of standard EVAR.","Pitoulias, Georgios A; Valdivia, Andrés Reyes; Hahtapornsawan, Suteekhanit; Torsello, Giovanni; Pitoulias, Apostolos G; Austermann, Martin; Gandarias, Claudio; Donas, Konstantinos P",Journal of vascular surgery,829,1

To address this need, we created and evaluated the Michigan system for opioid overdose surveillance (SOS). SOS integrates suspected fatal overdose data from Medical Examiners (MEs), and suspected non-fatal overdoses (proxied by naloxone administration) from the Michigan Emergency Medical Services (EMS) into a web-based dashboard that was developed with stakeholder feedback. Authorised stakeholders can view approximate incident locations and automated spatiotemporal data summaries, while the general public can view county-level summaries. Following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance system evaluation guidelines, we assessed simplicity, flexibility, data quality, acceptability, sensitivity, positive value positive (PVP), representativeness, timeliness and stability of SOS. Data are usually integrated into SOS 1-day postincident, and the interface is updated weekly for debugging and new feature addition, suggesting high timeliness, stability and flexibility. Regarding representativeness, SOS data cover 100% of EMS-based naloxone adminstrations in Michigan, and receives suspected fatal overdoses from MEs covering 79.1% of Michigan's population, but misses those receiving naloxone from non-EMS. PVP of the suspected fatal overdose indicator is nearly 80% across MEs. Because SOS uses pre-existing data, added burden on MEs/EMS is minimal, leading to high acceptability; there are over 300 authorised SOS stakeholders (~6 new registrations/week) as of this writing, suggesting high user acceptability. Using a collaborative, cross-sector approach we created a timely opioid overdose surveillance system that is flexible, acceptable, and is reasonably accurate and complete. Lessons learnt can aid other jurisdictions in creating analogous systems.","Goldstick, Jason; Ballesteros, Amanda; Flannagan, Carol; Roche, Jessica; Schmidt, Carl; Cunningham, Rebecca M",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,829,31

The role of 2-port access laparoscopy (TPA) has been underestimated. Compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery (CL), TPA is associated with smaller total incision size and less postoperative pain. Compared to single-incision laparoscopic surgery, no specific instruments and surgical techniques are needed. This study primarily evaluated the surgical and pathologic outcomes of TPA with conventional instruments, and additionally evaluated the surgeon's learning curve. Consecutive patients who underwent TPA and CL for endometrial cancer between 2015 and 2019 were included. Baseline characteristics were recorded. In total, 148 patients (TPA, 89; CL, 59) were identified. The baseline characteristics were similar, except for a greater proportion of patients in the CL group receiving para-aortic lymph node dissection (5.62% vs. 35.59%, P < 0.01). The mean operation time was significantly less in the TPA group (152.09 vs. 187.15 min; P < 0.01). Both the groups had comparable 5-year progression-free survival (TPA, 86.68%) and 5-year overall survival rates (TPA, 93.24%). Analysis of the learning curve showed that the operation time decreased after 3-4 procedures. TPA using conventional laparoscopic instruments for endometrial cancer is feasible and is easily accessible to patients and surgeons.","Huang, Kuan-Ju; Li, Ying-Xuan; Sheu, Bor-Ching; Chang, Wen-Chun",Scientific reports,829,26

No recent review on plasma levels of oxytocin in response to breastfeeding is available. MATERIALS AND METHODS Systematic literature searches on breastfeeding induced oxytocin levels were conducted 2017 and 2019 in PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Data on oxytocin linked effects and effects of medical interventions were included if available. RESULTS We found 29 articles that met the inclusion criteria. All studies had an exploratory design and included 601 women. Data were extracted from the articles and summarised in tables. Breastfeeding induced an immediate and short lasting (20 minutes) release of oxytocin. The release was pulsatile early postpartum (5 pulses/10 minutes) and coalesced into a more protracted rise as lactation proceeded. Oxytocin levels were higher in multiparous versus primiparous women. The number of oxytocin pulses during early breastfeeding was associated with greater milk yield and longer duration of lactation and was reduced by stress. Breastfeeding-induced oxytocin release was associated with elevated prolactin levels; lowered ACTH and cortisol (stress hormones) and somatostatin (a gastrointestinal hormone) levels; enhanced sociability; and reduced anxiety, suggesting that oxytocin induces physiological and psychological adaptations in the mother. Mechanical breast pumping, but not bottle-feeding was associated with oxytocin and prolactin release and decreased stress levels. Emergency caesarean section reduced oxytocin and prolactin release in response to breastfeeding and also maternal mental adaptations. Epidural analgesia reduced prolactin and mental adaptation, whereas infusions of synthetic oxytocin increased prolactin and mental adaptation. Oxytocin infusion also restored negative effects induced by caesarean section and epidural analgesia. CONCLUSIONS Oxytocin is released in response to breastfeeding to cause milk ejection, and to induce physiological changes to promote milk production and psychological adaptations to facilitate motherhood. Stress and medical interventions during birth may influence these effects and thereby adversely affect the initiation of breastfeeding.","Uvnäs Moberg, Kerstin; Ekström-Bergström, Anette; Buckley, Sarah; Massarotti, Claudia; Pajalic, Zada; Luegmair, Karolina; Kotlowska, Alicia; Lengler, Luise; Olza, Ibone; Grylka-Baeschlin, Susanne; Leahy-Warren, Patricia; Hadjigeorgiu, Eleni; Villarmea, Stella; Dencker, Anna",PloS one,829,33

As we uncover the links between host genomics and infectious disease, a number of ethical, legal, and social issues need to be considered when using that information in clinical practice or workforce decisions. We conducted a survey of the clinical staff at 10 federally funded Regional Ebola and Other Special Pathogen Treatment Centers to understand their views regarding the ethical, legal, and social issues related to host genomics and the administrative and clinical functions of high-level isolation units. Respondents overwhelmingly agreed that genomics could provide valuable information to identify patients and employees at higher risk for poor outcomes from highly infectious diseases. However, there was considerable disagreement about whether such data should inform the allocation of scarce resources or determine treatment decisions. While most respondents supported a confidential employer-based genomic testing system to inform individual employees about risk, respondents disagreed about whether such information should be used in staffing models. Respondents who thought genomic information would be valuable for patient treatment were more willing to undergo genetic testing for staffing purposes. Most respondents felt they would benefit from additional training to better interpret results from genetic testing. Although this study was completed before the COVID-19 pandemic, the responses provide a baseline assessment of provider attitudes that can inform policy during the current pandemic and in future infectious disease outbreaks.","Gerber, Jennifer E; Geller, Gail; Boyce, Angie; Maragakis, Lisa L; Garibaldi, Brian T",Health security,829,1

Late failure is common, however, and major quadriceps deficiency occurs after removal of the allograft material. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE Six human cadaver specimens were dissected to evaluate the feasibility of transferring the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle to fill the defect caused by loss of the patella and extensor tendon mechanism after failure and removal of allograft material. Transfer of the medial and lateral vastus muscles with their distal attachments into the tibia achieved closure of the defect but did not provide robust tendon material to fill the defect in the anterior knee. The medial gastrocnemius muscle reached easily to the muscular portion of the vastus medialis and lateralis flaps and provided secure closure of the anterior knee and strong attachment of viable muscle and tendon. METHODS Five knees (five patients) with failed patella-patellar tendon allograft between August 2008 and April 2010 were repaired using this technique. RESULTS Mean extensor lag was 47° (range, 35°-62°) before surgery and improved to 12° (range, 5°-15°) 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results suggest that the described muscle transfer technique may provide an approach to salvage the failed extensor mechanism allograft after TKA.","Whiteside, Leo A",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,829,1

Current research utilized an Analytical Quality by Design approach to optimize levels and combinations of critical gas pressure (sheath, auxiliary, sweep) and temperature (ion transfer tube, vaporizer) parameters for high-sensitivity mass spectrometric quantification of brain tissue glutamine. A Design of Experiments (DOE) matrix for evaluation of relationships between these multiple independent variables and a singular response variable, e.g. glutamine chromatogram area, was developed by statistical response surface methodology using central composite design. A second-order polynomial equation was generated to identify and predict singular versus combinatory effects of synergistic and antagonistic factors on chromatograph area. Predicted versus found outcomes overlapped, with enhanced area associated with the latter. DOE methodology was subsequently used to evaluate liquid chromatographic variable effects, e.g. flow rate, column temperature, and mobile phase composition on the response variable. Results demonstrate that combinatory AQbD-guided mass spectrometric/liquid chromatographic optimization significantly enhanced analytical sensitivity for Gln, thus enabling down-sized brain tissue sample volume procurement for quantification of this critical amino acid.","Bheemanapally, Khaggeswar; Ibrahim, Mostafa M H; Briski, Karen P",Scientific reports,829,12

MATERIALS AND METHODS This institutional review board-approved retrospective study included 240 cases with a mean age of 47.6 ± 15.9 years, ranging from 20 to 90 years, who had a chest CT and RT-PCR performed. Computed tomography images were independently analyzed by 2 thoracic radiologists to identify patterns defined by the RSNA-STR-ACR consensus statement, and concordance was determined with weighted κ tests. Also, CT findings and CT severity scores were tabulated and compared. RESULTS Of the 240 cases, 118 had findings on CT. The most frequent on the RT-PCR-positive group were areas of ground-glass opacities (80.5%), crazy-paving pattern (32.2%), and rounded pseudonodular ground-glass opacities (22.9%). Regarding the CT patterns, the most frequent in the RT-PCR-positive group was typical in 75.9%, followed by negative in 17.1%. The interreader agreement was 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.96) in this group. The CT severity score had a mean difference of -0.07 (95% confidence interval, -0.48 to 0.34) among the readers, showing no significant differences regarding visual estimation. CONCLUSIONS The RSNA-STR-ACR consensus statement on reporting chest CT patterns for COVID-19 presents a high interreader agreement, with the typical pattern being more frequently associated with RT-PCR-positive examinations.","Silva, Claudio F; Alegria, Julia; Ramos, Cristobal; Verdugo, Jaime; Diaz, Juan-Carlos; Varela, Cristian; Barbe, Mario",Journal of computer assisted tomography,829,25

The fusion peptide alters the membrane organization and dynamics of the host membrane to facilitate membrane fusion. Generally, the effect of fusion peptide on the membrane is sensitive to the lipid composition of target membranes. In this present work, we have utilized steady state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy in tandem with circular dichroism spectroscopy to elucidate the binding, oligomeric status, secondary structure of the fusion peptide and its impact on the depth-dependent membrane organization and dynamics. We have used depth-dependent fluorescence probes, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and its trimethylammonium derivative (TMA-DPH), to evaluate the effect of the peptide-binding along the bilayer normal. We have exploited the energy transfer efficiency of tryptophan between TMA-DPH and DPH to determine the relative location of the solitary tryptophan present in the membrane-bound fusion peptide. We have further evaluated the effect of membrane cholesterol on the binding and organization of the peptide and the impact of peptide binding on the depth-dependent physical properties of the membrane at various cholesterol concentrations. Our results clearly demonstrate that the membrane cholesterol alters the oligomeric status of the membrane-bound peptide and the effect of peptide-binding on the depth-dependent membrane organization and dynamics. The role of cholesterol is important as the eukaryotic host cells contain good amount of cholesterol that might be important for the entry of pathogenic viruses.","Meher, Geetanjali; Bhattacharjya, Surajit; Chakraborty, Hirak",The journal of physical chemistry.

Spontaneously breathing and MV untreated infected animals (n = 11 in each group), as well as uninfected animals (n = 5 in each group) were used as controls. Microbiological features and inflammation were evaluated. Data are presented as medians (interquartile range). Linezolid alone tended to reduce pulmonary MRSA load in both SB and MV rabbits, but failed to prevent bacteremia (59%) in the latter. Linezolid alone dampened TNF-α lung production in both SB and MV rabbits (e.g., 2226 [789] vs. 11478 [10251] pg/g; p = 0.022). Statins alone did the same in both SB and MV animals (e.g., 2040 [133]; p = 0.016), and dampened systemic inflammation in the latter, possibly through TLR2 down-regulation within the lung. However, the combination of LNZ and statin led to an increased rate of bacteremia in MV animals up to 75%. Statins provide an anti-inflammatory effect in rabbits with MRSA pneumonia, especially in MV ones. However, dampening the systemic inflammatory response with statins could impede blood defenses against MRSA.","Pauchard, Laure-Anne; Blot, Mathieu; Bruyere, Rémi; Barbar, Saber-Davide; Croisier, Delphine; Piroth, Lionel; Charles, Pierre-Emmanuel",PloS one,829,20

Brazil is now ranked #2 in the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 pandemic, and existing disparities in the treatment of neuro-oncology patients in Brazil will challenge the clinical and surgical decisions of this population, possibly affecting global survival. OBJECTIVE To search the literature about the management of glioblastomas during COVID-19 pandemic to guide surgical and clinical decisions in this population of patients in Brazil. METHODS We performed a systematic search on the PubMed electronic database targeting consensus statements concerning glioblastoma approaches during COVID-19 pandemic up to July 18, 2020. RESULTS When approaching glioblastoma during the COVID-19 pandemic, important parameters that help in the decision-making process are age, performance status, tumor molecular profile, and patient consent. Younger patients should follow the standard protocol after maximal safe resection, mainly those with MGMT methylated tumors. Aged and underperforming patients should be carefully evaluated, and probably a monotherapy scheme is to be considered.

Studies have consistently shown that major depression is associated with decreased diabetic self-care behaviour. People with subthreshold depression experience greater functional impairment, have a poorer quality of life and use health services more than those without depressive symptoms. Although subthreshold depression impacts self-care behaviour, the relationship between subthreshold depression and diabetes self-care behaviour has not been systematically reviewed. The objective of this systematic review is to determine the association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviour in adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS This protocol will follow the guideline of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 (PRISMA-P-2015). A systematic search of literature will be conducted for observational studies reporting the association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviour in adults aged 18 years or over and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Emcare and CINAHL will be searched using predefined search terms. Title and abstract, full-text screening and data extraction of identified articles will be done by two reviewers independently. Discrepancies will be resolved by a third author. The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed using The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) risk of bias tools. The review results will be presented in the form of narrative synthesis, and if sufficient studies are available and variability among the studies is low, a random effects meta-analysis will be done to quantify the result. DISCUSSION This review will synthesise evidence on the association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviour in type 2 diabetic adults. The findings will be useful to researchers and policymakers to determine the most effective approach to overall diabetes management.

Methodology This was a randomized controlled trial conducted at Surgical Unit II, Holy Family Hospital over a period of six months. All patients with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis who presented in the emergency department of Holy Family Hospital on the call days of Surgical Unit II undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy were included in the study. After taking informed consent about the respective procedure, patients were allocated to two groups using computer-generated random numbers. Group A was operated using harmonic scalpel and in Group B suture ligation was done. Total time required to ligate the mesoappendix or to cauterize it using the harmonic scalpel was measured in minutes. Data was entered and analyzed in SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results A total of 110 patients were enrolled in the study according to the inclusion criteria of the study. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups. Patients in Group A were operated using harmonic scalpel whereas patients in Group B were operated by suture ligation for dealing the mesoappendix in laparoscopic appendectomy. Mean operative time to ligate the mesoappendix for Group A patients was 1.56 (SD = 0.68) minutes while that of Group B was 21.07 (SD = 2.84) minutes. There was no per-operative bleeding in case of Group A while its incidence was 24% of patients in Group B. Results were statistically significant. Conclusion The conclusion of the study is that the use of harmonic scalpel was better than suture ligation for ligating the mesoappendix in laparoscopic appendectomy in terms of mean operative time and per operative bleed, hence it's preferable over the later in laparoscopic appendectomy.","Qaiser, Muhammad Umar; Nazir, Aamna; Khan, Muhammad Sheharyar; Butt, Hafiza Kiran; Anwar, Muhammad",Cureus,829,1

INTRODUCTION The Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire has multiple language versions from many countries around the world. In addition there is extensive research evidence of its psychometric properties. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of this study was to systematically review the evidence available on the validity and clinical utility of the Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand as a measure of activity and participation in patients with musculoskeletal hand injuries in developing country contexts. METHODS We registered the review with international prospective register of systematic reviews prior to conducting a comprehensive literature search and extracting descriptive data. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality with the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments critical appraisal tool, the checklist to operationalize measurement characteristics of patient-rated outcome measures and the multidimensional model of clinical utility. RESULTS Fourteen studies reporting 12 language versions met the eligibility criteria. Two language versions (Persian and Turkish) had an overall rating of good, and one (Thai) had an overall rating of excellent for cross-cultural validity. The remaining 9 language versions had an overall poor rating for cross-cultural validity. Content and construct validity and clinical utility yielded similar results. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS Poor quality ratings for validity and clinical utility were due to insufficient documentation of results and inadequate psychometric testing. With the increase in migration and globalization, hand therapists are likely to require a range of culturally adapted and translated versions of the Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand. Recommendations include rigorous application and reporting of cross-cultural adaptation, appropriate psychometric testing, and testing of clinical utility in routine clinical practice.","de Klerk, Susan; Buchanan, Helen; Jerosch-Herold, Christina",Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists,829,27

To overcome the limitations of the simplified helix wheel model of six-helix bundle, we herein developed a novel HIV-1 gp41 NHR-CHR-NHR tripartite model for the rational design of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors with improved antiviral activities. DESIGN Based on the crystal structure of six-helix bundle, we evaluated the NHR-binding properties of each residue in CHR. In this new tripartite model, CHR residues were divided into three groups: major binding, nonbinding, and assistant binding sites. METHODS Eight CHR peptides were designed and synthesized to confirm the validity of the tripartite model. Their affinities to NHR and inhibitory activities were analyzed. RESULTS In this tripartite model, replacements in assistant binding sites either increased or decreased the inhibition of HIV-1 infection. We identified three peptides with mutations of the residues in CHR at the assistant binding sites in our tripartite model but nonbinding sites in the helical wheel model. These mutant peptides had anti-HIV-1 activity up to 26-fold more potent than that of C34, a CHR peptide designed on the basis of the helix wheel model. CONCLUSION These data verified the superiority and validity of our new tripartite model for the rational design of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors. This approach can be adapted for designing viral fusion inhibitors against other enveloped viruses with class I membrane fusion protein.","Su, Shan; Wang, Qian; Xu, Wei; Yu, Fei; Hua, Chen; Zhu, Yun; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu",AIDS,829,10

Gastrointestinal function was evaluated using the Acute Gastrointestinal Injury (AGI) grade proposed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. DESIGN Prospective observational study at a single center. SETTING University hospital. PATIENTS Consecutive patients presenting for elective cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC). INTERVENTIONS None. RESULTS Daily assessment using the AGI grade was performed on the first 3 postoperative days in addition to standard care. For analysis, 3 groups were formed based on the maximum AGI grade: AGI 0, AGI 1, and AGI ≥2. Five hundred and one patients completed the study; 32.7%, 65.1%, and 2.2% of the patients scored a maximum AGI 0, AGI 1, and AGI ≥2, respectively. Patients with AGI grade ≥2 had more frequently undergone thoracic aortic surgery and had longer surgery duration and time on ECC. Patients with AGI grade ≥2 had statistically significant higher frequency of GI complications within 30 days (63.6% vs 1.2% and 5.5% in patients with AGI 0 and AGI 1) and higher 30-day mortality (9.1% vs 0.0% and 1.8% in patients with AGI 0 and AGI 1). CONCLUSIONS Early GI dysfunction following cardiac surgery was associated with an unfavorable outcome. Increased attention to GI dysfunction in cardiac surgery patients is warranted and the AGI grade could be a helpful adjunct to a structured approach.","Seilitz, Jenny; Edström, Måns; Sköldberg, Martin; Westerling-Andersson, Kristian; Kasim, Alhamsa; Renberg, Anja; Jansson, Kjell; Friberg, Örjan; Axelsson, Birger; Nilsson, Kristofer F",Journal of intensive care medicine,829,1
81490,81490,81490,Lessons learned from the analysis of 200 laparoscopic sigmoid resections for diverticulitis.,8.815412,3.8046994,2009,"BACKGROUND There is no consensus for esophageal reconstruction in the pediatric population. Long defects are commonly repaired with gastric pull-up or colonic interposition; however, jejunal interposition offers several potential advantages in children. One historical concern with jejunal interposition has been the risk of flap infarction following transposition. The use of neck and intrathoracic vessels to ""supercharge"" the jejunum has been reported in adults. This study reports outcomes of supercharged jejunal interposition in pediatric and young adult patients with long esophageal defects. METHODS The authors reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent supercharged jejunal interposition for esophageal reconstruction at their institution from 2013 to 2017. The authors collected data pertaining to patient characteristics, operative technique, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS Twenty patients, 10 female and 10 male, aged 1.4 to 23.8 years, underwent esophageal reconstruction with supercharged jejunal interposition and were followed for a median of 1.4 years. Seventeen patients had a primary diagnosis of long-gap esophageal atresia, and three required reconstruction following caustic ingestion. Eighty percent of patients had undergone prior attempts at surgical reconstruction. Postoperatively, all conduits demonstrated coordinated peristalsis, and no flap losses were noted. Major complications occurred in seven patients, stricture dilation was performed in four patients, and there was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS Jejunal interposition with supercharging can be safely performed for management of long esophageal gaps in the pediatric setting; it is useful where the stomach or colon has been used previously or is unavailable. Long-term outcome studies are required to determine whether jejunal interposition provides a more durable and safe conduit than gastric pull-up or colonic interposition over time.

AIMS We aimed to perform a uniform assessment of the global burden of IBS using data from Google Trends, a novel, online tool. METHODS Google Trends measures popularity of a search term in a given week compared to popularity of all search terms in that week, calculated as relative search volume (RSV). We compiled data on the popularity of IBS and its treatments across 173 countries between 2014 and 2018. We compared Google Trends popularity for IBS with prior epidemiological prevalence data, while controlling for gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and physician density. RESULTS Of the 173 countries with Google Trends data, 137 countries also had data for GDP per capita and physician density. Worldwide popularity of IBS as a search topic increased from 79 to 89 (13% increase by RSV) over the 5-year period between 2014 and 2018. Country-specific change in IBS RSV ranged from - 35% (Nigeria) to + 64% (Pakistan). There was poor correlation between the Google Trends data and prior epidemiological data (0.08, Pearson correlation, p = 0.64). Popularity of the low-FODMAP diet increased the most among 8 common therapies (RSV 41 to 89, 117% increase). CONCLUSIONS Google Trends is a novel tool that can complement traditional epidemiological methods in gastrointestinal disease. Future research is needed to assess its utility and accuracy as a measure of disease burden across different gastrointestinal diseases.","Flanagan, Ryan; Kuo, Braden; Staller, Kyle",Digestive diseases and sciences,829,17

Intraoperative blood loss, time for jejunum-cojejunum anastomosis, time to oral intake, postoperative hospital stay, hospitalization expenses, and postoperative complications were compared. RESULTS All 55 patients (TLH = 30, CLH = 25) were successfully treated without conversion to open surgery. In the TLH and CLH groups, the time to oral intake was 3.57 ± 0.19 d and 4.56 ± 0.27 d, respectively (t = 3.07, P < 0.01), the postoperative hospital stay was 5.50 ± 0.28 d and 7.00 ± 0.74 d (t = 2.03, P < 0.05), and the hospitalization expenses were CNY 40,085 ± 2447 and CNY 26,084 ± 2776 (t = 3.79, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in intraoperative blood loss (9.57 ± 3.28 ml vs 8.2 ± 1.13 ml, t = 0.37, P = 0.72) or time for jejunum-cojejunum anastomosis (80.5 ± 2.46 min vs 75.00 ± 2.04 min, t = 1.68, P = 0.10). The median follow-up periods of the TLH and CLH groups were 17 and 16 months, respectively. Overall complication rates were comparable between the two groups (10% vs 8%, χ2 = 0.07, P = 0.79). CONCLUSIONS TLH in children with CDCs has the advantages of rapid gastrointestinal functional recovery and a short hospitalization.

As a result of the increased incidence of chronic blood loss and iron deficiency anemia in abdominal surgery patients and its impact on patient outcomes, we systematically evaluated the quality of evidence for preoperative intravenous (IV) administration of iron to patients with anemia undergoing major abdominal surgery with the focus on clinical outcomes. METHODS In this systematic review, PubMed, Cochrane, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web Of Science, and Excerpta Medica Database databases were searched up to 2019 using specific keywords. Inclusion criteria were patients that were over 18 years of age, underwent abdominal surgery, and received an IV iron treatment in the preoperative setting. RESULTS The nine studies included in the final systematic review do not provide consistent evidence of a reduced incidence of allogeneic blood transfusions with preoperative IV iron administration. However, IV iron administration did consistently cause a significant increase in hemoglobin levels relative to oral iron therapy or no iron. CONCLUSION Overall, these findings are consistent in that IV iron administration is highly effective at rapidly increasing hemoglobin levels in patients with iron deficiency anemia undergoing major abdominal surgery. Unfortunately, there is currently no evidence of reduced incidence of allogeneic blood transfusions or other enhanced outcomes.","Moon, Tiffany; Smith, Aaron; Pak, Taylor; Park, Brian H; Beutler, Sascha S; Brown, Travis; Kaye, Alan D; Urman, Richard D",Advances in therapy,829,1

The full cellular impact and mechanisms of these potent molecules are undefined at a proteomic level. Here, we report mass spectrometry analysis of translational reprogramming by rocaglates, cap-dependent initiation disruptors that include zotatifin. We find effects to be far more complex than simple ""translational inhibition"" as currently defined. Translatome analysis by TMT-pSILAC (tandem mass tag-pulse stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture mass spectrometry) reveals myriad upregulated proteins that drive hitherto unrecognized cytotoxic mechanisms, including GEF-H1-mediated anti-survival RHOA/JNK activation. Surprisingly, these responses are not replicated by eIF4A silencing, indicating a broader translational adaptation than currently understood. Translation machinery analysis by MATRIX (mass spectrometry analysis of active translation factors using ribosome density fractionation and isotopic labeling experiments) identifies rocaglate-specific dependence on specific translation factors including eEF1ε1 that drive translatome remodeling. Our proteome-level interrogation reveals that the complete cellular response to these historical ""translation inhibitors"" is mediated by comprehensive translational landscape remodeling.","Ho, J J David; Cunningham, Tyler A; Manara, Paola; Coughlin, Caroline A; Arumov, Artavazd; Roberts, Evan R; Osteen, Ashanti; Kumar, Preet; Bilbao, Daniel; Krieger, Jonathan R; Lee, Stephen; Schatz, Jonathan H",Cell reports,829,32

However, in this paper, we argue that it can be sustainably managed if the environmental boundary conditions, laid by the traditional customs and practices, are fully respected. We narrate an empirical study from the Zunheboto district of Nagaland, India, where we deployed a mixed research method to explore the Indigenous and Local Knowledge and Practices (ILKPs) associated with shifting cultivation (aka Jhum), particularly concerning farm-level practices, forest and biodiversity conservation, and disaster risk reduction measures. The research method included analysis of primary data obtained through Focus Group discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews (n = 21), and a questionnaire survey (n = 153) with Jhum farmers from two different age groups, i.e., below 50 years (middle-aged farmers) and above 50 years (older farmers). From the qualitative inquiry, we identified 15 ILKPs, which were then validated from survey responses. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to examine differences in agreement between two groups of framers. Based on this analysis, we conclude that upholding of the ILKPs holds strong potential for the local implementation of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly, SDG-1(No poverty), SDG-2 (Zero hunger), and SDG-15 (Life on land). However, eight of the identified ILKPs showed a statistically significant difference between older and middle-aged farmers, underlining a declining trend. Finally, we suggest suitable policy measures to mainstream ILKPs to balance the trade-offs in food production and biodiversity conservation, and to ensure the future sustainability of Jhum cultivation in the region and beyond.","Dasgupta, Rajarshi; Dhyani, Shalini; Basu, Mrittika; Kadaverugu, Rakesh; Hashimoto, Shizuka; Kumar, Pankaj; Johnson, Brian Alan; Takahashi, Yasuo; Mitra, Bijon K; Avtar, Ram; Mitra, Priyanka",Environmental management,829,27

During the experimental evaluation, 1st-step ROIs and 2nd-step ROIs were successfully extracted from the frame images regardless of the ambient lighting conditions. The final accuracies of the implemented CNN model are 99.9% for both the training (172,800 images) and validation (1080 images) dataset while the final losses for the training and validation datasets are 0.48 and 0.45 after 13th epoch, respectively. In the 24-h continuous monitoring test, the accuracy of the model for volume recognition considering all the 1440 measurements (960 for day-lighting and 480 for night-lighting) is 95.5%, whereas in day-lighting and night-lighting modes the accuracies of the model are 98.2% and 90.0%, respectively.

The presence and volume of DWI lesions predict early deterioration in this population. We aimed to study the rate and implications of DWI reversal in patients with TIA/minor stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with TIA/minor stroke were prospectively enrolled and imaged within 24 hours of onset. Patients were followed for 3 months with repeat MR imaging either at day 30 or 90. Baseline DWI/PWI and follow-up FLAIR final infarct volumes were measured. RESULTS Of 418 patients included, 55.5% had DWI and 37% had PWI (time-to-peak of the impulse response ≥2 seconds' delay) lesions at baseline. The median time from symptom onset to baseline and follow-up imaging was 13.4 (interquartile range, 12.7) and 78.73 hours (interquartile range, 60.2), respectively. DWI reversal occurred in 5.7% of patients. The median DWI lesion volume was significantly smaller in those with reversal (0.26 mL, interquartile range = 0.58 mL) compared with those without (1.29 mL, interquartile range = 3.6 mL, P = .002); 72.7% of DWI reversal occurred in cortically based lesions. Concurrent tissue hypoperfusion (time-to-peak of the impulse response ≥2 seconds) was seen in 36.4% of those with DWI reversal versus 62.4% without (P = .08). DWI reversal occurred in 3.3% of patients with penumbral patterns (time-to-peak of the impulse response ≥6 seconds - DWI) > 0 and in 6.8% of those without penumbral patterns (P = .3). The severity of hypoperfusion, defined as greater prolongation of time-to-peak of the impulse response (≥2, ≥4, ≥6, ≥8 seconds), did not affect the likelihood of DWI reversal (linear trend, P = .147). No patient with DWI reversal had an mRS score of ≥2 at 90 days versus 18.2% of those without reversal (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS DWI reversal is uncommon in patients with TIA/minor stroke and is more likely to occur in those with smaller baseline lesions. DWI reversal should not have a significant effect on the accuracy of penumbra definition.","Asdaghi, N; Campbell, B C V; Butcher, K S; Coulter, J I; Modi, J; Qazi, A; Goyal, M; Demchuk, A M; Coutts, S B",AJNR.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Of 1,732 participants with diabetes recruited to the longitudinal observational Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II (FDS2) between 2008 and 2011, 1,482 had confirmed type 2 diabetes (mean age 65.8 years and median diabetes duration 9.0 years; 51.6% were male). All were followed for hospitalizations for or with, or deaths from, pneumonia/influenza, ascertained from validated administrative data linkage from study entry to end (2016). Cox regression and competing risk regression were used to identify independent predictors of this outcome. RESULTS Two-thirds of participants (n = 982) were taking an ACEi and/or ARB at study entry (498 [33.6%] ACEi, 408 [27.5%] ARB, 76 [5.1%] both). During 9,511 person-years of follow-up (mean ± SD 6.4 ± 2.0 years), 174 participants had incident pneumonia/influenza (156 hospitalizations and 18 deaths without hospitalization). In Cox regression analysis, baseline ACEi/ARB use was independently associated with a reduced risk of incident pneumonia/influenza (cause-specific hazard ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0.45, 0.89], P = 0.008). Allowing for the competing risk of death did not change this finding (subdistribution HR 0.67 [0.48, 0.95], P = 0.024), and similar reductions were seen for ACEi, ARB alone, and ACEi/ARB combination therapy. There was no significant change in use of ACEi/ARB during follow-up [interaction with ln(time), P = 0.70]. Other significant predictors of incident pneumonia/influenza were previously reported, clinically plausible variables. CONCLUSIONS ACEi/ARB reduce the risk of pneumonia/influenza in people with type 2 diabetes.","Davis, Timothy M E; Davis, Wendy A",Diabetes care,829,9

METHODS This article is based on an invited lecture by the first author at a conference-the eHealth Summit (""Pediatric Rehabilitation in a Digital Space"")-organized by the other authors and their colleagues in May 2020. RESULTS The first author offers his own experiences and perspectives, supplemented by comments and observations contributed by many of the 9000+ attendees at this talk, as curated by the second and third authors. The basic messages are that while life for families of children with developmental disabilities, and for service providers who work with them, is significantly altered, many important lessons are being learned. CONCLUSIONS The comments from participants support the currency of the ideas that were presented, and encourage childhood disability professionals to reflect on what we are learning, so that we can seize the opportunities they afford to do things differently-and we believe better-moving forward. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Ideas generated by colleagues and parents suggest that there may be alternatives to ""business as usual"" in childhood disability services after the COVID pandemic is over. People are recognizing opportunities, and benefits, to offering services virtually, including being able to see children in their natural environments, saving parents time, money and hassles to attend clinics in person, and perhaps increasing the availability of services. Many issues remain to be investigated systematically, including, among others, what services (assessments and interventions) require hands-on connections, what payment structures can accommodate new models of services, how professionals can work together in a virtual world, and what families will want. Regardless of the final answers to these issues, we believe that we should not simply ""go back to normal""; rather, we should expand the range, nature and locations of our services for children with developmental disabilities and their families.","Rosenbaum, Peter L; Silva, Mindy; Camden, Chantal",Disability and rehabilitation,829,16

In this context, the anterior approach becomes an important technique. However, one of the main limitations of this methods is the need for dedicated retractors, which requires larger incisions for its positioning and increases the cost of the procedure. The objective of the present study is to describe a technique for retracting abdominal structures by anterior approaches to the lumbar spine using Steinmann's wires. METHODS This manuscript consists in a technique description of anterior approach for lumbar spine. RESULTS Surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spine disease is often necessary when the patients have symptoms refractory to conservative treatments. Many of them will be candidates for surgical treatment due to anterior approach, either for arthrodesis/ALIF or arthroplasty. Small incisions are performed for positioning the modified Langenbeck retractors and the Steinmann wires. These retractors are easily positioned and provide good exposure of the lumbar discs making it possible to implant appropriate cages for restoring the necessary height, lordosis and sagittal balance. CONCLUSION The technique described is safe, inexpensive and reproducible. Simple and easily accessible instruments are required in most hospital complexes.","Dias Pereira Filho, Aecio Rubens",World neurosurgery,829,1

However, little is known regarding the clinical impact of IHGT pull-up via the retrosternal route. PATIENTS AND METHODS Clinical data of 231 patients receiving gastric tube reconstruction via the retrosternal route following esophagectomy were collected from medical charts. RESULTS Of the 231 patients, 19 (8%) developed IHGT. Vocal cord palsy, particularly with delayed onset, developed at a significantly high frequency in the group of patients with IHGT. There were no significant differences in the frequency of other surgical complications. CONCLUSION This is the first report to examine the clinical impact of IHGT pull-up via the retrosternal route. Vocal cord palsy, particularly with delayed onset, developed in the group of patients with IHGT. Therefore, when reconstruction is performed via the retrosternal route, it is very important that blunt and blind dissection of the retrosternal space be performed with extreme care to prevent pleural injury.","Uemura, Norihisa; Abe, Tetsuya; Kawakami, Jiro; Hosoi, Takahiro; Ito, Seiji; Shimizu, Yasuhiro",Digestive surgery,829,1

Rem is cleaved at the ER membrane into a functional N-terminal signal peptide (SP) and the C-terminus (Rem-CT). Rem-CT lacks a membrane-spanning domain and a known ER retention signal, yet was not detectably secreted into cell supernatants. Inhibition of intracellular trafficking by the drug Brefeldin A (BFA), which interferes with the ER to Golgi secretory pathway, resulted in dramatically reduced intracellular Rem-CT levels that were not rescued by proteasomal or lysosomal inhibitors. A Rem mutant lacking glycosylation was cleaved into SP and Rem-CT, but was insensitive to BFA, suggesting that unglycosylated Rem-CT does not reach this BFA-dependent compartment. Treatment with Endoglycosidase H indicated that Rem-CT does not traffic through the Golgi. Analysis of wild-type Rem-CT and its glycosylation mutant by confocal microscopy revealed that both were primarily localized to the ER lumen. A small fraction of wild-type Rem-CT, but not the unglycosylated mutant, was co-localized with Rab5+ early endosomes. Expression of a dominant-negative (DN) form of ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) (T31N) mimicked the effects of BFA by reducing Rem-CT levels and increased Rem-CT association with early and late endosomes. Inhibition of the AAA ATPase, p97/VCP, rescued Rem-CT in the presence of BFA or DN Arf1 and prevented localization to Rab5+ endosomes. Thus, Rem-CT uses an unconventional p97-mediated scheme for trafficking to early endosomes.IMPORTANCEMouse mammary tumor virus is a complex retrovirus that encodes a regulatory/accessory protein, Rem. Rem is a precursor protein that is processed at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by signal peptidase. The N-terminal SP uses the p97/VCP ATPase to elude ER-associated degradation to traffic to the nucleus and serve a human immunodeficiency virus Rev-like function. In contrast, the function of the C-terminal glycosylated cleavage product (Rem-CT) is unknown. Since localization is critical for protein function, we used mutants, inhibitors, and confocal microscopy to localize Rem-CT. Surprisingly, Rem-CT, which lacks a transmembrane domain or an ER retention signal, was detected primarily within the ER and required glycosylation and the p97 ATPase for early endosome trafficking without passage through the Golgi. Thus, Rem-CT uses a novel intracellular trafficking pathway, potentially impacting host anti-viral immunity.","Xu, Wendy Kaichun; Gou, Yongqiang; Lozano, Mary M; Dudley, Jaquelin P",Journal of virology,829,10

RESULTS The research included in this review showed that children with ADHD undertaking exercise experienced improvements in their characteristic symptoms, mainly attention deficit and hyperactivity, in comparison to other sedentary tasks such as watching a video. Five minutes of jumping or thirty minutes on a treadmill or static bicycle were enough to produce appreciable improvements in inhibitory control or in cognitive and executive functions. Benefits following exercise were also seen in other aspects such as reaction times and preparation for response, motor skills or brain activity.

We describe potential indications for the procedure and outcomes in a complex patient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed records of patients who underwent an OJ at our institution between 2005 and 2014. Primary outcomes include operating time, length of hospital stay, time to feeding goals, and postoperative complications. RESULTS We identified 12 children (6 males) with multiple comorbidities who underwent OJ procedures. The median age at surgery was 11years (range 3months-23years). Eleven patients had failed previous alternative feeding access or antireflux procedures. All patients eventually reached their feeding goals. Eight were at goal feeds in <10days. Two achieved goal feeds <1month, one <4months, and one within 7months. There was one OJ failure because of fistula formation requiring surgical revision, and one child was treated successfully but died of unrelated causes. Four children eventually transitioned to PO or G-tube feeds, and six were tolerating feeds via OJ at last follow-up (8-74months). CONCLUSIONS OJ provides a durable alternative to gastrojejunostomy tube for patients who are poor candidates for or have failed Nissen fundoplication. It is technically easier to perform than a gastroesophageal disconnect procedure, has minimal surgical comorbidities, and can provide durable feeding access and achievement of goal feeds in a complex and refractory patient subset.","Schlager, Avraham; Arps, Kelly; Siddharthan, Ragavan; Rajdev, Priya; Heiss, Kurt F",Journal of pediatric surgery,829,8

We report the discovery of a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV that blocks replication by inhibiting the unwinding activity of the SARS-CoV helicase (nsp13). We used a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based helicase assay to screen the Maybridge Hitfinder chemical library. We identified and validated a compound (SSYA10-001) that specifically blocks the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and dsDNA unwinding activities of nsp13, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of 5.70 and 5.30 μM, respectively. This compound also has inhibitory activity (50% effective concentration [EC(50)] = 8.95 μM) in a SARS-CoV replicon assay, with low cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC(50)] = >250 μM), suggesting that the helicase plays a still unidentified critical role in the SARS-CoV life cycle. Enzyme kinetic studies on the mechanism of nsp13 inhibition revealed that SSYA10-001 acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of nsp13 with respect to nucleic acid and ATP substrates. Moreover, SSYA10-001 does not affect ATP hydrolysis or nsp13 binding to the nucleic acid substrate. SSYA10-001 did not inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase, other bacterial and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, or reverse transcriptase. These results suggest that SSYA10-001 specifically blocks nsp13 through a novel mechanism and is less likely to interfere with the functions of cellular enzymes that process nucleic acids or ATP. Hence, it is possible that SSYA10-001 inhibits unwinding by nsp13 by affecting conformational changes during the course of the reaction or translocation on the nucleic acid. SSYA10-001 will be a valuable tool for studying the specific role of nsp13 in the SARS-CoV life cycle, which could be a model for other nidoviruses and also a candidate for further development as a SARS antiviral target.","Adedeji, Adeyemi O; Singh, Kamalendra; Calcaterra, Nicholas E; DeDiego, Marta L; Enjuanes, Luis; Weiss, Susan; Sarafianos, Stefan G",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,829,1

We aimed to compare therapeutic hypothermia using either surface or endovascular techniques in terms of efficacy, complications and outcome. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Thirty-bed teaching hospital intensive care unit (ICU). PATIENTS All patients (n=83) undergoing therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest over a 2.5-year period. The mean age was 61+/-16 years; 88% of arrests occurred out of hospital, and 64% were ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia. INTERVENTIONS Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated in the ICU using iced Hartmann's solution, followed by either surface (n=41) or endovascular (n=42) cooling; choice of technique was based upon endovascular device availability. The target temperature was 32-34 degrees C for 12-24 h, followed by rewarming at a rate of 0.25 degrees Ch(-1). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Endovascular cooling provided a longer time within the target temperature range (p=0.02), less temperature fluctuation (p=0.003), better control during rewarming (0.04), and a lower 48-h temperature load (p=0.008). Endovascular cooling also produced less cooling-associated complications in terms of both overcooling (p=0.05) and failure to reach the target temperature (p=0.04). After adjustment for known confounders, there were no differences in outcome between the groups in terms of ICU or hospital mortality, ventilator free days and neurological outcome. CONCLUSION Endovascular cooling provides better temperature management than surface cooling, as well as a more favorable complication profile.

On the surface, they seem to offer similar-sized stomachs after the procedures are performed. We chose to perform a randomized double-blinded trial to see if similar-sized pouches result in similar types of weight loss. Our belief was that sleeve gastrectomy would offer at least a 10% better weight loss over a 3-year period. METHODS Thirty patients were randomized to one of two arms. The patients and the third party administrator following the patients were blinded as to which procedure was chosen. The surgeon had full knowledge of the patients' surgery throughout the treatment. The decision of which arm to place them was made by a single employee of the third party administrator and not shared with the employees following the patients. Patients were then followed for 3 years. RESULTS There were no differences in weight, age, or BMI preoperatively. There were no differences between the two groups at any follow-up time point from 6 months to 3 years. Follow-up was 100%.

Even with our growing understanding of the cognitive neuroscience of music, the answer to this question remains unclear. One method for conceiving possible representations is to use artificial neural networks, which can provide biologically plausible models of cognition. One could train networks to solve musical problems, and then study how these networks encode musical properties. However, researchers rarely examine network structure in detail because networks are difficult to interpret, and because many assume that networks capture informal or subsymbolic properties. Here we report very high correlations between network connection weights and discrete Fourier phase spaces used to represent musical sets. This is remarkable because there is no clear mathematical relationship between network learning rules and discrete Fourier analysis. That networks discover Fourier phase spaces indicates that these spaces have an important role to play outside of formal music theory. Finding phase spaces in networks raises the strong possibility that Fourier components are possible codes for musical cognition.","Dawson, Michael R W; Perez, Arturo; Sylvestre, Sara",Scientific reports,829,31

We sought to assess embolization with these agents by using a dual-lumen balloon catheter in an experimental setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighteen injections of liquid embolic agents were performed in the rete mirabile of swine. We used 3 methods to control liquid embolic agent reflux: 1) dual-lumen balloon-catheter (group A, n = 8); 2) injection of liquid embolic agent after proximal n-BCA plug formation through a second microcatheter (group B, n = 4); and 3) standard liquid embolic agent injection (group C, controls, n = 6). The following outcomes were graded by using ordinal scales by angiography, macrophotography, and radiography of retia after euthanasia: 1) angiographic and pathologic extent of liquid embolic agent embolization of the rete, 2) reflux of liquid embolic agents in the parent artery, and 3) density of liquid embolic agents in the proximal rete. Technical complications were also recorded. A successful injection was defined as an embolization that reached the contralateral rete without reflux into proximal external branches. Exact logistic regression analyses were performed to compare groups. RESULTS There were significant differences among groups for reflux (P = .029) and liquid embolic agent density in the proximal rete (P = .014), while extension to the contralateral rete did not reach statistical significance (P = .07).

However, no apparent studies have reported national-level data on buprenorphine diversion. METHODS Case report data were drawn from a quarterly survey of prescription drug diversion completed by a national sample of law enforcement and regulatory agencies who engage in drug diversion investigations. Quarterly rates of buprenorphine diversion per 100 000 population and 100 000 prescriptions dispensed were calculated for the period 2002 through 2019. Population-based diversion rates were also calculated by U.S. region. RESULTS In total, 9670 cases of diverted buprenorphine were reported across all 50 states and the District of Columbia during the study period. Buprenorphine diversion rates, per 100 000 population, were characterized by an accelerating increase over time; increases in diversion rates from 1st quarter 2002 through 4th quarter 2006 were not statistically significant, yet from 1st quarter 2007 through 4th quarter 2019, the rate of diversion cases increased by 0.0067 cases per 100 000 per quarter (p < 0.001). Buprenorphine diversion rates per 100 000 prescriptions dispensed indicated a gradual increase over time; from 3rd quarter 2010 through 4th quarter 2019, diversion rates showed a statistically significant increase of 0.28 cases (p = 0.037) per quarter on average. The Northeast was the only region that did not observe an increase in the average quarterly change in buprenorphine diversion rates after 2006. CONCLUSIONS Findings from this study illustrate longitudinal national trends of increasing buprenorphine diversion. Continued systematic surveillance of this phenomenon is needed.","Buttram, Mance E; Kurtz, Steven P; Margolin, Zachary R; Severtson, Stevan Geoffrey",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,829,5

With renewed attention on these therapies from researchers and policy makers alike, the well-documented challenges of evaluating their safety and efficacy are once again of global concern. Between 2005 and 2018, the World Health Organization conducted a series of surveys, in which 88 percent of responding member states confirmed that their biggest challenge in traditional medicine was the need for technical guidance on research and evaluation. As a first step in pursuing this need, our commentary summarizes thirteen international and regional guidance documents by three broad categories on evaluating safety, efficacy, and product quality for market-based approval and distribution of these treatments. We highlight the paucity of updated international recommendations on these subjects and identify gaps that could inform the current evidence base. All available guidance note the need for evidence surrounding the efficacy of these treatments and practices but are also quick to caution against methodological difficulties in the conduct of such evaluations. Evidence suggests that improved evaluation methods on efficacy and effectiveness are crucial toward expanding future research into establishing the cost-effectiveness of these therapies, in the context of shifting acceptance, interest, and integration of traditional medicines into health systems, and as another step toward Universal Health Coverage.","Lin, Lydia Wenxin; Ananthakrishnan, Aparna; Teerawattananon, Yot",International journal of technology assessment in health care,829,33

Exercise is an effective treatment strategy to manage symptoms and reduce long-term health risk. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been suggested as a more efficient exercise mode in PCOS; however, it is not clear whether HIIT is superior to moderate intensity steady state exercise (MISS). Methods: We synthesized available data through a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of isolated HIIT and MISS exercise interventions. Our primary outcome measures were cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin resistance, measured using V ˙ O2max and HOMA-IR respectively. Results: A total of 16 studies were included. Moderate-quality evidence from 16 studies identified significant improvements in V ˙ O2max following MISS (Δ = 1.081 ml/kg/min, p < 0.001, n = 194), but not HIIT (Δ = 0.641 ml/kg/min, p = 0.128, n = 28). Neither HIIT nor MISS improved HOMA-IR [(Δ = -0.257, p = 0.374, n = 60) and (Δ = -0.341, p = 0.078, n = 159), respectively]. Discussion: A significant improvement in V ˙ O2max was evident following MISS, but not HIIT exercise in women with PCOS. This contrasts with previous literature in healthy and clinical cohorts that report superior benefits of HIIT. Therefore, based on available moderate-quality evidence, HIIT exercise does not provide superior outcomes in V ˙ O2max compared with MISS, although larger high-quality interventions are needed to fully address this. Additional dietary/pharmacological interventions may be required in conjunction with exercise to improve insulin sensitivity.","Richards, Cory T; Meah, Victoria L; James, Philip E; Rees, D Aled; Lord, Rachel N",Frontiers in physiology,829,30

The path for virus invasion into humans and other hosts is mediated by ""host-pathogen"" interactions, specifically, virus-receptor binding. An in-depth understanding of the virus-receptor binding mechanism is a prerequisite for the discovery of vaccines, antibodies, and/or small-molecule inhibitors that can interrupt this interaction and prevent or cure infection. In this review, we discuss the viral entry mechanism, the known structural aspects of virus-receptor interactions (SARS-CoV-2 S/humanACE2, SARS-CoV S/humanACE2, and MERS-CoV S/humanDPP4), the key protein domains and amino acid residues involved in binding, and the small-molecule inhibitors and other drugs that have (as of June, 2020) exhibited therapeutic potential. Specifically, we review the potential clinical utility of two transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)-targeting protease inhibitors, nafamostat mesylate and camostat mesylate, as well as two novel potent fusion inhibitors and the repurposed Ebola drug, remdesivir, which is specific to RdRp, against human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

TGF-β1 and oxidative stress cooperate to drive fibrosis. Cells can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) through activation and/or induction of NADPH oxidases, such as dual oxidase (DUOX1/2). Since DUOX enzymes, as extracellular H2O2-generating systems, are involved in extracellular matrix formation and in wound healing in different experimental models, we hypothesised that DUOX-based NADPH oxidase plays a role in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis.Our in vivo data (IPF patients and mouse models of lung fibrosis) showed that the NADPH oxidase DUOX1 is induced in response to lung injury. DUOX1-deficient mice (DUOX1+/- and DUOX1-/-) had an attenuated fibrotic phenotype. In addition to being highly expressed at the epithelial surface of airways, DUOX1 appears to be also well expressed in the fibroblastic foci of remodelled lungs. By using primary human and mouse lung fibroblasts, we showed that TGF-β1 upregulates DUOX1 and its maturation factor DUOXA1 and that DUOX1-derived H2O2 promoted the duration of TGF-β1-activated Smad3 phosphorylation by preventing phospho-Smad3 degradation. Analysis of the mechanism revealed that DUOX1 inhibited the interaction between phospho-Smad3 and the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L, preventing NEDD4L-mediated ubiquitination of phospho-Smad3 and its targeting for degradation.These findings highlight a role for DUOX1-derived H2O2 in a positive feedback that amplifies the signalling output of the TGF-β1 pathway and identify DUOX1 as a new therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis.","Louzada, Ruy Andrade; Corre, Raphaël; Ameziane El Hassani, Rabii; Meziani, Lydia; Jaillet, Madeleine; Cazes, Aurélie; Crestani, Bruno; Deutsch, Eric; Dupuy, Corinne",The European respiratory journal,829,1

Accurate and useful indicators are needed for the effective use of resources. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also produced endogenously without exogenous exposure. Studies confirm that endogenous CO increases in conditions such as pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. This study aimed to compare patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and healthy people to reveal whether endogenous carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels differ. It was also to determine whether it could be a helpful indicator for the clinician in predicting disease severity in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS The study included 72 patients admitted to the hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and a control group of 75 healthy people. The research data was collected retrospectively in a tertiary emergency department. The patients' demographic data, pneumonia severity index (PSI) score, CURB-65 score, 30-day mortality, hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation (MV), and COHb levels were recorded. RESULTS While the COHb level was 0.9% (min-max, 0.1 - 4.0) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, it was 1% (min-max, 0.1 - 2.6) in the control group. No significant difference was found between the patients and the control group in terms of COHb levels (p = 0.341). Also, there was no correlation between COHb levels and PSI and CURB-65 scores. No significant difference was detected between COHb levels and patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia in terms of mortality, need for MV, or hospitalization (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS We concluded that COHb levels alone could not be used to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia or predict disease severity. Besides, in COVID-19 pneumonia, the COHb level was not a useful indicator of mortality, need for MV, or hospitalization decision. Further studies are needed to find useful indicators to assist clinicians in their decision-making process in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Demir, Mehmet C; Akpinar, Guleser; Sultanoglu, Hasan; Yildiz-Gulhan, Pinar; Caliskan, Emel; Guclu, Derya; Karakoyun, Salih; Ince, Nevin",Clinical laboratory,829,7

We aimed to conduct a rapid review of mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19 during breastfeeding. Methods We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and preprint articles up to March 2020. We included studies relevant to transmission through milk and respiratory droplets during breastfeeding of mothers with COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Results A total of 4,481 records were identified in our literature search. Six studies (five case reports and one case series) involving 58 mothers (16 mothers with COVID-19, 42 mothers with influenza) and their infants proved eligible. Five case reports showed that the viral nucleic acid tests for all thirteen collected samples of breast milk from mothers with COVID-19 were negative. A case series of 42 influenza infected postpartum mothers taking precautions (hand hygiene and wearing masks) before breastfeeding showed that no neonates were infected with influenza during one-month of follow-up. Conclusions The current evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid has not been detected in breast milk. The benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants. Mothers with COVID-19 should take appropriate precautions to reduce the risk of transmission via droplets and close contact during breastfeeding.","Yang, Nan; Che, Siyi; Zhang, Jingyi; Wang, Xia; Tang, Yuyi; Wang, Jianjian; Huang, Liping; Wang, Chenglin; Zhang, Hairong; Baskota, Muna; Ma, Yanfang; Zhou, Qi; Luo, Xufei; Yang, Shu; Feng, Xixi; Li, Weiguo; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Luo, Zhengxiu; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Yaolong",Annals of translational medicine,829,7

African-American and Hispanic-American subjects are admixed populations whose genetic inheritance combines two or more ancestral populations originating from different continents. Racial inequalities in admixed populations can be parsed into relevant groups of mediating factors (environmental vs genetic) with the use of measures of genetic ancestry, including the proportion of an individual's genetic makeup that comes from each of the major ancestral continental populations. This review describes sleep health inequalities in African-American and Hispanic-American subjects and considers the potential utility of ancestry studies to exploit these differences to gain insight into the genetic underpinnings of these phenotypes. The inclusion of genetic approaches in future studies of admixed populations will allow greater understanding of the potential biological basis of race-related sleep health inequalities.","Prasad, Bharati; Saxena, Richa; Goel, Namni; Patel, Sanjay R",Chest,829,1

METHODS We assessed the time to CIB in the Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in the Intensive Care Unit (SUP-ICU) trial. We assessed if associations between baseline characteristics including allocation to SUP and CIB changed during time in the ICU, specifically in the later (after day two) compared to the earlier (first two days) period, using Cox models adjusted for SAPS II and allocation to SUP. Additionally, we described baseline characteristics and CIB episodes stratified by earlier/later/no CIB and 90-day mortality status. RESULTS CIB occurred in 110/3291 (3.3%) patients after a median of 6 (interquartile range 2-13) days; 25.5% of the episodes occurred early. Higher SAPS II was consistently associated with increased risk of CIB (hazard ratio (HR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.05 in the earlier period vs HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03 in the later period; P=0.37); university hospital admission was associated with decreased risk of earlier CIB (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14-0.63); this significantly increased in the later period (to HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53-1.37; P=0.02). Patients with later compared to earlier CIB received more transfusions and had more diagnostic/therapeutic procedures for CIB. CONCLUSIONS CIB mostly occurred more than two days after randomisation.

We describe the psychological needs of HCPs during COVID-19 and the implementation of Project ECHO Coping with COVID (ECHO-CWC) to help HCPs' manage COVID-19 distress. METHODS We used an established rapid implementation approach to accelerate the development and delivery of ECHO-CWC to address the emerging needs of HCPs. Participants' needs were identified using a 10-question survey of participants' perceived risk of COVID-19 and a 5-item self-efficacy measure. Implementation outcomes consisted of participant engagement and session satisfaction scores using a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS 426 participants registered for ECHO-CWC. Needs assessment data (n=129) showed that most participants' reported feeling increased stress at work (84.5%), fear of infecting others (75.2%), and fear of falling ill (70.5%) from COVID-19, yet most participants accepted the risk associated with work during this time (59.7%). Participants were highly satisfied with the initial five sessions (mean=4.26). CONCLUSION HCPs reported the greatest concern with fears of infection and infecting others during the acute phase of the pandemic. Using an iterative curriculum design approach and existing implementation frameworks, the ECHO tele-education model can be rapidly mobilized to address HCPs mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Clarkin, Chantalle; Serhal, Eva; Pereira, Cheryl; Crawford, Allison",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,829,1

METHODS This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a large urban tertiary care medical center. Thirty-two patients undergoing operative procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic were placed into 2 preoperative screening protocols. Early in the pandemic a ""high-risk case protocol"" was utilized to maximize available resources. As information and technology evolved, a ""universal point-of-care protocol"" was implemented. RESULTS Of 32 patients, 25 were screened prior to surgery. Three (12%) tested positive for COVID-19. In all 3 cases, the procedure was delayed, and patients were admitted for treatment or discharged under home quarantine. During this period, 86% of operative procedures were indicated for treatment of oncologic disease. There was no significant delay in arrival to the operating room for patients undergoing point-of-care screening immediately prior to their procedure (P = .92). DISCUSSION Currently, few studies address preoperative screening for COVID-19. A substantial proportion of individuals in this cohort tested positive, and both protocols identified positive cases. The major strengths of the point-of-care protocol are ease of administration, avoiding subsequent exposures after testing, and relieving strain on ""COVID-19 clinics"" or other community testing facilities. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Preoperative screening is a critical aspect of safe surgical practice in the midst of the widespread pandemic. Rapid implementation of universal point-of-care screening is possible without major workflow adjustments or operative delays.","Urban, Matthew J; Patel, Tirth R; Raad, Richard; LoSavio, Phillip; Stenson, Kerstin; Al-Khudari, Samer; Nielsen, Thomas; Husain, Inna; Smith, Ryan; Revenaugh, Peter C; Wiet, R Mark; Papagiannopoulos, Peter; Batra, Pete S; Tajudeen, Bobby A",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,829,27

Thiazole containing compounds (thiazoles) have shown various biological activities like antioxidant, analgesic, antibacterial, anticancer, antiallergic, antihypertensive, antiinflammatory, antimalarial, antifungal and antipsychotic. The scaffold is present in more than 18 FDA approved drugs and also in more than 70 experimental drugs. Only a few reviews are available in the literature despite its huge medicinal importance. During the course of time, this scaffold has been studied extensively for its antiviral activities and provided compounds with activity in nM range. However, no focused review is available on the compilation of antiviral activities shown by this scaffold. OBJECTIVE In the present review, we have made an effort to compile antiviral literature of thiazoles reported from the year 2011 till date. METHODS We searched the SciFinder database (excluding patent literature) with keywords like ""antiviral"", ""anti-HIV"" and ""virus"". Further filters were applied for the year of publication and keywords thiazole, reviews etc. to get relevant literature reported for the antiviral activities of thiazoles. RESULTS Nearly, 50 research articles were selected to compile and review the antiviral literature of thiazoles reported from the year 2011 to 2017. Compounds 8, 25, 40, 62, 72, 73, 91, 112, 113, 131, 137, 175, 198, 200, 201 and 213 were reported in the literature with potent antiviral activity against CVB, SARS, RSV, HCV, HRV, VZV, TMV, FMDV, DENV, YFV, influenza virus, Junin virus, HIV-1, HSV, VV and EBV, respectively. CONCLUSION There is further scope for the synthesis and evaluation of novel thiazole compounds by taking most active compounds as lead structures.

The assessment of palliative sedation has been focused on the assess of the level of consciousness but a more comprehensive approach to assessment is needed. AIM To understand how the potential effects and possible adverse events of palliative sedation in Palliative Care patients are measured. DESIGN Integrative review of most recent empirical research. DATA SOURCES Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, PubMed, and CINAHL were searched (2010-2020) using the terms sedation, palliative care, terminal care, assessment. Limits included studies in English and adults. Inclusion criteria were: scientific assessment papers, effects and complications of palliative sedation; patients with incurable illness. RESULTS Out of 588 titles, 26 fulfilled inclusion criteria. The Discomfort Scale-Dementia of Alzheimer Type and Patient Comfort Score were used to assess comfort. The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and The Ramsay Sedation Scale are the most used to measure its effect. Refractory symptoms were assessed through multi-symptom or specific scales; except for psychological or existential distress. Delirium was assessed using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale and pain through the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool. The use of technical approaches to monitor effects is upcoming. There is lack of measurement of possible adverse events and variability in timing measurement. CONCLUSIONS There are palliative care validated instruments to assess the sedation effect but this review shows the need for a more standardized approach when assessing it.

Intraprocedural C-arm CT imaging has been shown to provide such information. However, its repeated use is limited due to increasing radiation exposure to the patient. The goal of this study was to evaluate a new volume-of-interest C-arm CT imaging technique, which would provide device-specific information through multiple 3D acquisitions of only the region of interest, thus reducing cumulative radiation exposure to the patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS VOI C-arm CT images were obtained in 28 patients undergoing endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. VOI images were acquired with the x-ray source collimated around the deployed device, both horizontally and vertically. The images were reconstructed by using a novel prototype robust reconstruction algorithm to minimize truncation artifacts from double collimation. The reconstruction accuracy of VOI C-arm CT images was assessed quantitatively by comparing them with the full-head noncollimated images. RESULTS Quantitative analysis showed that the quality of VOI C-arm CT images is comparable with that of the standard Feldkamp, Davis, and Kress reconstruction of noncollimated C-arm CT images (correlation coefficient = 0.96 and structural similarity index = 0.92). Furthermore, 91.5% reduction in dose-area product was achieved with VOI imaging compared with the full-head acquisition. CONCLUSIONS VOI imaging allows multiple 3D C-arm CT acquisitions and provides information related to device expansion, parent wall apposition, and neck coverage during the procedure, with very low additional radiation exposure to the patient.","Chintalapani, G; Chinnadurai, P; Maier, A; Xia, Y; Bauer, S; Shaltoni, H; Morsi, H; Mawad, M E",AJNR.

According to previous studies, younger people and women seemed to be particularly affected. The aim of this study was to describe mental health problems of students and to draw consequences for the further handling of pandemics and other crises. METHOD Students at the University of Heidelberg, a typical German ""full university,"" were surveyed online using internationally comparable screening instruments like the Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). In addition, the students had the opportunity to describe in a narrative form their well-being and to make suggestions how to improve their situation. RESULTS Out of a population of 27,162 students who were contacted by email, 2,137 students completed the questionnaire. The salient finding is that according to the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, 72.2% of the respondents feel seriously impaired in their well-being. This corresponds to the finding that 75.8% of the respondents in the PHQ-D show indications of at least one syndrome diagnosis. Depression was found in 41.8% of the respondents in the PHQ-D. Indications of moderate to severe and severe depressive syndromes were present in 31.8%. Signs of somatoform syndromes are found in 25.4% and of anxiety syndromes in 20.0%. 1,089 students gave narrative reports on how they were feeling and made suggestions for improvement. About 75% reported severely reduced well-being. Their main complaints were loneliness and depression and lack of recognition for their specific academic and life situation during the pandemic. By far, the largest proportion of students supposed that their mental health issues were caused and/or intensified by the pandemic-related social contact restrictions. The vast majority of them made reasonable suggestions for controlled relaxation of contact restrictions. CONCLUSIONS Students suffer severely from the pandemic-related social restriction. In respect to future pandemic outbreaks or other crises leading to social isolation, the dramatic consequences of social lockdowns should be taken into account. Under pandemic conditions, we especially should support persons lacking social networks.","Holm-Hadulla, Rainer M; Klimov, Margaritha; Juche, Tilman; Möltner, Andreas; Herpertz, Sabine C",Psychopathology,829,31

A 34-year-old woman presented with severe right hemiplegia and ataxia. She was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) 13 years ago and treated with rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) during the last 15 months. She had received her first dose of adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) three months after her last infusion of rituximab and three days before experiencing her latest MS relapse episode, preceded by mild symptoms (fatigue, myalgia, generalized weakness, etc.). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed several new periventricular, juxtacortical, brainstem, and cerebellar peduncle lesions. She received corticosteroid therapy for five consecutive days, and her neurological deficits slightly improved. Twenty-one days after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, her anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were below the lower detection limit. However, a decision was made to adhere to the vaccination schedule and not risk the patient's safety against an unfortunate COVID-19 contraction, and thus, she was advised to receive the second Gam-COVID-Vac dose after discontinuation of oral steroid taper. The safety of adenovirus-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune diseases requires further investigation. Meanwhile, clinicians should raise awareness among their patients regarding the potentially limited efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in those treated with anti-CD20 treatments. After careful, individualized risk-benefit assessments, planning a delay/pause in such treatments to create a time window for patients to receive the vaccine and develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity may be recommended.","Etemadifar, Masoud; Sigari, Amirhossein Akhavan; Sedaghat, Nahad; Salari, Mehri; Nouri, Hosein",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,829,1

PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to understand if attending a one-day workshop format of the Self Compassion for Healthcare Communities (SCHC) program would improve pediatric nurses' resilience, well-being, and professional quality of life. DESIGN AND METHODS Following a quasi-experimental design, pre, post, and follow-up surveys were acquired from 22 nurses who attended the training and 26 nurses who did not attend the training. In a linear mixed models regression analysis, changes in self-compassion, mindfulness, compassion, resilience, job engagement, professional quality of life (compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress), depression, anxiety and stress were analyzed between groups. RESULTS Participants in the intervention exhibited significant increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, compassion to others, resilience and compassion satisfaction, and significant decreases in burnout, anxiety, and stress compared to the non-intervention group. CONCLUSIONS A one-day SCHC training program provides nurses with knowledge and skills to increase their resilience and support their emotional well-being and professional quality of life.

Drug repurposing or repositioning is a well-known strategy that seeks to deploy existing licensed drugs for newer indications and provides the quickest possible transition from bench to clinics for unmet therapeutic needs. Given the current, urgent and dire need for effective therapies against novel coronavirus-19, this approach is particularly appealing. AREAS COVERED Here, we review the significant anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral properties of minocycline as potential mechanisms for efficacy against the novel coronavirus and highlight the promises and pitfalls of this approach. EXPERT OPINION As compared to other agents being investigated for COVID-19, minocycline offers distinct advantages in terms of potential efficacy in patients with life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and myocardial injury, well-known safety and interaction profile, relatively low costs and widespread availability. We call upon public and private funders to facilitate urgent and rigorous research efforts before evidence-based recommendations for its widespread use can be made.","Singh, Harmanjit; Kakkar, Ashish Kumar; Chauhan, Prerna",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,829,1

The radiolabeling mechanism was studied by 13C NMR, ESI/MS, and computational calculations. It was found that the high electrophilicity of the C3 carbonyl group in the isatin ring, which served as a trap for [18F]fluoride, was responsible for the failure of the radiolabeling via nucleophilic substitution of the mesylate group in 7a by [18F]fluoride. Once treated with a strong base, 7a opened the isatin ring completely to form an isatinate intermediate 16, which lost the ability to trap [18F]fluoride, thereby allowing the displacement of the mesylate group to afford the 18F-labeled isatinate 17. [18F] 17 can be converted to isatin [18F] 2 efficiently under acidic conditions. The ring-opening and re-closure of the isatin ring under basic and acidic conditions were confirmed by reversed phase HPLC analysis, ESI/MS and 13C NMR studies. Computational studies of model compounds also support the above proposed mechanism. Similarly, the ring-opening and re-closure method was used successfully in the synthesis of the 11C labeled isatin sulfonamide analogue [11C] 4 (WC-98). A microPET imaging study using [11C] 4 in the Fas liver apoptosis model demonstrated retained activity in the target organ (liver) of the treated mice. Increased caspase-3 activation in the liver was verified by the fluorometric caspase-3 enzyme assay. Therefore, this study provides a useful method for radio-synthesis of isatin derivative radiotracers for PET and SPECT studies, and [11C] 4 is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis.","Zhou, Dong; Chu, Wenhua; Chen, Delphine L; Wang, Qi; Reichert, David E; Rothfuss, Justin; D'Avignon, Andre; Welch, Michael J; Mach, Robert H",Organic & biomolecular chemistry,829,8

However, how regional unevenness of radiation oncologists/urologists in Japan or other risk factors correlate with age-adjusted mortality (ADM) of prostate cancer remain unknown. Methods In addition to those factors, we examined whether various other factors, such as the regional unevenness of radiotherapists/urologists, correlated with ADM for prostate cancer by region or prefecture. Statistical data were obtained from Annual Report of Hospital-Based Cancer Registries, Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions and etc. We used the averages of ADM over the past 10 years in each prefecture to determine mortality rates. Results There was no correlation between the number of radiation oncologists/urologists per 100,000 and the averages of ADM over the past 10 years by prefecture in Japan. On the other hand, smoking rates and drinking per capita (liters) were correlated, respectively (P = 0.0002 and 0.0008). Conclusion The current study of statistics by prefecture in Japan also suggests that factors such as smoking and drinking alcohol are correlated with the risk of prostate cancer mortality. On the other hand, regional unevenness of radiation oncologists did not correlate. These results suggest that there is validity in this study design of analyzing factors of risk of prostate cancer fatality, even in macro statistics by region.","Nagano, T.; Hoshi, A.",,829,33

While certain types of cancer have been decreasing in the White population, minority populations are more likely to be diagnosed in a later stage and die of cancer. Stigmas caused by a cancer diagnosis and the disease itself may be a contributing factor in late detection and increased mortality. A telephone survey of 798 Chinese immigrants living in San Francisco was conducted. Subjects were asked several questions with established responses regarding their beliefs about cancer. One quarter of the 798 participants still believe cancer is contagious. Many also believe cancer is caused by environmental as well as personal action such as immoral behavior. A logistic regression model indicated that women who are at a low income level and have resided in the United States for an extended period of time are more likely to believe cancer is contagious. Community stigmas toward cancer and cancer survivors will prevent some Chinese immigrants from seeking early diagnosis. Multimedia education efforts that utilize print, television, and radio may provide a point of entry to reach otherwise unreachable individuals.

BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting dental everyday practice. Clinicians have to reduce the number of patients per day and the time they spend in the dental office. Minimally invasive and digital approaches, with less possible exposure and interaction, are suggested to reduce the risk of infection. CASE DESCRIPTION The failure of a short-span implant prosthetic rehabilitation combined with pain and mobility of the involved teeth was the main complaint reported by a 78-year-old male patient, who asked an urgent appointment to solve the problem. An intraoral scanner allowed the clinician to immediately take a preliminary digital impression of the arch to be treated. The resulting 3D files were sent by e-mail to the dental technician who provided a digital wax-up for the computerized workflow. Computer-aided implantology (CAI) performed using an in-office cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) allowed clinician to guide the surgical approach in a prosthetic manner. Such an integration inside a well-defined workflow was the key for a successful and rapid treatment. CONCLUSION By using new innovative digital technology, the treatment was completed in 1 day, reducing the risk of COVID-19 by limiting the number of appointments and reducing contacts in confined environments like the dental office and public transportations. It also helped to reduce materials production and people movement in the treatment of dental emergency. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The possibility of performing an effective treatment saving time by using efficient technology and a minimally invasive procedure highlights the importance of digital planning in order to optimize every single step of the treatment. Digital workflow reduces also the movement of potentially infected materials from the office to the dental laboratory.","Stefanelli, Luigi V; Franchina, Alessio; Pagliarulo, Michele; Burgess, David; Patil, Shankargouda; Bhandi, Shilpa; Di Nardo, Dario; Di Carlo, Stefano; Testarelli, Luca; Gambarini, Gianluca",The journal of contemporary dental practice,829,22

The breaking of contagion chains relies on two complementary strategies: manual reconstruction of contacts based on interviews and a digital (app-based) privacy-preserving contact tracing. We compare their effectiveness using model parameters tailored to describe SARS-CoV-2 diffusion within the activity-driven model, a general empirically validated framework for network dynamics. We show that, even for equal probability of tracing a contact, manual tracing robustly performs better than the digital protocol, also taking into account the intrinsic delay and limited scalability of the manual procedure. This result is explained in terms of the stochastic sampling occurring during the case-by-case manual reconstruction of contacts, contrasted with the intrinsically prearranged nature of digital tracing, determined by the decision to adopt the app or not by each individual. The better performance of manual tracing is enhanced by heterogeneity in agent behavior: superspreaders not adopting the app are completely invisible to digital contact tracing, while they can be easily traced manually, due to their multiple contacts. We show that this intrinsic difference makes the manual procedure dominant in realistic hybrid protocols.","Mancastroppa, Marco; Castellano, Claudio; Vezzani, Alessandro; Burioni, Raffaella",Nat Commun,829,12

We identified escape mutations as those that preserve viral infectivity but cause a virus to look different to the immune system, akin to word changes that preserve a sentence's grammaticality but change its meaning. With this approach, language models of influenza hemagglutinin, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (HIV Env), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike viral proteins can accurately predict structural escape patterns using sequence data alone.

In some countries a considerable percentage of installed wind power capacity is near the end of its useful lifetime. In the case of Spain, the figure is 50% within five years. Over the last 20 years, wind energy technology has evolved considerably and the expected capacity factor has improved, thus increasing annual energy production, and capital expenditure and operational expenditure have decreased substantially. This paper studies the optimal decision under uncertainty between life extension and full repowering for a generic wind farm installed in the Iberian Peninsula when the future hourly electricity prices and the capacity factor evolve stochastically and seasonally. The results show that in economic terms, full repowering is the best option, with a net present value of €702,093 per MW installed, while reblading is the second best option. The methodology can be transferred to other specific wind farms in different electricity markets and can be used to develop national wind energy policy recommendations to achieve projected shares in the electricity mix.","Abadie, Luis M.; Goicoechea, Nestor",Energies,829,16

The richness of various optical and electronic behaviors has made them one of the rapidly rising materials on the horizon of material science and condensed matter physics. Having the sheets of atoms that are stacked in a disorganized manner makes activated carbon being different from other forms of carbon -graphite- structures. The researches about the shielding properties of activated carbon atoms for gamma-rays are very rare and required to be improved. Since the use of radioactive sources in different fields (nuclear industry, shielding material, radiation biophysics and space research application, etc.) has been increasing expeditiously, the photon interactions with matter has gained more importance in the world of material science technology. In this article, we review the basics of the impregnated activated carbons (AC1 and AC2), as well as the link between the structural behaviors and the gamma shielding properties in terms of both quality and efficiency. Both XCom software and EGSnrc simulation code were used to obtain the theoretical calculations that are significantly important to be able to understand the shielding properties of impregnated activated carbons (AC1 and AC2) for gamma-rays. At the end, the mass attenuation coefficients (µm), the total atomic and the electronic cross-sections (&#963;t,a and &#963;t,e), the effective atomic number and the effective electron density (Zeff and Neff), the half value layer (HVL), the tenth value layer (TVL), and the mean free path (MFP) values of such materials were calculated and then compared with those of some other known shielding materials like lead, borosilicate, concrete and vermiculite.

Moreover, the present review provides the first summary of the potential molecular mechanism of specific substances in LH capsules involved in resistance to SARS-COV-2 infection and the inhibition of cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) caused by IL-6. Conclusion This review summarizes the available reports and evidence that support the use of LH capsules as potential drug candidates for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. However, TCM exerts its effects through multiple targets and multiple pathways, and LH capsules are not an exception. Therefore, the relevant mechanisms need to be further improved and experimentally verified.","Liang, Chengyuan; Hui, Nan; Liu, Yuzhi; Qiao, Guaiping; Li, Juan; Tian, Lei; Ju, Xingke; Jia, Minyi; Liu, Hong; Cao, Wenqiang; Yu, Pengcheng; Li, Han; Ren, Xiaodong",,829,1

We utilise the recently developed Deep Transitions framework which combines Techno-Economic Paradigms and sociotechnical transitions approaches. The first deep transition entails the long running emergence of industrial modernity since the late 18th century which culminated in the post-Second World War economic ‘golden age’ underpinned by rapid and stable growth and prosperity in North America and Western Europe. The Deep Transitions framework draws attention to the increasing role of fossil fuels over this long period, and how fossil fuel consumption accelerated in the 20th century taking on a particular direction where energy, mobility, and food systems became increasingly reliant on oil while the share of coal as a proportion of the energy mix decreased. This paper integrates sociotechnical, historical and geopolitical literatures to examine how the development of the age of oil was shaped by wartime demand pressures and logistical challenges and the search for new solutions to these challenges in the United States of America and the United Kingdom.","Johnstone, Phil; McLeish, Caitriona",Energy Res Soc Sci,829,16
