This report analyses the epidemiological data on COVID-19 infection in children in Kazakhstan. Methods: The study included 650 paediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Demographic and epidemiological data and the symptoms and radiological evidence of complications were collected and analysed. Children were sub-divided into four groups: neonates/infants, young children, older children and adolescents. Results: All of the 650 children were under 19 years of age, 56.3% of whom were male, and 122 (18.8%) were newborns and infants. The majority of cases (n = 558, 85.8%) were asymptomatic and only four cases were severe (0.6%). The symptoms were as follows in descending order: cough (14.8%), sore throat (12.8%), fever (9.1%) and rhinorrhoea (5.5%). Diarrhoea (2%), dyspnoea (1.8%) and muscle pain were rare (1.1%). Only three children required intensive care, including invasive ventilation. One patient had acute respiratory distress syndrome. There were no deaths. Conclusion: Most cases of COVID-19 infection in children in Kazakhstan were asymptomatic or the symptoms were mild. Only three patients required intensive care.","Bayesheva, Dinagul; Boranbayeva, Riza; Turdalina, Bayan; Fakhradiyev, Ildar; Saliev, Timur; Tanabayeva, Shynar; Zhussupov, Baurzhan; Nurgozhin, Talgat",Paediatrics and international child health,https://doi.org/10.1080/20469047.2020.1857101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315538/,725

METHODS A total of 149 COVID-19 positive patients admitted from March 20 to May 10, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. RESULTS Ninety-eight (65.8%) patients received at least a single annual flu shot in the last year, and 51 (34.2%) were never vaccinated. On presentation, vaccinated patients were more likely to present with gastrointestinal symptoms (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between study groups in laboratory findings or clinical outcomes. In multivariate analysis, receiving the annual shot did not influence risk of intensive care unit admission (OR=1.17, 95%CI=0.50-2.72, p=0.72), intubation (OR=1.40, 95%CI=0.60-3.23, p=0.43), complications (OR=1.08, 95%CI=0.52-2.26, p=0.83), or mortality (OR=1.29, 95%CI=0.31-5.29, p=0.73). CONCLUSION Although the benefits of the influenza vaccine for preventing disease and reducing morbidity in influenza patients are well-established, no differences in outcomes for hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received their annual influenza vaccination versus the non-vaccinated cohort were evident. There is a need for future meta-analyses, including randomized controlled studies in which the number of cases is increased to validate these findings.","Kline, Adam; Trinh, Lily N; Hussein, Mohammad H; Elshazli, Rami M; Toraih, Eman A; Duchesne, Juan; Fawzy, Manal S; Kandil, Emad",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34547161/,725

Soon many doctors around the world started using this tool because of its increased accuracy and ease of use. Stethoscopes hold great significance in the medical community. However, is the importance placed on stethoscopes justified today? We now have devices like portable ultrasound machines that make it much easier to visualize the body. These devices offset their higher initial cost by reducing downstream costs due to their greater accuracy and their capability of detecting diseases at an earlier stage. Also, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, new ways are being investigated to reduce the transmission of diseases. Stethoscopes being a possible vector for infectious agents coupled with the advent of newer devices that can visualize the body with greater accuracy put into question the continued use of stethoscopes today. With that said, the use of stethoscopes to diagnose diseases is still crucial in places where buying these new devices is not yet possible. The stethoscope is a great symbol of medicine, but its use needs to be in line with what is best for the patient.","Qamar, Shahraz; Tekin, Aysun; Taweesedt, Pahnwat Tonya; Varon, Joseph; Kashyap, Rahul; Surani, Salim",Hospital practice,https://doi.org/10.1080/21548331.2021.1949170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180345/,725

Here, we report results of a descriptive, exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed as of February 11, 2020. Methods: All COVID-19 cases reported through February 11, 2020 were extracted from China's Infectious Disease Information System. Analyses included: 1) summary of patient characteristics; 2) examination of age distributions and sex ratios; 3) calculation of case fatality and mortality rates; 4) geo-temporal analysis of viral spread; 5) epidemiological curve construction; and 6) subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 72 314 patient records-44 672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, 16 186 (22.4%) suspected cases, 10567 (14.6%) clinical diagnosed cases (Hubei only), and 889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%)-contributed data for the analysis. Among confirmed cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and considered mild (80.9%). A total of 1 023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%.

We compared the SARS-CoV-2 samples purified by two consecutive chromatographic procedures (size exclusion chromatography [SEC], followed by ion-exchange chromatography [IEC]) with samples purified by ultracentrifugation. The samples prepared using SEC and IEC retained more spikes on the surface than the ones prepared using ultracentrifugation, as confirmed by TEM and AFM. TEM showed that the spike (S) proteins were in the pre-fusion conformation. Notably, the S proteins could be recognized by specific monoclonal antibodies. Analytical TEM showed that the inactivated virions retained nucleic acid.

METHODS Between October 2013 and October 2014, a total of 411 consecutive NSCLC patients who underwent VATS lobectomy in the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, were enrolled. Propensity-matched analysis, incorporating preoperative clinical features, was used to compare the perioperative outcomes and analyse the safety and efficacy between SP and MP VATS lobectomies for NSCLCs. RESULTS There were 115 patients in the SP group, and 296 patients in the MP group from October 2013 to October 2014. Propensity matching produced 100 pairs in this retrospective study. During the operation, the lobectomy took less time in the SP than in the MP (65.7 ± 14.8 vs 81.3 ± 13.6, P < 0.001) group, while the duration of lymphadenectomy was longer in the SP group (29.6 ± 16.7 vs 17.4 ± 13.3, P < 0.001). The total operation duration, the volume of estimated blood loss (55.1 ± 9.0 ml vs 58.7 ± 7.1 ml, P = 0.22) and the length of postoperative hospital stay (4.7 ± 1.2 days vs 5.3 ± 1.4 days, P = 0.05) were similar between the two groups. Postoperatively, SP and MP groups showed similar results in terms of morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS In comparison with conventional VATS, SP VATS lobectomy showed better safety and efficacy in the surgical resection of NSCLCs. Further studies based on larger populations and better methodology are required to determine its further benefits towards patients.","Shen, Yaxing; Wang, Hao; Feng, Mingxiang; Xi, Yong; Tan, Lijie; Wang, Qun",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezv358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26464451/,725
126212,[Prevalence and risk factors of respiratory viral infection in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].,2017,"BACKGROUND As the global COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, there has been much debate surrounding the optimal management of patients with asthma who are at risk of or contract COVID-19, whether asthma and steroids are risk factors for severe COVID-19, and how transmissible the virus is among children. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to provide allergists and other clinicians with pearls pertaining to the managementof patients with asthma in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide some information regarding the risk of transmission among the pediatric population. METHODS Utilizing the case of one of our own patients with asthma who developed COVID-19 as context, we review the recent literature discussing the risk of COVID-19 in patients with asthma, the management of asthma medications in the time of the pandemic, and the risk of viral transmission. RESULTS Despite initial reports that asthma was a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19, subsequent investigation has shown that this is likely not true. Additionally, the use of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids does not appear to increasethe risk of severe COVID-19, but there is no evidence guiding the use of biologic therapy. There is conflicting evidence regarding the ability of children to transmit the virus. CONCLUSION We provide pearls that asthma does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 and continued use of inhaled corticosteroids appears to be safe. While there is no evidence guiding the use of biologic therapies, a recent position paper suggests that they should be continued unless a patient contracts COVID-19, at which point they should be held until clinical recovery occurs.","Pitlick, Mitchell M; Joshi, Avni Y",Allergy and asthma proceedings,https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2021.42.200111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33357281/,725

In normal metal/ferromagnet bilayers, a concerted action of the interconversions, the spin Hall effect and its inverse effect of normal metals, results in spin Hall magnetoresistance, whose sign is always positive regardless of the sign of spin Hall conductivity of normal metals. Here we report that the spin Hall magnetoresistance of Ta/NiFe bilayers is negative, necessitating an additional interconversion process. Our theory shows that the interconversion owing to interfacial spin-orbit coupling at normal metal/ferromagnet interfaces can give rise to negative spin Hall magnetoresistance. Given that recent studies found the conversion from charge currents to spin currents at normal metal/ferromagnet interfaces, our work provides a missing proof of its reciprocal spin-current-to-charge-current conversion at same interface. Our result suggests that interfacial spin-orbit coupling effect can dominate over bulk effects, thereby demanding interface engineering for advanced spintronics devices.","Kang, Min-Gu; Go, Gyungchoon; Kim, Kyoung-Whan; Choi, Jong-Guk; Park, Byong-Guk; Lee, Kyung-Jin",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17463-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681024/,725

In the present article, we describe the first transgastric pure NOTES salpingo-oophorectomy, which we call peroral endoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy (POESY). METHODS A woman with BRCA1 mutation presented for prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. We offered her the transgastric approach, having performed more than 25 transgastric appendectomies. After gastroscopic incision in the corpus wall, we advanced the gastroscope into the abdominal cavity. Salpingo-oophorectomy was performed with the help of an intrauterine manipulator and a transvaginally introduced 5-mm trocar. The posterior colpotomy was dilated and the specimens were extracted. The gastrotomy was closed with an over-the-scope clip, and the colpotomy with a running suture. RESULTS The gastroscope provided excellent optical control and good tissue preparation. Prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed successfully via POESY. The patient recovered quickly and was discharged on the third day, with an uneventful follow-up. CONCLUSION The present case demonstrates the feasibility of transgastric access. The gastroscope provided excellent optical control and good tissue preparation. Therefore, we expect an increasing role of transgastric procedures for diseases in the pelvic region, particularly if new endoscopic platforms with better means of instrumentation and tissue management become available.","Hornemann, Amadeus; Suetterlin, Marc; Trunk, Marcus J; Gerhardt, Axel; Kaehler, Georg",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgo.2013.08.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434232/,725

While data show that the prognosis of the disease will be poor in the presence of comorbidity, we witness the death of patients with no comorbidities in our clinical practice. This study aimed to investigate the effect of comorbidity on the clinical course and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: 155 Rt-PCR (+) adult patients hospitalized at Ízzet Baysal State Hospital (Bolu, Turkey) diagnosed with severe and critical pneumonia between August 2020 and February 2021 were included in this single-center, retrospective study. The patients were divided into two groups with and without comorbidity, compared the severity of inflammation parameters, radiological involvement, and oxygen requirement, and evaluated their effects on mortality and hospitalization duration. Results: There was no significant difference in the severity of the computed tomography (CT) involvement, the oxygen requirement, inflammation markers, and duration of hospitalization in patients with comorbidities compared to those without. When we evaluated the patients with comorbidities in general and their subgroups, the relationship with mortality was not significant. The severity of CT involvement, high oxygen requirement, and inflammation markers such as lymphocyte, lymphocyte ratio, LDH, CRP, troponin, ferritin levels were found to be associated with mortality. Conclusions: In this study, we found that the presence of comorbidity did not affect mortality and duration of stay and that the severity of radiological involvement, the severity of hypoxemia, and the increase in inflammation markers were the determinants of mortality.","Afsin, Emine Cosgun Mehmet",Experimental Biomedical Research,https://doi.org/10.30714/10.30714/j-ebr.2021471925,725

In accordance with the purpose of the study, the data were collected by the literature review and then it was analyzed by the descriptive analysis method. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on international student mobility and the relationships between these variables are explained by tables and classifications.FindingsAccording to the findings obtained, the restrictions in physical student mobility and shutdown are observed as the biggest challenges that occurred in higher education during the COVID-19. On a global scope, international student mobility has experienced a major break. Physical campus life is still on standby. Online higher education does not give any campus life as before. Students cannot benefit form city's or country's facilities when studying online at home country. The collaboration between university and business has been declined and this is even more discouraging for international students. The hybrid education model produced an intermediate solution in this period. On the other hand, the rise of online education has created new techniques for higher education. University students who cannot go abroad attend different countries lectures and education programs. But also a new challenge has come as the access of online platforms in under developing countries university students. Online education system also discussed in terms of creating inequality in higher education.Research limitations/implicationsThis study focused on student mobility and not focused about academic mobility.Practical implicationsIt is seen that the traditional higher education system has been adapted into online distance higher education system since COVID-19 crises began globally. On the other side, it is observed that most of studies have focused the effect of COVID-19 on university students based on the transition to online education. When considering the effect of pandemic process on the mobility of international students and higher education, the authors can suggest policy makers to develop new higher education protocols and teaching models supporting key issues (economic, social, health, education and equalization) in the long-term.

185221,[Molecular epidemiological and clinical features of coronavirus HKU1 in children with acute respiratory tract infection in Lanzhou].,2010,"COVID-19 has evolved as a pandemic causing unprecedented damages and disruptions to all spheres of life including healthcare, transportation, supply chains, education, and economy, among others. Pandemics are very low-probability events associated with deep uncertainty about the timing of such events and ensuing damages. National policy-makers generally rely on a set of risk indices associated with natural disasters and pandemics to assess the country's vulnerability and strategy formulation for such rare events. This paper explores the efficacy of early warning systems (disasters and epidemics-based risk ratings) in predicting the country-level exposure to COVID-19. Utilizing three real data-sets reflecting the risk exposure of individual countries to disasters, epidemics, and COVID-19, we explore relations among the associated risk dimensions, namely hazard and exposure, vulnerability, and lack of coping capacity. A comprehensive methodology integrating Pearson's correlation, ANOVA, and Bayesian Belief Networks-based techniques is adopted to explore and triangulate relations among the three risk indices. Results show that the risk ratings associated with epidemic risk and COVID-19 risk are statistically strongly correlated. However, only the vulnerability dimension of epidemic risk significantly influences the two risks.","Qazi, A.; Simsekler, M. C.

Already, some countries decide to conduct lockdown using data models. In this scenario, the end user loss of integrity, loss of confidentiality and security on health records impacts the patients. The security of electronic health records (EHR) is a challenging task especially in COVID-19 like situations. It is a necessity to share secure EHR to physicians and patients which plays a vital role in COVID-19, and also data availability, scalability, and performance of data to receive the end-user is the loss of integrity. In this paper, we proposed an integrated approach of blockchain 4.0 technology used in IoT-based cloud environment that reduce the latency while transmission of health care records and introduce the blockchain-based electronic health records named as BEHR transmission between the physicians and patients. The performance of the proposed approach tested with the NodeJs software and ApacheJmeter open source JMeter Cloud Test environment and proved that the simulation-results of BEHR are an efficient approach in response time and file storage and transmission of EHR than the present conventional system. © 2021 IEEE.","Mallikarjuna, B.; Kiranmayee, D.; Saritha, V.; Krishna, P.

The hens (40 individuals per group) were vaccinated twice, subcutaneously in four week interval and eggs were harvested once a week. Control group consisted of eggs sampled from non-vaccinated hens located in neighbouring cages. The antibody activity was measured by ELISA. All used vaccines induced the rise of IgY antibody in egg yolks. Based on the duration and the highest level of IgY antibody against bovine alimentary tract pathogens C vaccine was further used in next two trials for vaccination of 1000 hens each time. Double immunization seems to be enough in mounting response against examined pathogens for several weeks. Immunization with C vaccine allowed to harvest eggs with satisfactory levels of E. coli, rotavirus and coronavirus IgY antibodies which may be used to evaluate their protective effect by oral administration in calves.","Sitnik, O; Jawor, P; Kopeć, W; Skiba, T; Stefaniak, T",Polish journal of veterinary sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23971196/,725

The polyproteins are cotranslationally processed by viral proteinases into at least 15 mature proteins, including four predicted cleavage products of less than 25 kDa that together would comprise the final 59 kDa of protein translated from open reading frame 1a. Monospecific antibodies directed against the four distinct domains detected proteins of 10, 12, and 15 kDa (p1a-10, p1a-12, and p1a-15) in MHV-A59-infected DBT cells, in addition to a previously identified 22-kDa protein (p1a-22). When infected cells were probed by immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy, p1a-10, -22, -12, and -15 were detected in discrete foci that were prominent in the perinuclear region but were widely distributed throughout the cytoplasm as well. Dual-labeling experiments demonstrated colocalization of the majority of p1a-22 in replication complexes with the helicase, nucleocapsid, and 3C-like proteinase, as well as with p1a-10, -12, and -15. p1a-22 was also detected in separate foci adjacent to the replication complexes. The majority of complexes containing the gene 1 proteins were distinct from sites of accumulation of the M assembly protein. However, in perinuclear regions the gene 1 proteins and nucleocapsid were intercalated with sites of M protein localization. These results demonstrate that the complexes known to be involved in RNA synthesis contain multiple gene 1 proteins and are closely associated with structural proteins at presumed sites of virion assembly.","Bost, A G; Carnahan, R H; Lu, X T; Denison, M R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10708455/,725

Patients admitted in ICU with an acute COVID event present with respiratory dysfunction and are more likely to have critical illness myopathy and neuropathy (CIMN). Physiotherapy services being integral part of non-pharmacological management of any ICU was implemented for patients with COVID 19; a novel viral disease. Objective This retrospective study was undertaken to explore the physiotherapy practices that could be implemented in patients admitted with COVID 19 in the ICU and its effect on mobility and oxygen requirement as an outcome. Methodology Following ethical permission of institute, the data was extracted from electronic data record sheet in which daily parameters for physiotherapy intervention were recorded. Data from a single ICU and step down unit (SDU) from 5th June to 5th July 2020 was analysed. Records of patients diagnosed with COVID 19 and admitted in ICU or SDU were studied. Those in the age group of 18 to 90 years, of either gender were included. Demographic characteristics, disease severity, oxygen requirement, mobility status, physiotherapy intervention were studied. Results 278 record sheets (110 ICU and 168 SDU) were retrospectively analysed for demographics. 44.55% of patients improved with side lying position, 37.27% with prone position and 10.91% with quarter prone position. 4.55% of patient maintained oxygenation in propped up sitting. 2.73% could not be positioned. Chest physiotherapy techniques applied were deep breathing, ACBT, paced breathing and diaphragmatic breathing. Deep intercostal pressure on NIV along with vibrations was given to 12.72% of patients in the ICU. Group therapy sessions were conducted in SDU where 50.59% patients participated. ICU mobility score showed significant improvement on Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test status on day 7 in the ICU (z=-5.99, p=0.00) and SDU (z= 7.676, p=0.00) compared to day 1. Descriptive analysis showed a definitive reduction in oxygen support requirement. Conclusion Most common form of physiotherapy interventions in patients with Covid 19 were therapeutic positioning, early mobilization and breathing exercises. Physiotherapy intervention appears promising in facilitating early patient ambulation and discharge. This study shows that it is safe and feasible to provide early physiotherapy treatment techniques in patients with COVID-19 using appropriate measures of infection prevention and cross contamination.","Jiandani, Mariya P; Salagre, Santosh B; Kazi, Shabana; Iyer, Saraswati; Patil, Poonam; Khot, Wasim Y; Patil, Ekta; Sopariwala, Mashira",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978920/,725

After detailing an analysis of our general scalable strategy that relies on OpenACC and CUDA, we discuss the various capabilities of the package. Among them, the multi-precision possibilities of the code are discussed. If an efficient double precision implementation is provided to preserve the possibility of fast reference computations, we show that a lower precision arithmetic is preferred providing a similar accuracy for molecular dynamics while exhibiting superior performances. As Tinker-HP is mainly dedicated to accelerate simulations using new generation point dipole polarizable force field, we focus our study on the implementation of the AMOEBA model and provide illustrative benchmarks of the code for single- and multi-cards simulations on large biosystems encompassing up to millions of atoms.The new code strongly reduces time to solution and offers the best performances ever obtained using the AMOEBA polarizable force field.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS Prospective surveillance of all cases of CDI diagnosed in hospital patients from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2012 in 450 public hospitals in all Australian states and the Australian Capital Territory. All patients admitted to inpatient wards or units in acute public hospitals, including psychiatry, rehabilitation and aged care, were included, as well as those attending emergency departments and outpatient clinics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of HI-CDI (primary outcome); proportion and incidence of HA-CDI and CA-CDI (secondary outcomes). RESULTS The annual incidence of HI-CDI increased from 3.25/10 000 patient-days (PD) in 2011 to 4.03/10 000 PD in 2012. Poisson regression modelling demonstrated a 29% increase (95% CI, 25% to 34%) per quarter between April and December 2011, with a peak of 4.49/10 000 PD in the October-December quarter. The incidence plateaued in January-March 2012 and then declined by 8% (95% CI, - 11% to - 5%) per quarter to 3.76/10 000 PD in July-September 2012, after which the rate rose again by 11% (95% CI, 4% to 19%) per quarter to 4.09/10 000 PD in October-December 2012. Trends were similar for HA-CDI and CA-CDI. A subgroup analysis determined that 26% of cases were CA-CDI.

For this reason, indirect methods using intragenic polymorphic markers described along the von Willebrand factor (VWF) gene are valuable tools for gene monitoring and linkage analysis. Several studies have demonstrated the four commonly utilized short tandem repeats (STRs), three located in intron 40 and one in the promoter region of the VWF gene, to be highly informative for this task. Our objective was t o develop a rapid, automated method to simultaneously analyze these four STRs for VWF gene tracking. Amplification of the four loci is achieved in a single multiplex fluorescent PCR which is then analyzed in the same run by capillary electrophoresis. Data processing with GeneScan and Genotyper software has simplified management and tabulation of the resulting haplotypes. Analysis of the VWF gene in DNA from 102 individuals (204 chromosomes) revealed that the three STRs within intron 40 showed significant linkage disequilibrium against each other but not against the VWP locus. Moreover, the combination of the four markers offers a high heterozygosity rate (>99%) that improves tracing VWF gene inheritance. In conclusion, the automated fluorescent capillary electrophoresis method presented here is an extremely rapid, simple and highly informative technique for association studies between VWD and the VWF gene in addition to genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis by precise linkage analysis in VWD-affected families.","Vidal, Francisco; Julià, Antoni; Altisent, Carme; Puig, Lluís; Gallardo, Doinique",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15886817/,725

It is just required that the interested enterprises send to the Italian National Institute of Health a selfcertification in which they declare the technical characteristics of the masks and that masks are produced according to the safety requirements. In this context, a technical-scientific unit was established at the University of Napoli Federico II to provide interested enterprises with state-of-the-art consultancy, testing and measurement services, adhering to rigorous scientific protocols. Characterization tests were carried out on 163 surgical masks and/or materials for their construction and they have enabled the identification of pre-screening criteria to simplify the procedure for evaluating surgical masks using methods for assessing the filtration efficiency of particles and aerosols. Based on experimental results, it has been observed that a filtration efficiency for particles with sizes larger that 650 nm (PFE>650) exceeding 35% might guarantees a bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) higher than 95% while BFE values higher than 98% are obtained when the PFE>650 is larger than 40%. PFE measurement is extremely simpler with respect to BFE, the latter being time-consuming and requiring specific equipment and methods for its realization. Many tested materials have shown the capability to assure high filtration efficiencies but Spundonded-Meltblown-Spunbonded (SMS), that are layers of non-woven fabric with different weights of Meltblown, can simultaneously guarantee high particle filtration efficiencies with pressure drop values (breathability) in the limits to classify the surgical masks as Type II/IIR. In fact, the fabric products analyzed so far have not been able to simultaneously guarantee adequate BFE and breathability values. On the contrary, Spunbonds of adequate weights can virtually verify both requirements and accredit themselves as possible materials for the production of surgical masks, at least of Type I. Further studies are needed to verify the possibility of producing low-cost, reusable surgical masks that could meet the criteria of circular economy.","D'Anna, Andrea; Di Natale, Francesco; De Falco, Gianluigi; Di Maio, Ernesto; Tammaro, Daniele; Quaglia, Fabiana; Ungaro, Francesca; Cassiano, Chiara; Salvatore, Paola; Colicchio, Roberta; Scaglione, Elena; Pagliuca, Chiara; Fontana, Luca; Iavicoli, Ivo",Giornale italiano di medicina del lavoro ed ergonomia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32614536/,725

We hypothesize that, by altering lung airway surface properties through an inhaled nontoxic aerosol, we might substantially diminish the number of exhaled bioaerosol droplets and thereby provide a simple means to potentially mitigate the spread of airborne infectious disease independently of the identity of the airborne pathogen or the nature of any specific therapy. We find that some normal human subjects expire many more bioaerosol particles than other individuals during quiet breathing and therefore bear the burden of production of exhaled bioaerosols. Administering nebulized isotonic saline to these ""high-producer"" individuals diminishes the number of exhaled bioaerosol particles expired by 72.10 +/- 8.19% for up to 6 h.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether spotted hyenas also had been infected with these viruses and to assess risk factors for infection. Serum samples were collected between 1993 and 2001 from 119 animals in a single clan for which behavioral data on social structure were available and from 121 hyenas ill several other clans. All animals resided in the Masai Mara National Reserve. Antibodies to CDV, FIV, FPLV/CPV, FECV/FIPV, FCV, and FHV1 were present in 47%, 3.5%, 81%, 36%, 72%, and 0.5% of study hyenas, respectively. Antibody prevalence was greater in adults for FIV and FECV/FIPV, and being a female of high social rank was a risk factor for FIV. Hyenas near human habitation appeared to be at lower risk to have CDV, FIV, and FECV/FIPV antibodies, whereas being near human habitation increased the risk for FPLV/CPV antibodies. Canine (distemper virus and FECV/FIPV antibody prevalence varied considerably over time, whereas FIV, FPLV/CPV, and FCV had a stable, apparently endemic temporal pattern. These results indicate that hyenas might play a role in the ecology of these viruses in the Serengeti ecosystem. The effect of these viruses on hyena health should be further investigated. The lower prevalence of CDV antibody-positive hyenas near human habitation suggests that reservoirs for CDV other than domestic dogs are present in the Serengeti ecosystem.","Harrison, Tara M; Mazet, Jonna K; Holekamp, Kay E; Dubovi, Edward; Engh, Anne L; Nelson, Keith; Van Horn, Russell C; Munson, Linda",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15137483/,725

Yet the sheer magnitude and uniqueness of this event has also spawned a massive mobilization of effort in the scientific community to investigate the virus, to develop therapeutics and vaccines, and to understand the public health impacts. Structural biology has been at the center of these efforts, and so it is advantageous to take an opportunity to reflect on the status of structural science vis-a-vis its role in the fight against COVID-19, to register the unprecedented response and to contemplate the role of structural biology in addressing future outbreak threats. As the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaration that COVID-19 is a pandemic has just passed, over 1000 structures of SARS-CoV-2 biomolecules have been deposited in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (PDB). It is rare to obtain a snapshot of such intense effort in the structural biology arena and is of special interest as the 50th anniversary of the PDB is celebrated in 2021. It is additionally timely as it overlaps with a period that has been termed the 'resolution revolution' in cryoelectron microscopy (CryoEM). CryoEM has recently become capable of producing biomolecular structures at similar resolutions to those traditionally associated with macromolecular X-ray crystallo-graphy. Examining SARS-CoV-2 protein structures that have been deposited in the PDB since the virus was first identified allows a unique window into the power of structural biology and a snapshot of the advantages of the different techniques available, as well as insight into the complementarity of the structural methods.","Lynch, M.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits and feasibility of a double triage and telemedicine protocol in improving infection control in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: In this retrospective study, we recruited patients aged &#8805;20 years referred to the ED of the National Taiwan University Hospital between March 1 and April 30, 2020. A double triage and telemedicine protocol was developed to triage suggested COVID-19 cases and minimize health workers' exposure to this disease. We categorized patients attending video interviews into a telemedicine group and patients experiencing face-to-face interviews into a conventional group. A questionnaire was used to assess how patients perceived the quality of the interviews and their communication with physicians as well as perceptions of stress, discrimination, and privacy. Each question was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale. Physicians' total exposure time and total evaluation time were treated as primary outcomes, and the mean scores of the questions were treated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The final sample included 198 patients, including 93 cases (47.0%) in the telemedicine group and 105 cases (53.0%) in the conventional group. The total exposure time in the telemedicine group was significantly shorter than that in the conventional group (4.7 minutes vs 8.9 minutes, P<.001), whereas the total evaluation time in the telemedicine group was significantly longer than that in the conventional group (12.2 minutes vs 8.9 minutes, P<.001). After controlling for potential confounders, the total exposure time in the telemedicine group was 4.6 minutes shorter than that in the conventional group (95% CI -5.7 to -3.5, P<.001), whereas the total evaluation time in the telemedicine group was 2.8 minutes longer than that in the conventional group (95% CI -1.6 to -4.0, P<.001). The mean scores of the patient questionnaire were high in both groups (4.5/5 to 4.7/5 points).

282048,Considerations for Assessment and Deployment of Rapid Antigen Tests for Diagnosis of COVID-19,2021,"Background Intra-operative consultation by frozen section is a procedure which plays a major role in the surgical management of patients with neoplastic and non neoplastic disease. Therefore it is critical to determine efficiency of frozen section performance periodically. Objective To evaluate the accuracy of frozen section tests at different anatomical sites by comparing the frozen section diagnosis with the histological diagnosis. Method We conducted a retrospective study in Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital, Dhulikhel, and compared the results of 47 cases of frozen section with their final permanent section diagnosis during a period of January 2017 to December 2018. Result A total of 47 cases were studied on frozen section while no case was deferred for permanent paraffin section. The indication of frozen section was for presence/ typing of neoplasm in 38 cases (80.75%), clearance of margin in eight cases (17%) and diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease in one case (2.1%). The overall accuracy of frozen section was 91.4% (43 cases) with 8.5% (four cases) discordant with the diagnosis, reported as false negative. None of the cases were reported as false positive. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of frozen section in comparison with permanent section (as gold standard) were 85.18%, 100%, 100% and 83.33% respectively. Conclusion The accuracy of frozen section diagnosis at our institute was 91.4% which can be interpreted as comparable with most national and international studies. The overall error rate is 8.5% which is higher than previously published studies. Experience and training of the pathologist reduce the error rate.","Dhakal, B; Makaju, R",Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),,725

METHODS: This was an Internet-based, cross-sectional study that collected information about socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, adherence to the Mediterranean diet and other dietary details, physical activity levels, and smoking habits using a self-administered questionnaire. The survey was conducted between April 6 and June 20, 2020, 1 to 2.5 mo after the initiation of the social confinement measures. RESULTS: There were 1485 Cypriot adults who participated in the study. The median Mediterranean diet score was 21 (q1 = 19, q3 = 24) with men, married individuals, residents of rural regions, and physically active participants being more adherent to the Mediterranean diet compared with women; unmarried, divorced, or widowed; residents of urban regions; and physically inactive participants, respectively (P < 0.05). Multinomial logistic regression showed that being &#8805;45 y of age and physically active was positively associated with the Mediterranean diet score, whereas being unmarried, divorced, or widowed and a current smoker was negatively associated with the Mediterranean diet score (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet during the confinement imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic among the Cypriot adult population was associated with male sex, age >45 y, being married, being physically active, and being resident of rural regions.

Similarly, research funding to address the pandemic was appropriately fast-tracked and knowledge promptly disseminated. This swift and purposeful research response is encouraging and reflects thorough and meticulous training of the academic workforce; in particular the clinician scientist. Clinician scientists have formal clinical and research qualifications (primarily PhD), and are at the forefront of translating knowledge into health care. Yet in reality, advances in medical research are not rapid. Scientific discovery results from the long-term accumulation of knowledge. The drivers of this knowledge are often PhD students who provide new lines of clinical inquiry coupled with the advanced training of early- and mid-career researchers who sustain discovery through a clinician scientist workforce. A crucial point during these COVID-19 times is that this initial investment in training must be nurtured and maintained. Without this investment, the loss of a future generation of potential discoveries and a vibrant scientific workforce to safeguard us from future global health threats is at risk. This risk includes the modest gains achieved by increasing female and minority representation in STEM and the clinician scientist workforce. COVID-19 has presented serious concerns to Australia's health and economy. This perspective is central to these concerns and urges investment in the continuity of training and maintaining a sustainable clinician scientist workforce sufficient to address current and future pandemics, alongside continuing discoveries to improve the health of Australians.","Eley, Diann S; O039,; Leary, Shaun P; Young, Adrienne; Buttrum, Peter",Aust Health Rev,,725

Contagion-risk averse agents respond behaviorally to the diffusion of the infections by limiting their social interactions. Firms also respond by allowing employees to work remotely, depending on their productivity. The spatial structure induces local herd immunities along socio-demographic dimensions, which significantly affect the dynamics of infections. We study several non-pharmaceutical interventions; e.g., i) lockdown rules, which set thresholds on the spread of the infection for the closing and reopening of economic activities; and ii) selective lockdowns, which restrict social interactions by location (in the network) and by the demographic characteristics of the agents.

DESIGN: A repeated-measures design was used to evaluate the auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded in background noise with transparent and opaque face masks, and without a mask (N=154). In a smaller follow-up study (N=29), the same files were presented via auditory-only presentation to determine if differences observed in the transparent and opaque mask conditions were attributable to additional visual cues or to acoustic differences between the recordings of the two mask types. Listeners completed the 40-minute online session on a computer, laptop, or tablet in a quiet room via their personal listening devices (earbuds or hearing assistive device). The adult volunteers who used English as their first language were recruited through social media links and email and categorized into three groups: normal hearing and confirmed or suspected hearing loss either with or without the use of assistive listening devices. RESULTS: Auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded with the transparent mask was significantly better (M=68.9%) than for sentences recorded with the opaque mask (M=58.9%) for all participants. There was a trend for those who used hearing assistive technology to score lower than the other two groups who had similar performance across all conditions regardless of mask type. Subjective ratings of confidence and concentration followed the expected pattern based on objective scores. Results of the auditory-only presentation of the sentences to listeners with normal hearing suggested that the transparent-mask benefits were not attributable to an acoustic advantage but rather to the addition of the visual cues of the talker's face available through the transparent mask. In fact, performance in the auditory-only presentation was significantly lower with the transparent mask (M=40.7%) compared to the opaque mask (M=58.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of transparent masks can significantly facilitate speech recognition in noise even for persons with normal hearing and thus may reduce stressful communication challenges experienced in medical, employment, and educational settings during the global pandemic. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and facilitate communication, safety-approved transparent masks are strongly encouraged over opaque masks.","Thibodeau, Linda M; Thibodeau-Nielsen, Rachel B; Tran, Chi Mai Quynh; de Souza Jacob, Regina Tangerino",Ear hear,,725

The olfactory dysfunction linked to COVID-19 is not associated with rhinorrhea but there is no objective evaluation. AIMS: To evaluate nasal mucosal secretion objectively in COVID-19 patients with anosmia. METHODS: Fifty-two COVID-19 patients with anosmia and 51 healthy individuals included. Anosmia was diagnosed by subjective questionnaires. Nasal Schirmer test was done to the left and the right nasal cavity separately. RESULTS: All patients had anosmia and 82.6% had gustatory dysfunction. In group 1, the mean of the nasal Schirmer test results in the right cavity was 12.4 mm, 12.01 mm in the left nasal cavity. The median wetting distance (right plus left divided by two) was calculated 12.21 mm. In group 2, the mean of the nasal Schirmer test results in the right cavity was 12.1 mm, 11.8 mm in the left nasal cavity. The median wetting distance (right plus left divided by two) was calculated11.97 mm. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of nasal schirmer. CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction and gustatory dysfunction are the two of the unknown for this disease. We evaluated the nasal mucosa secretions in COVID-19 patients with anosmia objectively to evaluate if there is inflammation in the nasal mucosa. We found no difference between healthy individuals. According to our study, SARS-CoV-2 causes anosmia without causing nasal mucosal inflammation. Invasion of the olfactory bulb and central nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to anosmia in COVID-19, which may cause olfactory dysfunction.","Islamoglu, Yuce; Gemcioglu, Emin; Ates, Ihsan",Ir. j. med. sci,,725

495879,[Research progress in lung parenchyma segmentation based on computed tomography],2021,"To reduce the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, many pulmonary function testing (PFT) laboratories have been closed or have significantly reduced their testing capacity. Because these mitigation strategies may be necessary for the next 6 to 18 months to prevent recurrent peaks in disease prevalence, fewer objective measurements of lung function will alter the diagnosis and care of patients with chronic respiratory diseases. PFT, which includes spirometry, lung volume, and diffusion capacity measurement, is essential to the diagnosis and management of patients with asthma, COPD, and other chronic lung conditions. Both traditional and innovative alternatives to conventional testing must now be explored. These may include peak expiratory flow devices, electronic portable spirometers, portable exhaled nitric oxide measurement, airwave oscillometry devices, and novel digital health tools such as smartphone microphone spirometers and mobile health technologies along with integration of machine learning approaches. The adoption of some novel approaches may not merely replace but could improve existing management strategies and alter common diagnostic paradigms. With these options comes important technical, privacy, ethical, financial, and medicolegal barriers that must be addressed. However, the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic also presents a unique opportunity to augment conventional testing by including innovative and emerging approaches to measuring lung function remotely in patients with respiratory disease. The benefits of such an approach have the potential to enhance respiratory care and empower patient self-management well beyond the current global pandemic.","Kouri, Andrew; Gupta, Samir; Yadollahi, Azadeh; Ryan, Clodagh M; Gershon, Andrea S; To, Teresa; Tarlo, Susan M; Goldstein, Roger S; Chapman, Kenneth R; Chow, Chung-Wai",Chest,,725

It states that the origins of veterinary medicine are rooted in efforts to maintain the health of animals for food and fiber production and animals essential for work-related activities. The early phase of virology was one of skepticism and uncertainty because of the limited tools available to define the filterable agents. Even with filtration, there were differences among the agents as to their size as defined by filter retention. The bacterial viruses assisted in defining some of the basic principles of genetics through the study of mutations and the inheritance of phenotypic changes. Veterinary virology began as a discipline focusing on the effects of viral infections on animals of agricultural significance. Control of these infections relied on advances in understanding the disease process, in the characterization of the viruses, in the development of the fields of immunology and diagnostic technologies, and in the establishment of regulations controlling the movement of production animals. Initial experiences confirmed that eradication of some infectious diseases from defined areas could be achieved with a test and slaughter program, even in the absence of an effective vaccine. This chapter also explores characteristics of viruses, viral morphology, and taxonomy.",,Fenner's Veterinary Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123751584000018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123751584000018,725

AIM: This paper aims to overview the recent applications of machine learning techniques contributing to prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: A progressive investigation of the recent publications up to November 2020, related to AI approaches towards managing the challenges of COVID-19 infection was made. RESULTS: For patient diagnosis and screening, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are broadly applied for classification purposes. Moreover, Deep Neural Network (DNN) and homology modeling are the most used SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing models. CONCLUSION: While the fields of diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection by medical image processing and its dissemination pattern through machine learning have been sufficiently studied, some areas such as treatment outcome in patients and drug development need to be further investigated using AI approaches.","Mottaqi, Mohammad Sadeq; Mohammadipanah, Fatemeh; Sajedi, Hedieh",Inform Med Unlocked,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914821000162; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914821000162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33869730/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2021.100526,725
