1509,Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) in three HIV-positive patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome,2014-05-21,"BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving bridging procedure in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Official indications for ECMO are unclear for immunocompromised and HIV-positive patients affected by severe hypoxemia. Uncertainties are related to prognosis and efficacy of treatment of the underlying disease. However, the care of patients with HIV infection has advanced since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with increased life expectancy and decreased mortality. CASE PRESENTATION: Three HIV-infected patients with AIDS were admitted to ICU and were treated with ECMO: a 21 years old Caucasian female with congenital HIV infection presented with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP); a 38 years old Caucasian female with HIV-HCV infection and L. pneumophila pneumonia; a 24 years old Caucasian male with fever, cough weight loss and PJP pneumonia. Two patients were alive, with a good immunovirological profile and they went back to their previous quality of life. The last patient died with septic shock after three months of ICU stay. CONCLUSION: ECMO was effective in three HIV-positive patients with an otherwise fatal respiratory failure. All patients had severe immunosuppression and/or limited antiretroviral options. A multidisciplinary critical team is needed to individualize the use of ECMO in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV infection.","De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Fanelli, Vito; Corcione, Silvia; Urbino, Rosario; Bonetto, Chiara; Ricci, Davide; Rinaldi, Mauro; Di Perri, Giovanni; Bonora, Stefano; Ranieri, Marco V",BMC Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4057620/,304
1672,Pathophysiology and biomarkers of acute respiratory distress syndrome,2014-05-07,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is defined as an acute-onset, progressive, hypoxic condition with radiographic bilateral lung infiltration, which develops after several diseases or injuries, and is not derived from hydrostatic pulmonary edema. One specific pathological finding of ARDS is diffuse alveolar damage. In 2012, in an effort to increase diagnostic specificity, a revised definition of ARDS was published in JAMA. However, no new parameters or biomarkers were adopted by the revised definition. Discriminating between ARDS and other similar diseases is critically important; however, only a few biomarkers are currently available for diagnostic purposes. Furthermore, predicting the severity, response to therapy, or outcome of the illness is also important for developing treatment strategies for each patient. However, the PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio is currently the sole clinical parameter used for this purpose. In parallel with progress in understanding the pathophysiology of ARDS, various humoral factors induced by inflammation and molecules derived from activated cells or injured tissues have been shown as potential biomarkers that may be applied in clinical practice. In this review, the current understanding of the basic pathophysiology of ARDS and associated candidate biomarkers will be discussed.","Fujishima, Seitaro",J Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4267590/,304
1859,Impact of statin therapy on mortality in patients with sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) depends on ARDS severity: a prospective observational cohort study,2015-06-01,"BACKGROUND: Previous investigations have presumed a potential therapeutic effect of statin therapy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Statins are expected to attenuate inflammation in the lungs of patients with ARDS due to their anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical investigations of the role of statin therapy have revealed contradictory results. This study aimed to investigate whether pretreatment and continuous therapy with statins in patients with sepsis-associated ARDS are associated with 28-day survival according to disease severity (mild, moderate, or severe). METHODS: Patients with sepsis-associated ARDS from the surgical intensive care were enrolled in this prospective observational investigation. ARDS was classified into three groups (mild, moderate, and severe); 28-day mortality was recorded as the primary outcome variable and organ failure was recorded as secondary outcome variable. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and the requirements for organ support were evaluated throughout the observational period to assess organ failure. RESULTS: 404 patients with sepsis-associated ARDS were enrolled in this investigation. The distribution of the ARDS subgroups was 13 %, 59 %, and 28 % for mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. Statin therapy improved 28-day survival exclusively in the patients with severe ARDS compared with patients without statin therapy (88.5 % and 62.5 %, respectively; P = 0.0193). To exclude the effects of several confounders, we performed multivariate Cox regression analysis, which showed that statin therapy remained a significant covariate for mortality (hazard ratio, 5.46; 95 % CI, 1.38–21.70; P = 0.0156). Moreover, after carrying a propensity score-matching in the severe ARDS cohort, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed the improved 28-day survival among patients with statin therapy (P = 0.0205). Patients with severe ARDS who received statin therapy had significantly more vasopressor-free days compared with those without statin therapy (13 ± 7 and 9 ± 7, respectively; P = 0.0034), and they also required less extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy and had more ECMO-free days (18 ± 9 and 15 ± 9, respectively; P = 0.0873). CONCLUSIONS: This investigation suggests a beneficial effect of continuous statin therapy in patients with severe sepsis-associated ARDS and a history of prior statin therapy. Further study is warranted to elucidate this potential effect.

2822,Effect of HA330 resin-directed hemoadsorption on a porcine acute respiratory distress syndrome model,2017-08-14,"BACKGROUND: Blood purification is an emerging approach to dampening the cytokine storm. This study aims to assess the efficacy of HA330 resin-directed hemoadsorption (HA) on endotoxin-induced porcine acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) model. METHODS: Twenty-four Chinese domestic pigs were allocated into saline group receiving intravenous infusion of saline (N = 6) and endotoxin group receiving intravenous infusion of LPS (N = 18). When ALI model was initially diagnosed, six pigs in the LPS and saline group were killed for BALF and histopathological analysis. The remaining 12 pigs in LPS group received 3-h HA (N = 6) or HA-sham (N = 6) treatment, respectively. Following another 5-h observation, animals were killed. Variables on hemodynamics, blood gases and lung mechanics were recorded at a series of time points. Differentially expressed cytokines and proteins were determined by ELISA and proteomics. RESULTS: HA treatment significantly improved injured oxygenation induced by LPS. HA also partially improved the barrier permeability and reduced lung edema and inflammation/injury induced by LPS infusion. Proteomic analysis showed the differentially expressed proteins between HA- and HA-sham-treated groups mostly belonged to the categories of acute inflammation/immune response, and proteolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Hemoadsorption improved ARDS possibly by blunting the cytokine storm and by restoring homeostasis of the disordered proteome milieu in the exudative phase.

3002,Application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by avian influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia: national data from the Chinese multicentre collaboration,2018-01-08,"BACKGROUND: Evidence concerning the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with influenza A (H7N9) has been was limited to case reports. Our study is aimed to investigate the current application, efficacy and safety of ECMO in for severe H7N9 pneumonia-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the Chinese population. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted at 20 hospitals that admitted patients with avian influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia patients’ admission from 9 provinces in China between October 1, 2016, and March 1, 2017. Data from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China, including general conditions, outcomes and ECMO management, were analysed. Then, successfully weaned and unsuccessfully weaned groups were compared. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients, aged 57 ± 1 years, were analysed; 65.7% of patients were male with 63% mortality. All patients underwent invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), and rescue ventilation strategies were implemented for 23 cases (65.7%) with an average IPPV duration of 5 ± 1 d, PaO(2)/FiO(2) of 78 ± 23 mmHg, tidal volume (VT) of 439 ± 61 ml and plateau pressure (P(plat)) of 29 ± 8 cmH(2)O pre-ECMO. After 48 h on ECMO, PaO(2) improved from 56 ± 21 mmHg to 90 ± 24 mmHg and PaCO(2) declined from 52 ± 24 mmHg to 38 ± 24 mmHg. Haemorrhage, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma occurred in 45.7%, 60% and 8.6% of patients, respectively. Compared with successfully weaned patients (n = 14), the 21 unsuccessfully weaned patients had a longer duration of IPPV pre-ECMO (6 ± 4 d vs. 2 ± 1 d, P < 0.01) as well as a higher P(plat) (25 ± 5 cmH(2)O vs. 21 ± 3 cmH(2)O, P < 0.05) and VT (343 ± 96 ml vs. 246 ± 93 ml, P < 0.05) after 48 h on ECMO support. Furthermore, the unsuccessfully weaned group had a higher mortality (100% vs. 7.1%, P < 0.01) with more haemorrhage (77.3% vs. 28.6%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: ECMO is effective at improving oxygenation and ventilation of patients with avian influenza A (H7N9) induced severe ARDS. Early initiation of ECMO with appropriate IPPV settings and anticoagulation strategies are necessary to reduce complications.","Huang, Linna; Zhang, Wei; Yang, Yi; Wu, Wenjuan; Lu, Weihua; Xue, Han; Zhao, Hongsheng; Wu, Yunfu; Shang, Jia; Cai, Lihua; Liu, Long; Liu, Donglin; Wang, Yeming; Cao, Bin; Zhan, Qingyuan; Wang, Chen",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5759204/,304
3276,A vascular endothelial growth factor receptor gene variant is associated with susceptibility to acute respiratory distress syndrome,2018-07-09,"BACKGROUND: The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the main causes of mortality in adults admitted to intensive care units. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of genetic variants involved in the susceptibility and outcomes of this syndrome. We aimed to identify novel genes implicated in sepsis-induced ARDS susceptibility. METHODS: We first performed a prioritization of candidate genes by integrating our own genomic data from a transcriptomic study in an animal model of ARDS and from the only published genome-wide association study of ARDS study in humans. Then, we selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from prioritized genes to conduct a case-control discovery association study in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS (n = 225) and population-based controls (n = 899). Finally, we validated our findings in an independent sample of 661 sepsis-induced ARDS cases and 234 at-risk controls. RESULTS: Three candidate genes were prioritized: dynein cytoplasmic-2 heavy chain-1, fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1), and integrin alpha-1. Of those, a SNP from FLT1 gene (rs9513106) was associated with ARDS in the discovery study, with an odds ratio (OR) for the C allele of 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58–0.98 (p = 0.037). This result was replicated in an independent study (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.62–0.98, p = 0.039), showing consistent direction of effects in a meta-analysis (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.65–0.92, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: We identified FLT1 as a novel ARDS susceptibility gene and demonstrated that integration of genomic data can be a valid procedure to identify novel susceptibility genes. These results contribute to previous firm associations and functional evidences implicating FLT1 gene in other complex traits that are mechanistically linked, through the key role of endothelium, to the pathophysiology of ARDS.

3393,Predictors of survival in patients with influenza pneumonia-related severe acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with prone positioning,2018-09-24,"BACKGROUND: Patients with influenza complicated with pneumonia are at high risk of rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Prone positioning with longer duration and lung-protective strategies might reduce the mortality level in ARDS. The aim of this study is to investigate the survival predictors of prone positioning in patients with ARDS caused by influenza pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted by eight tertiary referral centers in Taiwan. From January 1 to March 31 in 2016, all of the patients in intensive care units with virology-proven influenza pneumonia were collected, while all of those patients with ARDS and receiving prone positioning were enrolled. Demographic data, laboratory examinations, management records, ventilator settings and clinical outcomes were collected for analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 336 patients with severe influenza pneumonia were screened and 263 patients met the diagnosis of ARDS. Totally, 65 patients receiving prone positioning were included for analysis. The 60-day survivors had lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, pneumonia severity index (PSI), creatinine level and lower rate of receiving renal replacement therapy than non-survivors (22.4 ± 8.5 vs. 29.2 ± 7.4, p = 0.003; 106.6 ± 40.9 vs. 135.3 ± 48.6, p = 0.019; 1.2 ± 0.9 mg/dL vs. 3.1 ± 3.6 mg/dL, p = 0.040; and 4% vs. 42%, p < 0.005). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified PSI (hazard ratio 1.020, 95% confidence interval 1.009–1.032; p < 0.001), renal replacement therapy (hazard ratio 6.248, 95% confidence interval 2.245–17.389; p < 0.001), and increase in dynamic driving pressure (hazard ratio 1.372, 95% confidence interval 1.095–1.718; p = 0.006) which were independent predictors associated with 60-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, in evaluating the effect of prone positioning in patients with influenza pneumonia-related ARDS, pneumonia severity index, renal replacement therapy and increase in dynamic driving pressure were associated with 60-day mortality in patients with influenza pneumonia-related ARDS receiving prone positioning.

3715,Sequelae of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Interest of Rehabilitation,2019-03-06,"CASE PRESENTATION: This clinical case presents the history of a woman hospitalized for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A 62-year-old woman, with regular physical activity and no history of respiratory disease or smoking, was hospitalized for moderate ARDS with bilateral pneumonitis. Fourteen days later, she was discharged from the intensive care unit and received respiratory physical therapy. One month later, she experienced exertional dyspnea. A regression of alveolar condensation with persistent sequelae at the pulmonary bases was noted. Three months later, the patient continued daily physical activity with satisfactory tolerance. A reduction in alveolar-capillary transfer, inappropriate hyperventilation upon exercise, and impairment of gas exchanges at maximal effort, suggestive of pulmonary shunt, were demonstrated. At the 6-month evaluation, the patient displayed exertional dyspnea with residual bilateral basal consolidations. Six months later, the dyspnea had ceased. The persistence of bilateral basal interstitial syndrome associated with bronchial dilatation and pleural-based consolidations was noted, as well as a stable impaired alveolar-capillary diffusing capacity. DISCUSSION: Upon discharge from intensive care, pulmonary follow-up should be proposed to ARDS survivors. Moreover, pulmonary function testing at rest and exercise is advised as soon as possible to evaluate the respiratory sequelae. This will help to limit the severity of complications through adapted exercise rehabilitation and then regular physical activity.","Godeau, Elise; Debeaumont, David; Artaud-Macari, Elise; Lagache, Laurie; Bouar, Gurvan Le; Coquart, Jérémy",Case Rep Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6431389/,304
4038,A multicenter RCT of noninvasive ventilation in pneumonia-induced early mild acute respiratory distress syndrome,2019-09-04,"RATIONALE: Our pilot study suggested that noninvasive ventilation (NIV) reduced the need for intubation compared with conventional administration of oxygen on patients with “early” stage of mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, PaO(2)/FIO(2) between 200 and 300). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether early NIV can reduce the need for invasive ventilation in patients with pneumonia-induced early mild ARDS. METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of NIV compared with conventional administration of oxygen through a Venturi mask. Primary outcome included the numbers of patients who met the intubation criteria. RESULTS: Two hundred subjects were randomized to NIV (n = 102) or control (n = 98) groups from 21 centers. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. In the NIV group, PaO(2)/FIO(2) became significantly higher than in the control group at 2 h after randomization and remained stable for the first 72 h. NIV did not decrease the proportion of patients requiring intubation than in the control group (11/102 vs. 9/98, 10.8% vs. 9.2%, p = 0.706). The ICU mortality was similar in the two groups (7/102 vs. 7/98, 4.9% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.721). Multivariate analysis showed minute ventilation greater than 11 L/min at 48 h was the independent risk factor for NIV failure (OR, 1.176 [95% CI, 1.005–1.379], p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with NIV did not reduce the need for intubation among patients with pneumonia-induced early mild ARDS, despite the improved PaO(2)/FIO(2) observed with NIV compared with standard oxygen therapy. High minute ventilation may predict NIV failure. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01581229.

4430,Prone positioning monitored by electrical impedance tomography in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome on veno-venous ECMO,2020-02-03,"BACKGROUND: Prone positioning (PP) during veno-venous ECMO is feasible, but its physiological effects have never been thoroughly evaluated. Our objectives were to describe, through electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the impact of PP on global and regional ventilation, and optimal PEEP level. METHODS: A monocentric study conducted on ECMO-supported severe ARDS patients, ventilated in pressure-controlled mode, with 14-cmH(2)O driving pressure and EIT-based “optimal PEEP”. Before, during and after a 16-h PP session, EIT-based distribution and variation of tidal impedance, VT(dorsal)/VT(global) ratio, end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) and static compliance were collected. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients who increased their static compliance by ≥ 3 mL/cmH(2)O after 16 h of PP. RESULTS: For all patients (n = 21), tidal volume and EELI were redistributed from ventral to dorsal regions during PP. EIT-based optimal PEEP was significantly lower in PP than in supine position. Median (IQR) optimal PEEP decreased from 14 (12–16) to 10 (8–14) cmH(2)O. Thirteen (62%) patients increased their static compliance by ≥ 3 mL/cmH(2)O after PP on ECMO. This subgroup had higher body mass index, more frequent viral pneumonia, shorter ECMO duration, and lower baseline VT(dorsal)/VT(global) ratio than patients with compliance ≤ 3 mL/cmH(2)O (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Although baseline tidal volume distribution on EIT may predict static compliance improvement after PP on ECMO, our results support physiological benefits of PP in all ECMO patients, by modifying lung mechanics and potentially reducing VILI. Further studies, including a randomized–controlled trial, are now warranted to confirm potential PP benefits during ECMO.","Franchineau, Guillaume; Bréchot, Nicolas; Hekimian, Guillaume; Lebreton, Guillaume; Bourcier, Simon; Demondion, Pierre; Le Guennec, Loïc; Nieszkowska, Ania; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Combes, Alain; Schmidt, Matthieu",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6997307/,304
4607,Transpulmonary thermodilution detects rapid and reversible increases in lung water induced by positive end-expiratory pressure in acute respiratory distress syndrome,2020-03-02,"BACKGROUND: The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation is debatable. Many articles in this field enrolled trials not based on acute kidney injury. The safety of the watchful waiting strategy has not been fully discussed, and late RRT initiation criteria vary across studies. The effect of early RRT initiation in the AKI population with high plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) has not been examined yet. METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were systemically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Trials not conducted in the AKI population were excluded. Data of study characteristics, primary outcome (all-cause mortality), and related secondary outcomes [mechanical ventilation (MV) days, length of hospital stay, RRT days, and length of ICU stay] were extracted. The outcomes were compared between early and late RRT groups by estimating the pooled odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes and the weighted mean difference for continuous outcomes. Prospective trials were also examined and analyzed using the same method. RESULTS: Nine RCTs with 1938 patients were included. Early RRT did not provide a survival benefit (pooled OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–1.27). However, the early RRT group had significantly fewer MV days (pooled mean difference, − 3.98 days; 95% CI − 7.81 to − 0.15 days). Subgroup analysis showed that RCTs enrolling the surgical population (P = .001) and the AKI population with high plasma NGAL (P = .031) had favorable outcomes regarding RRT days in the early initiation group. Moreover, 6 of 9 RCTs were selected for examining the safety of the watchful waiting strategy, and no significant differences were found in primary and secondary outcomes between the early and late RRT groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, early RRT initiation did not provide a survival benefit, but a possible benefit of fewer MV days was detected. Early RRT might also provide the benefit of shorter MV or RRT support in the surgical population and in AKI patients with high plasma NGAL. Depending on the conventional indication for RRT initiation, the watchful waiting strategy is safe on the basis of all primary and secondary outcomes.","Chen, Jia-Jin; Lee, Cheng-Chia; Kuo, George; Fan, Pei-Chun; Lin, Chan-Yu; Chang, Su-Wei; Tian, Ya-Chung; Chen, Yung-Chang; Chang, Chih-Hsiang",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054512/,304
9584,Serial change of neutrophil extracellular traps in tracheal aspirate of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: report of three cases,2020-04-10,"Inflammatory demyelinating diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders, which occur against the background of an acute or chronic inflammatory process. The pathologic hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the presence of focal demyelinated lesions with partial axonal preservation and reactive astrogliosis. Demyelinated plaques are present in the white as well as gray matter, such as the cerebral or cerebellar cortex and brainstem nuclei. Activity of the disease process is reflected by the presence of lesions with ongoing myelin destruction. Axonal and neuronal destruction in the lesions is a major substrate for permanent neurologic deficit in MS patients. The MS pathology is qualitatively similar in different disease stages, such as relapsing remitting MS or secondary or primary progressive MS, but the prevalence of different lesion types differs quantitatively. Acute MS and Balo's type of concentric sclerosis appear to be variants of classic MS. In contrast, neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are inflammatory diseases with primary injury of astrocytes, mediated by aquaporin-4 antibodies. Finally, we discuss the histopathology of other inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated demyelination. Knowledge of the heterogenous immunopathology in demyelinating diseases is important, to understand the clinical presentation and disease course and to find the optimal treatment for an individual patient.","Höftberger, Romana; Lassmann, Hans",Handb Clin Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149979/,304

These fibers have essentially different elastic properties, form a continuous network along the lungs, and are responsible for passive expiration. In the last decade, many studies analyzed the relationship between tissue composition, microstructure, and macrophysiology, showing that the lung physiological behavior reflects both the mechanical properties of tissue individual components and its complex structural organization. Different lung pathologies such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, fibrosis, inflammation, and emphysema can affect the extracellular matrix.

A population-based cohort study,2019-08-10,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, but there are no clinically proven treatments that specifically target neuronal loss and secondary injury development following TBI. In this study, we evaluate the effect of xenon treatment on functional outcome, lesion volume, neuronal loss and neuroinflammation after severe TBI in rats. METHODS: Young adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) brain trauma or sham surgery followed by treatment with either 50% xenon:25% oxygen balance nitrogen, or control gas 75% nitrogen:25% oxygen. Locomotor function was assessed using Catwalk-XT automated gait analysis at baseline and 24 h after injury. Histological outcomes were assessed following perfusion fixation at 15 min or 24 h after injury or sham procedure. RESULTS: Xenon treatment reduced lesion volume, reduced early locomotor deficits, and attenuated neuronal loss in clinically relevant cortical and subcortical areas. Xenon treatment resulted in significant increases in Iba1-positive microglia and GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes that was associated with neuronal preservation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that xenon improves functional outcome and reduces neuronal loss after brain trauma in rats. Neuronal preservation was associated with a xenon-induced enhancement of microglial cell numbers and astrocyte activation, consistent with a role for early beneficial neuroinflammation in xenon’s neuroprotective effect. These findings suggest that xenon may be a first-line clinical treatment for brain trauma.

We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of artificial or bioartificial liver support systems on survival in patients with ACLF. Ranking was performed by calculating the surface under cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve values. The RoB2 tool and a modified GRADE approach were used for the assessment of the risk of bias and quality of evidence (QE). RESULTS: In the quantitative synthesis 16 trials were included, using MARS®, Prometheus®, ELAD®, plasma exchange (PE) and BioLogic-DT®. Overall (OS) and transplant-free (TFS) survival were assessed at 1 and 3 months. PE significantly improved 3-month OS compared to SMT (RR 0.74, CrI: 0.6–0.94) and ranked first on the cumulative ranking curves for both OS outcomes (SUCRA: 86% at 3 months; 77% at 1 month) and 3-month TFS (SUCRA: 87%) and second after ELAD for 1-month TFS (SUCRA: 76%). Other comparisons did not reach statistical significance. QE was moderate for PE concerning 1-month OS and both TFS outcomes. Other results were of very low certainty. CONCLUSION: PE seems to be the best currently available liver support therapy in ACLF regarding 3-month OS. Based on the low QE, randomized trials are needed to confirm our findings for already existing options and to introduce new devices.","Ocskay, Klementina; Kanjo, Anna; Gede, Noémi; Szakács, Zsolt; Pár, Gabriella; Erőss, Bálint; Stange, Jan; Mitzner, Steffen; Hegyi, Péter; Molnár, Zsolt",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7813174/,304
16816,Abnormal liver phosphatidylcholine synthesis revealed in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome,2018-05-04,"INTRODUCTION: Venous leg ulceration (VLU), the most common type of chronic ulcer, can be difficult to heal and is a major cause of morbidity and reduced quality of life. Although compression bandaging is the principal treatment, it is time-consuming and bandage application requires specific training. There is evidence that intervention on superficial venous incompetence can help ulcer healing and recurrence, but this is not accessible to all patients. Hence, new treatments are required to address these chronic wounds. One possible adjuvant treatment for VLU is human decellularised dermis (DCD), a type of skin graft derived from skin from deceased tissue donors. Although DCD has the potential to promote ulcer healing, there is a paucity of data for its use in patients with VLU. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, parallel group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial. One hundred and ninety-six patients with VLU will be randomly assigned to receive either the DCD allograft in addition to standard care or standard care alone. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with a healed index ulcer at 12 weeks post-randomisation in each treatment arm. Secondary outcomes include the time to index ulcer healing and the proportion of participants with a healed index ulcer at 12 months. Changes in quality of life scores and cost-effectiveness will also be assessed. All analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. A mixed-effects, logistic regression on the outcome of the proportion of those with the index ulcer healed at 12 weeks will be performed. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using various statistical models appropriate to the distribution and nature of these outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was granted by the Bloomsbury Research Ethics Committee (19/LO/1271). Findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at national and international conferences.

19613,High-frequency oscillatory ventilation in paediatric patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome—early rescue use,2005-01-15,"Accurate determination of the evolutionary relationships between genes is a foundational challenge in biology. Homology—evolutionary relatedness—is in many cases readily determined based on sequence similarity analysis. By contrast, whether or not two genes directly descended from a common ancestor by a speciation event (orthologs) or duplication event (paralogs) is more challenging, yet provides critical information on the history of a gene. Since 2009, this task has been the focus of the Quest for Orthologs (QFO) Consortium. The sixth QFO meeting took place in Okazaki, Japan in conjunction with the 67th National Institute for Basic Biology conference. Here, we report recent advances, applications, and oncoming challenges that were discussed during the conference. Steady progress has been made toward standardization and scalability of new and existing tools. A feature of the conference was the presentation of a panel of accessible tools for phylogenetic profiling and several developments to bring orthology beyond the gene unit—from domains to networks. This meeting brought into light several challenges to come: leveraging orthology computations to get the most of the incoming avalanche of genomic data, integrating orthology from domain to biological network levels, building better gene models, and adapting orthology approaches to the broad evolutionary and genomic diversity recognized in different forms of life and viruses.","Linard, Benjamin; Ebersberger, Ingo; McGlynn, Shawn E; Glover, Natasha; Mochizuki, Tomohiro; Patricio, Mateus; Lecompte, Odile; Nevers, Yannis; Thomas, Paul D; Gabaldón, Toni; Sonnhammer, Erik; Dessimoz, Christophe; Uchiyama, Ikuo",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8321534/,304
20017,Association of different positive end-expiratory pressure selection strategies with all-cause mortality in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome,2021-08-12,"As electronic cigarette (E-cig) use, also known as “vaping”, has rapidly increased in popularity, data regarding potential pathologic effects are recently emerging. Recent associations between vaping and lung pathology have led to an increased need to scrutinize E-cigs for adverse health impacts. Our previous work (and others) has associated vaping with Ca(2+)-dependent cytotoxicity in cultured human airway epithelial cells. Herein, we develop a vaped e-liquid pulmonary exposure mouse model to evaluate vaping effects in vivo. Using this model, we demonstrate lung pathology through the use of preclinical measures, that is, the lung wet: dry ratio and lung histology/H&E staining. Further, we demonstrate that acute vaping increases macrophage chemotaxis, which was ascertained using flow cytometry-based techniques, and inflammatory cytokine production, via Luminex analysis, through a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism. This increase in macrophage activation appears to exacerbate pulmonary pathology resulting from microbial infection. Importantly, modulating Ca(2+) signaling may present a therapeutic direction for treatment against vaping-associated pulmonary inflammation.","Zhang, Rui; Jones, Myles M.; Parker, De’Jana; Dornsife, Ronna E.; Wymer, Nathan; Onyenwoke, Rob U.; Sivaraman, Vijay",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360547/,304

Our study aims to explore the Lebanese CPs’ willingness to administer influenza vaccine, and to identify factors associated with this willingness. METHODS: This is a web-based, cross-sectional study, conducted over 2 months, from the 1st of November to the end of December 2020. Self-reported data were collected electronically from Lebanese CPs through an anonymous, questionnaire using google form. The collected data were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to examine factors associated with the willingness of CPs to administer influenza vaccine. RESULTS: A total of 412 CPs participated in this survey of which 76.9% are willing to administer influenza vaccines. More than 90% of them had a good overall knowledge score and 88.8% of CPs showed a positive overall attitude score, particularly towards involvement of CPs in influenza vaccine provision. Their willingness to administer vaccine was positively associated with the younger age (aOR = 3.12 with 95% CI (1.597–4.040)), higher education level (aOR = 2.02 with 95% CI (1.093–3.741)), previous experience in immunization (aOR = 2.72 with 95% CI (1.320–5.627)) and urbanicity of pharmacy (aOR = 1.542 with 95% CI (1.219–4.627)). Extensive working hours (aOR = 2.34 with 95% CI (1.131–4.845)), working in pharmacies that are operating round-the-clock, showing positive attitude towards immunization (aOR = 3.01 with 95% CI (1.872–6.422)) and towards provision of influenza vaccines (aOR = 13.72 with 95% CI (13.721–38.507)) were also positively associated to this willingness. Conversely, patient privacy (aOR = 0.55 with 95% CI (0.079–0.983)), time and cost for professional development (aOR = 0.55 with 95% CI (0.172–0.918)), limited patient’s trust (aOR = 0.39 with 95% CI (0.203–0.784)), financial remuneration (aOR = 0.18 with 95% CI (0.088–0.377)), and requirement of formal certification in vaccine administration (aOR = 0.07 with 95% CI (0.020–0.279)) were negatively associated to this willingness. CONCLUSION: Addressing the unearthed concerns related to utilizing CPs as influenza immunizers through a concerted effort is a key to success in any future implementation of vaccination services in pharmacies.","Youssef, Dalal; Abou-Abbas, Linda; Hassan, Hamad",J Pharm Policy Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8450692/,304

In accordance with the UK Joint Royal Colleges’ advice the management of acute appendicitis (AA) changed with greater consideration for non-operative management (NOM) or open appendicectomy where operative management (OM) s sought. Our aim is to share our experience of the presentation, management and outcomes for patients presenting to our Trust with AA to guide care for future viral pandemics. METHODS: This single-centre retrospective cohort study included patients diagnosed with AA in March to July 2019 compared with March to July 2020. Medical records were used to evaluate demographics, inflammatory markers, imaging, severity, management, histology, length of stay (LOS), complications and 90-day outcomes. RESULTS: There were 149 and 125 patients in the 2019 and 2020 cohort, respectively. 14 patients (9.4%) had NOM in 2019 versus 31 patients (24.8%) in 2020 (p = 0.001). In the 2019 OM group 125 patients (92.6%) had laparoscopic appendicectomy versus 69 (73.4%) in 2020. 59 patients (39.6%) had a CT in 2019 versus 70 (56%) in 2020. The median LOS was 4 days (interquartile range (IQR) 3 to 6 days) in 2019 and 3 days (IQR 2 to 5 days) in 2020 (p = 0.03). Two patients in each year who received NOM had treatment failure (14.3% in 2019 and 6.5% in 2020). Three patients in 2019 who had OM had treatment failure (2.2%). Of 95 patients tested for COVID-19 all but one was negative. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic there was no observed increase in severity of AA, patients had a shorter LOS and were more likely to have imaging. NOM proportionally increased with no observed change in outcomes.","Pringle, H; Donigiewicz, U; Bennett, M; Fowler, G F; Walker, E; Ball, S; Narang, S; Bethune, R M; Pringle, Heather",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030173/,304

From the perspective of African–Americans and their abolitionist allies, the central problem with AI risk assessment does not involve ‘corrective’ stabilization of an inadvertently unstable system. On the contrary, that system’s de-facto—if sometimes camouflaged—purpose is enforcing the stability of historic patterns of racial oppression, constitutional formalities notwithstanding.

ChE activity in the exposure group was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The analysis of covariance result showed that ChE activity was lower in the (- -/- T) genotype in miR-30a rs111456995 (1.97 ± 0.47) than in the TT genotype (2.23 ± 0.59) of the exposure group (P = 0.004). Multivariate linear regression was performed to find influencing factors on ChE activity, and variables kept in the model included omethoate exposure (b = -1.094, P < 0.001), gender (b = -0.381, P < 0.001), miR-30a rs111456995 (- -/- T)(b = -0.248, P < 0.001), and drinking (b = 0.258, P =0.019).

Most of the research has focused on school-age children, ages 6 to 18 years. Yet, recent studies suggest that anxiety can emerge in young children, under 6 years, with ASD. This scoping review synthesized the literature on anxiety in young children with ASD. Three domains of anxiety research were reviewed: (a) prevalence/severity, phenomenology, and course; (b) correlates; and (c) treatment. Four online databases were searched from the start of the database until March 2020. Keywords pertaining to anxiety, autism, and young children were entered. The search identified 44 articles for inclusion. These studies varied with respect to sample source, informants, and measures to assess anxiety. The overall prevalence of anxiety ranged from 1.6 to 62%. Sixteen of 17 studies found that young children with ASD had higher levels of anxiety compared to various control groups. A variety of DSM anxiety symptoms and disorders were present in young children with the most common symptoms being specific, social, and generalized fears. Correlates of anxiety included sensory over-responsivity, sleep disturbance, aggression/defiance, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Three cognitive behavioral treatment studies for anxiety and one developmental intervention targeting ASD symptoms showed promise in reducing anxiety. Findings indicate an early emergence of anxiety in some children with ASD. Further research on the measurement, pathophysiology, and treatment of anxiety in early childhood is critical to improving outcomes in children with ASD. LAY SUMMARY: This scoping review synthesizes the literature on anxiety in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Results indicate that children with ASD have higher levels of anxiety than children without ASD. Potential factors that could be contributing to anxiety include sensory, sleep, and behavioral problems. Preliminary studies show that anxiety can improve with cognitive behavioral treatment. These findings suggest that research on anxiety in young children with ASD should be prioritized to improve mental health outcomes.","Vasa, Roma A; Keefer, Amy; McDonald, Rachel G; Hunsche, Michelle C; Kerns, Connor M",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978905/,304

72420,COVID-19 Pandemic Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Survivors: Pain After the Storm?,2020-07-01,"Discovery of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) revealed that the renin-angiotensin system has 2 counterbalancing arms. ACE2 is a major player in the protective arm, highly expressed in lungs and gut with the ability to mitigate cardiopulmonary diseases such as inflammatory lung disease. ACE2 also exhibits activities involving gut microbiome, nutrition, and as a chaperone stabilizing the neutral amino acid transporter, B0AT1, in gut. But the current interest in ACE2 arises because it is the cell surface receptor for the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, to infect host cells, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. This suggests that ACE2 be considered harmful, however, because of its important other roles, it is paradoxically a potential therapeutic target for cardiopulmonary diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. This review describes the discovery of ACE2, its physiological functions, and its place in the renin-angiotensin system. It illustrates new analyses of the structure of ACE2 that provides better understanding of its actions particularly in lung and gut, shedding of ACE2 by ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 17 protein), and role of TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine proteases 2) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 entry into host cells. Cardiopulmonary diseases are associated with decreased ACE2 activity and the mitigation by increasing ACE2 activity along with its therapeutic relevance are addressed. Finally, the potential use of ACE2 as a treatment target in COVID-19, despite its role to allow viral entry into host cells, is suggested.","Sharma, Ravindra K; Stevens, Bruce R; Obukhov, Alexander G; Grant, Maria B; Oudit, Gavin Y; Li, Qiuhong; Richards, Elaine M; Pepine, Carl J; Raizada, Mohan K",Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.120.15595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32783758/,304

Evolve and Pipeline flow diverters were deployed in one copy of each geometry; the third copy was used as Control. High-speed angiography was acquired under pulsatile flow in each replica, contrast concentration-time curves within the aneurysms were recorded, and the curves were quantified with six parameters. The parameters were statistically evaluated to compare the flow diversion effect of both devices. RESULTS The Evolve showed greater flow diversion trends in almost all intra-geometry comparisons than the Pipeline. When aggregated over the three geometries, the Evolve was statistically significantly better than the Pipeline in four of the six parameters, and about the same or better (not statistically significant) than the Pipeline in the other two parameters.

L’objectif était d’estimer et de comparer ce taux pour le Canada et les États-Unis en tenant compte de 2 sources de biais potentiel du taux brut. MÉTHODES: Pour ce faire, nous sommes partis du nombre quotidien de cas confirmés et de décès au Canada et aux États-Unis pour la période du 31 janvier au 22 avril 2020. Nous y avons appliqué une méthode statistique qui réduit au minimum les biais du taux de létalité brut de 2 façons : en intégrant la durée de survie, soit le délai entre le début de la maladie et le décès, et en considérant que moins de 50 % des cas de COVID-19 sont confirmés (intervalle de confiance à 95 % 10 %–50 %). RÉSULTATS: À partir du nombre de cas confirmés au Canada, nous avons évalué le taux brut en date en 22 avril 2020 à 4,9 %, et le taux ajusté à 5,5 % (intervalle de crédibilité [ICr] 4,9 %–6,4 %). En appliquant divers taux de cas confirmés inférieurs à 50 %, nous avons obtenu un taux ajusté de 1,6 % (ICr 0,7 %–3,1 %).

Further, to investigate the influence of the length of intervention, number of contacts, study size, delivery of feedback, and preliminary face-to-face sessions. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in May 2017, with a priori defined eligibility criteria: randomized controlled trials investigating remote feedback interventions in adult persons with type 2 diabetes, using physical activity as outcome. The effect size was calculated as standardized mean difference (SMD) and was pooled in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Meta-regression analyses were performed to examine if the observed effect size could be attributed to study- or intervention characteristics using these as covariates. RESULTS The literature search identified 4455 articles of which 27 met the eligibility criteria. The meta-analysis including a total of 4215 participants found an overall effect size in favour of remote feedback interventions compared to standardized treatment, SMD = 0.33 (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.49), I2 = 81.7%). Analyses on study characteristics found that the effect on physical activity was only influenced by study size, with a larger effect in small studies. CONCLUSION Adding remote feedback to standardized treatments aimed at increasing physical activity in persons with type 2 diabetes showed a small to moderate additional increase in physical activity levels.

We sought to define the extent of fetal telehealth conversion at a large fetal cardiac care center and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy for studies performed. Methods: At our center, fetal telemedicine expanded from one MFM site before the pandemic to four additional sites by May 2020. A retrospective review of fetal telecardiology visits between March 15 and July 15, 2020, was performed. The chart was reviewed for confirmation of diagnosis postnatally. Results: With pandemic onset, there was a large increase in the number of telemedicine visits with a total of 122 mothers seen between five MFM clinics. Fourteen mothers (11.5%) had abnormal fetal echocardiograms requiring additional follow-up, and seven mothers (5.8%) had a fetal echocardiogram suspicious for a critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). All the fetal echocardiograms suspicious for CCHD were confirmed on postnatal echocardiogram. To our knowledge, none of the normal fetal echocardiograms were found to have congenital heart disease postnatally. Conclusions: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we rapidly transitioned to fetal telecardiology using a variety of formats. This has reduced potential infectious exposure for pregnant mothers and minimized contact between physicians without compromising diagnostic accuracy. In our experience, the expansion of a telemedicine program requires strong initial infrastructure, prior relationships with MFM providers, and appropriate training among obstetric sonographers.","Schwartz, Bryanna N; Klein, Jennifer H; Barbosa, Megan B; Hamersley, Sheri L; Hickey, Kimberly W; Ahmadzia, Homa K; Broth, Richard E; Pinckert, Thomas L; Sable, Craig A; Donofrio, Mary T; Krishnan, Anita",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33513044/,304
89642,Thrombophilia in Pediatric Patients with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Secondary to Coronavirus Disease 2019 Supported on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.,2021-01-01,"INTRODUCTION Cesarean deliveries are commonly performed throughout the world. While the uterine closure technique following this procedure may influence how the uterine scar heals, there is insufficient evidence for choosing the appropriate technique and thus preventing long-term negative consequences. This prospective sized study examined the effects of single- and double-layer uterine closure techniques on uterine-scar healing following cesarean delivery. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study assessed a total of 282 women aged 18-45 years who were in gestational weeks 24-41 of singleton pregnancies. None had previously undergone uterine surgeries. These participants completed their first cesarean deliveries at the time of study and were randomized into the following two treatment groups: single-layer closure with locking and double-layer closure with locking in the first layer, but not in the second layer (NCT03629028). However, the decidua was not included for treatment in either group. Participants were evaluated at 6-9 months after cesarean section by saline infusion sonohysterography to assess cesarean delivery scar defects. These procedures were conducted by experienced sonographers who were not concerned about the uterine closure technique. RESULTS Of the 225 final participants, 109 received the single-layer closure technique, while 116 received the double-layer technique. The niche rates were 37% (n=40) for the single-layer group and 45.7% (n=53) for the double-layer group (p=0.22, RR 1.4, 95% CI=0.8-4.4). CONCLUSIONS The single- and double-layer closure techniques did not produce different impacts on uterine scar niche development.","Yilmaz Baran, Şafak; Kalayci, Hakan; Doğan Durdağ, Gülşen; Yetkinel, Selçuk; Alemdaroğlu, Songül; Çok, Tayfun; Kiliçdağ, Esra Bulgan",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33029804/,304

97839,[Pathological changes of fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the lungs: report of 10 cases by postmortem needle autopsy].,2020-06-08,"BACKGROUND Re-Irradiation (Re-RT) is an established treatment option for young patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Multiple reports show a low risk of side-effects as well as a good efficacy resulting in median survival times ranging from 5 to 18 months. Elderly patients, however, are underrepresented in reports about Re-RT. Even in the elderly, with concomitant radiochemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy, progression-free survival times now are approaching 6 months or even longer. METHODS We report on 25 consecutive patients with at least 65 years of age treated with Re-RT for recurrent GBM. We analyzed the patient's files for the treatment regimens, side-effects and survival times. Survival times, as well as hazards, were calculated by the Kaplan Meier method as well as Cox-regression method, respectively. RESULTS The median overall survival was 6.9 months, treatment was well tolerated with only minor side effects. Use of systemic treatments as well as the length of the interval between 1st -line radiotherapy and re-irradiation were associated with a favorable prognosis. The latter remained significant after multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION Re-RT of elderly GBM patients should not be withheld based purely on age since the treatment is safe and results in comparable survival times to younger patients. When counseling elderly patients with recurrent GBM, especially the length of the interval since 1st line radiotherapy should be considered as a prognostic factor and an additional systemic treatment option should be considered.","Straube, Christoph; Antoni, Stefanie; Gempt, Jens; Zimmer, Claus; Meyer, Bernhard; Schlegel, Jürgen; Schmidt-Graf, Friederike; Combs, Stephanie E",Journal of neuro-oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11060-019-03101-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659523/,304
98246,Histopathological features in fatal COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome.,2021-02-27,"INTRODUCTION Since the first reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, the disease has spread worldwide. Different social isolation strategies have been adopted to reduce community transmission, but few studies have evaluated the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection in a family cluster during periods of isolation. We report an outbreak in 24 members of a family cluster during a period of social distancing. METHODOLOGY We carried out an observational descriptive study of a family cluster infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil. Laboratory confirmation included RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal samples or IgM or IgG serology. RESULTS The attack rates were 75% (19/24) based on laboratory-confirmed cases and 87.5% (21/24) including probable cases. The time of spread was 17 days from the first case. All patients had mild symptoms, requiring no hospitalization, and none of them died. The frequency of symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed patients was higher among adults (94%) than among children (50%); the paediatric age group also had a higher frequency of exposed individuals who remained negative for infection. Ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography were present in all patients with reported dyspnoea. CONCLUSION This study highlights a high risk of intrahousehold transmission from an index case, suggesting the need for (I) specific guidelines during periods of social distancing, (II) minimization of external exposures and, above all, (III) adoption of strict quarantine measures for suspected cases and family members to prevent outbreaks from spreading.","Brito, Carlos Alexandre Antunes de; Brito, Marina Coelho Moraes de; Martins, Thiago Henrique Fernandes; Brito, Cecília Coelho Moraes de; Albuquerque, Maria Fátima Militão; Brito, Rita de Cássia Coelho Moraes de",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33031086/,304

We presented the faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, gut microbiota imbalance, and fecal microbiota transplantation as a hidden source of this virus. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed the available literature (PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar databases) regarding COVID-19 and gut microbiota related aspects. RESULTS The gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort/pain, may occur in these patients. Notably, these symptoms may contribute to the severity of COVID-19. Recent several studies have revealed a new SARS-CoV-2 transmission possibility, opening a fresh view on COVID-19. It is observed the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via faecal-oral route. Fecal microbiota transplantation may be a hidden source of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 and other factors may significantly alter the composition of gut microbiota. Among others, loss of bacterial diversity, the decrease of commensal microbes as well as the increase of opportunistic pathogens are observed. CONCLUSIONS The alterations of gut microbiota in COVID-19 patients consequently may lead to the development of gut dysbiosis-related diseases even after recovery from COVID-19. Therefore, it is recommended to screen stool samples taken from recovered patients at least 35 days after clearance of virus from respiratory tract. Before 35 days period, SARS-CoV-2 may still be detected in feces. It is also recommended to screen the composition as well as the activity of gut microbiota to assess its balance. In the case of gut dysbiosis, there should be introduced an appropriate method of its modulation. Additionally, all the fecal samples which are prepared for fecal microbiota transplantation should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 to provide protection for its recipients.","Kaźmierczak-Siedlecka, K; Vitale, E; Makarewicz, W",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202010_23448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33155247/,304

Cancer cells are killed by immunogenic cell death, causing long-lasting anticancer immune responses, a feature of particular interest in non-immunogenic CRC. Oncolytic peptides DTT-205 and DTT-304 were administered by intratumoral injection in subcutaneous tumors established from murine CRC cell lines CT26 and MC38, and complete regression was obtained in the majority of animals. When cured animals were rechallenged by splenic injection of tumor cells, 1/23 animals developed liver metastases, compared to 19/22 naïve animals. Treatment with both peptides was well tolerated, but monitoring post-injection hemodynamic parameters in rats, less extensive changes were observed with DTT-205 than DTT-304, favoring DTT-205 for future drug development. DTT-205 was subsequently shown to have strong in vitro activity in a panel of 33 cancer cell lines. In conclusion, both peptides exerted a strong inhibitory effect in two immunocompetent CRC models and induced a systemic effect preventing development of liver metastases upon splenic rechallenge. If a similar effect could be obtained in humans, these drugs would be of particular interest for combinatory treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic CRC.","Fleten, Karianne Giller; Eksteen, J Johannes; Mauseth, Brynjar; Camilio, Ketil André; Vasskog, Terje; Sveinbjørnsson, Baldur; Rekdal, Øystein; Mælandsmo, Gunhild M; Flatmark, Kjersti",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86239-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762676/,304
102149,Consideration of prevention and management of long-term consequences of post-acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.,2020-05-18,"Endocytosis is a fundamental process occurring in all eukaryotic cells. Live cell imaging of endocytosis has helped to decipher many of its mechanisms and regulations. With the pulsed-pH (ppH) protocol, one can detect the formation of individual endocytic vesicles (EVs) with an unmatched temporal resolution of 2 s. The ppH protocol makes use of cargo protein (e.g., the transferrin receptor) coupled to a pH-sensitive fluorescent protein, such as superecliptic pHluorin (SEP), which is brightly fluorescent at pH 7.4 but not fluorescent at pH <6.0. If the SEP moiety is at the surface, its fluorescence will decrease when cells are exposed to a low pH (5.5) buffer. If the SEP moiety has been internalized, SEP will remain fluorescent even during application of the low pH buffer. Fast perfusion enables the complete exchange of low and high pH extracellular solutions every 2 s, defining the temporal resolution of the technique. Unlike other imaging-based endocytosis assays, the ppH protocol detects EVs without a priori hypotheses on the dynamics of vesicle formation. Here, we explain how the ppH protocol quantifies the endocytic activity of living cells and the recruitment of associated proteins in real time. We provide a step-by-step procedure for expression of the reporter proteins with transient transfection, live cell image acquisition with synchronized pH changes and automated analysis. The whole protocol can be performed in 2 d to provide quantitative information on the endocytic process being studied.","Sposini, Silvia; Rosendale, Morgane; Claverie, Léa; Van, Thi Nhu Ngoc; Jullié, Damien; Perrais, David",Nature protocols,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-020-0371-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807908/,304

Thereby, patients with acute ischemic stroke who are on dabigatran treatment may become eligible for thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). In patients on dabigatran with intracerebral hemorrhage idarucizumab could prevent lesion growth. AIMS To provide insights into the clinical use of idarucizumab in patients under effective dabigatran anticoagulation presenting with signs of acute ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage. METHODS Retrospective data collected from German neurological/neurosurgical departments administering idarucizumab following product launch from January 2016 to August 2018 were used. RESULTS One-hundred and twenty stroke patients received idarucizumab in 61 stroke centers. Eighty patients treated with dabigatran presented with ischemic stroke and 40 patients suffered intracranial bleeding (intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in n = 27). In patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA following idarucizumab, 78% showed a median improvement of 7 points in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. No bleeding complications were reported. Hematoma growth was observed in 3 out of 27 patients with ICH. Outcome was favorable with a median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement of 4 points and modified Rankin score 0-3 in 61%. Six out of 40 individuals (15%) with intracranial bleeding died during hospital stay. CONCLUSION Administration of rt-PA after reversal of dabigatran activity with idarucizumab in case of acute ischemic stroke seems feasible, effective, and safe. In dabigatran-associated intracranial hemorrhage, idarucizumab appears to prevent hematoma growth and to improve outcome.","Kermer, Pawel; Eschenfelder, Christoph C; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Grond, Martin; Abdalla, Yasser; Abraham, Alexej; Althaus, Katharina; Becks, Gebhard; Berrouschot, Jörg; Berthel, Jörg; Bode, Felix J; Burghaus, Lothar; Cangür, Hakan; Daffertshofer, Michael; Edelbusch, Sebastian; Eggers, Jürgen; Gerlach, Rüdiger; Gröschel, Klaus; Große-Dresselhaus, Florian; Günther, Albrecht; Haase, Claus G; Haensch, Carl-Albrecht; Harloff, Andreas; Heckmann, Joseph G; Held, Valentin; Hieber, Maren; Kauert, Andreas; Kern, Rolf; Kerz, Thomas; Köhrmann, Martin; Kraft, Peter; Kühnlein, Peter; Latta, Jan; Leinisch, Elke; Lenz, Arne; Leithner, Christoph; Neumann-Haefelin, Tobias; Mäurer, Mathias; Müllges, Wolfgang; Nolte, Christian H; Obermann, Mark; Partowi, Someieh; Patzschke, Peer; Poli, Sven; Pulkowski, Ulrich; Purrucker, Jan; Rehfeldt, Torsten; Ringleb, Peter A; Röther, Joachim; Rossi, Raluca; El-Sabassy, Hazem; Sauer, Oliver; Schackert, Gabriele; Schäfer, Niklas; Schellinger, Peter D; Schneider, Andreas; Schuppner, Ramona; Schwab, Stefan; Schwarte, Olav; Seitz, Rüdiger J; Senger, Sebastian; Shah, Yogesh P; Sindern, Eckhart; Sparenberg, Paul; Steiner, Thorsten; Szabo, Kristina; Urbanek, Christian; Sarnowksi, Bettina von; Weissenborn, Karin; Wienecke, Peter; Witt, Karsten; Wruck, Robert; Wunderlich, Silke",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493019895654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31955706/,304

METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral everolimus 10 mg/day plus octreotide LAR 30 mg intramuscularly (i.m.) or to receive matching placebo plus octreotide LAR 30 mg i.m. every 28 days. SSA treatment before study enrollment was permitted. Patient characteristics and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed by treatment arm and previous SSA exposure status. RESULTS Of the 429 patients enrolled in RADIANT-2, 339 were previously exposed to SSA (95% received octreotide); 173 of 339 patients were in the everolimus plus octreotide LAR arm. All patients had a protocol-specified history of secretory symptoms, but analysis by type showed that more patients who previously received SSA therapy had a history of flushing symptoms (77%), diarrhea (86%), or both (63%) compared with SSA-naive patients (62, 62, and 24%, respectively). Patients who received everolimus plus octreotide LAR had longer median PFS regardless of previous SSA exposure (with: PFS 14.3 months, 95% confidence interval, CI, 12.0-20.1; without: 25.2 months, 95% CI, 12.0-not reached) compared with patients who received placebo plus octreotide LAR (with: 11.1 months, 95% CI, 8.4-14.6; without: 13.6 months, 95% CI, 8.2-22.7).

By using in silico prediction, in vitro refolding and a T2 cell-binding assay, followed by immunization of HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic mice, an HLA-A*0201-restricted decameric epitope, RI-10 (H5 HA205-214, RLYQNPTTYI), was shown to elicit a robust CTL epitope-specific response. In addition, RI-10 and its variant, KI-10 (KLYQNPTTYI), were also demonstrated to be able to induce a higher CTL epitope-specific response than the influenza A virus dominant CTL epitope GL-9 (GILGFVFTL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HLA-A*0201-positive patients who had recovered from H5N1 virus infection. Furthermore, the crystal structures of RI-10-HLA-A*0201 and KI-10-HLA-A*0201 complexes were determined at 2.3 and 2.2 A resolution, respectively, showing typical HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes. The conformations of RI-10 and KI-10 in the antigen-presenting grooves in crystal structures of the two complexes show significant differences, despite their nearly identical sequences. These results provide implications for the discovery of diagnostic markers and the design of novel influenza vaccines.","Sun, Yeping; Liu, Jun; Yang, Meng; Gao, Feng; Zhou, Jianfang; Kitamura, Yoshihiro; Gao, Bin; Tien, Po; Shu, Yuelong; Iwamoto, Aikichi; Chen, Zhu; Gao, George F",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.016766-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19955560/,304

METHODS A systematic search was carried out in the EBSCOhost, Embase, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Trip databases. The free terms ""stylomandibular ligament"" and ""Ernest syndrome"" were used, and the Boolean operator ""OR"" was used for connection of the terms. The research protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018112914). The results of this study are presented according to the PRISMA statement, and risk of bias was assessed according to the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies of the Effective Public Health Practice Project. RESULTS A total of 57 articles were found, 5 of which met the selection criteria and were included in this review. The selected articles represent a population of 81 patients with primarily unilateral pain in the periauricular and mandibular areas. Diagnosis was established according to clinical history, recognition of pain on palpation of the mandibular angle, and remission following infiltration with local anesthesia. Concerning the treatments applied, infiltration with corticosteroids was highly successful, as was partial resection of the stylomandibular ligament and part of the styloid process. Furthermore, in refractory cases, the application of radiofrequency thermoneurolysis was described. CONCLUSION The analyzed studies allow a better understanding of Ernest syndrome and the proposal of a tendinosis model for this condition. However, the evidence is scarce, and it is therefore necessary to carry out additional studies with better methodologic designs.","Domínguez, Javiera; Bornhardt, Thomas; Wen, Schilin; Iturriaga, Veronica",Journal of oral & facial pain and headache,https://doi.org/10.11607/ofph.2551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32255582/,304

Methods: Data obtained from independent verification studies and clinical testing of the HM-JACKarc FIT method in routine primary care practice were analysed to derive analytical performance characteristics. Results: Detection capabilities for the FIT method were 0.5 microg/g (limit of blank), 1.1 microg/g (limit of detection) and 15.0 microg/g (limit of quantification). 31 of 33 (94%) non-homogenised specimens analysed in triplicate were consistently categorised relative to 10 microg/g compared to all 33 (100%) homogenised specimens. Imprecision in non-homogenised specimens was higher (median 27.8%, (range 20.5% - 48.6%)) than in homogenised specimens (10.2%, (7.0 to 13.5%)). Considerable variation was observed in sequential clinical specimens from individual patients but no positive or negative trend in specimen degradation was observed (p=0.26). Conclusions: The FIT method is capable of detecting Hb at concentrations well below the DG30 threshold of 10 microg/g. However, total imprecision is considerable when including sampling variation. Binary categorisation against a single defined threshold above and below 10 microg/g was more consistent and improved following specimen homogenisation. This approach may be more appropriate when reporting results for symptomatic patients tested in primary care, including those who have had definitive investigation delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and need to be re-prioritised.","James, T.

In recent years, educators have gradually transitioned many classes to the online learning environment, effectively reducing teacher supervision. This has been greatly exacerbated with the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 and subsequent social distancing guidelines. In an effort to help students and educators better understand the implications of technology on academic distraction and academic performance, this literature review discusses the effects of three forms on technology on student distraction: laptops, smartphones, and social media use, particularly the social media platform Facebook. While the effects of student laptops on academic distraction are somewhat ambivalent, the debate is largely moot in the current educational environment. The detrimental effects of student smartphone and social media use on academic distraction are more conspicuous, especially with the pervasiveness of personal digital devices. Potential self‐regulatory and environmental interventions are discussed.

179854,Acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock in pregnant woman with COVID-19,2021,"The 9th International Workshop on Theorem-Proving Components for Educational Software (ThEdu'20) was scheduled to happen on June 29 as a satellite of the IJCAR-FSCD 2020 joint meeting, in Paris. The COVID-19 pandemic came by surprise, though, and the main conference was virtualised. Fearing that an online meeting would not allow our community to fully reproduce the usual face-to-face networking opportunities of the ThEdu initiative, the Steering Committee of ThEdu decided to cancel our workshop. Given that many of us had already planned and worked for that moment, we decided that ThEdu'20 could still live in the form of an EPTCS volume. The EPTCS concurred with us, recognising this very singular situation, and accepted our proposal of organising a special issue with papers submitted to ThEdu'20. An open call for papers was then issued, and attracted five submissions, all of which have been accepted by our reviewers, who produced three careful reports on each of the contributions. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume. We, the volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will help further promoting the development of theorem-proving-based software, and that it will collaborate to improve the mutual understanding between computer mathematicians and stakeholders in education. With some luck, we would actually expect that the very special circumstances set up by the worst sanitary crisis in a century will happen to reinforce the need for the application of certified components and of verification methods for the production of educational software that would be available even when the traditional on-site learning experiences turn out not to be recommendable.","Quaresma, Pedro; Neuper, Walther; Marcos, Joao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15832v1.pdf,304

METHODS We identified all potential cases of nosocomially acquired SARS, linked them to the most likely infection source, and described the hospital containment measures. SETTING A 2,300-bed medical center in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. RESULTS A total of 55 cases of SARS were identified, and 227 hospital workers were quarantined. The index patient and neighboring patients were isolated. A chest physician team reviewed medical charts and chest radiographs and monitored the development of SARS in patients staying in the ward. The presence of underlying lung disease and immunocompromise in some patients made the diagnosis of SARS difficult. Some cases of SARS were diagnosed after the patients had died. Medical personnel were infected only if they cared for patients with unrecognized SARS, and caretakers played important roles in transmission of SARS to family members. As the number of cases of nosocomial SARS increased, the hospital closed the affected ward and expedited construction of negative-pressure rooms on other vacated floors for patient cohorting, and the last case in the hospital was identified 1 week later. CONCLUSIONS Timely recognition of SARS is extremely important. However, given the limitations of SARS testing, possible loss of epidemic links, and the nonspecific clinical presentations in hospitalized patients, it is very important to establish cohorts of persons with low, medium, and high likelihoods of SARS acquisition. Rapid closure of affected wards may minimize the impact on hospital operations. Establishment of hospitals dedicated to appropriate treatment of patients with SARS might minimize the impact of the disease in future epidemics.","Liu, Jien-Wei; Lu, Sheng-Nan; Chen, Shun-Sheng; Yang, Kuender D; Lin, Meng-Chih; Wu, Chao-Chien; Bloland, Peter B; Park, Sarah Y; Wong, William; Tsao, Kuo-Chien; Lin, Tzou-Yien; Chen, Chao-Long",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16671027/,304

202427,Phase- and epidemic region-adjusted estimation of the number of coronavirus disease 2019 cases in China,2020,"BACKGROUND: Millions of individuals with visual impairment use vision assistance apps to help with their daily activities. The most widely used vision assistance apps are magnifier apps. It is still largely unknown what the apps are used for. Lack of insight into the visual needs of individuals with visual impairment is a hurdle for the development of more effective assistive technologies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how needs for visual aids may vary with social activities, by observing the changes in the usage of a smartphone magnifier app when many users take breaks from work. METHODS: The number of launches of the SuperVision Magnifier app was determined retrospectively from 2018 to 2020 from among active users worldwide. The fluctuation in app usage was examined by comparing weekday vs weekend periods, Christmas and new year vs nonholiday seasons, and COVID-19 lockdowns vs the easing of restriction during the pandemic. RESULTS: On average, the app was used 262,466 times by 38,237 users each month in 2020 worldwide. There were two major trough points on the timeline of weekly app usage, one aligned with the COVID-19 lockdowns in April 2020 and another aligned with the Christmas and new year week in 2018 and 2019. The app launches declined by 6947 (11% decline; P<.001) during the lockdown and by 5212 (9% decline; P=.001) during the holiday weeks. There was no significant decline during March to May 2019. App usage compensated for seasonal changes was 8.6% less during weekends than during weekdays (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The need for vision assistance technology was slightly lower during breaks and lockdowns, probably because the activities at home were different and less visually demanding. Nevertheless, for the entire user population, the needs for visual aids are still substantial.","Luo, Gang; Pundlik, Shrinivas",J Med Internet Res,,304

209064,What should we prepare for the next coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak? A survey on the opinions of infectious diseases specialists in South Korea,2020,"BACKGROUND: Fluoroscopic-guided lumbar procedures have increased in daily pain practice because the lumbar spine is one of the most common sources of pain. Interventional pain fellows must develop a minimum number of skills during their training in order to achieve the competences without neglecting radiological safety. However, medical training in fluoroscopic-guided interventions is being affected by the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation. METHODS: The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of a phantom model for lumbar injection as a training strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic in fellows of interventional pain. The study was divided into theoretical and practical modules. The hands-on practice was performed in a lumbar model phantom where fellows were evaluated in four fluoroscopically guided approaches: intra-articular facet block (IAFB), medial branch block (MBB), transforaminal block (TFB), and interlaminar block (ILB) divided in 5 sessions. The aim was to make as many punctures as possible in every session. We measured total procedural performance (TPP), total needle hand time (TNH), and total radiation dose generated by the fluoroscopic machine (TRD) during each procedure. Additionally, a survey was applied to evaluate confidence and satisfaction before and after training. RESULTS: A total of 320 lumbar punctures were completed. The results were statistically significant in all approaches attempted (p < 0.01). The fellow's survey for satisfaction and confidence demonstrated a significant difference between pre and post-test (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight the importance of adaptations and adoption of new educational models. The use of the phantom model for simulation could be a strategy for other emerging situations, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Including this practice in the interventional pain programs could lead to better results for the patient and operator radiology safety.","Silva, Victor; Martínez, Luis; Santiago, Margarita; López, Anna; Sánchez, Juan; Vázquez-Garza, Eduardo; Cantú, Fernando; García, Baltazar; Chora, Daniel; Guerra, Miguel; Franco-Cabrera, María",Pain pract.

For women who wish to preserve their uterus and who have not had a response to medical treatment, myomectomy and uterine-artery embolization are therapeutic options. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate myomectomy, as compared with uterine-artery embolization, in women who had symptomatic uterine fibroids and did not want to undergo hysterectomy. Procedural options included open abdominal, laparoscopic, or hysteroscopic myomectomy. The primary outcome was fibroid-related quality of life, as assessed by the score on the health-related quality-of-life domain of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS-QOL) questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life) at 2 years; adjustment was made for the baseline score. RESULTS: A total of 254 women, recruited at 29 hospitals in the United Kingdom, were randomly assigned: 127 to the myomectomy group (of whom 105 underwent myomectomy) and 127 to the uterine-artery embolization group (of whom 98 underwent embolization). Data on the primary outcome were available for 206 women (81%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the mean (±SD) score on the health-related quality-of-life domain of the UFS-QOL questionnaire at 2 years was 84.6±21.5 in the myomectomy group and 80.0±22.0 in the uterine-artery embolization group (mean adjusted difference with complete case analysis, 8.0 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 14.1; P = 0.01; mean adjusted difference with missing responses imputed, 6.5 points; 95% CI, 1.1 to 11.9). Perioperative and postoperative complications from all initial procedures, irrespective of adherence to the assigned procedure, occurred in 29% of the women in the myomectomy group and in 24% of the women in the uterine-artery embolization group. CONCLUSIONS: Among women with symptomatic uterine fibroids, those who underwent myomectomy had a better fibroid-related quality of life at 2 years than those who underwent uterine-artery embolization.

Drawing from recent insights into the complex relationship between religious affiliation and other intersecting social identities (namely race, gender and class), we argue that understanding the racial inequities of COVID-19 requires consideration of the religious beliefs, participation and the collective resources of racial minorities. We suggest that religion can simultaneously offer a salve for vulnerable communities during this outbreak and can exacerbate the spread of the disease without solving the problem of insufficient access to care.

Recently, a cell surface protein, known as angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), has been identified to be involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis for SARS-CoV-2 entry to the cells. Many studies have reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19: sudden deterioration of disease around 1-2 weeks after onset; much lower level of lymphocytes, especially natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood; extremely high pro-inflammatory cytokines and C reactive protein (CRP). About 15.7% of patients develop severe pneumonia, and cytokine storm is an important factor leading to rapid disease progression. Currently, there are no specific drugs for COVID-19 and the cytokine storm it causes. Baricitinib intracellularly inhibits the proinflammatory signal of several cytokines by suppressing Janus kinase (JAK) JAK1/JAK2. It has been demonstrated clinical benefits for the patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active systemic lupus erythematosus and atopic dermatitis with good efficacy and safety records. Baricitinib is expected to interrupt the passage and intracellular assembly of SARS-CoV-2 into the target cells mediated by ACE2 receptor, and treat cytokine storm caused by COVID-19. Several clinical trials are currently investigating the drug, and one of which has been completed with encouraging results. In this paper, we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm mediated by JAK-STAT pathway in severe COVID-19, the possible mechanisms of baricitinib on reducing the viral entry into the target cells and cytokine storm, the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the latest research reports, clinical trials progress and drug instruction from the US FDA, so as to provide reference for the treatment of severe COVID-19.","Zhang, Xiuhong; Zhang, Yan; Qiao, Weizhen; Zhang, Ji; Qi, Zhigang",Int Immunopharmacol,,304

And to propose mitigation strategies via easy to implement visual ergonomic practices. Methods: A standardized tool was used to gather information via an online survey conducted over a period of October-December 2020. Study population consisted of 231 professionals working from home (Mean age 37 years ± 6). The survey consisted of CVSS-17 questionnaire along with questions targeting ergonomics and human factors in the new work-from-home setups. The paper shows the association between impact of the new work environment and eye health using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) for all the variables under ideal ergonomic practices. Result: The study indicates that there is a marked increase in the hours spent in front of a screen for work (r = 0.67). The people who face eye strain reported that the letters on the screen became blurry after continuous screen use (r = 0.56). Screen size is negatively correlated to the ideal visual ergonomic position of eyes in relation to the screen (r = −0.29). Overall awareness about refresh rate is very low (21%). Conclusion: The study has established a definite indication of onset of computer vision syndrome in the majority of the people who are now working from home on screens for extended hours.

This pathogenic virus has been identified in swabs performed on the throat and nose of patients who suffer from or are suspected of the disease. When COVI-19 infect the upper and lower respiratory tract it can cause mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-6. The binding of COVI-19 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release of pro-IL-1ß which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1ß which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. Suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members and IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. Cytokine IL-37 has the ability to suppress innate and acquired immune response and also has the capacity to inhibit inflammation by acting on IL-18R&#945; receptor.

We aim to better understand lower uptake among racial and ethnic minority staff groups to inform initiatives to enhance uptake. DESIGN: Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted (October 2020-January 2021) with UK-based healthcare staff. Data were inductively and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Vaccine decision-making processes were underpinned by an overarching theme, 'weighing up risks of harm against potential benefits to self and others'. Sub-themes included 'fear of harm', 'moral/ethical objections', 'potential benefits to self and others', 'information and misinformation', and 'institutional or workplace pressure'. We identified ways in which these were weighted more heavily towards vaccine hesitancy for racial and ethnic minority staff groups influenced by perceptions about institutional and structural discrimination. This included suspicions and fear around institutional pressure to be vaccinated, racial injustices in vaccine development and testing, religious or ethical concerns, and legitimacy and accessibility of vaccine messaging and communication. CONCLUSIONS: Drawing on a critical race perspective, we conclude that acknowledging historical and contemporary abuses of power is essential to avoid perpetuating and aggravating mistrust by de-contextualising hesitancy from the social processes affecting hesitancy, undermining efforts to increase vaccine uptake.","Woodhead, Charlotte; Onwumere, Juliana; Rhead, Rebecca; Bora-White, Monalisa; Chui, Zoe; Clifford, Naomi; Connor, Luke; Gunasinghe, Cerisse; Harwood, Hannah; Meriez, Paula; Mir, Ghazala; Jones Nielsen, Jessica; Rafferty, Anne Marie; Stanley, Nathan; Peprah, Dorothy; Hatch, Stephani L",Ethn Health,,304

The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has exerted a negative impact on dental practices. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the nature and diffusion of COVID-19-related oral health information on the Chinese social media site Weibo. METHODS: A total of 15,900 tweets related to oral health and dentistry information from Weibo during the COVID-19 outbreak in China (December 31, 2019, to March 16, 2020) were included in our study. Two researchers coded 1000 of the total tweets in advance, and two main thematic categories with eight subtypes were refined. The included tweets were analyzed over time and geographic region, and coded into eight thematic categories. Additionally, the time distributions of tweets containing information about dental services, needs of dental treatment, and home oral care during the COVID-19 epidemic were further analyzed. RESULTS: People reacted rapidly to the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 threat to dental services, and a large amount of COVID-19-related oral health information was tweeted on Weibo. The time and geographic distribution of tweets shared similarities with epidemiological data of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Tweets containing home oral care and dental services content were the most frequently exchanged information (n=4803/15,900, 30.20% and n=4478, 28.16%, respectively). Significant differences of public attention were found between various types of bloggers in dental services-related tweets (P<.001), and the tweets from the government and media engaged the most public attention. The distributions of tweets containing information about dental services, needs of dental treatment, and home oral care information dynamically changed with time. CONCLUSIONS: Our study overviewed and analyzed social media data on the dental services and oral health information during the COVID-19 epidemic, thus, providing insights for government organizations, media, and dental professionals to better facilitate oral health communication and efficiently shape public concern through social media when routine dental services are unavailable during an unprecedented event. The study of the nature and distribution of social media can serve as a useful adjunct tool to help make public health policies.","Tao, Zhuo-Ying; Chu, Guang; McGrath, Colman; Hua, Fang; Leung, Yiu Yan; Yang, Wei-Fa; Su, Yu-Xiong",J Med Internet Res,,304

255990,Care for Older People with Dementia During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Before a trip, a screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR is often required and raises the problem of detection of residual viral RNA at distance from the acute infection (post-Covid). At the University Hospital of Geneva, we developed an expertise to distinguish acute from post-Covid infections. Between October and December 2020, 30% of the people tested positive were able to travel because the result corresponded to post-Covid and 65% were put in isolation because of an acute infection with a risk of transmission. To overcome the detection of residual viral RNA by RT-PCR, a rapid antigenic test would be an interesting and less expensive alternative. It could also be performed a few hours before departure.","Allgower, A.; Aebischer Perone, S.; Schibler, M.; Schwob, J.

An audit was performed at a major quaternary referral centre for Ophthalmology in Sydney, Australia. This study assesses the outcomes of teleconsultation in an acute ophthalmic clinic setting. Methods : 242 patients with an Acute Ophthalmic Service clinic appointment at the Sydney Hospital & Sydney Eye Hospital between 19 March 2020 and 9 April 2020 inclusive were included in this study. These patients were separated into two study groups - 162 patients attended their pre-arranged appointment, whereas 80 patients had their appointment th th changed to a telehealth consultation. A final year Ophthalmology Registrar performed an online medical records review of all patients and selected 80 patients for teleconsultation, following which re-presentation rate and reason for re-presentation was collected each month for five months for the two patient populations. The primary outcome measure was the rate of re-presentation and reason for representation to the Eye Emergency Department. Results : There were no significant differences in the number of re-presentations after each month during the five months (P = 0.166, 0.113, 0.139, 0.266 and 0.390 at each month). There were also no significant differences in the reason for re-presentation after each month during the five months (P = 0.999, 0.999, 0.872, 0.663 and 0.517 at each month). Conclusions : There were similar short-term outcomes between the two study groups suggesting that telehealth is a viable alternative for the provision of acute care to appropriately selected patients.","Lam, D.; Downie, C.; Zagora, S.; McCluskey, P.

METHODS: A survey was sent to 872 health professionals caring for women with EBC. Questions addressed most common GUS seen, experience treating GUS, and attitudes to treatment options. RESULTS: 144 surveys were completed. Respondent characteristics: median age 50 years; 76% female; 42% medical oncologists; 24% nurses; 20% breast surgeons; 8% radiation oncologists. Most (68%) reported prescribing endocrine therapies for EBC, 99% were aware endocrine therapies can cause GUS, and 55% reported ""often"" or ""always"" asking patients on endocrine therapy if they have GUS. Respondents thought vaginal dryness was the most bothersome symptom for their patients (66%), followed by dyspareunia (11%). 81% of respondents reported seeing women stop endocrine therapy prematurely due to GUS. Respondents reported receiving ""none"" (19%) or ""a little"" (46%) training or education in managing GUS and only 16% reported feeling ""very confident"" managing GUS. The proportions of respondents reporting ""often"" and ""very often"" recommending the following vaginal treatments were: lubricants (81%); moisturisers (68%); oestrogens (21%); and laser (3%). Vaginal oestrogens were considered ""safe"" or ""probably safe"" by 77% and 90% of respondents for women with hormone receptor positive and negative EBC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite health professionals frequently encountering GUS in women with EBC and seeing patients stop endocrine therapies prematurely, only 16% felt confident managing these symptoms. Education and training for health professionals are needed to better address this common problem.","Pearson, Antonia; Dhillon, Haryana M; Kiely, Belinda E",Breast cancer (Tokyo. 1994),,304

It is important to learn from this to inform mental healthcare during future crises. METHOD: A lexical analysis was conducted of clinician reflections during COVID-19 as they delivered psychiatry services to children and families in New South Wales (n = 6) and transitioned to e-mental health. RESULTS: E-mental health can extend the reach of, and access to psychiatry services, particularly for individuals disadvantaged by inequity. Yet e-mental health can be problematic. It is partly contingent on technological prowess, equipment, internet access as well as space and privacy. Relatedly, e-mental health can hinder clinician capacity to conduct examinations, monitor child development as well as assess risk and the need for child protection. CONCLUSIONS: Given the benefits and limitations of e-mental health, a model that supports face-to-face mental healthcare and e-mental health may be of value. This model would require practical, yet flexible policies and protocols that protect the privacy of children and families, safeguard them from harm, and respect the needs and preferences of children, families and clinicians.","Eapen, Valsamma; Dadich, Ann; Balachandran, Srilaxmi; Dani, Anitha; Howari, Rasha; Sequeria, Anupama Zeena; Singer, Joel D",Australas Psychiatry,,304
267543,Additional Concerns Regarding Children With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical respiratory support. Healthcare professionals are exposed to a particularly high risk of contracting the virus while providing resuscitation and respiratory support, which may in turn result in grave consequences and even death. Although COVID-19 has been shown to cause milder disease in children, paediatricians and intensivists who provide care for children must be prepared to provide optimal respiratory support without putting themselves or other medical, nursing, and paramedical staff at undue risk. We propose an airway management approach that is especially relevant in the current COVID-19 pandemic and provides instructions for: (1) Elective intubation for respiratory failure; and (2) Emergency intubation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. To minimise risk, intubation methods must be kept as straightforward as possible and should include the provision of appropriate personal protection and equipment to healthcare workers. We identify two key considerations: that bag-mask ventilation should be avoided if possible and that bacterial and viral filters should be placed in the respiratory circuit. Our novel approach provides a framework for airway management that could benefit paediatric critical care practitioners who provide care for any children with a novel viral illness, with a focus on infection prevention during high-risk airway management procedures.","Leung, K K Y; Ku, S W; Fung, R C M; Hui, W F; Au, C C; Cheung, W L; Szeto, W H; Wong, J C P; Kwan, K F; Hon, K L",Hong Kong med. j,,304

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of thrombotic events on COVID-19 patients. Methods. We systematically reviewed all the studies about thrombotic events on COVID-19 patients in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, MedRxiv, bioRxiv, from Dec 1, 2019 to July 5, 2020. The weighted mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for clinical data in COVID-19 patients with or without thrombotic events was calculated. Results 12 articles contained 1083 patients were included for meta-analysis. The prevalence of thrombosis was 22 % (95 % CI 0.08–0.40) in COVID-19 patients and increased to 43 % (95 % CI 0.29–0.65) after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Compared with non-thrombotic patients, thrombotic patients had higher levels of D-dimer (MD = 2.79 μg/ml, 95 % CI 2.27–3.31 μg/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (MD = 112.71 U/L, 95 % CI 62.40–163.02 U/L), and white blood cells (WBC) (MD = 1.14 *109/L, 95 % CI 0.47–1.81*109/L) while decreased lymphocytes (MD= -0.20*109/L, 95 % CI -0.38 – -0.02*109/L). Age, platelet counts, and male sex tended to be risks while diabetes tended to be a protection for thrombosis for COVID-19 patients, although no statistical difference was achieved. Finally, patients with thrombosis were at a higher risk of death (OR = 2.39, 95 % CI 1.36–4.20). Conclusions Prevalence of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients was high, especially in ICU, though pharmacologic thromboembolism prophylaxis was applied. Therefore, higher levels of D-dimer, LDH, WBC, and decreased lymphocytes needed to be paid close attention to in patients with COVID-19.","Xiong, Xiaoming Chi Jianhua Gao Qinglei",Thrombosis Journal,,304

269241,Corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19 disease,2020,"Proteomics studies allow for the determination of the identity, amount, and interactions of proteins under specific conditions that allow the biological state of an organism to ultimately change. These conditions can be either beneficial or detrimental. Diseases are due to detrimental changes caused by either protein overexpression or underexpression caused by as a result of a mutation or posttranslational modifications (PTM), among other factors. Identification of disease biomarkers through proteomics can be potentially used as clinical information for diagnostics. Common biomarkers to look for include PTM. For example, aberrant glycosylation of proteins is a common marker and will be a focus of interest in this review. A common way to analyze glycoproteins is by glycoproteomics involving mass spectrometry. Due to factors such as micro- and macroheterogeneity which result in a lower abundance of each version of a glycoprotein, it is difficult to obtain meaningful results unless rigorous sample preparation procedures are in place. Microheterogeneity represents the diversity of glycans at a single site, whereas macroheterogeneity depicts glycosylation levels at each site of a protein. Enrichment and derivatization of glycopeptides help to overcome these limitations. Over the time range of 2016 to 2020, several methods have been proposed in the literature and have contributed to drastically improve the outcome of glycosylation analysis, as presented in the sampling surveyed in this review. As a current topic in 2020, glycoproteins carried by pathogens can also cause disease and this is seen with SARS CoV2, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. This review will discuss glycoproteomic studies of the spike glycoprotein and interacting proteins such as the ACE2 receptor.","Pujic, Ivona; Perreault, Hélène",Mass spectrom. rev,,304

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between teachers’ self-efficacy as measured by TPACK and their perceived success and satisfaction for delivering online learning during the emergency COVID-19 school closures. A web-based survey was conducted of in-service K-12 teachers instructing remotely. While teachers felt competent in technology integration and felt successful with the remote instruction in Spring 2020, teachers were not always satisfied with their online experience. Furthermore, content area proved to be a factor in predicting both success and satisfaction with online instruction. Teachers with a stronger understanding of their content area and instructional strategies related to the content did not feel their students were successful nor did they feel satisfied with their work online. Results from this study suggests additional support is needed for teachers to bring their teaching to an online platform. School districts should invest in the support and resources needed to provide teachers with professional development specific to grade level and content.

We compare gender differences in distinct precarious forms of employment (PFEs) across a range of geographies, including national, provincial, census metropolitan areas, and urban/rural areas. We find that distinct spatial patterns and degree of gendered precariousness were evident within and across geographic spaces. Logit models further confirmed the robustness of gender differences in PFEs across space, revealing that PFEs were associated with gender, immigration status, age, type of economic family, education, income, and occupation. This study has implications for further understanding the causal factors at play in producing these uneven economic geographies. In terms of policy recommendations, this study calls for greater gender equity in social safety net policies, especially in the wake of the labor market shocks brought by the COVID‐19 pandemic.

292833,Antimicrobial consumption among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Pakistan,2021,"BACKGROUND: Patient travel history can be crucial in evaluating evolving infectious disease events. Such information can be challenging to acquire in electronic health records, as it is often available only in unstructured text. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of annotating and automatically extracting travel history mentions from unstructured clinical documents in the Department of Veterans Affairs across disparate health care facilities and among millions of patients. Information about travel exposure augments existing surveillance applications for increased preparedness in responding quickly to public health threats. METHODS: Clinical documents related to arboviral disease were annotated following selection using a semiautomated bootstrapping process. Using annotated instances as training data, models were developed to extract from unstructured clinical text any mention of affirmed travel locations outside of the continental United States. Automated text processing models were evaluated, involving machine learning and neural language models for extraction accuracy. RESULTS: Among 4584 annotated instances, 2659 (58%) contained an affirmed mention of travel history, while 347 (7.6%) were negated. Interannotator agreement resulted in a document-level Cohen kappa of 0.776. Automated text processing accuracy (F1 85.6, 95% CI 82.5-87.9) and computational burden were acceptable such that the system can provide a rapid screen for public health events. CONCLUSIONS: Automated extraction of patient travel history from clinical documents is feasible for enhanced passive surveillance public health systems. Without such a system, it would usually be necessary to manually review charts to identify recent travel or lack of travel, use an electronic health record that enforces travel history documentation, or ignore this potential source of information altogether. The development of this tool was initially motivated by emergent arboviral diseases. More recently, this system was used in the early phases of response to COVID-19 in the United States, although its utility was limited to a relatively brief window due to the rapid domestic spread of the virus. Such systems may aid future efforts to prevent and contain the spread of infectious diseases.","Peterson, Kelly S; Lewis, Julia; Patterson, Olga V; Chapman, Alec B; Denhalter, Daniel W; Lye, Patricia A; Stevens, Vanessa W; Gamage, Shantini D; Roselle, Gary A; Wallace, Katherine S; Jones, Makoto",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,304

However, most of the existing epidemiological models fail to capture this aspect by neither representing the sites visited by individuals explicitly nor characterizing disease transmission as a function of individual mobility patterns. In this work, we introduce a temporal point process modeling framework that specifically represents visits to the sites where individuals get in contact and infect each other. Under our model, the number of infections caused by an infectious individual naturally emerges to be overdispersed. Using an efficient sampling algorithm, we demonstrate how to apply Bayesian optimization with longitudinal case data to estimate the transmission rate of infectious individuals at the sites they visit and in their households. Simulations using fine-grained and publicly available demographic data and site locations from Bern, Switzerland showcase the flexibility of our framework. To facilitate research and analyses of other cities and regions, we release an open-source implementation of our framework.","Lorch, Lars; Kremer, Heiner; Trouleau, William; Tsirtsis, Stratis; Szanto, Aron; Scholkopf, Bernhard; Gomez-Rodriguez, Manuel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07641v5.pdf,304

306891,Pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome,2021,"With many employees returning to work after lockdowns and quarantines in the current COVID-19 pandemic, research that seeks to identify effective ways to help them regain focus at work is warranted. However, the small body of applied psychology literature on large-scale disruptive events has paid insufficient attention to this important topic. Further, different from acute events (e.g., disasters), the ongoing pandemic poses an additional challenge for organizations as they seek to effectively protect employees' job engagement from health and safety threats in the workplace. To address these gaps, we drew from job reattachment research and investigated it as an important antecedent of job engagement for employees returning to work. Moreover, we incorporated leader safety commitment as a moderator that can strengthen the effectiveness of job reattachment in enhancing job engagement. We further linked engagement to work withdrawal, use of personal protective equipment (e.g., wearing a mask), and task performance to underscore the downstream implications of job reattachment. To test our research model, we collected multiwave, multisource data from the original epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic-Wuhan, China-where many employees were returning to work. The results provide strong support for our model. In addition to extending research on large-scale disruptive events, the current study has important implications for organizations and employees in the COVID-19 pandemic.

In particular, the past decade has seen the emergence of a new paradigm: ""Positive Technology,"" the scientific and applied approach to the use of technology for improving the quality of our personal experience. In this article we discussed the potential of Positive Technology to augment and enhance the existing strategies for generating psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular different positive technologies-m-Health and smartphone apps, stand-alone and social virtual reality, video games, exergames, and social technologies-have the potential of enhancing different critical features of our personal experience-affective quality, engagement/actualization, and connectedness-that are challenged by the pandemic and its social and economic effects. In conclusion, although the focus of tackling the direct impact of COVID-19 is important, positive technologies can be extremely useful to reduce the psychological burden of the pandemic and to help individuals in flourishing even during difficult and complex times.","Riva, Giuseppe; Mantovani, Fabrizia; Wiederhold, Brenda K",Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw,,304

In recent times, the recycling of MSW has drawn attention as the process can add value through resources from the recovered waste materials and facilitates the process of circular economy. However, during the unprecedented coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the risk of infection with the highly contagious virus has proven detrimental to the continuation of MSW as a valuable resource. The volume of waste, especially household waste, is higher; face masks, PPE (personal protective equipment), and hazardous materials such as batteries and empty chlorine bottles are examples of extra waste that have arisen during the pandemic. Various countries have set up initiatives for MSW management, including safety measurements for employees in the MSW management sector. The use of disinfectant prior to sorting waste, as well as storing waste for 9 days, may help to inactivate the COVID-19 virus, ensuring an appropriate safety level for MSW management. This work aimed at studying different MSW management strategies, specific challenges, and possible solutions for better understanding for those involved in waste management, in addition to providing a possible management strategy during and post-COVID-19 pandemic.","Das, Atanu Kumar; Islam, Md Nazrul; Billah, Md Morsaline; Sarker, Asim",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

321784,Comorbidity and its Impact on Patients with COVID-19,2020,"Purpose: There is widespread accord among economists that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a severe negative impact on the global economy. Establishing new radiotherapy (RT) infrastructure may be significantly compromised in the post COVID-19 era. Alternative strategies are needed to improve the existing RT accessibility without significant cost escalation. The outcomes of these approaches on the RT availability has been examined for Asia. Methods and Materials: The details of RT infrastructures in 2020 for 51 countries in Asia were obtained from the Directory of Radiotherapy Centers of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Using the IAEA guidelines, the %RT accessibility and the additional requirements of teletherapy (TRT) units were computed for these countries. To maximize the utilization of the existing RT facilities, five options were evaluated, namely, hypofractionation RT (HFRT) alone, with/without 25% or 50% additional working hours. The impact of these strategies on the %RT access and additional TRT unit requirements to achieve 100% RT access were estimated. Results: 4617 TRT units are available in 46 countries. The mean %RT accessibility is 62.4% in 43 countries (TRT units =4491) where the information on cancer incidence was also available and these would need an additional 6474 TRT units for achieving 100% RT accessibility. By adopting HFRT alone, increasing the working hours by 25% alone, 25% with HFRT, 50% alone and 50% with HFRT; the %RT access could improve to 74.9%, 78%, 90.5%, 93.7% and 106.1% respectively. Correspondingly, the need for additional TRT units would progressively decrease to 4646, 4284, 3073, 2820 and 1958 units. Conclusion: The economic slowdown in the post Covid-19 period could severely impend establishment of new RT facilities. Thus, maximal utilization of the available RT infrastructure with minimum additional costs could be possible by adopting HFRT with or without increased working hours to improve the RT coverage.","Datta, Niloy R; Datta, Sneha; Samiei, Massoud",,,304

METHODS: To assess the causal impact of COVID-19 on psychological changes in China, we constructed a city-level panel data set based on the expressed sentiment in the contents of 13 million geotagged tweets on Sina Weibo, the Chinese largest microblog platform. RESULTS: Applying a difference-in-differences approach, we found a significant deterioration in mental health status after the occurrence of COVID-19. We also observed that this psychological effect faded out over time during our study period and was more pronounced among women, teenagers and older adults. The mental health impact was more likely to be observed in cities with low levels of initial mental health status, economic development, medical resources and social security. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may assist in the understanding of mental health impact of COVID-19 and yield useful insights into how to make effective psychological interventions in this kind of sudden public health event.","Zhu, Yongjian; Cao, Liqing; Xie, Jingui; Yu, Yugang; Chen, Anfan; Huang, Fengming",Psychol Med,,304

To better understand the persistence of immune response and the proportion of the population who can develop one, the authors assessed patterns of immunoglobulin G (IgG) positivity over time in individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or IgG at a large national reference laboratory. More than 2.4 million SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology (initiated April 21, 2020) and 6.6 million nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) (initiated March 9, 2020) results on persons from across the United States as of July 10, 2020 were analyzed. Additional IgG serology results through August 11, 2020 were used for one household analysis. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity was observed in 91% (19,434/21,452) of individuals tested after a positive NAAT result and in 10% (7,831/80,968) after a negative NAAT result. Factors associated with seropositivity include age, region of patient residence, and interval between NAAT and IgG serology. The probability of persistent IgG seropositivity declined from 98.6% after 1 week to 74.3% after 2 months, less so in individuals ages &#8805;55 years than in younger groups. Specimens within 2 days from pairs of same-household members showed 92% IgG antibody concordance. Household adults were more frequently IgG positive prior to household children testing positive (36% versus 8%). IgG serology testing can identify an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 that varies based on age, sex, and duration since exposure. Loss of detectable IgG seropositivity occurs, in some patients, over weeks or months. Adults may be infecting household children.","Kaufman, Harvey W; Chen, Zhen; Meyer, William A; Wohlgemuth, Jay G",Popul Health Manag,,304

338825,The immunological response among COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome,2021,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We describe how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected the economics of emergency department care (ED). METHODS: We conducted an observational study of 136 EDs from January 2019 to September 2020, using 2020-to-2019 3-week moving ratios for ED visits, complexity, revenue, and staffing expenses. We tabulated 2020-to-2019 staffing ratios and calculated hour and full-time-equivalent changes. RESULTS: Following the COVID-19 pandemic's onset, geriatric (age &#8805;65), adult (age 18 to 64), and pediatric (age <18) ED visits declined by 43%, 40%, and 73%, respectively, compared to 2019 visits and rose thereafter but remained below 2019 levels through September. Relative value units per visit rose by 8%, 9%, and 18%, respectively, compared to 2019, while ED admission rates rose by 32%. Both fell subsequently but remained above 2019 levels through September. Revenues dropped sharply early in the pandemic and rose gradually but remained below 2019 levels. In medium and large EDs, staffing and expenses were lowered with a lag, largely compensating for lower revenue at these sites, and barely at freestanding EDs. Staffing and expense reductions could not match revenue losses in smaller EDs. During the pandemic, emergency physician and advanced practice provider clinical hours and compensation fell 15% and 27%, respectively, corresponding to 174 lost physician and 193 lost advanced practice provider full-time-equivalent positions. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the economics of ED care, with large drops in overall and, in particular, low-acuity ED visits, necessitating reductions in clinical hours. Staffing cutbacks could not match reduced revenue at small EDs with minimum emergency physician coverage requirements.","Pines, Jesse M; Zocchi, Mark S; Black, Bernard S; Kornas, Rebecca; Celedon, Pablo; Moghtaderi, Ali; Venkat, Arvind",Ann. emerg. med,,304

Does the effect of the famine persist today? To explore this question, we combine historical data on province-level famine exposure with contemporary data on individual wealth. To better understand if the relationship is causal, we simultaneously account for the well-known historical evidence on the selection effect arising for those who survive the famine and those born during this period, as well as the issue of endogeneity on the exposure of a province to the famine. We find robust evidence showing that famine exposure has had a considerable negative effect on the contemporary wealth of individuals born during this period. Together, the evidence suggests that the famine had an adverse effect on wealth, and it is even present among the wealthiest cohort of individuals in present-day China.","Sur, Pramod Kumar; Sasaki, Masaru",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00935v2.pdf,304
347849,Cancer or COVID-19? A Review of Guidelines for Safe Cancer Care in the Wake of the Pandemic,2020,"The high SARS-CoV-2 reproductive number driving the COVID-19 pandemic has been a mystery. Our recent in vitro, and in vivo coronaviral pathogenesis studies involving Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV-A59) suggest a crucial role for a small host membrane-virus contact initiator region of the Spike protein, called the fusion peptide that enhances the virus fusogenicity and infectivity. Here I study the Spike from five human ß-coronaviruses (HCoV) including the SARS-CoV-2, and MHV-A59 for comparison. The structural and dynamics analyses of the Spike show that its fusion loop spatially organizes three fusion peptides contiguous to each other to synergistically trigger the virus-host membrane fusion process. I propose a Contact Initiation Model based on the architecture of the Spike quaternary structure that explains the obligatory participation of the fusion loop in the initiation of the host membrane contact for the virus fusion process. Among all the HCoV Spikes in this study, SARS-CoV-2 has the most hydrophobic surface and the extent of hydrophobicity correlates with the reproductive number and infectivity of the other HCoV. Comparison between results from standard and replica exchange molecular dynamics reveal the unique physicochemical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The priming of the Spike by its cleavage and subsequent fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread. The importance of the fusion loop makes it an apt target for anti-virals and vaccine candidates.","Pal, Debnath",J Struct Biol,,304

LID - e8188,2020,"The infection by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease called COVID-19, mainly causes alterations in the respiratory system. In severely ill patients, the disease often evolves into an acute respiratory distress syndrome that can predispose patients to a state of hypercoagulability, with thrombosis at both venous and arterial levels. This predisposition presents a multifactorial physiopathology, related to hypoxia as well as to the severe inflammatory process linked to this pathology, including the additional thrombotic factors present in many of the patients. In view of the need to optimise the management of hypercoagulability, the working groups of the Scientific Societies of Anaesthesiology-Resuscitation and Pain Therapy (SEDAR) and of Intensive, Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC) have developed a consensus to establish guidelines for actions to be taken against alterations in haemostasis observed in severely ill patients with COVID-19. These recommendations include prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in these patients, and in the peripartum, management of patients on long-term antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment, bleeding complications in the course of the disease, and the interpretation of general alterations in haemostasis.","Llau, J V; Ferrandis, R; Sierra, P; Hidalgo, F; Cassinello, C; Gómez-Luque, A; Quintana, M; Amezaga, R; Gero, M; Serrano, A; Marcos, P",Rev. esp. anestesiol. reanim,,304

The COVID-19 pandemic has witnessed so much international help across national borders. Inspired by research on IWAH, we examined whether IWAH was associated with adolescents' sympathy for people in COVID-19 affected countries, which was further related to their willingness to help. The moderating role of conscientiousness on this indirect association was also examined. Eight hundred and fifty four students were recruited as participants. Data were obtained with adolescents reporting on their IWAH, sympathy for and willingness to help people in COVID-19 affected countries. The results indicated that IWAH was both directly and indirectly associated with their willingness to help people in COVID-19 affected countries via sympathy for them. Adolescents' conscientiousness moderated the indirect relation of adolescents' IWAH with their willingness to help via sympathy for people in COVID-19 affected countries. Specifically, for adolescents high in conscientiousness, IWAH was more strongly associated with willingness to give help.

358433,Do No Harm: Reaffirming the Value of Evidence and Equipoise While Minimizing Cognitive Bias in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Era,2020,"Purpose: To determine the prevalence and spectrum of incidental findings (IFs) identified in patients undergoing chest CT as a primary triage tool for COVID-19. Methods: In this study 232 patients were triaged in our COVID-19 Screening Unit by means of a chest CT (March 25 - April 23, 2020). Original radiology reports were evaluated retrospectively for the description of IFs, which were defined as any finding in the report not related to the purpose of the scan. Documented IFs were categorized according to clinical relevance into minor and potentially significant IFs and according to anatomical location into pulmonary, mediastinal, cardiovascular, breast, upper abdominal and skeletal categories. IFs were reported as frequencies and percentages; descriptive statistics were used. Results: In total 197 IFs were detected in 126 patients (54% of the participants). Patients with IFs were on average older (54.0 years old, SD 16.6) than patients without IFs (44.8 years old, SD 14.6, P < 0.05). In total 60 potentially significant IFs were detected in 53 patients (23% of the participants). Most often reported were coronary artery calcifications (n = 23, 38% of total potentially significant IFs/ 10% of the total study population), suspicious breast nodules (n = 8, 14% of total potentially significant IFs/ 3% of the total study population) and pulmonary nodules (n = 7, 12% of total potentially significant IFs/ 3% of the total study population). Conclusion: A considerable number of IFs were detected by using chest CT as a primary triage tool for COVID-19, of which a substantial percentage (23%) is potentially clinically relevant.","Kilsdonk, Iris D; de Roos, Marlise P; Bresser, Paul; Reesink, Herre J; Peringa, Jan",Eur J Radiol Open,,304
363313,Predictive factors of mortality in patients treated with tocilizumab for acute respiratory distress syndrome related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"This study investigated 8-month-old infants' perception of object permanence in an extension of the rotating screen studies by Baillargeon (1987) and Baillargeon, Spelke, and Wasserman (1985). Using computer-animated stimuli similar to the ""live"" stimuli used by Baillargeon and her colleagues (Baillargeon, 1987; Baillargeon et al., 1985), 48 8-month-old infants were habituated to 1 of 4 computer-animated events and then tested on all 4 events. The events involved a screen that rotated in either a 180° or 120° arc*** and a block that either was sitting in the path of the rotating screen or absent from the event. The results provided no evidence that infants responded on the basis of the possibility or impossibility of the events as claimed by Baillargeon and her colleagues, but instead indicated that the infants responded on the basis of perceptual novelty. These results are consistent with the findings of Schilling (this issue) and Bogartz, Shinskey, and Schilling (this issue). Taken together, along with the findings of Rivera, Wakeley, and Langer (1999), these more recent findings suggest that Baillargeon's (1987; Baillargeon et al., 1985) results should not be interpreted as definitive evidence of object permanence in very young infants.","Cashon, Cara H; Cohen, Leslie B",Infancy,,304
364288,Management of Traumatic Spinal Fracture in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Situation,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can spread rapidly within skilled nursing facilities. After identification of a case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility, we assessed transmission and evaluated the adequacy of symptom-based screening to identify infections in residents. METHODS: We conducted two serial point-prevalence surveys, 1 week apart, in which assenting residents of the facility underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, including real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing. Symptoms that had been present during the preceding 14 days were recorded. Asymptomatic residents who tested positive were reassessed 7 days later. Residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), symptomatic with only atypical symptoms, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic. RESULTS: Twenty-three days after the first positive test result in a resident at this skilled nursing facility, 57 of 89 residents (64%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 76 residents who participated in point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) tested positive. Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days). Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents. As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%). Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility. More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission. Infection-control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility.","Arons, Melissa M; Hatfield, Kelly M; Reddy, Sujan C; Kimball, Anne; James, Allison; Jacobs, Jesica R; Taylor, Joanne; Spicer, Kevin; Bardossy, Ana C; Oakley, Lisa P; Tanwar, Sukarma; Dyal, Jonathan W; Harney, Josh; Chisty, Zeshan; Bell, Jeneita M; Methner, Mark; Paul, Prabasaj; Carlson, Christina M; McLaughlin, Heather P; Thornburg, Natalie; Tong, Suxiang; Tamin, Azaibi; Tao, Ying; Uehara, Anna; Harcourt, Jennifer; Clark, Shauna; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Page, Libby C; Kay, Meagan; Lewis, James; Montgomery, Patty; Stone, Nimalie D; Clark, Thomas A; Honein, Margaret A; Duchin, Jeffrey S; Jernigan, John A",N Engl J Med,,304

In this study, we present a retrospective study of 133 hospitalized confirmed mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, including 116 patients with COVID-19 with negative serum hepatitis B antigen and 17 HBV inactive carriers with COVID-19. We found that there were no significant differences for the discharge rate or duration of hospitalization between the two groups. However, inactive HBV carriers with SARS-CoV-2 co-infection are at a higher risk of abnormal liver function tests. The enhanced liver injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 and HBV co-infection was identified as the hepatocyte type rather than the cholangiocyte type. Moreover, the inflammatory response, including abnormal lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and interleukin-6 production, may contribute to this injury following SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. Collectively, SARS-CoV-2 and HBV co-infection exacerbates liver function of the patients with COVID-19.","Lin, Yong; Yuan, Jun; Long, Quanxin; Hu, Jieli; Deng, Haijun; Zhao, Zhenyu; Chen, Juan; Lu, Mengji; Huang, Ailong",,,304

We performed an in-depth genetic analysis of chromosome 21 exploiting the genome-wide association study data, including 6,406 individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 and 902,088 controls with European genetic ancestry from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. We found that five single nucleotide polymorphisms within TMPRSS2 and near MX1 gene show associations with severe COVID-19. The minor alleles of the five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) correlated with a reduced risk of developing severe COVID-19 and high level of MX1 expression in blood. Our findings demonstrate that host genetic factors can influence the different clinical presentations of COVID-19 and that MX1 could be a potential therapeutic target.","Andolfo, Immacolata; Russo, Roberta; Lasorsa, Vito Alessandro; Cantalupo, Sueva; Rosato, Barbara Eleni; Bonfiglio, Ferdinando; Frisso, Giulia; Abete, Pasquale; Cassese, Gian Marco; Servillo, Giuseppe; Esposito, Gabriella; Gentile, Ivan; Piscopo, Carmelo; Villani, Romolo; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Cerino, Pellegrino; Buonerba, Carlo; Pierri, Biancamaria; Zollo, Massimo; Iolascon, Achille; Capasso, Mario",iScience,,304

Thus, it is important to resolve reports in the literature which present conflicting data on vaccine safety. We performed a prospective study of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinations administered at the Albany Community Vaccination Center. All potential vaccinees to the site were screened for allergic history prior to triage by a board-certified allergist. In the first 14 days of operation, our site vaccinated 14,655 individuals, 3.9% of which had a personal history of anaphylaxis. While some vaccine recipients had non-allergic complications, none of the visitors suffered any objective, immediate allergic symptoms. Our findings indicate that specialist-confirmed rates of immediate allergic reaction to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are far lower than self-reported rates defined by subjective, unconfirmed symptoms.","Myles, Ian A; Vinciguerra, Joshua S; Premus, Robert T",Vaccine,,304
387172,Multiple fatalities in a family cluster of COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome,2020,"Oxygen therapy has been widely used in clinical practice, especially in anesthesia and emergency medicine. However, the risks of hyperoxemia caused by excessive O2 supply have not been sufficiently appreciated. Because nasal inhalation is mostly used for oxygen therapy, the pulmonary capillaries are often the first to be damaged by hyperoxia, causing many serious consequences. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which hyperoxia injures pulmonary capillary endothelial cells (LMECs) has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we systematically investigated these issues using next-generation sequencing and functional research techniques by focusing on non-coding RNAs. Our results showed that hyperoxia significantly induced apoptosis and profoundly affected the transcriptome profiles of LMECs. Hyperoxia significantly up-regulated miR-181c-5p expression, while down-regulated the expressions of NCAPG and lncRNA-DLEU2 in LMECs. Moreover, LncRNA-DLEU2 could bind complementarily to miR-181c-5p and acted as a miRNA sponge to block the inhibitory effect of miR-181c-5p on its target gene NCAPG. The down-regulation of lncRNA-DLEU2 induced by hyperoxia abrogated its inhibition of miR-181c-5p function, which together with the hyperoxia-induced upregulation of miR-181c-5p, all these significantly decreased the expression of NCAPG, resulting in apoptosis of LMECs. Our results demonstrated a ceRNA network consisting of lncRNA-DLEU2, miR-181c-5p and NCAPG, which played an important role in hyperoxia-induced apoptosis of vascular endothelial injury. Our findings will contribute to the full understanding of the harmful effects of hyperoxia and to find ways for effectively mitigating its deleterious effects.","Wu, Jizhi; Zhang, Guangqi; Xiong, Hui; Zhang, Yuguang; Ding, Gang; Ge, Junfeng",Sci Rep,,304

In order to avoid essentialization, the article addresses the question of the public health system, which mirrors Romania’s low capacity state. The article argues that, due to a dearth of resources, the public health system has had a hard time implementing the ‘test, trace, isolate strategy’. States that have effectively implemented such a strategy have been successful in their attempt to curb the community spread of coronavirus. Also, the article seeks to demonstrate that even in a low capacity state, one may run into ‘pockets of efficiency’, that is, public institutions where quality management coexists with neopatrimonial practices. In order to illuminate the existence of such ‘pockets of efficiency’, the article makes a comparison between public hospitals turned into COVID-19 hotspots by poor management. And public hospitals where sound management has kept the SARS-CoV-2 virus at bay. Considering that informality usually takes precedence over formality in low capacity states, the article seeks to find an explanation for the occurrence of ‘pockets of efficiency’ in a prevalent neopatrimonial milieu.

404542,A vicious circle between oxidative stress and cytokine storm in acute respiratory distress syndrome pathogenesis at covid-19 infection,2021,"Fake news or misinformation is the information or stories intentionally created to deceive or mislead the readers. Nowadays, social media platforms have become the ripe grounds for misinformation, spreading them in a few minutes, which led to chaos, panic, and potential health hazards among people. The rapid dissemination and a prolific rise in the spread of fake news and misinformation create the most time-critical challenges for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. Relevant literature reveals that the presence of an element of surprise in the story is a strong driving force for the rapid dissemination of misinformation, which attracts immediate attention and invokes strong emotional stimulus in the reader. False stories or fake information are written to arouse interest and activate the emotions of people to spread it. Thus, false stories have a higher level of novelty and emotional content than true stories. Hence, Novelty of the news item and recognizing the Emotional state of the reader after reading the item seems two key tasks to tightly couple with misinformation Detection. Previous literature did not explore misinformation detection with mutual learning for novelty detection and emotion recognition to the best of our knowledge. Our current work argues that joint learning of novelty and emotion from the target text makes a strong case for misinformation detection. In this paper, we propose a deep multitask learning framework that jointly performs novelty detection, emotion recognition, and misinformation detection. Our deep multitask model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for fake news detection on four benchmark datasets, viz. ByteDance, FNC, Covid-Stance and FNID with 7.73%, 3.69%, 7.95% and 13.38% accuracy gain, respectively. The evaluation shows that our multitask learning framework improves the performance over the single-task framework for four datasets with 7.8%, 28.62%, 11.46%, and 15.66% overall accuracy gain. We claim that textual novelty and emotion are the two key aspects to consider while developing an automatic fake news detection mechanism.

In the absence of a vaccine, a small number of countries have managed to control the diffusion of viruses by early detection and early quarantine. South Korea, one of the countries which have kept the epidemics well-controlled, has opened the infected patients' trajectory to the public. Such a reaction has been regarded as an effective method, however, serious privacy breach cases have been issued in South Korea. Furthermore, some suspected contacts have refused to take infection tests because they are afraid of being exposed. To solve this problem, we propose a privacy-preserving contact tracing method based on spatio-temporal trajectory which can be practically used in many quarantine systems. In addition, we develop a system to visualize the contact tracing workflow.","Kim, Wooil; Lee, Hyubjin; Chung, Yon Dohn",PLoS One,,304

As of the same date, Italy represents the third country worldwide in total number of cases and the first one in total number of deaths. The purpose of this study is to analyse the Italian case and identify key problem questions and lessons learned from the Italian experience. The study initially provides a general overview of the country's characteristics and health care system, followed by a detailed description of the Italian epidemiological picture regarding COVID-19. Afterwards, all non-pharmaceutical measures adopted by the Government against COVID-19 are presented in chronological order. The study explores some estimations of the economic impact of the epidemic, as well as its implications for society, lifestyle, and social media reactions. Finally, the study refers to two types of mathematical models to predict the evolution of the spread of COVID-19 disease. Having considered all of the above-mentioned aspects, some significant issues can be raised, including the following: (1) the available epidemiological data presents some gaps and potential biases; (2) mathematical models always come with high levels of uncertainty; (3) the high number of deaths should be interpreted in light of the national demographic context; and (4) the long-term management of the epidemic remains an open question. In conclusion, the Italian experience definitely highlights the importance of preparedness and early action, effective interventions and risk communication.","Ortenzi, Flaminia; Albanese, Emiliano; Fadda, Marta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,304

Design/methodology/approach: Based on consumer spending data, the authors identify patterns of consumption displacement for the hospitality and retail sectors as defined by ANZSIC. We answer where, when, how, what and why consumption displacement happens. Findings: The findings provide evidence of spatial and temporal displacement of consumption based on consumer spending patterns. Evidence of increased spending in some consumption categories confirms stockpiling behaviours. The hospitality sector experiences a sharp decline in consumer spending over lockdown. Originality/value: Given the lack of studies analysing the impacts of crises and disasters on the services sector and consumption displacement, this study provides evidence of different forms of consumption displacement related to COVID-19.","Hall, Michael C.; Prayag, Girish; Fieger, Peter; Dyason, David",J.

In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, app developers have joined the response effort in various ways by releasing apps that target different user bases (e.g., all citizens or journalists), offer different services (e.g., location tracking or diagnostic-aid), provide generic or specialized information, etc. While many apps have raised some concerns by spreading misinformation or even malware, the literature does not yet provide a clear landscape of the different apps that were developed. In this study, we focus on the Android ecosystem and investigate Covid-related Android apps. In a best-effort scenario, we attempt to systematically identify all relevant apps and study their characteristics with the objective to provide a first taxonomy of Covid-related apps, broadening the relevance beyond the implementation of contact tracing. Overall, our study yields a number of empirical insights that contribute to enlarge the knowledge on Covid-related apps: (1) Developer communities contributed rapidly to the Covid-19, with apps released as early as February 2020; (2) Covid-related apps deliver digital tools to users (e.g., health diaries), serve to broadcast information to users (e.g., spread statistics), and collect data from users (e.g., for tracing); (3) Covid-related apps are less complex than standard apps; (4) they generally do not seem to leak sensitive data; (5) in the majority of cases, Covid-related apps are released by entities with past experience on the market, mostly official government entities or public health organizations.","Samhi, Jordan; Allix, Kevin; Bissyand'e, Tegawend'e F.; Klein, Jacques",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11002v1.pdf,304

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, an online-based anonymous survey was conducted within the Convention of University Professors of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery in Germany from April 3 to April 11, 2020. A bipolar 5-point Likert scale (with possible responses of ""totally disagree,"" ""rather disagree,"" ""neutral,"" ""rather agree,"" and ""totally agree"") was applied. Fifty-two (69.3%) of 75 clinic directors participated. RESULTS: Communication and cooperation with the government, hospital administration, and other departments during the COVID-19 pandemic were mainly perceived as appropriate. However, only 7 respondents (13.7%) totally agreed or rather agreed with the statement that the authorities are supporters of orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments. Substantial financial and personnel changes in orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments of university hospitals were reported, resulting in an average reduction of 49.4% in operating room capacity and an expected 29.3% loss of revenue. In addition, 14.7% of physicians were reallocated from orthopaedic and trauma surgery to other care-delivery environments. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments in German university hospitals. Distinct structural and financial effects were noted. Nevertheless, the present study demonstrates the commitment of our specialty to overcome the pandemic by providing competent personnel as well as close cooperation with the hospital administration and other departments. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first Germany-wide survey among the heads of orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments in university hospitals on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey results may help to inform system-wide decision-making in Germany, in Europe, and beyond.","Haffer, Henryk; Schömig, Friederike; Rickert, Markus; Randau, Thomas; Raschke, Michael; Wirtz, Dieter; Pumberger, Matthias; Perka, Carsten",J Bone Joint Surg Am,,304

443451,[Challenges of schistosomiasis control in China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic],2020,"Background: Breast reconstruction has a well-documented positive impact on the psychosocial well-being of women recovering from breast cancer. Rates of breast cancer diagnoses are rising, and more women are seeking mastectomy as treatment and as prophylaxis. Methods: Postmastectomy breast reconstruction often begins at the time of mastectomy in coordination with the oncologic breast surgeons. Immediate breast reconstruction increases complication rate (11% vs 4%) and unplanned reoperation rate (7% vs 4%), requiring more personnel and resources used during the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of patient care. Discussion: In the setting of global pandemics such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), breast reconstruction demands a unique and nuanced approach, as most forms of breast reconstruction can occur successfully in a delayed fashion. While this may prolong the overall time until completion of reconstruction, other factors come into play in the setting of a communicable (potentially deadly) illness. Factors that must be considered include allocation of essential resources and protection of patients and families from disease transmission. Conclusions: Plastic surgeons performing breast reconstruction must take these factors into account when counseling their patients, colleagues, and institutions and be proactive in determining which procedures are time-critical and which should be postponed until the disaster situation has relieved.","Chetta, Matthew D; Schoenbrunner, Anna R; Lee, Clara N",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,,304
445877,Mean Platelet Volume Predicts Severe COVID-19 Illness,2021,"The use of oxidative stress generated by Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) in oncology is being recently studied as a novel potential anti-cancer therapy. However, the beneficial effects of CAP for treating osteosarcoma have mostly been demonstrated in 2-dimensional cultures of cells, which do not mimic the complexity of the 3-dimensional (3D) bone microenvironment. In order to evaluate the effects of CAP in a relevant context of the human disease, we developed a 3D tissue-engineered model of osteosarcoma using a bone-like scaffold made of collagen type I and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. Human osteosarcoma cells cultured within the scaffold showed a high capacity to infiltrate and proliferate and to exhibit osteomimicry in vitro. As expected, we observed significantly different functional behaviors between monolayer and 3D cultures when treated with Cold Plasma-Activated Ringer's Solution (PAR). Our data reveal that the 3D environment not only protects cells from PAR-induced lethality by scavenging and diminishing the amount of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generated by CAP, but also favours the stemness phenotype of osteosarcoma cells. This is the first study that demonstrates the negative effect of PAR on cancer stem-like cell subpopulations in a 3D biomimetic model of cancer. These findings will allow to suitably re-focus research on plasma-based therapies in future.","Tornín, Juan; Villasante, Aranzazu; Solé-Martí, Xavi; Ginebra, Maria-Pau; Canal, Cristina",Free Radic Biol Med,,304

However, there is a limited understanding of suicide among individuals with positive/suspected COVID diagnosis specifically. Hence, this study, using online newspaper reports, aimed to determine factors influencing suicide among individuals withCOVID-19 infection status. METHODOLOGY: Information regarding positive/suspected COVID related suicide was obtained from online newspapers published in 4 languages between 30th Jan 2020 to 16th August 2020 using google news aggregator. Of 235 online identified, 93 were eligible for analysis after the exclusion and analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Median Age of COVID related suicide victims was 45 years (range 15 - 80) wherein 61.3% belonged to 30-59 year age group, and 75.3% were males. 50% of suicides occurred within the first week of COVID diagnosis confirmation, and 50% suicides occurred at COVID centres. Hanging (53.8%) was the commonest method of suicide, followed by jumping (12.9%). CONCLUSION: Higher risk for suicide was observed among male gender and those with positive/suspected COVID infection within the first week, while receiving treatment in COVID care centres. Hanging and jumping were the two commonest methods. The above highlight an urgent need to integrate suicide preventive strategies into standard care protocols of COVID-19 positive and suspected cases.","Sripad, Madhumitha Nanditale; Pantoji, Makarand; Gowda, Guru S; Ganjekar, Sundarnag; Reddi, Venkata Senthil Kumar; Math, Suresh Bada",Psychiatry Res,,304

This study investigates the dynamics of an SIR type model which accounts for human tendency to avoid infection while also maintaining preexisting, interpersonal relationships. Specifically, we use a network model in which individuals probabilistically deactivate connections to infected individuals and later reconnect to the same individuals upon recovery. To analyze this network model, a mean field approximation consisting of a system of fourteen ordinary differential equations for the number of nodes and edges is developed. This system of equations is closed using a moment closure approximation for the number of triple links. By analyzing the differential equations, it is shown that, in addition to force of infection and recovery rate, the probability of deactivating edges and the average node degree of the underlying network determine if an epidemic occurs.","Scanlon, Hannah; Gemmer, John",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10940v1.pdf,304

This article explores the factors associated with an increase in domestic violence incidents during COVID-19 by applying routine activity theory (RAT) framework. Data were drawn from the incidents of domestic violence reported in newspapers. Data was analyzed using content analysis and three major themes, i.e., three principle components of RAT-motivated offender, suitable target, and absence of capable guardian-were drawn. Findings reveal that sources of motivation in domestic violence perpetrators during the lockdown were alcohol and unemployment. The symbolic value that perpetrators associated with women, lower inertia, visibility, and accessibility to the perpetrators made women suitable targets of domestic violence. Lastly, shortage of police force and travel restrictions on formal and informal sources resulted in the absence of capable guardians. We conclude that changes in the routine activities of people during the COVID-19 lockdown provided more opportunities to the perpetrators of domestic violence.","Krishnakumar, Akshaya; Verma, Shankey",Asian J Criminol,,304

Because of the elements of the perfect storm, nursing homes are like a tinderbox, and it only takes one person to start a fire that could cause many deaths in a single facility. Several public health interventions and health policy strategies, adequate resources, and focused clinical quality improvement initiatives can help calm the storm.

Nevertheless, it is preventable through vaccination. Concerning the paediatric population, the recommendation of influenza vaccination is under-represented in many European countries. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal childhood vaccination against influenza in Europe. AREAS COVERED: : We conducted a systematic review of original article assessing the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination by searching PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases for studies in English, starting from January 1st, 2010 up to October 21st, 2020. EXPERT OPINION: Our literature review showed that all studies identified highlight that paediatric vaccinations using a live vaccine, especially in the quadrivalent formulation, are cost-effective compared to current vaccinations (elderly and at-risk groups) with TIV or no vaccination. A significant contribution to this positive economic profile is due to the indirect protection. Already many clinical data report the relevant direct and indirect impact of vaccination against influenza for younger subjects. The recent studies collected in this review showed also that the paediatric vaccination is also cost-effective. Therefore, decision-makers should now consider this new favourable evidence.","Boccalini, Sara; Bechini, Angela; Moscadelli, Andrea; Paoli, Sonia; Schirripa, Annamaria; Bonanni, Paolo",Expert rev. pharmacoecon. outcomes res,,304

474537,Frequent convulsive seizures in an adult patient with covid-19: A case report,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has resulted in widespread training disruption in many sports. Some athletes have access to facilities and equipment, while others have limited or no access, severely limiting their training practices. A primary concern is that the maintenance of key physical qualities (e. g. strength, power, high-speed running ability, acceleration, deceleration and change of direction), game-specific contact skills (e. g. tackling) and decision-making ability, are challenged, impacting performance and injury risk on resumption of training and competition. In extended periods of reduced training, without targeted intervention, changes in body composition and function can be profound. However, there are strategies that can dramatically mitigate potential losses, including resistance training to failure with lighter loads, plyometric training, exposure to high-speed running to ensure appropriate hamstring conditioning, and nutritional intervention. Athletes may require psychological support given the challenges associated with isolation and a change in regular training routine. While training restrictions may result in a decrease in some physical and psychological qualities, athletes can return in a positive state following an enforced period of rest and recovery. On return to training, the focus should be on progression of all aspects of training, taking into account the status of individual athletes.","Stokes, Keith A; Jones, Ben; Bennett, Mark; Close, Graeme L; Gill, Nicholas; Hull, James H; Kasper, Andreas M; Kemp, Simon P T; Mellalieu, Stephen D; Peirce, Nicholas; Stewart, Bob; Wall, Benjamin T; West, Stephen W; Cross, Matthew",Int. j. sports med,,304

478728,Using lung ultrasound changes to evaluate the response of recruitment maneuver in a patient recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 with acute respiratory distress syndrome,2020,"BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections are responsible for potentially significant transmission of COVID-19. Worldwide, a number of studies were conducted to estimate the magnitude of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. However, there is a need for more robust and well-designed studies to have a relevant public health intervention. Synthesis of the available studies significantly strengthens the quality of evidences for public health practice. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the overall magnitude of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course of infection using available evidences. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA checklist to present this study. Two experienced review authors (MA and DBK) were systematically searched international electronic databases for studies. We performed meta-analysis using R statistical software. The overall weighted proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course infection was computed. The pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals were presented using forest plot. Egger's tests were used to assess publication bias, and primary estimates were pooled using a random effects model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assure the robustness of the result. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Consequently, in the meta-analysis, a total of 6,071 COVID-19 cases were included. The proportion of asymptomatic infections among the included studies ranged from 1.4% to 78.3%. The findings of this meta-analysis showed that the weighted pooled proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course of infection was 25% (95%CI: 16-38). The leave-one out result also revealed that the weighted pooled average of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 28% and 31.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, one-fourth of SARS-CoV-2 infections are remained asymptomatic throughout the course infection. Scale-up of testing, which targeting high risk populations is recommended to tackle the pandemic.","Alene, Muluneh; Yismaw, Leltework; Assemie, Moges Agazhe; Ketema, Daniel Bekele; Mengist, Belayneh; Kassie, Bekalu; Birhan, Tilahun Yemanu",PLoS One,,304

481878,Identifying Clinical Phenotypes in Moderate to Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Related to COVID-19: The COVADIS Study,2021,"Growing human activity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) is driving increasing impacts on the biodiversity of this vast area of the ocean. As a result, the United Nations General Assembly committed to convening a series of intergovernmental conferences (IGCs) to develop an international legally-binding instrument (ILBI) for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of ABNJ [the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) agreement] under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The BBNJ agreement includes consideration of marine genetic resources (MGR) in ABNJ, including how to share benefits and promote marine scientific research whilst building capacity of developing states in science and technology. Three IGCs have been completed to date with the fourth delayed by the Covid pandemic. This delay has allowed a series of informal dialogues to take place between state parties, which have highlighted a number of areas related to MGR and benefit sharing that require technical guidance from ocean experts. These include: guiding principles on the access and use of MGR from ABNJ;the sharing of knowledge arising from research on MGR in ABNJ;and capacity building and technology transfer for developing states. In this paper, we explain what MGR are, the methods required to collect, study and archive them, including data arising from scientific investigation. We also explore the practical requirements of access by developing countries to scientific cruises, including the sharing of data, as well as participation in research and development on shore whilst promoting rather than hindering marine scientific research. We outline existing infrastructure and shared resources that facilitate access, research, development, and benefit sharing of MGR from ABNJ;and discuss existing gaps. We examine international capacity development and technology transfer schemes that might facilitate or complement non-monetary benefit sharing activities. We end the paper by highlighting what the ILBI can achieve in terms of access, utilization, and benefit sharing of MGR and how we might future-proof the BBNJ Agreement with respect to developments in science and technology. © Copyright © 2021 Rogers, Baco, Escobar-Briones, Gjerde, Gobin, Jaspars, Levin, Linse, Rabone, Ramirez-Llodra, Sellanes, Shank, Sink, Snelgrove, Taylor, Wagner and Harden-Davies.","Rogers, A.

482420,Multiple potential targets of opioids in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19,2020,"This article considers the potential for the COVID-19 pandemic to represent an epochal moment in international politics, one which China can use as a window to maximize its international order-building efforts. It is argued that China’s putative international order-building efforts to date have faltered, in part, due to an inability to create meaningful friendships with prominent international powers. However, the COVID-19 pandemic allows China to play a key humanitarian role in heavily afflicted countries and, through this, perhaps an opportunity to forge more meaningful friendships. It is argued that China is trying to attach its concept of friendship to its humanitarian assistance while also stepping into the clear international leadership void that exists at the moment. This is not without faults or missteps, but the lasting impact could be significant for international politics and the global order.","Smith, Nicholas Ross; Fallon, Tracey",World Aff.,,304

Initially, this conference was planned to be held in Thailand. Later on, due to the covid-19 pandemic situation and travel restrictions imposed by various Governments, the options available was to either postpone, cancel or conduct in virtual mode. Postponement was too unsure, since it’s not clear when normalcy will be restored, conducive for physical conference. Cancellation of the conference will upset and disappoint people who have contributed to the conference. Hence the committee decided to go for online mode on the same dates as planned earlier. The organizers hosted the conference from Chennai, India. By meeting virtually, the conference incorporated 8 SDGs – SDG 3,4,5,6,8,10,16,17. This conference and these proceedings are a unique opportunity for sharing ideas and achievements, discoveries and innovation for growing together our knowledge and contribute to expand the knowledge of humanity. The technological areas addressed in this meeting is in response to United Nations call of action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. The conference covers topics on the interdisciplinary areas of agriculture and food security, biodiversity conservation, circular economy, cities and urbanisation, climate change in holistic context, development, economy, ecosystem services, ecological protection, education, energy, environmental development, environmental law, finance, gender equality, green infrastructure, health and environment, human population, industrialization, innovation, land cover and land use change, natural capital, natural resources conservation and management, pollution, poverty, social and cultural, supply chain, waste, water–energy–food and water-soil-waste connections and others, all as related to sustainability. We received 52 papers and after peer review 17 papers were accepted and presented in this conference. The papers were evaluated on the basis of completeness, relevance to the conference, originality, sufficiently novel, technical quality, structure and presentation of the paper and adequate references to previous work. Every paper was reviewed by at least 2 reviewers and the review comments were shared with the authors for incorporating the suggestions and comments. The conference had participation from various countries – India, China, Thailand, Australia, Jordan, South Africa, Nigeria, Uzbekistan and Malaysia. Total number of participants were 47. It was also calculated that the total savings of CO2e is approximately 40000kgs as the conference was held in virtual mode. On the day of the conference, all the presenters were able to present online and the sessions were held smoothly as per the schedule. 17 papers were presented in 2 sessions. Each presenter was given 15 minutes for presentation, followed by question-and-answer session. A networking session was also arranged, which enabled the participants to interact, learn and network with each other. The conference platform “REMO”, which we hired was appreciated by all the participants due to the interactive and networking feature.

485125,Practice Modification for Pandemics: A Model for Surge Planning in Obstetrics,2020,"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic, the highest risk level in the infectious disease alert phase, on 11 March 2020. In the Western Pacific Region (WPR), 192,016 confirmed cases with 7125 deaths had been reported as of 8 June 2020. In people with diabetes COVID-19 can be more difficult to treat due to the wide fluctuations in blood glucose levels or presence of comorbidities such as diabetes complications, including cardiovascular disease and renal damage, which are recognized risks for adverse outcomes. National diabetes associations and governments have established guidelines for subjects with diabetes in relation to COVID-19, and are trying to supply emergency and their regularly required medical products for them. The WPR is so large and composed of such diverse countries and COVID-19 situations, no one conclusion or program applies. Instead we could see a diverse COVID-19 pandemic profile in the WPR, and several creative diagnostic and therapeutic measures undertaken. This includes drive-through screening facilities, high-speed RT-PCR technologies, convalescent patients' plasma therapy, which potentially had some positive contributions in combatting COVID-19 in the WPR as well as globally. Although the numbers of confirmed cases are currently decreasing in the region, the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and many experts are recommending to prepare measures for potential second or third waves of COVID-19.","Hwang, Yerin; Khasag, Altaisaikhan; Jia, Weiping; Jenkins, Alicia; Huang, Chien-Ning; Yabe, Daisuke; Kim, Doo-Man; Kadowaki, Takashi; Lee, Moon-Kyu",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,304

491929,Evidence of Steroids in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The recovery rate is important to determine a country's development towards controlling coronavirus. It is a function of myriad factors - death rate, cases requiring hospitalization, quality of care, and discharge policies, among others. India's recovery rate is growing steadily from an earlier low of 10% to 11%. It is imperative to understand the determinants of recovery rate in a country to enable improvements in the same. MATERIAL AND METHODS: COVID-19 data have been compiled from several sources, including the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, National Disaster Management Authority, and Indian Council of Medical Research and demographic and health data from Census of India, 2011, National Health Profile, 2019, and were used. The study uses linear regression to understand the relationship between recovery rate and development indicators in India. RESULTS: Our analysis emphasizes the beneficial impacts of the health system and better economy on the recovery rate. Investment in health, urban stay, non-slum and non-poor population, and effective governance is instrumental in improving recovery rate. CONCLUSION: Scaling up health facilities and medical infrastructure, slum decongestion, focus on economically weaker sections, capacity building of health workers and ameliorating long-term investments in health, health research, and better quality of living are also essential to address recovery of COVID-19.","Akancha, Singh Aparajita Chattopadhyay",Indian Journal of Medical Sciences,,304

To define the vulnerabilities of mTORC1-addicted cancer cells and to find previously unknown therapeutic targets, we investigated the mechanism of piperlongumine, a small molecule identified in a chemical library screen to specifically target cancer cells with a hyperactive mTORC1 phenotype. Sensitivity to piperlongumine was dependent on its ability to suppress RUVBL1/2-TTT, a complex involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. Cancer cells with high mTORC1 activity are subjected to higher levels of DNA damage stress via c-Myc and displayed an increased dependency on RUVBL1/2 for survival and counteracting genotoxic stress. Examination of clinical cancer tissues also demonstrated that high mTORC1 activity was accompanied by high RUVBL2 expression. Our findings reveal a previously unknown role for RUVBL1/2 in cell survival, where it acts as a functional chaperone to mitigate stress levels induced in the mTORC1-Myc-DNA damage axis.","Shin, Seung Ho; Lee, Ji Su; Zhang, Jia-Min; Choi, Sungbin; Boskovic, Zarko V; Zhao, Ran; Song, Mengqiu; Wang, Rui; Tian, Jie; Lee, Mee-Hyun; Kim, Jae Hwan; Jeong, Minju; Lee, Jung Hyun; Petukhov, Michael; Lee, Sam W; Kim, Sang Gyun; Zou, Lee; Byun, Sanguine",Sci.

496222,Nrf2 activation putatively mediates clinical benefits of low-dose radiotherapy in COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Novel mechanistic considerations,2021,"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease that has spread across the world and infected a large number of people many of whom have died. People with moderate to severe dementia are at very high risk of becoming infected as the disease mainly impacts on older people with other health problems and once infected the person with dementia is more likely to become seriously ill than other people. To prevent infection, people are required to wear masks and isolate from contact with others. It is believed that these measures can reduce the quality of life and general well-being of people with moderate to severe dementia in hospital or social care. This belief has not yet been demonstrated by research. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: We show that people with moderate to severe dementia receiving care on mental health hospital wards and subject to strict infection prevention measures can still achieve high levels of well-being. We show that mental health nurses alter the focus of their care to deliberately overcome the challenges and particularly the restrictions on visiting by families. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: We believe that the changes in practice we observed can occur in other healthcare and social care settings and that whilst restrictions remain in place care staff can protect and possibly enhance well-being for people with moderate to severe dementia. ABSTRACT: Introduction The effect of coronavirus (COVID-19) on people living with dementia is potentially severe in its clinical impacts. More widely, for this vulnerable group, the social restrictions to limit the spread of infection may be emotionally and psychologically damaging. Aim To explore the impact of restrictions on well-being for people with moderate to severe dementia in acute mental health hospital care. Method ""Dementia Care Mapping"" was the observational tool used to determine well- or ill-being. Observations were undertaken in two mental health hospital wards during a time of restrictions and the use of personal protective equipment. Results We report levels of well-being that are higher than might be expected alongside a change in the focus of psychological care delivered through mental health nursing interventions aimed at enhancing well-being. Discussion-We postulate that mental health nurses faced with an unprecedented challenge respond by changing practice to mitigate for infection prevention measures and to compensate for family absence. Implications for practice We suggest that the desirable enhancing actions by nursing staff which raise well-being in these hospital settings are readily transferable to other settings that are aiming to maintain well-being but also practising under COVID-19 restrictions.","Page, Sean; Davies-Abbott, Ian; Jones, Adrian",J. psychiatr. ment. health nurs,,304
497379,"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a Children's Hospital in New York City: Patient Characteristics and an Institutional Protocol for Evaluation, Management, and Follow-Up",2020,"COVID-19 has impacted nations differently based on their policy implementations. The effective policy requires taking into account public information and adaptability to new knowledge. Epidemiological models built to understand COVID-19 seldom provide the policymaker with the capability for adaptive pandemic control (APC). Among the core challenges to be overcome include (a) inability to handle a high degree of non-homogeneity in different contributing features across the pandemic timeline, (b) lack of an approach that enables adaptive incorporation of public health expert knowledge, and (c) transparent models that enable understanding of the decision-making process in suggesting policy. In this work, we take the early steps to address these challenges using Knowledge Infused Policy Gradient (KIPG) methods. Prior work on knowledge infusion does not handle soft and hard imposition of varying forms of knowledge in disease information and guidelines to necessarily comply with. Furthermore, the models do not attend to non-homogeneity in feature counts, manifesting as partial observability in informing the policy. Additionally, interpretable structures are extracted post-learning instead of learning an interpretable model required for APC. To this end, we introduce a mathematical framework for KIPG methods that can (a) induce relevant feature counts over multi-relational features of the world, (b) handle latent non-homogeneous counts as hidden variables that are linear combinations of kernelized aggregates over the features, and (b) infuse knowledge as functional constraints in a principled manner. The study establishes a theory for imposing hard and soft constraints and simulates it through experiments. In comparison with knowledge-intensive baselines, we show quick sample efficient adaptation to new knowledge and interpretability in the learned policy, especially in a pandemic context.","Roy, Kaushik; Zhang, Qi; Gaur, Manas; Sheth, Amit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06245v1.pdf,304

This will allow better identification of potential COVID-19 patients and take appropriate precautions. STUDY DESIGN: Meta analysis. METHODS: We searched three databases, PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid to identify studies published between Dec-2019 and May-2020. All studies reporting upper-aerodigestive symptoms of COVID-19 infection were included. The meta-analysis was conducted following meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, which have evaluated the pooled prevalence of 14 symptoms and nine laboratory investigations. RESULTS: Based on inclusion criteria, 67 publications consisting of 8302 patients were included. Among adults, the pooled proportion of hypertensive and diabetic patients was 18% and 7%. Cough (53% [0.46-0.61]), anosmia (38% [0.19-0.58]), loss/distortion of taste (31% [0.17-0.45]), and nasal obstruction (26% [0.12-0.39]) were the most common ear, nose & throat (ENT) symptoms. Fever (69% [0.62-0.76]) and fatigue (31% [0.26-0.37]) were the commonest generalized symptoms. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were raised in 56% (0.41-0.71) and 49% (0.21-0.77), respectively. Interestingly, lymphopenia (41% [0.30-0.53]) and leucopenia (22% [0.16-0.29]) were more common than lymphocytosis (33% [0.02-0.64]) and leucocytosis (12% [0.09-0.16]). Fever (69% vs. 44%), cough (53% vs. 33%), and dyspnea (20% vs. 4%) were more common in adults as compared to the pediatric population. Diarrhea was more common among the pediatric cases (12%) versus (9%). The pooled estimate of fatality was 4%. CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly experienced ENT symptom was cough followed by anosmia and dysguesia. Raised ESR and CRP with leukopenia and lymphopenia are common laboratory findings. Majority of the infected patients had abnormal computed tomography findings. COVID infection is less severe in pediatric patients.

510260,Recovery of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome with tocilizumab: successful outcome in two critically ill patients,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Sense of purpose has been associated with greater health and well-being, even in daily contexts. However, it is unclear whether effects would hold in daily life during COVID-19, when people may have difficulty seeing a path towards their life goals. DESIGN: The current study investigated whether purposefulness predicted daily positive affect, negative affect, and physical symptoms. Participants (n = 831) reported on these variables during the first weeks of the COVID-19 response in North America. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed daily surveys asking them for daily positive events, stressors, positive affect, negative affect, physical symptoms, and purposefulness. RESULTS: Purposefulness at between- and within-person levels predicted less negative affect and physical symptoms, but more positive affect at the daily level. Between-person purposefulness interacted with positive events when predicting negative and positive affect, suggesting that purposeful people may be less reactive to positive events. However, between-person purposefulness also interacted with daily stressors, insofar that stressors predicted greater declines in positive affect for purposeful people. CONCLUSION: Being a purposeful person holds positive implications for daily health and well-being, even during the pandemic context. However, purposefulness may hold some consequences unique to the COVID-19 context, which merit attention in future research.","Hill, Patrick L; Klaiber, Patrick; Burrow, Anthony L; DeLongis, Anita; Sin, Nancy L",Psychol Health,,304

We aimed to describe the characteristics and predictors for developing in-hospital neurologic manifestations in a large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Mexico City. METHODS: We analyzed records from consecutive adult patients hospitalized from March 15 to June 30, 2020, with moderate to severe COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Neurologic syndromes were actively searched by a standardized structured questionnaire and physical examination, confirmed by neuroimaging, neurophysiology of laboratory analyses, as applicable. RESULTS: We studied 1,072 cases (65% men, mean age 53.2±13 years), 71 patients had pre-existing neurologic diseases (diabetic neuropathy: 17, epilepsy: 15, history of ischemic stroke: eight, migraine: six, multiple sclerosis: one, Parkinson disease: one), and 163 (15.2%) developed a new neurologic complication. Headache (41.7%), myalgia (38.5%), dysgeusia (8%), and anosmia (7%) were the most common neurologic symptoms at hospital presentation. Delirium (13.1%), objective limb weakness (5.1%), and delayed recovery of mental status after sedation withdrawal (2.5%), were the most common new neurologic syndromes. Age, headache at presentation, preexisting neurologic disease, invasive mechanical ventilation, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio &#8805;9 were independent predictors of new in-hospital neurologic complications. CONCLUSIONS: Even after excluding initial clinical features and pre-existing comorbidities, new neurologic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are frequent and can be predicted from clinical information at hospital admission.","Flores-Silva, Fernando Daniel; García-Grimshaw, Miguel; Valdés-Ferrer, Sergio Iván; Vigueras-Hernández, Alma Poema; Domínguez-Moreno, Rogelio; Tristán-Samaniego, Dioselina Panamá; Michel-Chávez, Anaclara; González-Duarte, Alejandra; Vega-Boada, Felipe A; Reyes-Melo, Isael; Jiménez-Ruiz, Amado; Chávez-Martínez, Oswaldo Alan; Rebolledo-García, Daniel; Marché-Fernández, Osvaldo Alexis; Sánchez-Torres, Samantha; García-Ramos, Guillermo; Cantú-Brito, Carlos; Chiquete, Erwin",PLoS One,,304

591540,A Comprehensive Review on Tocilizumab in COVID‐19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Mandatory rules for social distancing to curb the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic require individuals to maintain a critical interpersonal distance above 1.5 m. However, this contradicts our natural preference, which is closer to 1 m for non-intimate encounters, for example, when asking a stranger for directions. OBJECTIVE: This review addresses how humans typically regulate interpersonal distances, in order to highlight the challenges of enforcing atypically large interpersonal distances. METHOD: To understand the challenges posed by social distancing requirements, we integrate relevant contributions from visual perception, social perception, and human factors. RESULTS: To date, research on preferred interpersonal distances suggests that social distancing could induce discomfort, heighten arousal, and decrease social signaling in the short term. While the protracted effects of social distancing are unclear, we propose hypotheses on the mid- to long-term consequences of violating preferred norms of interpersonal distances. CONCLUSION: We suggest that enforcing a physical distance of 1.5–2 m presents a serious challenge to behavioral norms. APPLICATION: We address how notifications, architectural design, and visualizations could be effectively applied to promote interpersonal distance requirements.","Welsch, Robin; Hecht, Heiko; Chuang, Lewis; von Castell, Christoph",Hum Factors,https://doi.org/10.1177/0018720820956858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32902338/,304

Materials and Method: A consecutive cohort of 73 COVID-19 and 48 influenza pneumonia patients were retrospectively recruited from five independent institutions. The courses of both diseases were confirmed to be in the early stages (mean 2.66 (SD 2.62) days for COVID-19 and mean 2.19 (SD 2.10) days for influenza pneumonia after onset). The chi-square test, student`s t-test, and Kruskal-Wallis H-test were performed to compare CT imaging and clinical features between the two groups. Spearman or Kendall correlation tests between feature metrics and diagnosis outcomes were also assessed. The diagnostic performance of each feature in differentiating COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia was evaluated with univariate analysis. The corresponding area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and threshold were reported. Results: The ground-glass opacification (GGO) was the most common imaging feature in COVID-19, including pure-GGO (75.3%) and mixed-GGO (78.1%), mainly in peripheral distribution. For clinical features, most COVID-19 patients presented normal white blood cell (WBC) count (89.04%) and neutrophil count (84.93%). Twenty imaging features and 6 clinical features were identified to be significantly different between the two diseases. The diagnosis outcomes correlated significantly with the WBC count (r=-0.526, P<0.001) and neutrophil count (r=-0.500, P<0.001). Four CT imaging features had absolute correlations coefficients higher than 0.300 (P<0.001), including crazy-paving pattern, mixed-GGO in peripheral area, pleural effusions, and consolidation. Conclusions: Among a total of 1537 lesions and 62 imaging and clinical features, 26 features were demonstrated to be significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia. The crazy-paving pattern was recognized as the most powerful imaging feature for the differential diagnosis in the early stage, while WBC count yielded the highest diagnostic efficacy in clinical manifestations.","Yang, Z.; Lin, D.; Chen, X.; Qiu, J.; Li, S.; Huang, R.; Sun, H.; Liao, Y.; Xiao, J.; Tang, Y.; Liu, G.; Wu, R.; Dai, Z.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20061242; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20061242v1?rss=1,304

The Comirnaty vaccine showed high efficacy in clinical trials and was the first to be approved for its distribution to the general population. We evaluated the immune response induced by the first vaccine dose in different sex/age groups and subjects with or without naturally present anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: As part of an Italian multicenter project (Covidiagnostix), serum samples from 4,290 health-professionals were serologically tested the day of the first vaccination dose, and 21 days later, using two different instrumentations (Siemens-Healthineers and Roche). RESULTS: In total, 97% of samples showed the presence of specific antibodies 21 days after the vaccination dose; the percentage of non-responders increased with age in both genders. Remarkably, naturally seropositive individuals showed antibody persistence up to 11 months and an exceptionally higher vaccination response compared to subjects never infected by SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the importance of the serological test i) to identify naturally SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals and ii) to evaluate the antibody level elicited by the first vaccination dose. Both tests, highlighted differences in the immune response, when subjects were stratified by sex and age, and between naturally seropositive and seronegative subjects.The data obtained show how serological tests could play a crucial role in the triage of the population subjected to the vaccination campaign for COVID-19. The definition of suitable instrumentation-specific thresholds is needed to correctly follow eventually acquired post-vaccination immunity in the general population.","Ferrari, Davide; Mangia, Alessandra; Spanò, Maria Sestina; Zaffarano, Lucia; Viganò, Marco; Di Resta, Chiara; Locatelli, Massimo; Ciceri, Fabio; De Vecchi, Elena",Clin. chem. lab. med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34614550/; https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2021-0364,304

601735,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cytokine Storms, Hyper-Inflammatory Phenotypes, and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome",2020-06-29,"Over the past decades, there has been tremendous progress towards eliminating canine rabies in Latin America. Major components of rabies prevention programs in Latin America leading to these successes have been constant and intense surveillance for rabid dogs and uninterrupted yearly mass dog vaccination campaigns. However, vital measures to control COVID-19 in Latin America have had the negative trade-off of jeopardizing these rabies elimination and prevention activities. In this paper, we aimed to assess the effect of interrupting canine rabies surveillance and mass dog vaccination campaigns on rabies trends. We built a deterministic compartment model of dog rabies dynamics parameterized for conditions found in Arequipa, Peru, where there is an ongoing dog rabies epidemic. Our model suggests that a decrease in canine vaccination coverage as well as decreased surveillance leading to an increased length of survival of infected dogs could lead to a sharp rise in canine rabies and, subsequently, human rabies risk. We examined our results over the best estimate of the basic reproductive number in Arequipa (R(0) = 1.44) and a range of plausible values for R(0) (1.36 – 2). The rising trend was consistent. It is very possible that COVID-19 will continue to challenge our public health departments in the short- and medium-term. Innovative strategies to conduct dog vaccination and rabies surveillance during these trying times should be considered to safeguard the achievements made in Latin America towards the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies.","Raynor, Brinkley; Díaz, Elvis W.; Shinnick, Julianna; Zegarra, Edith; Monroy, Ynes; Mena, Claudia; Castillo-Neyra, Ricardo",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.06.20169581; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.06.20169581v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817966/,304

The outbreak of the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to a crisis in many sectors, including sport. Global efforts to limit the spread of the pathogen resulted in temporary lockdowns that limited sporting activity, thus deteriorating athletes’ physical fitness. Methods: The participants included 20 kickboxers competing at the international level. Their physical fitness was evaluated based on the test developed by the International Committee on the Standardization of Physical Fitness Test (ICSPFT) and their body build was assessed using Tanita BC601 body composition monitor and a body height meter. Differences between physical fitness before the COVID-19 outbreak and during the pandemic after re-opening sports facilities were evaluated. Results: Temporary closing of sports clubs has led to the increase in body mass of the participants by 2.65 kg on average and significantly deteriorated physical fitness. Conclusions: Temporary closing of sports clubs and restrictions on physical activity aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 caused a significant reduction in physical fitness and increased body mass of the participants. This is likely to cause worse performance in the nearest competitions and have a negative impact on the athletes’ health status and immunity to diseases.","Ambroży, Tadeusz; Rydzik, Łukasz; Obmiński, Zbigniew; Klimek, Andrzej T.; Serafin, Natalia; Litwiniuk, Artur; Czaja, Robert; Czarny, Wojciech",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33923913/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18084342,304

Thus, the appearance of a new disease often creates emerging challenges in morphological examinations due to the lack of available data from autopsy- or biopsy-based research. Since late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel seventh coronavirus disease has been reported in China caused by “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). On March 11, 2020, the new clinical condition COVID-19 (Corona-Virus-Disease-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Patients with COVID-19 mainly have a mild disease course, but severe disease onset might result in death due to proceeded lung injury with massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. However, the detailed mechanisms that cause organ injury still remain unclear. We investigated the morphological findings of a COVID-19 patient who died during self-isolation. Pathologic examination revealed massive bilateral alveolar damage, indicating early-phase “acute respiratory distress syndrome” (ARDS). This case emphasizes the possibility of a rapid severe disease onset in previously mild clinical condition and highlights the necessity of a complete autopsy to gain a better understanding of the pathophysiological changes in SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Suess, Christine; Hausmann, Roland",Int J Legal Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32504146/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00414-020-02319-8,304
605898,Goal-Oriented Respiratory Management for Critically Ill Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2012-08-23,"Viruses of the picornavirus-like supercluster mainly achieve cleavage of polyproteins into mature proteins through viral 3-chymotrypsin proteases (3C(pro)) or 3-chymotrypsin-like proteases (3CL(pro)). Due to the essential role in processing viral polyproteins, 3C(pro)/3CL(pro) is a drug target for treating viral infections. The 3CL(pro) is considered the main protease (M(pro)) of coronaviruses. In the current study, the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitory activity of di- and tri-peptides (DTPs) resulted from the proteolysis of bovine milk proteins was evaluated. A set of 326 DTPs were obtained from virtual digestion of bovine milk major proteins. The resulted DTPs were screened using molecular docking. Twenty peptides (P1–P20) showed the best binding energies (ΔG(b) < − 7.0 kcal/mol). Among these 20 peptides, the top five ligands, namely P1 (RVY), P3 (QSW), P17 (DAY), P18 (QSA), and P20 (RNA), based on the highest binding affinity and the highest number of interactions with residues in the active site of M(pro) were selected for further characterization by ADME/Tox analyses. For further validation of our results, molecular dynamics simulation was carried out for P3 as one of the most favorable candidates for up to 100 ns. In comparison to N3, a peptidomimetic control inhibitor, high stability was observed as supported by the calculated binding energy of the M(pro)-P3 complex (− 59.48 ± 4.87 kcal/mol). Strong interactions between P3 and the M(pro) active site, including four major hydrogen bonds to HIS41, ASN142, GLU166, GLN189 residues, and many hydrophobic interactions from which the interaction with CYS145 as a catalytic residue is worth mentioning. Conclusively, milk-derived bioactive peptides, especially the top five selected peptides P1, P3, P17, P18, and P20, show promise as an antiviral lead compound.

AIM the aim of this study was to investigate COVID-19 incidence and mortality in patients transplanted in the North Italy Transplant program (NITp) area during the outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS all consecutive patients transplanted from February 20 to April 3, 2020 (6 weeks) were included in our cohort and followed for at least 4 weeks. Survival analyses were performed. RESULTS one-hundred and twenty-four patients were transplanted with 12 (9.7%) hearts, 4 (3.2%) lungs, 39 (31.4%) livers, 67 (54%) kidneys, 2 (1.6%) combined kidney-pancreas. Recipients’ mean age was 51 years (SD±16.6) and 76/124 (61%) were male. Five (4%) developed COVID-19 after a mean of 13 days (SD±6.7) with a cumulative incidence of 4.0% (CI95%, 0.5-7.5). During the follow-up, 5/124 (4%) recipients died for an overall mortality of 4.3% (CI 95%, 0.6-8.0) of whom only one for COVID-19, for a COVID-19-related mortality of 0.8% (CI95%, 0-6.0). CONCLUSIONS this study showed a low COVID-19 incidence and related-mortality in patients transplanted during the COVID-19 era. Further studies with a longer follow-up are mandatory to confirm the safety of transplant procedures.","Passamonti, Serena Maria; Cannavò, Antonino; Trunzo, Valentina; Caporale, Vittoria; Buonocore, Ruggero; DeFeo, Tullia Maria",Transplant Proc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.07.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041134520326245?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723520/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041134520326245,304

Thus far, many CRISPR/Cas systems have been repurposed for diagnostic functions and are revolutionizing the accessibility of robust diagnostic tools due to their high flexibility, sensitivity and specificity. As RNA-guided targeted recognition effectors, Cas9 variants have been utilized for a variety of diagnostic applications, including biosensing assays, imaging assays and target enrichment for next-generation sequencing (NGS), thereby enabling the development of flexible and cost-effective tests. In addition, the ensuing discovery of Cas proteins (Cas12 and Cas13) with collateral cleavage activities has facilitated the development of numerous diagnostic tools for rapid and portable detection, and these tools have great potential for point-of-care settings. However, representative reviews proposed on this topic are mainly confined to classical biosensing applications; thus, a comprehensive and systematic description of this fast-developing field is required. In this review, based on the detection principle, we provide a detailed classification and comprehensive discussion of recent works that harness these CRISPR-based diagnostic tools from a new perspective. Furthermore, current challenges and future perspectives of CRISPR-based diagnostics are outlined.","Wang, Meng; Zhang, Rui; Li, Jinming",Biosens Bioelectron,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32729545/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566320304243?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112430; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566320304243,304
609375,Response to: Management of Traumatic Spinal Fracture in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Situation,2020-05-12,"BACKGROUND: To explore and describe the current literature surrounding bacterial/fungal co-infection in patients with coronavirus infection. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched using broad based search criteria relating to coronavirus and bacterial co-infection. Articles presenting clinical data for patients with coronavirus infection (defined as SARS-1, MERS, SARS-COV-2, and other coronavirus) and bacterial/fungal co-infection reported in English, Mandarin, or Italian were included. Data describing bacterial/fungal co-infections, treatments, and outcomes were extracted. Secondary analysis of studies reporting antimicrobial prescribing in SARS-COV-2 even in the absence of co-infection was performed. RESULTS: 1007 abstracts were identified. Eighteen full texts reported bacterial/fungal co-infection were included. Most studies did not identify or report bacterial/fungal coinfection (85/140;61%). 9/18 (50%) studies reported on COVID-19, 5/18 (28%) SARS-1, 1/18 (6%) MERS, and 3/18 (17%) other coronavirus. For COVID-19, 62/806 (8%) patients were reported as experiencing bacterial/fungal co-infection during hospital admission. Secondary analysis demonstrated wide use of broad-spectrum antibacterials, despite a paucity of evidence for bacterial coinfection. On secondary analysis, 1450/2010 (72%) of patients reported received antimicrobial therapy. No antimicrobial stewardship interventions were described. For non-COVID-19 cases bacterial/fungal co-infection was reported in 89/815 (11%) of patients. Broad-spectrum antibiotic use was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Despite frequent prescription of broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobials in patients with coronavirus associated respiratory infections, there is a paucity of data to support the association with respiratory bacterial/fungal co-infection. Generation of prospective evidence to support development of antimicrobial policy and appropriate stewardship interventions specific for the COVID-19 pandemic are urgently required.","Rawson, Timothy M; Moore, Luke S P; Zhu, Nina; Ranganathan, Nishanthy; Skolimowska, Keira; Gilchrist, Mark; Satta, Giovanni; Cooke, Graham; Holmes, Alison",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32358954/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa530,304
610450,Coronavirus Disease 2019 With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Mimicking Heart Failure Exacerbation: Time to Rethink,2020-05-03,"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has a wide range of pathophysiological effects. Curcumin, an active constituent of Curcuma longa (turmeric), has several properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, anti-thrombotic, and anti-proliferative effects, which make it a promising candidate for the symptomatic treatment of COVID-19. Objective: We aimed to determine the effects of curcumin administered with piperine (to optimize absorption) on symptoms in patients with COVID-19 in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial at a 30-bed dedicated COVID Health Center (DCHC) in Maharashtra, India. Methods: In addition to conventional COVID-19 treatment, patients in the control group received a dose of probiotics twice a day, and patients in the study group received curcumin (525 mg) with piperine (2.5 mg) in tablet form twice a day. The effects of curcumin/piperine treatment on primary and secondary outcomes were assessed for the duration of hospitalization. Results: Patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms who received curcumin/piperine treatment showed early symptomatic recovery (fever, cough, sore throat, and breathlessness), less deterioration, fewer red flag signs, better ability to maintain oxygen saturation above 94% on room air, and better clinical outcomes compared to patients of the control group. Furthermore, curcumin/piperine treatment appeared to reduce the duration of hospitalization in patients with moderate to severe symptoms, and fewer deaths were observed in the curcumin/piperine treatment group. Conclusions: Administration of oral curcumin with piperine as an adjuvant symptomatic therapy in COVID-19 treatment could substantially reduce morbidity and mortality, and ease the logistical and supply-related burdens on the healthcare system. Curcumin could be a safe and natural therapeutic option to prevent Post-Covid thromboembolic events.

612946,A Kidney Transplant Patient Who Died of COVID-19-associated Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2021-05-29,"The outbreak of COVID-19 leads to emergence of the global pandemic, but there is no specific vaccine recommended for COVID-19. More than 216 countries are struggling against the transmission of the disease, recovery and motility. Till date more than 0.948 million deaths out of 30.369 million confirmed cases are reported by WHO. Most of the nations adopted partial or complete ‘lockdown’ and imposed ‘social distancing’ to control the rapid transmission of COVID-19 and its consequence. Though global economic growth declined due to nationwide lockdown, there are certain positive impacts on environment. This review article has discussed the effects of nationwide lockdown aiming to community transmission COVID-19 on animal life behaviour and atmospheric environment in different aspects. In the lockdown period, the levels of NO(2) and carbon emission remarkably decrease in atmosphere due to restricted consumption of fossil fuel by industries, thermal power stations and air transportations. The concentration of NO(2) dropped by 45–54% in the atmosphere of most populated cities in Europe. The intensities of particulate matters PM(2.5) and PM(10) decreased by 43% and 31% respectively, at lower atmosphere indicating improvement in air qualities in different parts of world caused by less traffic and construction activities. SPM reduced up to 15.9%, showing improvement in surface water quality. New deserted bank has developed due to less river activities in this period. Noise pollution remarkably dropped below 60 db even in crowded cities. Thus, the atmospheric environment has resumed some extent in all respect by means of such global-wide lockdown aiming to control COVID-19 pandemic. The behavioural changes of wild animals, birds, butterfly, pets and street animals that reflected on ecosystem of their relative region indicate the non-interference of human activities on lives of natural creatures during lockdown period. There is certain correlation between atmospheric change with the behavioural changes of natural creature during lockdown period. The objective of this study is to focus the critical analysis of the effect of human activities on atmospheric environment for sustainable ecosystem in long term. Significantly, there is ample scope of research on sustainable development of atmospheric environment and ecosystem of creature in absence of human being.","Bar, Harekrishna",Environ Dev Sustain,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-01002-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33020695/,304

Considering the strong infectivity and clustering of COVID-19, early detection of infectious cases is of great significance to control the epidemic. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) plays an important role in rapid laboratory diagnosis, treatment assessment, epidemic prevention and control of COVID-19. However, since COVID-19 is caused by a new emerging virus and NAT for COVID-19 has not been clinically applied before, false negative results inconsistent with clinical diagnosis have appeared in clinical practice. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the sensitivity of NAT for COVID-19. This study aimed to summarize the current situation and prospect of NAT based on the latest findings on COVID-19 infection. Also, the quality control of sample collection was discussed. Hopefully, this study could help to improve the effectiveness of NAT for COVID-19.","Mao, Xiao-Dong; Li, Taiping; Xu, Zhirong; Liu, Kangsheng",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33581843/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X20322816; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.12.094; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X20322816?v=s5,304
615860,Association between treatment with colchicine and improved survival in a single-centre cohort of adult hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome,2020-07-30,"Emergence of a highly contagious novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, has precipitated the current global health crisis with over 479,000 deaths and more than 9.3 million confirmed cases. Currently, our knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is very limited which has hampered attempts to develop targeted antiviral strategies. Therefore, we urgently need an effective therapy for this unmet medical need. Viruses hijack and dysregulate cellular machineries in order for them to replicate and infect more cells. Thus, identifying and targeting dysregulated signaling pathways that have been taken over by viruses is one strategy for developing an effective antiviral therapy. We have developed a high-throughput drug screening system to identify potential antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. We utilized a small molecule library of 430 protein kinase inhibitors, which are in various stages of clinical trials. Most of the tested kinase antagonists are ATP competitive inhibitors, a class of nucleoside analogs, which have been shown to have potent antiviral activity. From the primary screen, we have identified 34 compounds capable of inhibiting viral cytopathic effect in epithelial cells. Network of drug and protein relations showed that these compounds specifically targeted a limited number of cellular kinases. More importantly, we have identified mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR/MAPK, and DNA-Damage Response (DDR) pathways as key cellular signaling pathways critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, a secondary screen confirmed compounds such as Berzosertib (VE-822), Vistusertib (AZD2014), and Nilotinib with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity. Finally, we found that Berzosertib, an ATR kinase inhibitor in the DDR pathway, demonstrated potent antiviral activity in a human epithelial cell line and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. These inhibitors are already in clinical trials of phase 2 or 3 for cancer treatment, and can be repurposed as promising drug candidates for a host-directed therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we have identified small molecule inhibitors exhibiting anti SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking key cellular kinases, which gives insight on important mechanism of host-pathogen interaction. These compounds can be further evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients following additional in vivo safety and efficacy studies.

To estimate the qualitative/quantitative impact of HTS on forest virology, we have summarized viruses affecting major tree/shrub species and their fungal associates, including fungal plant pathogens, mutualists and saprotrophs. The contribution of HTS methods is extremely significant for forest virology. Reviewed data on viral presence in holobionts allowed us a first attempt to address the role of virome in holobionts. Forest health is dependent on the variability of microorganisms interacting with the host tree/holobiont; symbiotic microbiota and pathogens engage in a permanent interplay, which influences the host. Through virus–virus interplays synergistic or antagonistic relations may evolve, which may drastically affect the health of the holobiont. Novel insights of these interplays may allow practical applications for forest plant protection based on endophytes and mycovirus biocontrol agents. The current analysis is conceived in light of the prospect that novel viruses may initiate an emergent infectious disease and that measures for the avoidance of future outbreaks in forests should be considered.","Rumbou, Artemis; Vainio, Eeva J.; Büttner, Carmen",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442809/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9081730,304
617414,Correction to: The emerging role of probiotics as a mitigation strategy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19),2021-05-12,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are critical human and animal pathogens because of their potential to cause severe epidemics of respiratory or enteric diseases. In pigs, the newly emerged porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and re-emerged porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) reported in the US and Asia, as well as the discovery of novel CoVs in wild bats or birds, has necessitated development of improved detection and control measures for these CoVs. Because the previous pancoronavirus (panCoV) RT-PCR established in our laboratory in 2007–2011 did not detect deltacoronaviruses (δ-CoVs) in swine fecal and serum samples, our goal was to develop a new panCoV RT-PCR assay to detect known human and animal CoVs, including δ-CoVs. In this study, we designed a new primer set to amplify a 668 bp-region within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene that encodes the most conserved protein domain of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-CoVs. We established a one-step panCoV RT-PCR assay and standardized the assay conditions. The newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay was demonstrated to have a high sensitivity and specificity. Using a panel of 60 swine biological samples (feces, intestinal contents, and sera) characterized by PEDV, PDCoV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus-specific RT-PCR assays, we demonstrated that sensitivity and specificity of the newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay were 100%. 400 avian fecal (RNA) samples were further tested simultaneously for CoV by the new panCoV RT-PCR and a one-step RT-PCR assay with the δ-CoV nucleocapsid-specific universal primers. Four of 400 avian samples were positive for CoV, three of which were positive for δ-CoV by the conventional RT-PCR. PanCoV RT-PCR fragments for 3 of the 4 CoVs were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of one γ-CoV and two δ-CoV in the sequenced samples. The newly designed panCoV RT-PCR assay should be useful for the detection of currently known CoVs in animal biological samples.","Hu, Hui; Jung, Kwonil; Wang, Qiuhong; Saif, Linda J.; Vlasova, Anastasia N.",J Virol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093417304925; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093417304925; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.02.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29499225/,304

We do this based on two dimensions inspired by the CM literature, that is, the degree of the perceived time pressure and the precrisis legal institutional framework. The plausibility of the analytical framework is assessed on the basis of three cases: the WHO’s dealing with the SARS crisis; the European Commission’s dealing with the Mad Cow Disease crisis; and the UN’s handling of the humanitarian crisis in the Great Lakes region. The results show that the perceived time pressure affected IO autonomy in so far as higher time pressure that rendered IO autonomy stronger, whereas with regard to the institutional framework no stringent pattern could be seen. Moreover, based on our findings, we propose that IO autonomy in crisis situations also depends on the framing of an issue in terms on impartiality, on the extent to which the IO in question is subject to politicisation, as well as on the degree to which it possesses specific technical expertise.","Olsson, Eva-Karin; Verbeek, Bertjan",J Int Relat Dev (Ljubl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288634/; https://doi.org/10.1057/s41268-016-0071-z,304

Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were used as microorganisms for yogurt production. Chemical analysis revealed a decline of fat matter in the presence of propolis and/or cinnamon. Propolis had statistically significant suppressive effects on Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis as well as on Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus numbers (p < 0.05). These effects were diminished in the presence of increasing cinnamon concentrations. For Lactobacillus acidophilus a statistically significant reducing effect on the number of colonies was observed in all products investigated. Nevertheless all samples met the standard of recommended level of ≥ 10(6) viable cells/g of a product.

623611,Drug repurposing of dermatologic medications to treat coronavirus disease 2019: Science or fiction?,2021-02-02,"Background: The most critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may require advanced support modalities, such as veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). A systematic, methodical approach to a respiratory pandemic on a state and institutional level is critical. Methods: We conducted retrospective review of our institutional response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the creation of a dedicated airlock biocontainment unit (BCU) to treat patients with refractory COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS). Data were collected through conversations with staff on varying levels in the BCU, those leading the effort to make the BCU and hospital incident command system, email communications regarding logistic changes being implemented, and a review of COVID-19 patient census at our institution from March through June 2020. Results: Over 2100 patients were successfully admitted to system hospitals; 29% of these patients required critical care. The response to this respiratory pandemic augmented intensive care physician staffing, created a 70-member nursing team, and increased the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) capability by nearly 200%. During this time period, 40 COVID-19 patients on VV-ECMO were managed in the BCU. Challenges in an airlock unit included communication, scarcity of resources, double-bunking, and maintaining routine care. Conclusions: Preparing for a surge of critically ill patients during a pandemic can be a daunting task. The implementation of a coordinated, system-level approach can help with the allocation of resources as needed. Focusing on established strengths of hospitals within the system can guide triage based on individual patient needs. The management of ECMO patients is still a specialty care, and a systematic and hospital based approach requiring an ECMO team composed of multiple experienced individuals is paramount during a respiratory viral pandemic.","Dave, Sagar; Shah, Aakash; Galvagno, Samuel; George, Kristen; Menne, Ashley R.; Haase, Daniel J.; McCormick, Brian; Rector, Raymond; Dahi, Siamak; Madathil, Ronson J.; Deatrick, Kristopher B.; Ghoreishi, Mehrdad; Gammie, James S.; Kaczorowski, David J.; Scalea, Thomas M.; Menaker, Jay; Herr, Daniel; Krause, Eric; Tabatabai, Ali",Membranes (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes11040258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33918355/,304

Many articles have predicted the development of the epidemic. Most of them only use very basic SEIR model without considering the real situation. In this paper, we build a model called e-ISHR model based on SEIR model. Then we add hospital system and time delay system into the original model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 better. Besides, in order to take the government’s control and people’s awareness into consideration, we change our e-ISHR model into a 3-staged model which effectively shows the impact of these factors on the spread of the disease. By using this e-ISHR model, we fit and predict the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and China except Hubei. We also change some of parameters in our model.

METHODS: All patients from the ages of 0 to 18 years visiting the University of Health Sciences, Ankara Research and Training Hospital, paediatric emergency service from April‐October 2019 to April‐October 2020 with no missing information in their records were involved in this retrospective cross‐sectional study. RESULTS: The total number of paediatric emergency service consultations was 74 739; the number of emergency visits from April to October 2019 was 55 678, whereas it was 19 061 from April to October 2020 in the midst of the COVID‐19 pandemic period. There was a 67.7% decrease in consultations during the pandemic period. The mean age of participants from April to October 2019 was 8.11 ± 5.31 years, and 52.4% of cases were male. The mean age from April to October 2020 was 8.58 ± 5.93 years, and 51% of cases were male. COVID‐19‐related symptoms were higher during the pandemic period (P < .05), with fever and gastroenteritis being the most frequently received diagnosis in both periods. During the pandemic period, the newborn consultation ratio was higher (P > .05), there was a decrease in consultation ratios related to suicide attempts (P < .05), and a threefold increase in death rates was observed (P < .05). CONCLUSION: In Turkey, where emergency consultation rates are quite high, these decreases look fearsome for secondary injuries that can develop in children. For this reason, families should be made aware of the importance of bringing their children to the hospital during emergencies, and that all necessary health precautions are being taken to decrease the spread of infection in hospitals.","Fidancı, İlknur; Taşar, Medine Ayşin; Akıntuğ, Bahar; Fidancı, İzzet; Bulut, İsmail",Int J Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34028932/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14398,304
629370,Clinically Worsening Myasthenia-Related Respiratory Distress Notwithstanding Normal Markers of Respiratory Function,2021-05-26,"BACKGROUND: Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is responsible for VEE epidemics that occur in South and Central America and the U.S. The VEEV envelope contains two glycoproteins E1 (mediates cell membrane fusion) and E2 (binds receptor and elicits virus neutralizing antibodies). Previously we constructed E1 and E2 epitope maps using murine monoclonal antibodies (mMAbs). Six E2 epitopes (E2(c,d,e,f,g,h)) bound VEEV-neutralizing antibody and mapped to amino acids (aa) 182–207. Nothing is known about the human antibody repertoire to VEEV or epitopes that engage human virus-neutralizing antibodies. There is no specific treatment for VEE; however virus-neutralizing mMAbs are potent protective and therapeutic agents for mice challenged with VEEV by either peripheral or aerosol routes. Therefore, fully human MAbs (hMAbs) with virus-neutralizing activity should be useful for prevention or clinical treatment of human VEE. METHODS: We used phage-display to isolate VEEV-specific hFabs from human bone marrow donors. These hFabs were characterized by sequencing, specificity testing, VEEV subtype cross-reactivity using indirect ELISA, and in vitro virus neutralization capacity. One E2-specific neutralizing hFAb, F5n, was converted into IgG, and its binding site was identified using competitive ELISA with mMAbs and by preparing and sequencing antibody neutralization-escape variants. FINDINGS: Using 11 VEEV-reactive hFabs we constructed the first human epitope map for the alphaviral surface proteins E1 and E2. We identified an important neutralization-associated epitope unique to the human immune response, E2 aa115–119. Using a 9 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of the Sindbis virus E2 protein, we showed the probable surface location of this human VEEV epitope. CONCLUSIONS: The VEEV-neutralizing capacity of the hMAb F5 nIgG is similar to that exhibited by the humanized mMAb Hy4 IgG. The Hy4 IgG has been shown to limit VEEV infection in mice both prophylactically and therapeutically. Administration of a cocktail of F5n and Hy4 IgGs, which bind to different E2 epitopes, could provide enhanced prophylaxis or immunotherapy for VEEV, while reducing the possibility of generating possibly harmful virus neutralization-escape variants in vivo.","Hunt, Ann R.; Frederickson, Shana; Maruyama, Toshiaki; Roehrig, John T.; Blair, Carol D.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20644615/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000739,304
629811,Toward Optimal Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Outcomes: Recognizing the Syndrome and Identifying Its Causes,2021-09-18,"BACKGROUND: Past respiratory viral epidemics suggest that bacterial infections impact clinical outcomes. There is minimal information on potential co-pathogens in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in the US. We analyzed pathogens, antimicrobial use, and healthcare utilization in hospitalized US patients with and without severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included patients with > 1 day of inpatient admission and discharge/death between March 1 and May 31, 2020 at 241 US acute care hospitals in the BD Insights Research Database. We assessed microbiological testing data, antimicrobial utilization in admitted patients with ≥24 h of antimicrobial therapy, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: A total of 141,621 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (17,003 [12.0%] positive) and 449,339 patients were not tested. Most (> 90%) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 had additional microbiologic testing performed compared with 41.9% of SARS-CoV-2-untested patients. Non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen rates were 20.9% for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared with 21.3 and 27.9% for SARS-CoV-2-negative and −untested patients, respectively. Gram-negative bacteria were the most common pathogens (45.5, 44.1, and 43.5% for SARS-CoV-2-positive, −negative, and −untested patients). SARS-CoV-2-positive patients had higher rates of hospital-onset (versus admission-onset) non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative or −untested patients (42.4, 22.2, and 19.5%, respectively), more antimicrobial usage (68.0, 45.2, and 25.1% of patients), and longer hospital LOS (mean [standard deviation (SD)] of 8.6 [11.4], 5.1 [8.9], and 4.2 [8.0] days) and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS (mean [SD] of 7.8 [8.5], 3.6 [6.2], and 3.6 [5.9] days). For all groups, the presence of a non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen was associated with increased hospital LOS (mean [SD] days for patients with versus without a non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen: 13.7 [15.7] vs 7.3 [9.6] days for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, 8.2 [11.5] vs 4.3 [7.9] days for SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, and 7.1 [11.0] vs 3.9 [7.4] days for SARS-CoV-2-untested patients). CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar rates of non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens in SARS-CoV-2-positive, −negative, and −untested patients, SARS-CoV-2 was associated with higher rates of hospital-onset infections, greater antimicrobial usage, and extended hospital and ICU LOS. This finding highlights the heavy burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare systems and suggests possible opportunities for diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship.

Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease may have a higher risk of infection of COVID-19 and worse outcomes than others. To improve the outcome during the pandemic, management strategies for the patients recovering from coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery need to be reconsidered. METHODS: Some precaution advices including self-protection, blood glucose and blood pressure controlling are recommended for the patients recovering from CABG during the pandemic. They are encouraged to communicate with doctors by telephone or Internet when COVID-19 related symptoms such as cough, fever and dyspnea occur. As a follow-up strategy for patients after CABG surgery, cardiac biomarkers and CTA could also be helpful to the diagnosis of COVID-19. Some medications being investigated for COVID-19 therapy may have side effects relevant to cardiovascular disease. Appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) is necessary for cardiovascular health-care workers operating in clinical settings. RESULTS: There was zero out of over 300 follow-up patients after CABG surgery confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 from January to June 2020. No cardiovascular health-care workers were reported to be infected neither in the Second Xiangya Hospital during the pandemic.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven C. albicans, six C. parapsilosis, five C. guilliermondii, five C. tropicalis, and four C. glabrata clinical isolates were investigated. We quantified the adherence of these Candida species by flow cytometric method and evaluated the formation of biofilms by XTT reduction and crystal violet methods. Actions of micafungin (MF), fluconazole (FZ), and N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) on the adhesion and biofilm formation of different Candida species were determined. RESULTS: Non‐albicans Candida species were demonstrated to have stronger adhesion abilities compared with C. albicans. The biofilm‐forming capabilities of different Candida species were varied considerably, and the degree of biofilm formation might be affected by different assay approaches. Interestingly, C. parapsilosis displayed the highest biofilm formation abilities, while C. glabrata exhibited the lowest total biomass and metabolic activity. Furthermore, the inhibitory activities of MF, FZ, and NAC on fungal adhesion and biofilm formation were evaluated, and the results indicated that MF could reduce the adhesion ability and biofilm metabolism more significantly (p < 0.05), and its antifungal activity was elevated in a dose‐dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Non‐albicans Candida species, especially C. guilliermondii, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis, exhibited higher adhesion ability in catheter‐related candidemia patients.

Treatments of proven efficacy are currently limited predominantly to herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus. Development of new therapies has been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal model systems for some important viruses and by the difficulty in conducting human clinical trials for diseases that may be rare, or in the case of arboviral infections, often have variable seasonal and geographic incidence. Nonetheless, many novel approaches to antiviral therapy are available including candidate thiazolide and purazinecarboxamide derivatives with potential broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy. New herpesvirus drugs include viral helicase-primase and terminase inhibitors. The use of antisense oligonucleotides and other strategies to interfere with viral RNA translation has shown efficacy in experimental models of CNS viral disease. Identifying specific molecular targets within viral replication cycles has led to many existing antivirals and will undoubtedly continue to be the basis of future drug design. A promising new area of research involves therapies based on enhanced understanding of host antiviral immune responses. Toll-like receptor agonists, and drugs that inhibit specific cytokines as well as interferon preparations have all shown potential therapeutic efficacy. Passive transfer of virus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes have been used in humans and may provide an effective therapies for some herpesvirus infections and potentially for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

642736,CT Quantitative Analysis and Its Relationship with Clinical Features for Assessing the Severity of Patients with COVID-19,2020-05-06,"OBJECTIVES: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may trigger severe pneumonia in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients through release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and recruitment of neutrophils in the lungs. Activated neutrophils induce inflammation and severe alveolar injury by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The backbones of many DAMPs and NETs are made of extracellular, cell-free DNA decorated with highly toxic compounds such as elastase, myeloperoxidase and citrullinated histones. Dornase alfa is a FDA-approved recombinant human DNAse 1 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, which cleaves extracellular DNA and may break up cell-free DNA, loosening sticky mucus in the distal airways and reducing NETs-induced toxicity on alveolar pneumocytes. The COVIDornase trial intends to define the impact of aerosolized intra-tracheal dornase alfa administration on the severity and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. This drug might make lung mucus thinner and looser, promoting improved clearance of secretions and reduce extracellular double-stranded DNA-induced hyperinflammation in alveoli, preventing further damage to the lungs. TRIAL DESIGN: COVIDornase is a prospective, randomized, controlled, 2-arm (1:1 ratio), multicentric, open-label clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study will recruit mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the recruiting centres (at the time of writing: The Rothschild foundation hospital in Paris, the Strasbourg university hospitals, and Metz-Thionville hospital) who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and meet ARDS criteria. INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Adult patient (age ≥ 18 years old); - Hospitalized in ICU; - With severe COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS according to Berlin criteria (PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 300 and PEEP > 5 cmH(2)O); - Intubated for less than 8 days; - With an anticipated duration of mechanical ventilation > 48 hours; - Carrier of an arterial catheter; - For whom 4 PaO(2)/FiO(2) values over the preceding 24 hours are available; NON-INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Known hypersensitivity to dornase alfa or any of its excipients; - Pregnant or breastfeeding status; - Patient under legal protection. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention 1, Study group Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme®, Roche, Switzerland) will be administered by aerosol, at a dose of 2500 IU twice daily, 12 hours apart, for 7 consecutive days, using a vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Solo®, Aerogen, Ireland). The remainder of the management will be performed in accordance with good clinical practice, including mechanical ventilation (protective ventilation, PEEP > 5 cmH(2)O, tracheal balloon pressure check every 4 hours or automatic device, 30° head of the bed elevation, tidal volume 6-8mL/kg, plateau pressure < 30 cmH(2)O), neuromuscular blockers if necessary, prone position if PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 150, early enteral nutrition, glycemic control and a sedation protocol based on the RASS score. Intervention 2, Comparator Patients will receive usual care in accordance with good practice (as detailed above), without aerosols. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one grade improvement between D(0) (inclusion) and D(7) in the ARDS scale severity (Berlin criteria). For instance from “severe” to “moderate” or from “moderate” to “mild”. RANDOMISATION: All consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised 1:1 using an eCRF-based, computer-generated randomisation table, either to the dornase alfa arm or to the control arm. An interim analysis will be performed after inclusion of 20 patients. Inclusions may be stopped at the interim analysis per data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) advice, if statistical analyses conclude on the futility or efficacy of the intervention or by other DSMB decision. BLINDING (MASKING): The participants and caregivers will not be blinded to study group assignment. Those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to study group assignment.

It is confirmed that dermoscopy of NMSC confers a diagnostic advantage as compared to visual face-to-face assessment. COVID-19 restrictions diagnostics by telemedicine photos, which are analogous to visual inspection, displaced part of in-person visits. This study evaluated by a dual convolutional neural network (CNN) performance metrics in dermoscopic (DI) versus smartphone-captured images (SI) and tested if artificial intelligence narrows the proclaimed gap in diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: A CNN that receives a raw image and predicts malignancy, overlaid by a second independent CNN which processes a sonification (image-to-sound mapping) of the original image, were combined into a unified malignancy classifier. All images were histopathology-verified in a comparison between NMSC and benign skin lesions excised as suspected NMSCs. Study criteria outcomes were sensitivity and specificity for the unified output. RESULTS: Images acquired by DI (n = 132 NMSC, n = 33 benign) were compared to SI (n = 170 NMSC, n = 28 benign). DI and SI analysis metrics resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.911 and 0.821, respectively. Accuracy was increased by DI (0.88; CI 81.9–92.4) as compared to SI (0.75; CI 68.1–80.6, p < 0.005). Sensitivity of DI was higher than SI (95.3%, CI 90.4–98.3 vs 75.3%, CI 68.1–81.6, p < 0.001), but not specificity (p = NS). CONCLUSION: Telemedicine use of smartphone images might result in a substantial decrease in diagnostic performance as compared to dermoscopy, which needs to be considered by both healthcare providers and patients.","Dascalu, A.; Walker, B.

654267,Clinical Features of COVID-19 Patients in Xiaogan City,2020-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Mental health of the population during COVID-19 quarantine could be at risk. Previous studies in short quarantines, found mood-related and anxiety symptomatology. Here we aimed to characterize the subtypes of psychological distress associated with quarantine, assess its prevalence, explore risk/protective factors, and possible mechanisms. METHODS: Online cross-sectional data (n=4408) was collected during the Argentine quarantine, between 1(st)-17(th) April 2020 along a small replication study (n=644). Psychological distress clusters were determined using latent profile analysis on a wide-range of symptoms using the complete Brief-Symptom Inventory-53. Multinomial and Elastic-net regression were performed to identify risk/protective factors among trait-measures (Personality and Resilience) and state-measures (COVID-19 related fear and coping-skills). RESULTS: Three latent-classes defined by symptom severity level were identified. The majority of individuals were classified in the mild (40.9%) and severe classes (41.0%). Participants reported elevated symptoms of Phobic-Anxiety (41.3%), Anxiety (31.8%), Depression (27.5%), General-Distress (27.1%), Obsession-Compulsion (25.1%) and Hostility (13.7%). Logistic-regressions analyses mainly revealed that women, young individuals, having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or trauma, having high levels of trait-neuroticism and COVID-related fear, were those at greater risk of psychological distress. In contrast, adults, being married, exercising, having upper-class income, having high levels of trait-resilience and coping-skills, were the most protected. Mediation analysis, showed that state-measures mediated the association between trait-measures and class-membership. CONCLUSIONS: Quarantine was associated intense psychological distress. Attention should be given to COVID-19-related fear and coping-skills as they act as potential mediators in emotional suffering during quarantine.","Fernández, Rodrigo S.; Crivelli, Lucia; Guimet, Nahuel Magrath; Allegri, Ricardo F.; Pedreira, Maria E.",J Affect Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32799107/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032720325866; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032720325866?v=s5,304

Clinical, epidemiological, and virological evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses contribute to human mental diseases whose etiology remains elusive. Therefore, the investigation of the mechanisms whereby viruses persist in the CNS and disturb normal brain function represents an area of research relevant to clinical and basic neurosciences. Borna disease virus (BDV) causes CNS disease in several vertebrate species characterized by behavioral abnormalities. Based on its unique features, BDV represents the prototype of a new virus family. BDV provides an important model for the investigation of the mechanisms and consequences of viral persistence in the CNS. The BDV paradigm is amenable to study virus–cell interactions in the CNS that can lead to neurodevelopmental abnormalities, immune-mediated damage, as well as alterations in cell differentiated functions that affect brain homeostasis. Moreover, seroepidemiological data and recent molecular studies indicate that BDV is associated with certain neuropsychiatric diseases. The potential role of BDV and of other yet to be uncovered BDV-related viruses in human mental health provides additional impetus for the investigation of this novel neurotropic infectious agent.","Gonzalez–Dunia, Daniel; Sauder, Christian; de la Torre, Juan Carlos",Brain Res Bull,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0361923097002761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9421127/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361923097002761,304

To release the therapeutic potential of this versatile but large and fragile molecule, excipients are used which either interact by electrostatic interaction, passively encapsulate siRNA or are covalently attached to enable specific and safe delivery of the drug substance. Controlling the delicate balance between protective complexation and release of siRNA at the right point and time is done by understanding excipients–siRNA interactions. These can be lipids, polymers such as PEI, PLGA, Chitosans, Cyclodextrins, as well as aptamers and peptides.

Currently available serological assays utilize single analyte technologies such as ELISA to measure antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens including spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) protein. To measure individual antibody (IgG and IgA) responses against SARS-CoV-2 and the endemic human coronaviruses (hCoVs) NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1, we developed a multiplexed immunoassay (CoVi-plex), for which we included S and N proteins of these coronaviruses in an expanded antigen panel. Compared to commercial in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests our CoVi-plex achieved the highest sensitivity and specificity when analyzing 310 SARS-CoV-2 infected and 866 uninfected individuals. Simultaneously we see high IgG responses against hCoVs throughout all samples, whereas no consistent cross reactive IgG response patterns can be defined. In summary, our CoVi-plex is highly suited to monitor vaccination studies and will facilitate epidemiologic screenings for the humoral immunity toward pandemic as well as endemic coronaviruses.","Becker, M.; Strengert, M.; Junker, D.; Kerrinnes, T.; Kaiser, P.

665683,Caloric Intake with High Ratio of Enteral Nutrition Associated with Lower Hospital Mortality for Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Using Prone Position Therapy,2021-09-18,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pneumonia extension is assessed by computed tomography (CT) with the ratio between the volume of abnormal pulmonary opacities (PO) and CT-estimated lung volume (CT(LV)). CT-estimated lung weight (CT(LW)) also correlates with pneumonia severity. However, both CT(LV) and CT(LW) depend on demographic and anthropometric variables. PURPOSES: To estimate the extent and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia adjusting the volume and weight of abnormal PO to the predicted CT(LV) (pCT(LV)) and CT(LW) (pCT(LW)), respectively, and to evaluate their possible association with clinical and radiological outcomes. METHODS: Chest CT from 103 COVID-19 and 86 healthy subjects were examined retrospectively. In controls, predictive equations for estimating pCT(LV) and pCT(LW) were assessed. COVID-19 pneumonia extent and severity were then defined as the ratio between the volume and the weight of abnormal PO expressed as a percentage of the pCT(LV) and pCT(LW), respectively. A ROC analysis was used to test differential diagnosis ability of the proposed method in COVID-19 and controls. The degree of pneumonia extent and severity was assessed with Z-scores relative to the average volume and weight of PO in controls. Accordingly, COVID-19 patients were classified as with limited, moderate and diffuse pneumonia extent and as with mild, moderate and severe pneumonia severity. RESULTS: In controls, CT(LV) could be predicted by sex and height (adjusted R(2) = 0.57; P < 0.001) while CT(LW) by age, sex, and height (adjusted R(2) = 0.6; P < 0.001). The cutoff of 20% (AUC = 0.91, 95%CI 0.88–0.93) for pneumonia extent and of 50% (AUC = 0.91, 95%CI 0.89–0.92) for pneumonia severity were obtained. Pneumonia extent were better correlated when expressed as a percentage of the pCT(LV) and pCT(LW) (r = 0.85, P < 0.001), respectively. COVID-19 patients with diffuse and severe pneumonia at admission presented significantly higher CRP concentration, intra-hospital mortality, ICU stay and ventilatory support necessity, than those with moderate and limited/mild pneumonia. Moreover, pneumonia severity, but not extent, was positively and moderately correlated with age (r = 0.46) and CRP concentration (r = 0.44). CONCLUSION: The proposed estimation of COVID-19 pneumonia extent and severity might be useful for clinical and radiological patient stratification.","Carvalho, Alysson Roncally Silva; Guimarães, Alan; Garcia, Thiego de Souza Oliveira; Madeira Werberich, Gabriel; Ceotto, Victor Fraga; Bozza, Fernando Augusto; Rodrigues, Rosana Souza; Pinto, Joana Sofia F.; Schmitt, Willian Rebouças; Zin, Walter Araujo; França, Manuela",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658944/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.617657,304

Although daylight provides the proper qualities of light for promoting circadian alignment, our modern indoor lifestyles offer fewer opportunities for adequate daylight exposure. This field study explores how increasing circadian-effective light in residences affects circadian phase, sleep, vitality, and mental health. In this crossover study, 20 residents spent one week in their apartments with electrochromic glass windows and another week with functionally standard windows with blinds. Calibrated light sensors revealed higher daytime circadian-effective light levels with the electrochromic glass windows, and participants exhibited consistent melatonin onset, a 22-min earlier sleep onset, and higher sleep regularity. In the blinds condition, participants exhibited a 15-min delay in dim light melatonin onset, a delay in subjective vitality throughout the day, and an overall lower positive affect. This study demonstrates the impact of daytime lighting on the physiological, behavioral, and subjective measures of circadian health in a real-world environment and stresses the importance of designing buildings that optimize daylight for human health and wellbeing.","Nagare, Rohan; Woo, May; MacNaughton, Piers; Plitnick, Barbara; Tinianov, Brandon; Figueiro, Mariana",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639284/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18199980,304

This study describes the prevalence, trends, inequalities, and drivers of EM and ECB in South Asia using eight rounds of Demographic and Health Survey data across 13 years. We report the percentage of ever‐married women aged 20–24 years (n = 105,150) married before 18 years (EM) and with a live birth before 20 years (ECB). Relative trends were examined using average annual rate of reduction (AARR). Inequalities were examined by geography, marital household wealth, residence, and education. Sociodemographic drivers of changes for EM were assessed using regression decomposition analyses. We find that EM/ECB are still common in Bangladesh (69%/69%), Nepal (52%/51%), India (41%/39%), and Pakistan (37%/38%), with large subnational variation in most countries. EM has declined fastest in India (AARR of –3.8%/year), Pakistan (–2.8%/year), and Bangladesh (–1.5%/year), but EM elimination by 2030 will not occur at these rates. Equity analyses show that poor, uneducated women in rural areas are disproportionately burdened. Regression decomposition analysis shows that improvements in wealth and education explained 44% (India) to 96% (Nepal) of the actual EM reduction. Investments across multiple sectors are required to understand and address EM and ECB, which are pervasive social determinants of maternal and child wellbeing.","Scott, Samuel; Nguyen, Phuong Hong; Neupane, Sumanta; Pramanik, Priyanjana; Nanda, Priya; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.; Afsana, Kaosar; Menon, Purnima",Ann N Y Acad Sci,https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33258141/,304

Here, we present a streamlined workflow—COVseq—which can be used to generate highly multiplexed sequencing libraries compatible with Illumina platforms from hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 samples in parallel, in a rapid and cost-effective manner. We benchmark COVseq against a standard library preparation method (NEBNext) on 29 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, reaching 95.4% of concordance between single-nucleotide variants detected by both methods. Application of COVseq to 245 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive samples demonstrates the ability of the method to reliably detect emergent VOC as well as its compatibility with downstream phylogenetic analyses. A cost analysis shows that COVseq could be used to sequence thousands of samples at less than 15 USD per sample, including library preparation and sequencing costs. We conclude that COVseq is a versatile and scalable method that is immediately applicable for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and easily adaptable to other pathogens such as influenza viruses.","Simonetti, Michele; Zhang, Ning; Harbers, Luuk; Milia, Maria Grazia; Brossa, Silvia; Huong Nguyen, Thi Thu; Cerutti, Francesco; Berrino, Enrico; Sapino, Anna; Bienko, Magda; Sottile, Antonino; Ghisetti, Valeria; Crosetto, Nicola",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24078-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162869/,304

Although there is no direct evidence that there is ADE in COVID-19, this potential risk is a huge challenge for prevention and vaccine development. This article focuses on the virus-induced ADE phenomenon and its molecular mechanism.

Monocyte is an important member of the body’s innate immune system; however its role in KD is still elusive due to its ambiguous heterogeneity and complex functions. We aim to comprehensively delineate monocyte heterogeneity in healthy and KD infants and to reveal the underlying mechanism for KD. METHODS: Peripheral monocytes were enriched from peripheral blood samples of two healthy infants and two KD infants. scRNA-seq was performed to acquire the transcriptomic atlas of monocytes. Bio-information analysis was utilized to identify monocyte subsets and explore their functions and differentiation states. SELL+CD14+CD16- monocytes were validated using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Three monocyte subsets were identified in healthy infants, including CD14+CD16- monocytes, CD14+CD16+ monocytes, and CD14(Low)CD16+ monocytes. Cell trajectory analysis revealed that the three monocyte subsets represent a linear differentiation, and possess different biological functions. Furthermore, SELL+CD14+CD16- monocytes, which were poorly differentiated and relating to neutrophil activation, were found to be expanded in KD. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a valuable resource for deciphering the monocyte heterogeneity in healthy infants and uncover the altered monocyte subsets in KD patients, suggesting potential biomarkers for KD diagnosis and treatment.","Geng, Zhimin; Tao, Yijing; Zheng, Fenglei; Wu, Linlin; Wang, Ying; Wang, Yujia; Sun, Yameng; Fu, Songling; Wang, Wei; Xie, Chunhong; Zhang, Yiying; Gong, Fangqi",J Inflamm Res,https://doi.org/10.2147/jir.s293993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758528/,304

METHODS: An anonymized survey was conducted among German private practice urologists during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The χ2 test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: 257 urologists were included in the final analysis. Thirty-five (14.0%) of urologists had used telemedicine as part of their consultation, and 221 (86.0%) had not used telemedicine. There was no difference between telemedicine adoption rates between rural and urban settings. Telemedicine users were significantly more satisfied with the information they had received regarding telemedicine issues. Users saw the greatest barrier to telemedicine that patients do not take up the offer of telemedicine. Nonusers were most concerned with unclear indications for telemedicine followed by lesser reimbursements during telemedicine than in-person visitations. Users were significantly more likely to use telemedicine beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Urologists, who wanted to use the service in the future, wanted an active support by the German society of urology and guidelines for telemedicine. Last, users and nonusers preferred telemedicine for non-acute chronic diseases and follow-up visitations.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during March and April, 2020, in Shiraz, Iran. Pregnant mothers registered in maternity clinics affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences were included. An online self-administered checklist was used. It included socio-demographic, obstetric and medical histories, and the short form of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) to evaluate depression, anxiety, and stress. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In total, 540 pregnant mothers answered the questionnaire. 83.5% had no comorbidity. Abnormal depression scores were significantly higher in those who had no insurance (OR = 2.5) and in those with poor self-rated health (SRH) (OR = 27.8). Pregnant mothers with lower SRH and two or more comorbidities had a higher chance of having an abnormal level of anxiety subscale (6.9, 3.7 times, retrospectively).

675602,Management of Traumatic Spinal Fracture in Patient with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Situation,2020-05-12,"To design an effective and safe vaccine against betacoronaviruses, it is necessary to use their evolutionarily conservative antigenic determinants that will elicit the combination of strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Targeting such determinants minimizes the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection. This phenomenon was observed in animal trials of experimental vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV that were developed based on inactivated coronavirus or vector constructs expressing the spike protein (S) of the virion. The substitution and glycosylation of certain amino acids in the antigenic determinants of the S-protein, as well as its conformational changes, can lead to the same effect in a new experimental vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Using more conservative structural and accessory viral proteins for the vaccine antigenic determinants will help to avoid this problem. This review outlines approaches for developing vaccines against the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that are based on non-pathogenic viral vectors. For efficient prevention of infections caused by respiratory pathogens the ability of the vaccine to stimulate mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract is important. Such a vaccine can be developed using non-pathogenic Sendai virus vector, since it can be administered intranasally and induce a mucosal immune response that strengthens the antiviral barrier in the respiratory tract and provides reliable protection against infection.","Zaichuk, T.

An initial step in estimating the impact of these changes is characterizing the patients, visits, and diagnoses for whom care is being delayed or deferred. Methods: We conducted an observational study, examining demographics and diagnoses for all patient visits to the ED of an urban Level-1 trauma center before and after the state declaration and compared them to visits from a similar period in 2019. We estimated the ratios of the before and after periods using Poisson regression, calculated the percent change with respect to 2019 for total ED visits, patient characteristics, and diagnoses, and then evaluated the interactions between each factor and the overall change in ED visits. Results: There was a significant 35.2% drop in overall ED visits after the state declaration. Disproportionate declines were seen in visits by pediatric and older patients, women, and Medicare recipients as well as for presentations of syncope, cerebrovascular accidents, urolithiasis, abdominal and back pain. Significantly disproportionate increases were seen in ED visits for potential symptoms of COVID-19, including URIs, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Conclusions: Patient concerns about health care settings and public health have significantly altered care-seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall and differential declines in ED visits for certain demographic groups and disease processes should prompt efforts to encourage care-seeking and research to monitor for the morbidity and mortality that is likely to result from delayed or deferred care.","Westgard, B.

Products enriched with antioxidants can be referred to such category. For food producers, the development of products “for health” is usually connected with significant investment, whereas the final success of innovative products does not always meet the expectations. The greatest part of such products is withdrawn from the market during the first year. It is important for manufacturers to learn consumer behavior in order to ensure sale growth and a stable market position. The purpose of this study was to study consumer reception of products containing antioxidants. (It is important to conduct market research to identify the needs of buyers in order to maintain a stable position in the market. In order to study this issue, we analyzed the consumer perception of foods with antioxidant properties.) We studied the consumer perception of products with antioxidant properties with regard to choice predictors and barriers for purchasing, which finally determine the success of the product on the market. For this purpose, we conducted a survey of 721 consumers of the South Urals. The results of the statistical analysis done with the help of SPSS proved that South Ural consumers in general are ready to purchase products containing antioxidants. Besides, producers must bring information concerning the real value of the product and win the consumer trust and confidence as far as these are the main predictors determining the choice for purchasing the products containing antioxidants. Misunderstanding of the role antioxidants play in the human body may lead to perception of risk concerning consumption of such products and rejection of the purchase.","Fatkullin, Rinat; Naumenko, Natalya; Popova, Natalia; Ruskina, Alena; Kalinina, Irina; Potoroko, Irina",Int J Food Sci,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9971425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336998/,304

COVID-19 will soon become endemic in Pakistan, the government should adopt COVID-19 RDT kits for trace, test and quarantine activities. Methodology: Considering the availability of COVI-19 rapid diagnostic kits, 596 individuals all previously COVID-19 PCR tested were made part of this cross sectional study. Simple random sampling was used for the selection of study participants. The whole study was conducted during September and October 2020. Results: The major findings of this study is clearly showing that the Positive Likely hood ratio of the COVID-19 RDT Kits (LR+) is well above 1; similarly the Negative Likely hood ratio is approaching 0.On the other hand the Sensitivity and Specificity 80% and 74% respectively .Similarly study found statistically significant association was between RDT out comes and Last PCR Test status, Occupation and Contact with COVID-19 positive individuals. While other variables like Gender, BCG Vaccination and history of seasonal flu vaccinations were found to have no significant associations with COVID-19 RDT Kit out comes. Conclusion: Being the first study of its kind in Pakistan the major findings of this study are almost in line with the set hypothesis and objectives of this study and based on study findings it will be of high value to use COVID-19 RDT kits during mass screening especially during Test, Trace and Quarantine activities.","Arif, M.; Larik, E.; Saeed, A.; Baig, M.

683869,Care for Older People with Dementia During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-01-27,"Every choice we make in health professions education has a cost, whether it be financial or otherwise; by choosing one action (e.g., integrating more simulation, studying more for a summative examination) we lose the opportunity to take an alternative action (e.g., freeing up time for other teaching, leisure time). Economics significantly shapes the way we behave and think as educators and learners and so there is increasing interest in using economic ways of thinking and approaches to examine and understand how choices are made, the influence of constraints and boundaries in educational decision making, and how costs are felt. Thus, in this article, we provide a brief historical overview of modern economics, to illustrate how the core concepts of economics—scarcity (and desirability), rationality, and optimization—developed over time. We explain the important concept of bounded rationality, which explains how individual, meso-factors and contextual factors influence decision making. We then consider the opportunities that these concepts afford for health professions education and research. We conclude by proposing that embracing economic thinking opens up new questions and new ways of approaching old questions which can add knowledge about how choice is enacted in contemporary health professions education.","Cleland, J.

Here, we evaluate circulating human CD4 T cells collected prior to 2020 for reactivity towards hCoV spike proteins, probing for the ability to produce IFN-γ, IL-2 or granzyme B. We find robust reactivity to spike-derived epitopes, comparable to influenza, but highly variable abundance and functional potential across subjects, depending on age and viral antigen specificity. To explore the potential of these memory cells to be recruited in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we examined the same subjects for cross-reactive recognition of epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, membrane/envelope, and spike. The functional potential of these cross-reactive CD4 T cells was highly variable, with nucleocapsid-specific CD4 T cells, but not spike-reactive cells showing exceptionally high levels of granzyme production upon stimulation. These results are considered in light of recruitment of hCoV-reactive cells into responses of humans to SARS-CoV infections or vaccinations.","Richards, Katherine A; Glover, Maryah; Crawford, Jeremy C; Thomas, Paul; White, Chantelle; Sant, Andrea J",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33556959/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab076,304
684929,Deceleration capacity is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19,2021-08-02,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined Twitter for public health surveillance during a mass gathering in Canada with two objectives: to explore the feasibility of acquiring, categorizing and using geolocated Twitter data and to compare Twitter data against other data sources used for Pan Parapan American Games (P/PAG) surveillance. METHODS: Syndrome definitions were created using keyword categorization to extract posts from Twitter. Categories were developed iteratively for four relevant syndromes: respiratory, gastrointestinal, heat-related illness, and influenza-like illness (ILI). All data sources corresponded to the location of Toronto, Canada. Twitter data were acquired from a publicly available stream representing a 1% random sample of tweets from June 26 to September 10, 2015. Cross-correlation analyses of time series data were conducted between Twitter and comparator surveillance data sources: emergency department visits, telephone helpline calls, laboratory testing positivity rate, reportable disease data, and temperature. RESULTS: The frequency of daily tweets that were classified into syndromes was low, with the highest mean number of daily tweets being for ILI and respiratory syndromes (22.0 and 21.6, respectively) and the lowest, for the heat syndrome (4.1). Cross-correlation analyses of Twitter data demonstrated significant correlations for heat syndrome with two data sources: telephone helpline calls (r = 0.4) and temperature data (r = 0.5). CONCLUSION: Using simple syndromes based on keyword classification of geolocated tweets, we found a correlation between tweets and two routine data sources for heat alerts, the only public health event detected during P/PAG. Further research is needed to understand the role for Twitter in surveillance.

690467,Reversible platypnea-orthodeoxia in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors,2020-08-07,"Many studies imply causal links between linguistic competencies and Theory of Mind (ToM). But despite Dyslexia being a prime example of linguistic deficits, studies on whether it is related to ToM have been relatively unforthcoming. In the first of 2 studies (N = 89), independently-diagnosed dyslexic adults and non-dyslexic adults were presented with false-belief vignettes via computer, answering 4 types of question (Factual, Inference, 1st-order ToM & 2nd-order ToM). Dyslexia related to lower false-belief scores. Study 2 (N = 93) replicated this result with a non-computer-based variant on the false-belief task. We considered the possibility that the apparent-issue with ToM is caused by processing demands more associated to domains of cognition such as language, than to ToM itself. Addressing this possibility, study 2 additionally utilised the ToM30Q questionnaire, designed largely to circumvent issues related to language and memory. Principal-Components analysis extracted 4 factors, 2 capturing perceptual/representational ToM, and the other 2 capturing affective components related to ToM. The ToM30Q was validated via its associations to a published measure of empathy, replication of the female gender advantage over males, and for one factor from the ToM30Q there was a correlation with an existing published index of ToM. However, when we considered the performance of dyslexic and non-dyslexic participants using the ToM30Q, we found absolutely no difference between them. The contrasting findings from our 2 studies here, arguably offer the first experimental evidence with adults, that there is in fact no ToM deficit in dyslexia. Additionally, this finding raises the possibility that some other groups considered in some sense atypical, failed ToM tasks, not because they actually have a ToM deficit at all, but rather because they are asked to reveal their ToM competence through cognitive domains, such as language and memory.","Wright, Barlow C.; Wright, Bernice A.
