68,An object simulation model for modeling hypothetical disease epidemics – EpiFlex,2006-08-23,"BACKGROUND: EpiFlex is a flexible, easy to use computer model for a single computer, intended to be operated by one user who need not be an expert. Its purpose is to study in-silico the epidemic behavior of a wide variety of diseases, both known and theoretical, by simulating their spread at the level of individuals contracting and infecting others. To understand the system fully, this paper must be read together in conjunction with study of the software and its results. EpiFlex is evaluated using results from modeling influenza A epidemics and comparing them with a variety of field data sources and other types of modeling. EpiFlex is an object-oriented Monte Carlo system, allocating entities to correspond to individuals, disease vectors, diseases, and the locations that hosts may inhabit. EpiFlex defines eight different contact types available for a disease. Contacts occur inside locations within the model. Populations are composed of demographic groups, each of which has a cycle of movement between locations. Within locations, superspreading is defined by skewing of contact distributions. RESULTS: EpiFlex indicates three phenomena of interest for public health: (1) R(0 )is variable, and the smaller the population, the larger the infected fraction within that population will be; (2) significant compression/synchronization between cities by a factor of roughly 2 occurs between the early incubation phase of a multi-city epidemic and the major manifestation phase; (3) if better true morbidity data were available, more asymptomatic hosts would be seen to spread disease than we currently believe is the case for influenza. These results suggest that field research to study such phenomena, while expensive, should be worthwhile. CONCLUSION: Since EpiFlex shows all stages of disease progression, detailed insight into the progress of epidemics is possible. EpiFlex shows the characteristic multimodality and apparently random variation characteristic of real world data, but does so as an emergent property of a carefully constructed model of disease dynamics and is not simply a stochastic system. EpiFlex can provide a better understanding of infectious diseases and strategies for response.","Hanley, Brian",Theor Biol Med Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1570461/,53

864,Application of Consensus Scoring and Principal Component Analysis for Virtual Screening against β-Secretase (BACE-1),2012-06-11,"BACKGROUND: In order to identify novel chemical classes of β-secretase (BACE-1) inhibitors, an alternative scoring protocol, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), was proposed to summarize most of the information from the original scoring functions and re-rank the results from the virtual screening against BACE-1. METHOD: Given a training set (50 BACE-1 inhibitors and 9950 inactive diverse compounds), three rank-based virtual screening methods, individual scoring, conventional consensus scoring and PCA, were judged by the hit number in the top 1% of the ranked list. The docking poses were generated by Surflex, five scoring functions (Surflex_Score, D_Score, G_Score, ChemScore, and PMF_Score) were used for pose extraction. For each pose group, twelve scoring functions (Surflex_Score, D_Score, G_Score, ChemScore, PMF_Score, LigScore1, LigScore2, PLP1, PLP2, jain, Ludi_1, and Ludi_2) were used for the pose rank. For a test set, 113,228 chemical compounds (Sigma-Aldrich® corporate chemical directory) were docked by Surflex, then ranked by the same three ranking methods motioned above to select the potential active compounds for experimental test. RESULTS: For the training set, the PCA approach yielded consistently superior rankings compared to conventional consensus scoring and single scoring. For the test set, the top 20 compounds according to conventional consensus scoring were experimentally tested, no inhibitor was found. Then, we relied on PCA scoring protocol to test another different top 20 compounds and two low micromolar inhibitors (S450588 and 276065) were emerged through the BACE-1 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. CONCLUSION: The PCA method extends the conventional consensus scoring in a quantitative statistical manner and would appear to have considerable potential for chemical screening applications.","Liu, Shu; Fu, Rao; Zhou, Li-Hua; Chen, Sheng-Ping",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3372491/,53
1152,A Lattice Model for Influenza Spreading,2013-05-22,"We construct a stochastic SIR model for influenza spreading on a D-dimensional lattice, which represents the dynamic contact network of individuals. An age distributed population is placed on the lattice and moves on it. The displacement from a site to a nearest neighbor empty site, allows individuals to change the number and identities of their contacts. The dynamics on the lattice is governed by an attractive interaction between individuals belonging to the same age-class. The parameters, which regulate the pattern dynamics, are fixed fitting the data on the age-dependent daily contact numbers, furnished by the Polymod survey. A simple SIR transmission model with a nearest neighbors interaction and some very basic adaptive mobility restrictions complete the model. The model is validated against the age-distributed Italian epidemiological data for the influenza A(H1N1) during the [Image: see text] season, with sensible predictions for the epidemiological parameters. For an appropriate topology of the lattice, we find that, whenever the accordance between the contact patterns of the model and the Polymod data is satisfactory, there is a good agreement between the numerical and the experimental epidemiological data. This result shows how rich is the information encoded in the average contact patterns of individuals, with respect to the analysis of the epidemic spreading of an infectious disease.","Liccardo, Antonella; Fierro, Annalisa",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3661600/,53
1185,A Simulation Optimization Approach to Epidemic Forecasting,2013-06-27,"Reliable forecasts of influenza can aid in the control of both seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. We introduce a simulation optimization (SIMOP) approach for forecasting the influenza epidemic curve. This study represents the final step of a project aimed at using a combination of simulation, classification, statistical and optimization techniques to forecast the epidemic curve and infer underlying model parameters during an influenza outbreak. The SIMOP procedure combines an individual-based model and the Nelder-Mead simplex optimization method. The method is used to forecast epidemics simulated over synthetic social networks representing Montgomery County in Virginia, Miami, Seattle and surrounding metropolitan regions. The results are presented for the first four weeks. Depending on the synthetic network, the peak time could be predicted within a 95% CI as early as seven weeks before the actual peak. The peak infected and total infected were also accurately forecasted for Montgomery County in Virginia within the forecasting period. Forecasting of the epidemic curve for both seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks is a complex problem, however this is a preliminary step and the results suggest that more can be achieved in this area.","Nsoesie, Elaine O.; Beckman, Richard J.; Shashaani, Sara; Nagaraj, Kalyani S.; Marathe, Madhav V.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694918/,53
1439,Injection Route and TLR9 Agonist Addition Significantly Impact Heroin Vaccine Efficacy,2014-02-11,"[Image: see text] Active immunization is an effective means of blocking the pharmacodynamic effects of drugs and holds promise as a treatment for heroin addiction. Previously, we demonstrated the efficacy of our first-generation vaccine in blocking heroin self-administration in rats, however, many vaccine components can be modified to further improve performance. Herein we examine the effects of varying heroin vaccine injection route and adjuvant formulation. Mice immunized via subcutaneous (sc) injection exhibited inferior anti-heroin titers compared to intraperitoneal (ip) and sc/ip coadministration injection routes. Addition of TLR9 agonist cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 (CpG ODN 1826) to the original alum adjuvant elicited superior antibody titers and opioid affinities compared to alum alone. To thoroughly assess vaccine efficacy, full dose–response curves were generated for heroin-induced analgesia in both hot plate and tail immersion tests. Mice treated with CpG ODN 1826 exhibited greatly shifted dose–response curves (10–13-fold vs unvaccinated controls) while non-CpG ODN vaccine groups did not exhibit the same robust effect (2–7-fold shift for ip and combo, 2–3-fold shift for sc). Our results suggest that CpG ODN 1826 is a highly potent adjuvant, and injection routes should be considered for development of small molecule–protein conjugate vaccines. Lastly, this study has established a new standard for assessing drugs of abuse vaccines, wherein a full dose–response curve should be performed in an appropriate behavioral task.","Bremer, Paul T.; Schlosburg, Joel E.; Lively, Jenny M.; Janda, Kim D.",Mol Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3993894/,53

Values were found to be consistent with those of other Pteropus species. Four hundred and forty-seven animals were sampled over 12 months and significant differences were found between age, sex, reproductive and body condition cohorts in the sample population. Mean values for each cohort fell within the determined normal adult reference range, with the exception of elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase in juvenile animals. Hematologic and biochemistry parameters of injured animals showed little or no deviation from the normal reference values for minor injuries, while two animals with more severe injury or abscessation showed leucocytosis, anaemia, thrombocytosis, hyperglobulinemia and hypoalbuminemia.","McMichael, Lee; Edson, Daniel; McLaughlin, Amanda; Mayer, David; Kopp, Steven; Meers, Joanne; Field, Hume",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418720/,53
2172,Chasing Ebola through the Endosomal Labyrinth,2016-03-22,"During virus entry, the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus (EBOV) undergoes a complex set of transformations within the endosomal network. Tools to study EBOV entry have been limited to static immunofluorescence or biochemical and functional analysis. In a recent article in mBio, Spence et al. reported a novel, live-cell-imaging method that tracks this transformational journey of EBOV in real time [J. S. Spence, T. B. Krause, E. Mittler, R. K. Jangra, and K. Chandran, mBio 7(1):e01857-15, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01857-15]. The assay validates known mechanisms of EBOV entry and sheds light on some novel intricacies. Direct evidence supports the hypothesis that fusion is a rare event that starts in maturing early endosomes, is completed in late endosomes, and occurs entirely in Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-positive (NPC1(+)) compartments. The study demonstrated that lipid mixing and productive fusion are temporally decoupled, with different energetic barriers and a protease-dependent step between the two events. Analysis of the mechanism of action of an important class of EBOV neutralizing antibodies, such as KZ52 and ZMapp, provides direct evidence that these antibodies act by inhibiting the membrane fusion.","Aman, M.

2204,Integrated sequence and immunology filovirus database at Los Alamos,2016-04-21,"The Ebola outbreak of 2013–15 infected more than 28 000 people and claimed more lives than all previous filovirus outbreaks combined. Governmental agencies, clinical teams, and the world scientific community pulled together in a multifaceted response ranging from prevention and disease control, to evaluating vaccines and therapeutics in human trials. As this epidemic is finally coming to a close, refocusing on long-term prevention strategies becomes paramount. Given the very real threat of future filovirus outbreaks, and the inherent uncertainty of the next outbreak virus and geographic location, it is prudent to consider the extent and implications of known natural diversity in advancing vaccines and therapeutic approaches. To facilitate such consideration, we have updated and enhanced the content of the filovirus portion of Los Alamos Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses Database. We have integrated and performed baseline analysis of all family Filoviridae sequences deposited into GenBank, with associated immune response data, and metadata, and we have added new computational tools with web-interfaces to assist users with analysis. Here, we (i) describe the main features of updated database, (ii) provide integrated views and some basic analyses summarizing evolutionary patterns as they relate to geo-temporal data captured in the database and (iii) highlight the most conserved regions in the proteome that may be useful for a T cell vaccine strategy.

2514,Screening and Identification of APOC1 as a Novel Potential Biomarker for Differentiate of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Children,2016-12-15,"Background: Although Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children, the currently used diagnostic methods are not optimal. Proteomics is increasingly being used to study the biomarkers of infectious diseases. Methods: Label-free quantitative proteomics and liquid chromatography-mass/mass spectrometry were used to analyze the fold change of protein expression in plasma of children with MP pneumonia (MPP), infectious disease control (IDC), and healthy control (HC) groups. Selected proteins that can distinguish MPP from HC and IDC were further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: After multivariate analyses, 27 potential plasma biomarkers were identified to be expressed differently among child MPP, HC, and IDC groups. Among these proteins, SERPINA3, APOC1, ANXA6, KNTC1, and CFLAR were selected for ELISA verification. SERPINA3, APOC1, and CFLAR levels were significantly different among the three groups and the ratios were consistent with the trends of proteomics results. A comparison of MPP patients and HC showed APOC1 had the largest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.853, with 77.6% sensitivity and 81.1% specificity. When APOC1 levels were compared between MPP and IDC patients, it also showed a relatively high AUC of 0.882, with 77.6% sensitivity and 85.3% specificity. Conclusion: APOC1 is a potential biomarker for the rapid and noninvasive diagnosis of MPP in children. The present finding may offer new insights into the pathogenesis and biomarker selection of MPP in children.","Li, Jieqiong; Sun, Lin; Xu, Fang; Qi, Hui; Shen, Chen; Jiao, Weiwei; Xiao, Jing; Li, Qinjing; Xu, Baoping; Shen, Adong",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5156883/,53
2647,Chemical property based sequence characterization of PpcA and its homolog proteins PpcB-E: A mathematical approach,2017-03-31,"Periplasmic c7 type cytochrome A (PpcA) protein is determined in Geobacter sulfurreducens along with its other four homologs (PpcB-E). From the crystal structure viewpoint the observation emerges that PpcA protein can bind with Deoxycholate (DXCA), while its other homologs do not. But it is yet to be established with certainty the reason behind this from primary protein sequence information. This study is primarily based on primary protein sequence analysis through the chemical basis of embedded amino acids. Firstly, we look for the chemical group specific score of amino acids. Along with this, we have developed a new methodology for the phylogenetic analysis based on chemical group dissimilarities of amino acids. This new methodology is applied to the cytochrome c7 family members and pinpoint how a particular sequence is differing with others. Secondly, we build a graph theoretic model on using amino acid sequences which is also applied to the cytochrome c7 family members and some unique characteristics and their domains are highlighted. Thirdly, we search for unique patterns as subsequences which are common among the group or specific individual member. In all the cases, we are able to show some distinct features of PpcA that emerges PpcA as an outstanding protein compared to its other homologs, resulting towards its binding with deoxycholate. Similarly, some notable features for the structurally dissimilar protein PpcD compared to the other homologs are also brought out. Further, the five members of cytochrome family being homolog proteins, they must have some common significant features which are also enumerated in this study.","Das, Jayanta Kumar; Pal Choudhury, Pabitra",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5376323/,53

In this study we analyzed proteomics data obtained with the SomaLogic technology from blood serum of a cohort of patients and matched healthy subjects. We developed a workflow based on biomarker identification and network-based pathway analysis that allowed us to describe different deregulated pathways. In addition to muscle-related functions, we identified other biological processes such as apoptosis, signaling in the immune system and neurotrophin signaling as significantly modulated in patients compared with controls. Moreover, our network-based analysis identified the involvement of FoxO transcription factors as putative regulators of different pathways. On the whole, this study provided a global view of the molecular processes involved in Duchenne muscular dystrophy that are decipherable from serum proteome.","Parolo, Silvia; Marchetti, Luca; Lauria, Mario; Misselbeck, Karla; Scott-Boyer, Marie-Pier; Caberlotto, Laura; Priami, Corrado",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5846794/,53

3201,"Therapeutics and Immunoprophylaxis Against Noroviruses and Rotaviruses: The Past, Present, and Future",2018-03-11,"BACKGROUND: Noroviruses and rotaviruses are important viral etiologies of severe gastroenteritis. Noroviruses are the primary cause of nonbacterial diarrheal outbreaks in humans, whilst rotaviruses are a major cause of childhood diarrhea. Although both enteric pathogens substantially impact human health and economies, there are no approved drugs against noroviruses and rotaviruses so far. On the other hand, whilst the currently licensed rotavirus vaccines have been successfully implemented in over 100 countries, the most advanced norovirus vaccine has recently completed phase-I and II trials. METHODS: We performed a structured search of bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research litera-ture on advances in the fields of norovirus and rotavirus therapeutics and immunoprophylaxis. RESULTS: Technological advances coupled with a proper understanding of viral morphology and replication over the past decade has facilitated pioneering research on therapeutics and immunoprophylaxis against noroviruses and rotaviruses, with promising outcomes in human clinical trials of some of the drugs and vaccines. This review focuses on the various developments in the fields of norovirus and rotavirus thera-peutics and immunoprophylaxis, such as potential antiviral drug molecules, passive immunotherapies (oral human immunoglobulins, egg yolk and bovine colostral antibodies, llama-derived nanobodies, and anti-bodies expressed in probiotics, plants, rice grains and insect larvae), immune system modulators, probiot-ics, phytochemicals and other biological substances such as bovine milk proteins, therapeutic nanoparti-cles, hydrogels and viscogens, conventional viral vaccines (live and inactivated whole virus vaccines), and genetically engineered viral vaccines (reassortant viral particles, virus-like particles (VLPs) and other sub-unit recombinant vaccines including multi-valent viral vaccines, edible plant vaccines, and encapsulated viral particles).

3674,Consequences of delays and imperfect implementation of isolation in epidemic control,2019-03-05,"For centuries isolation has been the main control strategy of unforeseen epidemic outbreaks. When implemented in full and without delay, isolation is very effective. However, flawless implementation is seldom feasible in practice. We present an epidemic model called SIQ with an isolation protocol, focusing on the consequences of delays and incomplete identification of infected hosts. The continuum limit of this model is a system of Delay Differential Equations, the analysis of which reveals clearly the dependence of epidemic evolution on model parameters including disease reproductive number, isolation probability, speed of identification of infected hosts and recovery rates. Our model offers estimates on minimum response capabilities needed to curb outbreaks, and predictions of endemic states when containment fails. Critical response capability is expressed explicitly in terms of parameters that are easy to obtain, to assist in the evaluation of funding priorities involving preparedness and epidemics management.","Young, Lai-Sang; Ruschel, Stefan; Yanchuk, Serhiy; Pereira, Tiago",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6401305/,53
3707,Quantifying heterogeneous contact patterns in Japan: a social contact survey,2019-03-20,"BACKGROUND: Social contact surveys can greatly help in quantifying the heterogeneous patterns of infectious disease transmission. The present study aimed to conduct a contact survey in Japan, offering estimates of contact by age and location and validating a social contact matrix using a seroepidemiological dataset of influenza. METHODS: An internet-based questionnaire survey was conducted, covering all 47 prefectures in Japan and including a total of 1476 households. The social contact matrix was quantified assuming reciprocity and using the maximum likelihood method. By imposing several parametric assumptions for the next-generation matrix, the empirical seroepidemiological data of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 was analysed and we estimated the basic reproduction number, R(0). RESULTS: In total, the reported number of contacts on weekdays was 10,682 whereas that on weekend days was 8867. Strong age-dependent assortativity was identified. Forty percent of weekday contacts took place at schools or workplaces, but that declined to 14% on weekends. Accounting for the age-dependent heterogeneity with the known social contact matrix, the minimum value of the Akaike information criterion was obtained and R(0) was estimated at 1.45 (95% confidence interval: 1.42, 1.49). CONCLUSIONS: Survey datasets will be useful for parameterizing the heterogeneous transmission model of various directly transmitted infectious diseases in Japan. Age-dependent assortativity, especially among children, along with numerous contacts in school settings on weekdays implies the potential effectiveness of school closure.

Converging lines of evidence indicate that AEP may be involved in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia. AEP is activated in the aging brain, cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) and promotes the production of amyloid-β (Aβ). We renamed AEP to δ-secretase to emphasize its role in APP fragmentation and Aβ production. AEP also cleaves other substrates, such as tau, α-synuclein, SET, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43, generating neurotoxic fragments and disturbing their physiological functions. The activity of δ-secretase is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Here, we review the recent advances in the role of δ-secretase in neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on its biochemical properties and the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of its activity, and discuss the clinical implications of δ-secretase as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.","Zhang, Zhentao; Tian, Ye; Ye, Keqiang",Transl Neurodegener,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6943888/,53

This virus is the first orbivirus discovered in reptiles. Phylogenetic analyses placed Letea virus as a highly divergent species in the Culicoides-/sand fly-borne orbivirus clade. Gene reassortment and intragenic recombination were detected in the majority of the nine Letea virus strains obtained, implying that these mechanisms play important roles in the evolution and diversification of the virus. However, the screening of arthropods, including Culicoides biting midges collected within the same surveillance program, tested negative for Letea virus infection and could not confirm the arthropod vector of the virus. The study provided complete genome sequences for nine Letea virus strains and new information about orbivirus diversity, host range, ecology and evolution.

Consensus statements defining technical equipment and operational procedures have been published in recent years, but the level of adherence to these has not been evaluated. METHODS: Data summarized here comparing German and European isolation facilities are the partial results of a cross-sectional analysis conducted by the “European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases” that included 48 clinical care facilities in 16 European nations. Data collection was conducted using questionnaires and on-site visits, focussing on aspects of infrastructure, technical equipment, and the availability of trained personnel. RESULTS: Although all centres enrolled were listed as “isolation units”, all aspects evaluated differed broadly. Eighteen facilities fulfilled the definition of a ‘High Level Isolation Unit’, as 6/8 enrolled German facilities did. In contrast, 24 facilities could not operate independently from their co-located hospital. DISCUSSION: Within and between nations contributing data disparities regarding the fulfilment of guidelines published were seen. German isolation facilities mostly fulfilled all criteria evaluated and performed on a high technical level. However, data presented do not reflect the current situation in Germany due to the time that has elapsed since the study was conducted. Hence, longitudinal data collection and harmonisation of terminology at least on national level needs to be implemented.","Schilling, Stefan; Brodt, H.-R.",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080071/,53

5156,Simultaneous Determination of Four Active Components in Tobacco Wastes by LC,2008-12-12,"The effect of short-time treatment with the ionophore monensin, administered intraluminally at concentrations of 5 and 10 μM, was studied on the Golgi apparatus of absorptive cells in the small intestine of the rat. At 2–3 min after treatment most of the Golgi stacks exhibited dilated cisternae. At 4–5 min stacked cisternae were absent; they were replaced by groups of smooth-surfaced vacuoles. Dilatation and vacuolization occurred in the entire stacks without preferential effect on any particular Golgi subcompartment. Monensin did not influence the cytochemical Golgi reaction of thiamine pyrophosphatase and acid phosphatase. The characteristic staining pattern of these two enzymes in all Golgi cisternae of absorptive cells in the proximal small intestine, and the reactivity restricted to trans cisternae in distal segments of the small intestine, were unchanged after treatment with monensin. In the distal small intestine, the cytochemical pattern allowed the monensin-induced vacuoles to be attributed to the former cisor trans-Golgi face. Further, the cytochemical results demonstrate that vacuolization is not restricted to the stacked cisternae, but includes the trans-most cisterna.

There was no difference in serum IgG concentrations between 27 kids fed a colostrum supplement (20 g, derived from cow lacteal secretions) prior to the kids’ first meal (658 ± 703 mg dl(−1)) and 21 kids ingesting maternal colostrum freely (1011 ± 1140 mg dl(−1)) at 24 hours of birth. Hematocrit values, serum glucose and urea concentrations at 24 hours and 5 days of age were unaffected by treatment. Serum total proteins were 14% higher (P < 0.05) in the unsuplemented group than in the supplemented group at 5 d of age. There was no significant difference between the supplemented and unsupplemented kids in daily weight gain from birth to 70 days of age (92 ± 4.8 vs 102 ± 5.1 g day(−1)). Mortality was 4% for kids receiving the colostrum supplement as compared with 0.0% for kids ingesting maternal colostrum only. Results suggest that, in intensively managed non-dairy goats with kiddings in summer, the supplementation of this commercial colostrum derived from cow lacteal secretions and containing antibodies against diverse pathogens organisms did not enhanced growth, survival or immunity under the farming conditions of this study.","Mellado, M.; Pittroff, W.; García, J.

5705,Airflows Around Oxygen Masks: A Potential Source of Infection,2015-12-31,"Housing preweaned dairy calves in pairs rather than individually has been found to positively affect behavioral responses in novel social and environmental situations, but concerns have been raised that close contact among very young animals may impair their health. In previous studies, the level of social contact permitted in individual housing has been auditory, visual, or physical contact. It is unclear how these various levels of social contact compare with each other and to pair housing, when their effects on behavior and health are considered, and whether the timing of pair housing has an effect. To investigate this, 110 Holstein calves (50 males, 60 females) in 11 blocks were paired according to birth date. Within 60 h of birth, each pair of calves was allocated to 1 of 5 treatments: individual housing with auditory contact (I), individual housing with auditory and visual contact (V), individual housing with auditory, visual, and tactile contact (T), pair housing (P), or individual housing with auditory and visual contact the first 2 wk followed by pair housing (VP). At 6 wk of age, calves were subjected to a social test and a novel environment test. In the social test, all pair-housed calves (P and VP) had a shorter latency to sniff an unfamiliar calf than did individually housed calves (I, V, and T), whereas calves with physical contact (T, P, and VP) sniffed the unfamiliar calf for longer than calves on the remaining treatments (I and V). In the novel environment test, calves with physical contact (T, P, and VP) had a lower heart rate, and more of these calves vocalized during the test compared with calves without physical contact (I and V). No effect of treatment was found for clinical scores, levels of the 5 most common pathogens in feces, or in development of serum antibodies against the 3 most common respiratory pathogens. Calves housed individually are more fearful of unfamiliar calves than are pair-housed calves. Contrary to common belief, the allowance of physical contact and pair housing had no effects on the health of the calves.","Jensen, Margit Bak; Larsen, Lars Erik",J Dairy Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094583/,53
5723,Sensitivity of bats to urbanization: a review,2014-10-23,"Influenza viruses infect millions of people around the globe annually, usually causing self-limited upper respiratory tract infections. However, a small but non-negligible proportion of patients suffer from life-threatening pulmonary disease. Those affected include otherwise healthy individuals, and children with primary infections in particular. Much effort has been devoted to virological studies of influenza and vaccine development. By contrast, the enormous interindividual variability in susceptibility to influenza has received very little attention. One interesting hypothesis is that interindividual variability is driven largely by the genetic makeup of the infected patients. Unbiased genomic approaches have been used to search for genetic lesions in children with life-threatening pulmonary influenza. Four monogenic causes of severe influenza pneumonitis—deficiencies of GATA2, IRF7, IRF9, and TLR3—have provided evidence that severe influenza pneumonitis can be genetic and often in patients with no other severe infections. These deficiencies highlight the importance of human type I and III IFN-mediated immunity for host defense against influenza. Clinical penetrance is incomplete, and the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. However, human genetic studies have clearly revealed that seemingly sporadic and isolated life-threatening influenza pneumonitis in otherwise healthy individuals can be genetic.","Zhang, Qian",Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094886/,53

DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study. SETTING: A university hospital pediatric intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Nineteen children with ARDS (PaO(2)/FIO(2)<200) unresponsive to conventional ventilation treated with HFO from January 1995 to September 1996. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The following were recorded: demographic, arterial blood gas and ventilator variables at the time points 0, 6, 12 and 24 h after the start of HFO; PRISM in the first 24 h of admission and pediatric respiratory failure and multiple organ system failure scores on the day of starting HFO. The mortality rate was 26% (5/19). The survival was better than predicted by the Pediatric Respiratory Failure score (p<0.01). None of the scores differentiated survivors from non-survivors (p>0.25). There was no significant change in oxygenation index over the first 24 h (p>0.18). Of patients with an initial oxygenation index higher than 20 who did not have at least a 20% reduction in oxygenation index by the time 6 h, 6/9 (67%) survived (sensitivity 75%, specificity 57%). CONCLUSIONS: Survival in pediatric ARDS patients treated with HFO could not be predicted using several outcome scores or the oxygenation index (in the first 24 h). Survival was significantly better than predicted by the Pediatric Respiratory Failure score. A prospective randomized controlled trial of HFO in ARDS is warranted.","Anton, Natalie; Joffe, Kenneth M.; Joffe, Ari R.",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095387/,53

The current recommendations coincide to the effect that perioperative transfusion is unnecessary up to a Hb concentration of 10 g/dl (6.21 mmol/l) even in older patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidity and is only recommended in cases of Hb <6 g/dl (<3.72 mmol/l) in otherwise healthy subjects including pregnant women and children. Critically ill patients with multiple trauma and sepsis do not seem to benefit from transfusions up to Hb concentrations >9 g/dl (>5.59 mmol/l).

Studies using the mitochondrial genes, Cytochrome Oxidase Sub-Unit 1 (cox1) and small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S), provide some nucleotide detail for understanding the evolution and phylogeography of this species. Despite this, the origins of the invasion remain unknown, as do the origins of its parasites. This study provides the full annotated mitochondrial genome (15,460 bp) of D. haemobaphes, consisting of 2 rRNAs, 24 tRNAs and 14 protein coding genes. Mitochondrial genes from the UK isolate are compared to existing data on NCBI and are used in a concatenated phylogenetic approach and identify D. haemobaphes as an early member of the Gammaridae (Amphipoda). Viral, bacterial, protistan and microsporidian parasites are present across the Gammaridae, including D. haemobaphes, suggesting the ancestor of the Gammaridae harboured related diseases, and that further screening of amphipods is likely to reveal further microparasite diversity. This correlation suggests that other gammarid invaders have the potential to harbour a range of microparasites. The mitochondrial genome of this species will act a resource to facilitate our understanding of geneflow, disease epidemiology and evolutionary history in this invasion-disease model.","Bojko, Jamie",Hydrobiologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100570/,53

7956,"Read all about it: The Lancet's Paper of the Year, 2003",2003-12-19,"As all the enveloped viruses, the entry of influenza viruses includes a number of steps in host cell infection. This chapter summarizes the current knowledge of the entry pathway and the role of the fusion protein of influenza virus, hemagglutinin, in this process. Hemagglutinin (HA) is a trimeric glycoprotein that is present in multiple copies in the membrane envelope of influenza virus. HA contains a fusion peptide, a receptor binding site, a metastable structural motif, and the transmembrane domain. The first step of influenza virus entry is the recognition of the host cell receptor molecule, terminal α-sialic acid, by HA. This multivalent attachment by multiple copies of trimetric HA triggers endocytosis of influenza virus that is contained in the endosome. The endosome-trapped virus traffics via a unidirectional pathway to near the nucleus. At this location, the interior pH of the endosome becomes acidic that induces a dramatic conformational change in HA to insert the fusion peptide into the host membrane, induce juxtaposition of the two membranes, and form a fusion pore that allows the release of the genome segments of influenza virus. HA plays a key role in the entire entry pathway. Inhibitors of virus entry are potentially effective antiviral drugs of influenza viruses.","Luo, Ming",Viral Molecular Machines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123407/,53

AHF has had significant morbidity since its emergence in the 1950s, with a case-fatality rate of the illness without treatment between 15% and 30%. The use of a live attenuated vaccine has markedly reduced the incidence of AHF. Present specific therapy involves the transfusion of immune plasma in defined doses of neutralizing antibodies during the prodromal phase of illness. However, alternative forms of treatment are called for due to current difficulties in early detection of AHF, related to its decrease in incidence, troubles in maintaining adequate stocks of immune plasma, and the absence of effective therapies for severely ill patients that progress to a neurologic–hemorrhagic phase. Ribavirin might be a substitute for immune plasma, provided that the supply is guaranteed. Immune immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies should also be considered.

During this process, viral core components are incorporated into membrane vesicles that contain viral transmembrane proteins, termed ‘spike’ proteins. For many years these spike proteins, which are required for infectivity, were believed to be incorporated into virions via a direct interaction between their cytoplasmic domains and viral core components. More recent evidence shows that, while such direct interactions drive budding of alphaviruses, this may not be the case for negative strand RNA viruses and retroviruses. These viruses can bud particles in the absence of spike proteins, using only viral core components to drive the process. In some cases the spike proteins, without the viral core, can be released as virus‐like particles. Optimal budding and release may, therefore, depend on a ‘push‐and‐pull’ concerted action of core and spike, where oligomerization of both components plays a crucial role.","Cadd, Tamarra L.; Skoging, Ulrica; Liljeström, Peter",Bioessays,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161837/,53

Recently, however, we have described an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay that detects rhinovirus‐specific antibodies in sera and nasal secretions [Barclay and Al‐Nakib, 1987]. Here we describe an evaluation of the ELISA in a study involving 71 adult volunteers inoculated intranasally with human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV‐2). Pre‐and post‐inoculation serum samples and pre‐inoculation nasal washings were tested for the presence of HRV‐2‐specific antibodies by ELISA. Such antibodies were associated with protection against infection when present locally in nasal secretions, but when also present in the serum they were associated with protection against both infection and the development of illness. The antibody concentrations showed strong correlation with each other and with that of antibodies detected by the neutralisation test. Following HRV‐2 infection, rises in HRV‐2‐specific IgA in sera detected by ELISA occurred more frequently than rises in neutralizing antibody. These results suggest that the ELISA is a sensitive and reliable indicator of recent infection, as well as a predictor of homologous immune status.","Barclay, Wendy S.; Callow, Kathleen A.; Sergeant, Marianne; Ai‐Nakib, Widad",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166658/,53

Data from published clinical studies indicate that the infectivity of influenza A virus is probably very high, so that transmission of infection may involve low doses of virus. At low doses, the relation between dose and the probability of infection is approximately linear, so that the reduction in infection risk is proportional to the reduction in exposure due to particle retention of the mask. A population transmission model was set up to explore the impact of population‐wide mask use, allowing estimation of the effects of mask efficacy and coverage (fraction of the population wearing masks) on the basic reproduction number and the infection attack rate. We conclude that population‐wide use of face masks could make an important contribution in delaying an influenza pandemic. Mask use also reduces the reproduction number, possibly even to levels sufficient for containing an influenza outbreak.","Brienen, Nicole C.

10796,Assessing allergenic fungi in house dust by floor wipe sampling and quantitative PCR,2011-08-09,"1. Contemporary species distributions are determined by a mixture of ecological and historical filters acting on several spatial and temporal scales. Mediterranean climate areas are one of the world's biodiversity hotspots with a high level of endemicity, which is linked to complex ecological and historical factors. 2. This paper explores the ecological and historical factors constraining the distribution of caddisfly species on a large regional scale. A total of 69 taxa were collected from 140 sampling sites in 10 Iberian Mediterranean river basins. Approximately 74% of taxa can be considered rare, with the southern basins (the Baetic–Riffian region) having greater endemicity. The greatest richness, involving a mixture of northern and southern species, was found in the transitional area between the Baetic–Riffian region and the Hesperic Massif. 3. The historical processes occurring during the Tertiary (i.e. the junction of the Eurasian and African plates) explained 3.1% of species distribution, whereas ecological factors accounted for 20.7%. Only 0.3% was explained by the interaction of history and ecology. A set of multi‐scale ecological variables (i.e. basin, reach and bedform characteristics) defined five river types with specific caddisfly assemblages. The commonest caddisfly species accounted for the regional distribution pattern, while rare taxa contributed to the explanation of subtle patterns not shown by common species. 4. Despite the importance of historical factors for biogeography and the large scale used in our study, ecological variables better explained caddisfly distribution. This may be explained by the length of time since the historical process we are considering, the high dispersion and colonisation capacity of many caddisfly species, and the strong environmental gradient in the area. Because of the historical and environmental complexity of Mediterranean areas, rare taxa should be included in ecological studies so that the singularity of these ecosystems is not missed.","BONADA, NÚRIA; ZAMORA‐MUÑOZ, CARMEN; RIERADEVALL, MARIA; PRAT, NARCÍS",Freshw Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201900/,53
10991,Peptide Phage Display: Molecular Principles and Biomedical Applications,2020-01-06,"INTRODUCTION: High alcohol consumption has been associated with decreased fibrinolysis and enhanced thrombosis risk in cardiovascular disease. In trauma, alcohol has been associated with poor clot formation; however, its effect on fibrinolysis has not been fully investigated. We assessed the association of blood alcohol levels and fibrinolysis in trauma activation patients. METHODS: We queried our prospective registry of trauma activations from 2014 to 2016. Associations between viscoelastic measurements [rapid thrombelastography (rTEG)] and blood alcohol level (BAL) were determined and adjusted for confounders by a multinomial logistic regression. Lysis phenotypes were defined by the % lysis in 30 min (LY30) as follows: hyperfibrinolysis ≥ 3%, physiologic 0.9–2.9%, and fibrinolysis shutdown < 0.9%. RESULTS: Overall, 191 (43.8%) had BAL measured. There were 65 (34%) patients that had no detectable BAL, 32 (16.8%) had BAL of 10–150 mg/dL, and 94 (49.2%) patients had BAL > 150 mg/dL. BAL had a moderate, but significant inverse correlation with LY30 (Rho = − 0.315, p < 0.001), while there were no significant correlations between BAL and other TEG values. The distribution of fibrinolysis phenotypes varied significantly by BAL levels (p < 0.009, with high BAL having more shutdown and less hyperfibrinolysis than the other two BAL level groups. Multinomial logistic regression showed that after adjustment for confounders, BAL levels > 150 mg/dL were independently associated with a threefold increase in the odds of shutdown compared to undetectable BAL (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.04–8.05, p = 0.006). High BAL was also significantly associated with higher odds of shutdown compared to low BAL (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.15–6.06). Compared to physiologic fibrinolysis, fibrinolysis shutdown was associated with increased mortality (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.41–5.83) and VFD < 28 (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.47–4.39). CONCLUSION: In the injured patient, high blood alcohol levels are associated with increased incidence of fibrinolysis shutdown. This finding has implications for postinjury hemostatic resuscitation as these patients may be harmed by anti-fibrinolytics. Further research is needed to assess whether the association with fibrinolysis is modified by the chronicity and type of alcohol consumed and whether anti-fibrinolytic therapy in intoxicated patients produces adverse effects.","Stettler, Gregory R.; Moore, Ernest E.; Nunns, Geoffrey R.; Moore, Hunter B.; Huebner, Benjamin R.; Silliman, Christopher C.; Banerjee, Anirban; Sauaia, Angela",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222146/,53
11327,Effective Catheter Manoeuvre for the Removal of Phlegm by Suctioning: A Biomechanical Analysis of Experts and Novices,2020-04-24,"PURPOSE: Premorbid conditions affect prognosis of acutely-ill aged patients. Several lines of evidence suggest geriatric syndromes need to be assessed but little is known on their relative effect on the 30-day survival after ICU admission. The primary aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of frailty, cognition decline and activity of daily life in addition to the presence of comorbidity and polypharmacy and to assess their influence on 30-day survival. METHODS: Prospective cohort study with 242 ICUs from 22 countries. Patients 80 years or above acutely admitted over a six months period to an ICU between May 2018 and May 2019 were included. In addition to common patients’ characteristics and disease severity, we collected information on specific geriatric syndromes as potential predictive factors for 30-day survival, frailty (Clinical Frailty scale) with a CFS > 4 defining frail patients, cognitive impairment (informant questionnaire on cognitive decline in the elderly (IQCODE) with IQCODE ≥ 3.5 defining cognitive decline, and disability (measured the activity of daily life with the Katz index) with ADL ≤ 4 defining disability. A Principal Component Analysis to identify co-linearity between geriatric syndromes was performed and from this a multivariable model was built with all geriatric information or only one: CFS, IQCODE or ADL. Akaike’s information criterion across imputations was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of our models. RESULTS: We included 3920 patients with a median age of 84 years (IQR: 81–87), 53.3% males). 80% received at least one organ support. The median ICU length of stay was 3.88 days (IQR: 1.83–8). The ICU and 30-day survival were 72.5% and 61.2% respectively. The geriatric conditions were median (IQR): CFS: 4 (3–6); IQCODE: 3.19 (3–3.69); ADL: 6 (4–6); Comorbidity and Polypharmacy score (CPS): 10 (7–14). CFS, ADL and IQCODE were closely correlated. The multivariable analysis identified predictors of 1-month mortality (HR; 95% CI): Age (per 1 year increase): 1.02 (1.–1.03, p = 0.01), ICU admission diagnosis, sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) (per point): 1.15 (1.14–1.17, p < 0.0001) and CFS (per point): 1.1 (1.05–1.15, p < 0.001). CFS remained an independent factor after inclusion of life-sustaining treatment limitation in the model. CONCLUSION: We confirm that frailty assessment using the CFS is able to predict short-term mortality in elderly patients admitted to ICU. Other geriatric syndromes do not add improvement to the prediction model. Since CFS is easy to measure, it should be routinely collected for all elderly ICU patients in particular in connection to advance care plans, and should be used in decision making.

12250,Phylogeography of the diamond turbot (Hypsopsetta guttulata) across the Baja California Peninsula,2009-10-02,"Indirect predator-induced effects on growth, morphology and reproduction have been extensively studied in marine invertebrates but usually without consideration of size-specific effects and not at all in post-metamorphic echinoids. Urchins are an unusually good system, in which, to study size effects because individuals of various ages within one species span four orders of magnitude in weight while retaining a nearly isometric morphology. We tracked growth of urchins, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (0.013–161.385 g), in the presence or absence of waterborne cues from predatory Jonah crabs, Cancer borealis. We ran experiments at ambient temperatures, once for 4 weeks during summer and again, with a second set of urchins, for 22 weeks over winter. We used a scaled, cube-root transformation of weight for measuring size more precisely and for equalizing variance across sizes. Growth rate of the smallest urchins (summer: <17 mm diameter; winter: <7 mm diameter) decreased by 40–42% in response to crab cues. In contrast, growth rate of larger urchins was unaffected in the summer and increased in response to crab scent by 7% in the winter. At the end of the 22-week experiment, additional gonadal and skeletal variables were measured. Cue-exposed urchins developed heavier, thicker skeletons and smaller gonads, but no differences in spine length or jaw size. The differences depended on urchin size, suggesting that there are size-specific shifts in gonadal and somatic investment in urchins.","Selden, Rebecca; Johnson, Amy S.; Ellers, Olaf",Mar Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3906715/,53

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the frequency of HCMV congenital infections in newborns up to 1 month in the Sao Paulo State, from 2010 to 2018. The molecular characterization of HCMV-positive samples was also undertaken. Urine samples from 275 potential congenital HCMV-infected patients were tested by real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). HCMV-positive samples were amplified by conventional PCR targeting the UL89 gene, sequenced and searched for mutations. A total of 32 (11.6%) positive-HCMV cases were detected (mean Ct 30.59); mean and median age of 10.3 and 6 days old, respectively. Children aged between 0-3 weeks had higher HCMV detection rates (84.4%; 27/32). UL89 gene was successfully sequenced in two samples, both classified as the human betaherpesvirus 5. No described resistance-associated mutations were identified.

E30 is particularly devastating in the neonatal population and currently no vaccine or antiviral therapy is available. Here we characterize two highly potent E30-specific monoclonal antibodies, 6C5 and 4B10, which efficiently block binding of the virus to its attachment receptor CD55 and uncoating receptor FcRn. Combinations of 6C5 and 4B10 augment the sum of their individual anti-viral activities. High-resolution structures of E30-6C5-Fab and E30-4B10-Fab define the location and nature of epitopes targeted by the antibodies. 6C5 and 4B10 engage the capsid loci at the north rim of the canyon and in-canyon, respectively. Notably, these regions exhibit antigenic variability across EV-Bs, highlighting challenges in development of broad-spectrum antibodies. Our structures of these neutralizing antibodies of E30 are instructive for development of vaccines and therapeutics against EV-B infections.","Wang, Kang; Zheng, Binyang; Zhang, Li; Cui, Lunbiao; Su, Xuan; Zhang, Qian; Guo, Zhenxi; Guo, Yu; Zhang, Wei; Zhu, Ling; Zhu, Fengcai; Rao, Zihe; Wang, Xiangxi",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7474084/,53
13143,Insights from Parasite-Specific Serological Tools in Eco-Immunology,2014-04-23,"Background. We evaluated a candidate A/Anhui/2013(H7N9) pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccine (pLAIV) in healthy adults, and assessed the ability of 1 or 2 doses to induce immune memory. Methods. Healthy subjects in 2 age groups (18–49 years and 50–70 years) with undetectable hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) antibody to H7N9 were enrolled. Younger subjects received either 1 or 2 intranasal doses of 10(7.0) fluorescent focus units of A/Anhui/1/2013 pLAIV, while older subjects received a single dose. All subjects received a single 30-µg dose of unadjuvanted, antigenically matched A/Shanghai2/2013(H7N9) pandemic inactivated influenza vaccine (pIIV) 12 weeks after their first dose of pLAIV. Results. Both vaccines were well tolerated. Serum HAI antibody responses were detected in 0 of 32 younger subjects and 1 of 17 older subjects after 1 dose of pLAIV and in 2 of 16 younger subjects after a second dose. Strong serum antibody responses were detected after a single subsequent dose of pIIV that was broadly reactive against H7 influenza viruses. Conclusions. An A(H7N9) pLAIV candidate was safe in both age groups. Priming with pLAIV resulted in responses to subsequent pIIV that exceeded those seen in naive subjects in previous reports. The A(H7N9) pLAIV induces strong immune memory that can be demonstrated by exposure to subsequent antigenic challenge. Clinical Trials Registration.

14512,The Failures of Ethnobotany and Phytomedicine in Delivering Novel Treatments for Snakebite Envenomation,2020-12-06,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Like plants, animal-based remedies are being utilized traditionally in different cultures around the globe. We explored the traditional usage of wild animals by the local inhabitants in Ladakh area of Trans-Himalayan region, India, using questionnaires and interviews. Furthermore, associations between ethnozoological usage and animal species were also evaluated through multivariate ecological community analysis. The highest priority of local inhabitants was for food followed by medicinal usage. We documented therapeutic uses of 48% of the reported species. Among these Alectoris chukar (chukar), Cuon alpinus (Asiatic wild dog), Lepus oiostolus (hares), Marmota himalayana (marmots), Ovis aries vignei (Ladakh urial), Pantholops hodgsonii (Tibetan antelope), Procapra picticaudata (Tibetan gazelle), Pseudois nayaur (blue sheep), Tetraogallus himalayensis (Himalayan snow), Tetraogallus tibetanus (Tibetan snow cock), and Lutra lutra (common otter) were reported for the first time from this region and are being used for medicinal purpose. Our findings could be valuable as reference data for policymakers, researchers, land managers, common public, and the other stakeholders to develop logical and scientific approaches for sustainable use of faunal diversity in biodiversity hotspot regions. ABSTRACT: Zootherapy is accepted all around the globe not only in ancient cultures but different animal derived medicines are also part of the practice in the modern health care systems. The present study assessed the traditional ethnozoological usage of wild animals by local inhabitants in Ladakh region, India, and the reference data for scientific approaches for protection of faunal diversity in trans-Himalayas. The ethnozoological documentation of the animals in Ladakh was carried out through semistructured and close-ended questionnaire surveys and interviews. Multivariate ecological community analysis was used to elucidate the relationship between ethnozoological usage and animal species. Our results showed three animal usage clusters with 32% similarity. Moreover, the similarity in animal usage between digging tools, trophy, handle of tools, decoration, and matting, showed less than 32% of similarity. The highest priority of local people was for food followed by decoration and medicinal usage. The most frequently used animal parts were meat followed by fur and horn. Medicinal uses of 48% of the reported species, i.e., Alectoris chukar (chukar), Cuon alpinus (Asiatic wild dog), Lepus oiostolus (hares), Marmota himalayana (marmots), Ovis aries vignei (Ladakh urial), Pantholops hodgsonii (Tibetan antelope), Procapra picticaudata (Tibetan gazelle), Pseudois nayaur (blue sheep), Tetraogallus himalayensis (Himalayan snow), Tetraogallus tibetanus (Tibetan snow cock), and Lutra lutra (common otter) were reported for the first time from this region. Our study provides innovative information regarding the ethnozoological knowledge in the Ladakh region and reference data for policymakers, researchers, land managers, common public, and the other stakeholders to develop logical and scientific approaches for sustainable use of faunal diversity in hotspot regions like trans-Himalayas and other similar biodiversity-rich sites.","Haq, Shiekh Marifatul; Calixto, Eduardo Soares; Yaqoob, Umer; Ahmed, Riyaz; Mahmoud, Ahmed Hossam; Bussmann, Rainer W.; Mohammed, Osama B.; Ahmad, Khalid; Abbasi, Arshad Mehmood",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762308/,53
14853,Limbic Encephalitis Brain Damage Induced by Cocal Virus in Adult Mice Is Reduced by Environmental Enrichment: Neuropathological and Behavioral Studies,2020-12-30,"There is a growing diversity of bat-associated lyssaviruses in the Old World. In August 2017, a dead Brandt’s bat (Myotis brandtii) tested positive for rabies and based on partial sequence analysis, the novel Kotalahti bat lyssavirus (KBLV) was identified. Because the bat was in an autolyzed state, isolation of KBLV was neither successful after three consecutive cell passages on cells nor in mice. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was applied using Ion Torrent ™ S5 technology coupled with target enrichment via hybridization-based capture (myBaits(®)) was used to sequence 99% of the genome, comprising of 11,878 nucleotides (nt). KBLV is most closely related to EBLV-2 (78.7% identity), followed by KHUV (79.0%) and BBLV (77.6%), supporting the assignment as phylogroup I lyssavirus. Interestingly, all of these lyssaviruses were also isolated from bat species of the genus Myotis, thus supporting that M. brandtii is likely the reservoir host. All information on antigenic and genetic divergence fulfil the species demarcation criteria by ICTV, so that we recommend KBLV as a novel species within the Lyssavirus genus. Next to sequence analyses, assignment to phylogroup I was functionally corroborated by cross-neutralization of G-deleted RABV, pseudotyped with KBLV-G by sera from RABV vaccinated humans. This suggests that conventional RABV vaccines also confer protection against the novel KBLV.","Calvelage, Sten; Tammiranta, Niina; Nokireki, Tiina; Gadd, Tuija; Eggerbauer, Elisa; Zaeck, Luca M.; Potratz, Madlin; Wylezich, Claudia; Höper, Dirk; Müller, Thomas; Finke, Stefan; Freuling, Conrad M.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7825429/,53

15175,28th Annual Meeting of the Dysphagia Research Society,2021-02-02,"East Coast fever (ECF), caused by Theileria parva, is the most important tick-borne disease of cattle in sub-Saharan Africa. Practical disadvantages associated with the currently used live-parasite vaccine could be overcome by subunit vaccines. An 80-aa polypeptide derived from the C-terminal portion of p67, a sporozoite surface Ag and target of neutralizing Abs, was the focus of the efforts on subunit vaccines against ECF and subjected to several vaccine trials with very promising results. However, the vaccination regimen was far from optimized, involving three inoculations of 450 μg of soluble p67C (s-p67C) Ag formulated in the Seppic adjuvant Montanide ISA 206 VG. Hence, an improved formulation of this polypeptide Ag is needed. In this study, we report on two nanotechnologies that enhance the bovine immune responses to p67C. Individually, HBcAg-p67C (chimeric hepatitis B core Ag virus-like particles displaying p67C) and silica vesicle (SV)–p67C (s-p67C adsorbed to SV-140-C(18), octadecyl-modified SVs) adjuvanted with ISA 206 VG primed strong Ab and T cell responses to p67C in cattle, respectively. Coimmunization of cattle (Bos taurus) with HBcAg-p67C and SV-p67C resulted in stimulation of both high Ab titers and CD4 T cell response to p67C, leading to the highest subunit vaccine efficacy we have achieved to date with the p67C immunogen.

15407,Rising to the challenge,2021-01-20,"INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory, degenerative disease of the central nervous system manifesting at first with relapses in about 85% of cases. In Germany, intravenous therapy with high-dose corticosteroids is the treatment standard of acute relapses. The treatment leads to a faster reduction of symptoms in about 25 of 100 treated patients but has no proven long-term benefits over placebo treatment. Intravenous treatment is not superior to oral treatment. Therefore, informed decisions on relapse management are required. An earlier randomised controlled trial showed that evidence-based patient information and education on relapse management leads to more informed decisions and more relapses not treated or treated with oral corticosteroids. This study aims to evaluate whether a web-based relapse management programme will positively change relapse management and strengthen autonomy in people with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: The pragmatic double-blind randomised controlled trial is accompanied by a mixed-methods process evaluation and a health economic evaluation and follows the UK Medical Research Council guidance on developing and evaluating complex interventions. A total of 188 people with possible or relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with ≥ 1 relapse within the last year and/or ≥ 2 relapses within the last 2 years will be recruited and randomised using blocks. The intervention group receives a web- and dialogue-based decision aid on relapse management, a nurse-led webinar and access to a monitored chat forum. The control group receives standard information, which will be made available via the same online platform as the intervention. The primary endpoint is the proportion of relapses not treated or treated with oral corticosteroids. Key secondary endpoints are the annualised relapse rate, decision-making, empowerment, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Facilitators and barriers will be assessed by mixed-methods process evaluation measures. The study ends when 81 relapses have been documented or after 24 months of observation per individual patient. Analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle. DISCUSSION: We hypothesise that the intervention will enhance patient empowerment and have a positive impact on patients’ relapse management.

15555,Biological Cybernetics: 60 years and more to come,2021-02-23,"OBJECTIVE: GPVI (glycoprotein VI) is a key molecular player in collagen-induced platelet signaling and aggregation. Recent evidence indicates that it also plays important role in platelet aggregation and thrombus growth through interaction with fibrin(ogen). However, there are discrepancies in the literature regarding whether the monomeric or dimeric form of GPVI binds to fibrinogen at high affinity. The mechanisms of interaction are also not clear, including which region of fibrinogen is responsible for GPVI binding. We aimed to gain further understanding of the mechanisms of interaction at molecular level and to identify the regions on fibrinogen important for GPVI binding. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using multiple surface- and solution-based protein-protein interaction methods, we observe that dimeric GPVI binds to fibrinogen with much higher affinity and has a slower dissociation rate constant than the monomer due to avidity effects. Moreover, our data show that the highest affinity interaction of GPVI is with the αC-region of fibrinogen. We further show that GPVI interacts with immobilized fibrinogen and fibrin variants at a similar level, including a nonpolymerizing fibrin variant, suggesting that GPVI binding is independent of fibrin polymerization. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the above findings, we conclude that the higher affinity of dimeric GPVI over the monomer for fibrinogen interaction is achieved by avidity. The αC-region of fibrinogen appears essential for GPVI binding. We propose that fibrin polymerization into fibers during coagulation will cluster GPVI through its αC-region, leading to downstream signaling, further activation of platelets, and potentially stimulating clot growth.","Xu, Rui-Gang; Gauer, Julia S.; Baker, Stephen R.; Slater, Alexandre; Martin, Eleyna M.; McPherson, Helen R.; Duval, Cédric; Manfield, Iain W.; Bonna, Arkadiusz M.; Watson, Steve P.; Ariëns, Robert A.S.",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7901536/,53

Domestic dogs’ sensitivity to the accuracy of human informants,2021-03-06,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a predominant cause of community-acquired respiratory infections. We recently discovered the clinical efficacy of Maxing shigan decoction (MXSG) in M. pneumoniae infection and designed a study to explore the mechanism of action. METHODS: Serum IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α, and transcript expression of the NLR Family, Pyrin Domain Containing Protein 3 (NLRP3) were measured in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 30 children with M. pneumoniae infection and 30 healthy donors. An in vitro model of M. pneumoniae infection in A549 cell culture was used to explore the curative effects and mechanisms of MXSG. Pyroptosis was measured by flow cytometry with activated caspase-1 and propidium iodide staining. IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α, and NLRP3 transcript expression were measured by qRT-PCR. Protein expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, pro-caspase-1, IL-1β, pro-IL-1β, and GSDMD-N was determined by Western blotting. Experimental confirmation was performed in NLRP3-overexpressing A549 cells and in the presence of an NLRP3 inhibitor, INF39. RESULTS: M. pneumoniae infection-induced IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, and mRNA expression of NLRP3 in PBMCs and promoted pyroptosis in A549 cells. It also induced IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, and up-regulated NLRP3, ro-IL-1β, Caspase-1, Pro-Caspase-1, and GSDMD-N in culture. Similar to the NLRP3 inhibitor INF39, MXSG (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/mL) suppressed pyroptosis induced by M. pneumoniae infection and decreased IL-1β (P < 0.001), IL-18, TNF-α in culture. MXSG down-regulated NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, Caspase-1, pro-Caspase-1, and GSDMD-N in infected cultures and mitigated NLRP3 overexpression-induced pyroptosis. CONCLUSION: MXSG mitigates M. pneumoniae-induced pyroptosis in A549 cells via the NLRP3 inflammasome.","Liu, Fang; Liu, TianTian; Sun, Min; Zhou, JingMin; Xue, Feng; Chen, ShuangHui; Chen, Jia; Zhang, Lei",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7937399/,53

Primary outcomes included percentage of patients who completed the 30‐day program and the percentage for successful linkage to more permanent ongoing treatment after the initial program. RESULTS: There were 324 participants who initiated treatment on buprenorphine from April 2018 to July 2019, with an average age of 36 (±9.6 years) and 52% of participants were males. At 30 days, 293/324 (90.43%) completed the program, and 203 of these (63%) were successfully connected to a subsequent community addiction medicine physician. There was a significant improvement (36%) in health‐related quality of life. CONCLUSION: Lack of insurance is a predictor for treatment failure. Implementation of a multipronged treatment program is feasible and was associated with positive patient‐reported outcomes. This approach holds promise as a strategy for engaging and retaining patients in treatment.","Langabeer, James R.; Champagne‐Langabeer, Tiffany; Yatsco, Andrea J.; O'Neal, Meredith M.; Cardenas‐Turanzas, Marylou; Prater, Samuel; Luber, Samuel; Stotts, Angela; Fadial, Tom; Khraish, Gina; Wang, Henry; Bobrow, Bentley J.; Chambers, Kimberly A.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8011614/,53

Materials and Methods: For this purpose, we developed an ensemble method that fused two deep learning models, one based on convolutional neural network and the other based on transfer learning. For the first model, called 5-CNN, we developed an efficient end-to-end trained model with five convolutional layers, while for the second model, the pre-trained VGG-19 architecture was repurposed, optimized and trained. We trained and validated our models using a dataset of ultrasound images consisting of four types of thyroidal images: autoimmune, nodular, micro-nodular, and normal. Results: Excellent results were obtained by the ensemble CNN-VGG method, which outperformed the 5-CNN and VGG-19 models: 97.35% for the overall test accuracy with an overall specificity of 98.43%, sensitivity of 95.75%, positive and negative predictive value of 95.41%, and 98.05%. The micro average areas under each receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.96. The results were also validated by two physicians: an endocrinologist and a pediatrician.

17654,Feasibility of predicting allele specific expression from DNA sequencing using machine learning,2021-05-19,"BACKGROUND: Many previous studies have explored socialization-oriented social media (SM), but their reach has been limited to the context of information exchange for common personal interests. This study focuses on work-oriented SM, which can enhance organizational networking and productivity levels in the context of public hospitals. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide a theoretical framework to explain how the use of SM can enhance the skills of health professionals and levels of organizational productivity in uncertain environments. METHODS: A total of 2 distinct forms of data collection techniques were combined: focus groups and semistructured interviews. Both were conducted with doctors and nurses in Saudi public sector hospitals. RESULTS: The findings reveal that the use of SM can create professional socialization at the level of the institution, and this can enhance skills, knowledge, decision making, and the overall level of organizational productivity. The increasing use of SM creates collaboration between health experts (particularly endocrinologists and pulmonologists in this case) who arrange video calls to share best practices in terms of medication, diet, and health care plans for patients with multiple diseases. Many of these patients are particularly vulnerable, given the wider context of the current global pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study culminates in the Social Media Organizational Productivity model, which provides insights into how SM has increased the accessibility of health professionals through the use of technology. Access to such professionals creates a patient-centric approach and a culture of shared communication for dealing with high-risk patients during the current global pandemic.","Dailah Sr, Hamad Ghaleb; Naeem, Muhammad",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135021/,53
18002,Divergence time and species delimitation of microbivalves in the Southern Ocean: the case of Kidderia species,2021-06-01,"During the school summer holidays, pressures on the already tight budgets of low-income families are compounded, particularly when the safety net of free school meals is removed. The main aim of the current study was to investigate how low-income parents and carers feed their families during term time when children receive free school meals and if, and how, strategies differ during the school summer holidays. A secondary aim was to investigate the role of holiday activity and food programmes in supporting parents and carers to feed their children during the school summer holidays. We used purposive sampling to recruit a total of 21 parents (N = 20 Female, N = 1 Male) whose children attended free summer holiday clubs in Scotland and England during summer 2017. Participants were asked about their food and shopping habits during the school term and if, and how they differed during the school summer holidays when free school meals were not available. The findings suggest that food insecurity is a constant factor in the lives of low-income parents in England and Scotland, and that the stages of food insecurity and the strategies employed to mitigate its effects appear to be cyclical, aligning with the Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) food insecurity continuum and the school academic year. During term time, parents and carers worried about food, suggesting they were experiencing mild food insecurity, despite their children being in receipt of free school meals. As the school holidays approached, moderate food insecurity was experienced as parents reported that they began “provisioning,” storing food and reducing household expenditure. During the summer holidays, food did not last, and parental food acquisition habits became more intense. Parents downgraded food brands and bought reduced price items of food. Ultimately, parents self-sacrificed their own nutritional intake by only buying food their children would eat and parents often skipped meals or only ate their children's leftovers. However, children's attendance at holiday club helped make the food at home last longer and once school resumed, parents returned to their less intense, but constantly coping approach to food shopping. The findings of this study suggest that food insecurity is a constant factor in the lives of low-income families who simply do not have enough household income to prevent them from experiencing food insecurity, even when initiatives such as free school meals and access to holiday club provision with food and activities are in place.","Shinwell, Jackie; Defeyter, Margaret Anne",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8170021/,53
19010,Yield estimation of the 2020 Beirut explosion using open access waveform and remote sensing data,2021-07-08,"IMPORTANCE: Hundreds of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapies are under investigation for hematologic malignant cancers and solid malignant tumors. As the field of modern CAR therapy enters its second decade, clinical trials that demonstrate the efficacy of CAR therapies using randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and/or investigate methods to optimize patient outcomes with commercially available CAR therapies are increasingly important. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the landscape of registered CAR-related trials with dual focuses on trial methods and intent. EVIDENCE REVIEW: This systematic review identified 1304 ongoing or upcoming CAR-related trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as of December 22, 2020, and excluded 513 trials that did not pertain to cell-based therapy. Both CAR-related and trial-related variables, including target antigens and countries of origin, were recorded. Trials were categorized as non-RCTs that compared CAR with non-CAR therapies or RCTs in which every arm received CAR therapy. Trial intent was separately categorized as demonstrating the efficacy of a CAR therapy, optimizing patient outcomes with established CAR therapies using adjunctive non-CAR modalities, or miscellaneous. FINDINGS: Of 778 relevant trials, 587 (75%) involved blood cancers, whereas 182 (23%) involved solid tumor cancers; the remaining 9 (1%) involved nonmalignant diseases. A total of 433 trials (56%) were from China and 288 from the US (37%). Ten RCTs (1%) compared CAR therapies with non-CAR therapies, including phase 3 RCTs for 4 of 5 CAR therapies (80%) that are currently commercially available. Twenty-eight studies (4%) sought to optimize outcomes with established CAR therapies using non-CAR drugs or radiotherapy, whereas 3 studies (0.4%) sought to optimize supportive care during CAR therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review found that randomized and optimization-focused trials are comparatively rare within the landscape of ongoing and upcoming CAR-related trials. As the field of modern CAR therapy enters its second decade, additional studies of these characteristics are necessary to strengthen the evidence base for CAR therapy and improve patient outcomes.","Banerjee, Rahul; Prasad, Vinay",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8267610/,53

Receptor binding is initiated by the viral attachment protein Haemagglutinin (H), with the viral Fusion protein (F) driving membrane fusion. Crystal structures of the prototypic morbillivirus measles virus H with either SLAMF1 or Nectin-4 are available and have served as the basis for improved understanding of this interaction. However, whether these interactions remain conserved throughout the morbillivirus genus requires further characterisation. Using a random mutagenesis approach, based on error-prone PCR, we targeted the putative receptor binding site for SLAMF1 interaction on peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) H, identifying mutations that inhibited virus-induced cell-cell fusion. These data, combined with structural modelling of the PPRV H and ovine SLAMF1 interaction, indicate this region is functionally conserved across all morbilliviruses. Error-prone PCR provides a powerful tool for functionally characterising functional domains within viral proteins.","Gallo, Giulia; Conceicao, Carina; Tsirigoti, Christina; Willett, Brian; Graham, Stephen C; Bailey, Dalan",J Gen Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8290269/,53

However, there is no good scoring system to predict mortality within 30-day, 1-year after AKI in older adults. We performed a retrospective analysis screening data of 53,944 hospitalized elderly patients (age > 65 years) from multi-centers in China. 944 patients with AKI (acute kidney disease) were included and followed up for 1 year. Multivariable regression analysis was used for developing scoring models in the test group (a randomly 70% of all the patients). The established models have been verified in the validation group (a randomly 30% of all the patients). Model 1 that consisted of the risk factors for death within 30 days after AKI had accurate discrimination (The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, AUROC: 0.90 (95% CI 0.875–0.932)) in the test group, and performed well in the validation groups (AUROC: 0.907 (95% CI 0.865–0.949)).

This study examined whether isometric exercise combined with whole body-electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) can improve serum cytokine levels, muscle strength, and knee function in elderly women with early knee OA. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled study included 75 participants assigned into three groups: the control group (CON), isometric exercise group (ISOM), and isometric exercise and electromyostimulation group (ISOM + EMS). The two exercise groups performed their respective programs for 8 weeks, 3 days a week, 30 min a day. The main exercises for both groups were performed continuously during the 20 min in an alternation of a 6-s contraction with a 4-s break. At pre- and post-intervention, anthropometric variables, muscle strength, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and blood sampling for biomarkers including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, and resistin were performed. Results: All variables at pre-intervention showed no significant differences among the three groups. However, there were significant differences between groups for body composition, muscle strength, KOOS subscale scores, and biomarkers. ISOM + EMS group resulted in a significant reduction in body weight, fat mass, fat percentage, inflammatory cytokine levels, and increased muscle strength. An ISOM + EMS group had the best KOOS score among all groups. Conclusion: Isometric exercise combined with WB-EMS resulted in the best overall improvements in knee function and alleviating the pain and symptoms of patients with early knee OA. Further, reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines were observed. These non-pharmacologic, non-invasive interventions should be considered by healthcare specialists for elderly patients with early knee OA.","Park, Sunhee; Min, Sukyung; Park, Si-Hwa; Yoo, Jaehyun; Jee, Yong-Seok",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8313868/,53

Strategies for the efficient management of this parasitic infection include adequate treatment with anti-malarial therapeutics and vaccination. However, the emergence and spread of resistant strains of malaria parasites to the majority of presently used anti-malarial medications, on the other hand, complicates malaria treatment. Other shortcomings of anti-malarial drugs include poor aqueous solubility, low permeability, poor bioavailability, and non-specific targeting of intracellular parasites, resulting in high dose requirements and toxic side effects. To address these limitations, liposome-based nanotechnology has been extensively explored as a new solution in malaria management. Liposome technology improves anti-malarial drug encapsulation, bioavailability, target delivery, and controlled release, resulting in increased effectiveness, reduced resistance progression, and fewer adverse effects. Furthermore, liposomes are exploited as immunological adjuvants and antigen carriers to boost the preventive effectiveness of malaria vaccine candidates. The present review discusses the findings from studies conducted over the last 40 years (1980–2020) using in vitro and in vivo settings to assess the prophylactic and curative anti-malarial potential of liposomes containing anti-malarial agents or antigens. This paper and the discussion herein provide a useful resource for further complementary investigations and may pave the way for the research and development of several available and affordable anti-malarial-based liposomes and liposomal malaria vaccines by allowing a thorough evaluation of liposomes developed to date for the management of malaria.","Memvanga, Patrick B.; Nkanga, Christian I.",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8313885/,53

They supervise students in the clinical setting to enable them to have a practical experience with patients, and they assess students’ skills at the highest tier of clinical assessment. The university where this study was done conducts a distributed Bachelor of Clinical Medical Practice course on a distributed platform which is dependent on preceptors at the training sites. Understanding the perceptions of preceptors, as major stakeholders, regarding the student assessment they do will assist the faculty to provide better support and development that might be needed and assist in maximising the benefits of distributed training. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of preceptors regarding assessing clinical associate students at district hospitals in the Bachelor of Clinical Medical Practice programme. SETTING: The study was conducted at a rural university in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. METHODS: This was a qualitative study involving nine preceptors who were purposively selected from three district hospital training sites based on their involvement in assessing clinical associate students. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from thematic analysis: assessment issues, preceptor issues, student issues and university support issues. Preceptors are committed and enthusiastic in training and assessing the clinical associate students but require input from the university in terms of training and ongoing support. CONCLUSION: Lack of training threatens the validity of preceptor assessment. Academic institutions should train and support preceptors to enable them better to fulfil their roles.","Kakia, Aloysious; Couper, Ian",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335760/,53

Current research indicates long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) may play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of endometriosis. However, the molecular mechanism of lncRNA in endometriosis is far from clear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The lncRNA and mRNA expression of 8 patients with ovarian endometriosis were determined by high-throughput RNA sequencing (8 ectopic endometria samples vs 8 eutopic endometria samples), and miRNA expression profiles were obtained from our previous study. Then a lncRNA-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed by combining the regulatory interaction and negative co-expression interaction between the differentially expressed lncRNAs/mRNAs and miRNAs by different rules. RESULTS: The constructed lncRNA-related ceRNA network was composed of two separate networks, network 1 including 14,137 dysregulated lncRNA–mRNA interactions, referring to 242 lncRNAs, 55 miRNAs and 1600 mRNAs, network 2 including 4459 dysregulated lncRNA–mRNA interactions, referring to 111 lncRNAs, 39 miRNAs and 1151 mRNAs. The top six hub lncRNAs (LINC01140, MSC-AS1, HAGLR, CKMT2-AS1, JAKMIP2-AS1, AL365361.1) in the significant ternary relationship of mRNA–miRNA–lncRNA in network 1, and the top six hub lncRNAs (PAX8-AS1, MIR17HC, PART1, HOXA-AS3, PLAC4, LINC00511) in the significant ternary relationship of mRNA–miRNA–lncRNA in network 2 were selected. Functional enrichment analysis of these lncRNA-related mRNAs indicated that the lncRNAs in network 1 mainly take part in positive regulation of phagocytosis, myeloid leukocyte activation, and tissue remodeling, while the lncRNAs in network 2 mainly take part in negative regulation of cell proliferation, blood vessel development and regulation of epithelial cell differentiation, which is consistent with the results obtained from the different rules to construct the networks. CONCLUSION: lncRNA-related ceRNA network analysis recognized key lncRNAs related to the development of endometriosis.","Gu, Chenglei; Meng, Yuanguang; Meng, Qingqing; Fan, Wensheng; Ye, Mingxia; Zhang, Qian; Zhang, Nina; Li, Lian",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8352637/,53

Knowledge of whether bnAb precursor B cells are circulating at sufficient frequencies within individuals in communities heavily impacted by HIV may be important. Using a germline-targeting eOD-GT8 immunogen and high-throughput droplet-based single-cell BCR sequencing, we demonstrate that large numbers of paired BCR sequences from multiple donors can be efficiently screened to elucidate precursor frequencies of rare, naive VRC01-class B cells. Further, we analyzed IGHV1-2 allelic usage among three different cohorts; we find that IGHV1-2 alleles traditionally thought to be incompatible with VRC01-class responses are relatively common in various human populations and that germline variation within IGHV1-2 associates with gene usage frequencies in the naive BCR repertoire.","Lee, Jeong Hyun; Toy, Laura; Kos, Justin T.; Safonova, Yana; Schief, William R.; Havenar-Daughton, Colin; Watson, Corey T.; Crotty, Shane",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8421370/,53

In addition to providing support for neurons, microglia and astrocytes function as the resident immune cells in the brain. The glial function is impacted by multiple aspects including aging and local CNS changes caused by neurodegeneration. During aging, microglia and astrocytes display alterations in their homeostatic functions. For example, aged microglia and astrocytes exhibit impairments in the lysosome and mitochondrial function as well as in their regulation of synaptic plasticity. Recent evidence suggests that glia can also alter the pathology associated with many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Shifts in the microbiome can impact glial function as well. Disruptions in the microbiome can lead to aberrant microglial and astrocytic reactivity, which can contribute to an exacerbation of disease and neuronal dysfunction. In this review, we will discuss the normal physiological functions of microglia and astrocytes, summarize novel findings highlighting the role of glia in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, and examine the contribution of microglia and astrocytes to disease progression.","Hanslik, Kendra L.; Marino, Kaitlyn M.; Ulland, Tyler K.",Front Cell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8439422/,53

Given the social importance of this activity and the high responsibility it requires, prevention and alleviation of burnout symptoms become primary concerns in ensuring the well-being of firefighters. Although work meaning is one of the factors associated with a lower risk of developing burnout, its protective role has not been studied in firefighters. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the buffering role of work meaning in the health-impairment process of the Job Demands-Resources model, targeting the relationship between job demands and related emotional exhaustion. A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data from a sample consisting of Romanian firefighters (n = 1096). Structural equation modeling indicated a positive link between job demands and exhaustion. In addition, deriving personal meaning from work was associated with lower levels of exhaustion in firefighters. A small but significant interaction effect between work meaning and job demands showed that higher levels of work meaning attenuated the positive relationship between job demands and exhaustion. In conclusion, our findings suggest that work meaning has a buffering effect on the impact of various job demands on job-related exhaustion. Nevertheless, the small effect sizes warrant further research on this topic.","Roșca, Andra Cătălina; Mateizer, Alexandru; Dan, Cristina-Ioana; Demerouti, Evangelia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8472436/,53

A Review of Standardised Antibacterial Material Testing Methods,2021-09-03,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a pathogen associated with substantial economic losses in the dairy cattle industry. Currently, there are no effective vaccines against BVDV. Melatonin (MT) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, and the use of MF59 in vaccines significantly enhances vaccine efficiency. Here, MT and MF59 were added into the E(rns)-LTB vaccine. Subsequently, their inhibitory activity on the NF-κB signaling pathway in Mardin-Darby Bovine Kidney cells and the hippocampus was assessed using western blot and quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The findings revealed that MT in the E(rns)-LTB vaccine decreases the phosphorylation of p65 proteins caused by BVDV infection. In addition, MT decreased the mRNA levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in vitro, but increased the production of IFN-α, IFN-β, Mx1 in vitro, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cyclic amp response element-binding protein, and the stem cell factor in vivo. Furthermore, treatment with E(rns)-LTB + MF59 + MT stimulated the production of T lymphocytes, alleviated pathological damage, decreased expressions of BVDV antigen, and tight junction proteins in mice. These findings imply that MT has potential for use in the E(rns)-LTB vaccine to inhibit BVDV infection and regulate the immune responses of T-cells by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway.","Wang, Yi-Xuan; Yang, Guang-Hui; Zhang, Lin-Lin; Wang, Jing; Wang, Jiu-Feng",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473004/,53

22270,"2014 ACMT Annual Scientific Meeting—March 28–30, 2014 Phoenix, AZ, USA",2014-02-05,"Fenitrothion is an insecticide belonging to the organophosphate family of pesticides that is widely used around the world in agriculture and living environments. Today, it is one of the most hazardous chemicals that causes severe environmental pollution. However, detection of fenitrothion residues in the environment is considered a significant challenge due to the small molecule nature of the insecticide and lack of molecular recognition elements that can detect it with high specificity. We performed in vitro selection experiments using the SELEX process to isolate the DNA aptamers that can bind to fenitrothion. We found that newly discovered DNA aptamers have a strong ability to distinguish fenitrothion from other organophosphate insecticides (non-specific targets). Furthermore, we identified a fenitrothion-specific aptamer; FenA2, that can interact with Thioflavin T (ThT) to produce a label-free detection mode with a K(d) of 33.57 nM (9.30 ppb) and LOD of 14 nM (3.88 ppb). Additionally, the FenA2 aptamer exhibited very low cross-reactivity with non-specific targets. This is the first report showing an aptamer sensor with a G4-quadruplex-like structure to detect fenitrothion. Moreover, these aptamers have the potential to be further developed into analytical tools for real-time detection of fenitrothion from a wide range of samples.","Trinh, Kien Hong; Kadam, Ulhas Sopanrao; Song, Jinnan; Cho, Yuhan; Kang, Chang Ho; Lee, Kyun Oh; Lim, Chae Oh; Chung, Woo Sik; Hong, Jong Chan",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8509669/,53

22623,How to Frame Mobility?,2008-02-13,"Large-genome Nidoviruses and Nidovirus-like viruses reside at the current boundary of largest RNA genome sizes. They code for an unusually large number of gene products matching that of small DNA viruses (e.g. DNA bacteriophages). The order of appearance and distribution of enzyme genes along various virus families (e.g. helicase and ExoN) may be seen as an evolutionary marker in these large RNA genomes lying at the genome size boundary. A positive correlation exists between (+)RNA virus genome sizes and the presence of the RNA helicase and the ExoN domains. Although the mechanistic basis of the presence of the helicase is still unclear, the role of the ExoN activity has been linked to the existence of an RNA synthesis proofreading system. In large Nidovirales, ExoN is bound to a processive replicative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and corrects mismatched bases during viral RNA synthesis. Over the last decade, a view of the overall process has been refined in Coronaviruses, and in particular in our lab (Ferron et al., PNAS, 2018). We have identified genetic markers of large RNA genomes that we wish to use to data-mine currently existing metagenomic datasets. We have also initiated a collaboration to sequence and explore new viromes that will be searched according to these criteria.

This article examines ethical concerns surrounding the development of markets in a particular form of human genetic engineering in which heterozygotes are fitter than both homozygotes, a condition known as heterozygous advantage. To begin, we present a generalized model of the condition, illuminated by the application to sickle-cell anemia. Next, we propose a typology of related markets, some of which are currently functioning with available products and services, and others that are widely viewed as imminent. We suggest the manner in which perverse incentives may arise for firms that market genetic intervention in circumstances where heterozygous advantage is possible. Finally, we propose that this misalignment of incentives with social welfare has arisen from both ill-conceived market intervention where markets are capable of achieving efficient outcomes and the lack of market intervention where markets have failed. We offer specific legal and regulatory approaches for reform.","Jones, Gregory Todd; Hagtvedt, Reidar",J Bus Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087662/,53

23423,P1.3 Pathologies et risques infectieux,2011-11-03,"BACKGROUND: Recent infectious disease epidemics have highlighted the importance of rapid recognition and isolation of patients with severe infectious diseases. In response, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene carried out a series of unannounced “Mystery Patient Drills” to assess Emergency Departments (ED) ability to identify and safely respond to patients with communicable diseases of public health concern. METHODS: All 911-receiving hospitals participating in the NYC Hospital Preparedness Program were recruited to participate. Scenarios utilized an actor presenting to an ED describing symptoms and history consistent with measles or MERS-CoV. An exercise evaluation guide captured performance measures to analyze 1) compliance with key infection control measures; 2) association between screening interventions (e.g., travel history) and implementation of infection control measures; 3) times from patient entry to triage, donning a mask, and placement into isolation. Post-drill report narratives were reviewed to identify additional strengths and challenges. RESULTS: Among 50 eligible hospitals, 49 participated in 2 drills (N = 98) during December 2015–May 2016. Three pilot drills were excluded from the analysis. The patient was masked and isolated in 78% of drills; 61% of hospitals completed this process in both drills. Masking and isolation was observed in a higher proportion of drills when travel history was obtained, compared with drills when travel history was not obtained (88% vs. 21%; P < 0.0001). The median time from patient entry to masking was 1 minute and 9 minutes to placement into isolation. Overall, 36% of staff practiced hand hygiene and 77% entered the isolation room wearing Personal Protective Equipment. Identified best practices include the use of triage questionnaires to identify high-risk patients and algorithms to guide masking and isolation procedures. CONCLUSION: ED staff’s ability to identify potentially infectious patients and implement recommended control measures varied. Drill findings were used to inform hospital improvement planning and will guide citywide efforts to improve healthcare system readiness for communicable diseases through addressing identified gaps and supporting implementation of best practice recommendations.

23428,Heterocycle-Fused Acridines,2008-04-25,"BACKGROUND: Human parechovirus (HPeV) type 3 (HPeV3) is an emerging pathogen causing sepsis and meningoencephalitis in neonates and young infants. However, specific treatment for HPeV3 infection is currently unavailable. The application of antisense technology, such as peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), to viral infection has opened a new era of therapeutics. The aim of this study is to develop PNAs inhibiting HPeV3 gene expression in an in vitro model. METHODS: We designed four PNAs that target domains I, J (base and head of domain J structure), and K of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) region within the 5’ untranslated region of HPeV3. The IRES region is needed for the cap-independent translation. The PNAs were conjugated to cell-penetrating peptide (RXR)(4)XB (R = L-arginine, X = 6-aminohexanoic acid, B = β-alanine). LLC-MK2 cells were treated with 0.1–10µM of each PNA or water-containing growth medium for 4h. The cells were then infected with HPeV3 at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for 1h. The infected cells were incubated for 7 days at 37ºC in 5% CO(2). Extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA were measured by real-time PCR on days 0 and 7. RESULTS: Without any treatment, an extracellular level of HPeV3 RNA increased to 8.2 × 10(6) copies/µL on day 7. When the cells were treated with 10µM of PNA targeting the domain I of IRES, an extracellular level of HPeV3 RNA was suppressed to 4.7 × 10(4) copies/µL (−99%) on day 7. Using the same PNA with lower concentrations, 1 µM and 0.1 µM of the PNA suppressed 24% and 0% of extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA, respectively, which demonstrated the effect is dose-dependent. In contrast, 10µM of PNAs targeting domain J (base), J (head), and K suppressed 94%, 92%, and 20% of extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA, respectively, compared with control. CONCLUSION: The PNA-(RXR)(4)XB targeting the domain I of IRES suppressed extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA in an in vitro model in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, PNA treatment may be a therapeutic candidate for HPeV3-infected patients. This novel therapy could target other HPeV genotypes given that the target sequence used in this study is identical to those of other clinically significant HPeVs.

A small proportion of CAP cases are caused by Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomona maltophilia [2, 3]. The main problem concerning the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections is their related antibiotic resistance, reported as multidrug resistant (MDR = resistant to at least one agent in three or more groups of antibiotics), extensively drug resistant (XDR = resistant to at least one agent in all but two or fewer groups of antibiotics) and pan-drug resistant (PDR = resistant to all groups of antibiotics) [4]. This makes the clinical management of pneumonia caused by such pathogens a challenge for physicians.

In this paper, we propose two algorithms to find the factors. In the first algorithm, the typical rough set method is used to generate all the variable precision rules firstly; secondly reduce attributes and generate all the non-variable precision rules; lastly compare the variable precision rules and non-variable precision rules to generate the factors that negate the variable precision rules. In the second algorithm, firstly, induce all the variable precision rules; secondly, select the examples corresponding to the variable precision rules to build decernibility matrixes; thirdly, generate the factors that negate the variable precision rules.

Although partially effective treatments are now available, MS represents a major target for research into the development of disease-modifying therapies that specifically focus on the neuroimmune pathways of myelin and tissue damage that currently are incompletely understood. Multiple sclerosis is considered to be an example of development of autoimmunity to self-antigens within the CNS through multiple initiating events that include infections and other environmental factors. The direct or indirect induction of immune responses against CNS antigens includes chemotaxis of T cells, B cells, and monocytes, and production of immunoglobulin responses, each of which can act as an effector of myelin damage that occurs in distinct histological patterns. Because a specific cause for MS has not been identified, much MS research has focused on CNS immune responses triggered by unidentified insults that in turn trigger inflammation-mediated cascades of myelin and cellular damage that are likely relevant to other neurodegenerative diseases. This chapter discusses current the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, animal models, virus models and recent advances in the neuroimmunology of MS from the perspective of the potential for development of newer therapies for MS and other inflammatory CNS diseases.","Soldan, Samantha S.; Wu, Gregory; Markowitz, Clyde; Kolson, Dennis L.",Neuroimmune Pharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120222/,53
24171,Polmoniti,2006,"The complement system plays a crucial role in host defense against pathogen infections and in the recognition and removal of damaged or altered self-components. Complement system activation can be initiated by three different pathways—classical, alternative, and lectin pathways—resulting in a proteolytic cascade, which culminates in multiple biological processes including opsonization and phagocytosis of intruders, inflammation, cell lysis, and removal of immune complexes and apoptotic cells. Furthermore, it also functions as a link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. The lectin pathway (LP) activation is mediated by serine proteases, termed mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine proteases (MASPs), which are associated with the pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) that recognize carbohydrates or acetylated compounds on surfaces of pathogens or apoptotic cells. These result in the proteolysis of complement C2 and C4 generating C3 convertase (C4b2a), which carries forward the activation cascade of complements, culminating in the elimination of foreign molecules. This chapter presents an overview of the complement system focusing on the characterization of MASPs and its genes, as well as its functions in the immune response.","Andrade, Fabiana A.; Lidani, Kárita C.

Despite the development of new antibiotics and vaccines, pneumonia is still a disease that occurs frequently in children under 5 years of age and is one of the main causes of mortality, especially in developing countries. The biggest challenge in treating pneumonia is to determine the agent, which depends on age, disease severity, immunological condition, geographic location, epidemiological situation, and immunizations. The classic clinical picture presents with fever, coughing, and difficulty in breathing. The physical examination shows tachypnea, reduced breath sounds, and fine crackles. Wheezing may be present in infants with viral pneumonia. The chest X-ray is considered an important tool to confirm the disease diagnosis and may guide specific treatment. Acute-phase reactants have a low sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between virus and bacteria. Microbiological identification does not have a clinical impact for most children with community-acquired pneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage may be considered for immunocompromised patients. Antibiotic treatment is empirical based on the best possible etiology, depending on the patient’s age and epidemiological timing.

Knowledge of the microbiology of sinusitis is necessary because it impacts the choice of antibiotic therapy. The sinus aspirate is the most reliable source of microbiological data in sinusitis in children. However, sinus aspirates are rarely done in cases of patients with rhinosinusitis; the last time one was done in a child was in 1984. When they are done, sinus aspirate studies of children showed the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis). Unlike sinus aspirates, nasopharyngeal and middle meatal cultures are not reliable in determining the bacteriology of children with acute sinusitis. The observation of an increase in the proportion of cases of acute otitis media caused by H. influenzae may reflect that in acute sinusitis as well. Staphylococcus aureus does not play a significant role in uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis. The microbiology of acute otitis media can be used as a surrogate for that of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. In contrast to bacteria, the contribution of viruses to the pathogenesis of acute bacterial sinusitis has not been studied systematically.

That is, if you are born in October/November in the northern hemisphere, then your first winter exposure to RSV is likely to be when you are less than 4 months of age and vulnerable because of poor respiratory mechanical reserve (Alonso et al. 2007). However, if you are born in May/June, then you will be 7–8 months during your first winter exposure to RSV, much bigger and stronger and have more efficient thoracic and diaphragmatic mechanics. In the PICU, the main predictors of severe outcome in previously well infants appear to be young age, presence of apnea, and pulmonary consolidation on admission chest radiograph (Tasker et al. 2000; Lopez Guinea et al. 2007).

The respiratory system consists of an air conduction portion and a respiratory portion. The direct initiating factor of the common cold is low temperature, especially relative coldness. When people feel cold or chilly, vascular constriction around the inlet area of air occurs, resulting in a reduction of mucus secretion containing various antiviral soluble mediators and followed by an explosive increase in the nasal viral flora. A relatively low temperature and dryness are good conditions for viral proliferation and invasion to the body. The first symptom of the common cold is usually a runny nose, followed by a sore throat and/or systemic fever. Acute symptoms of the common cold are usually terminated within 3 days, at the longest 5~7 days. The mortality rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has reached around 10%.

Vitamin C can prevent the onset of a cold. Vitamin C can even prevent influenza virus from spreading down from the upper respiratory tract to the lower one. In addition, levels of interferon (IFN) in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid are markedly low in vitamin C-insufficient mice. Inflammatory cells are markedly increased in BAL fluid, providing the immunological evidences that daily supplementation of high-dose vitamin C can prevent influenza infection and that, in extreme case, it can save the life.","Lee, Wang Jae",Vitamin C in Human Health and Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122289/,53

Nineteen years ago, when I was 8 years old, my connection with HIV/AIDS began; my Mom, divorced and raising me as a single parent, was diagnosed HIV-positive (herein HIV+). It was the mid-1980s and the Australian social climate surrounding AIDS was one laden with fear. During that time, Australia’s profound early response to what would become the worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic was taking form.","Ross, Alischa",Igniting the Power of Community,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122423/,53
25800,Rationale for the Existence of Zoos,2012-07-23,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic neonatal lung disease characterized by inflammation and arrest of alveolarization. Its common sequela, pulmonary hypertension (PH), presents with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance associated with remodeling of the pulmonary arterioles. Despite notable advancements in neonatal medicine, there is a severe lack of curative treatments to help manage the progressive nature of these diseases. Numerous studies in preclinical models of BPD and PH have demonstrated that therapies based on mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) can resolve pulmonary inflammation and ameliorate the severity of disease. Recent evidence suggests that novel, cell-free approaches based on MSC-derived exosomes (MEx) might represent a compelling therapeutic alternative offering major advantages over treatments based on MSC transplantation. Here, we will discuss the development of MSC-based therapies, stressing the centrality of paracrine action as the actual vector of MSC therapeutic functionality, focusing on MEx. We will briefly present our current understanding of the biogenesis and secretion of MEx, and discuss potential mechanisms by which they afford such beneficial effects, including immunomodulation and restoration of homeostasis in diseased states. We will also review ongoing clinical trials using MSCs as treatment for BPD that pave the way for bringing cell-free, MEx-based therapeutics from the bench to the NICU setting.","Yeung, Vincent; Willis, Gareth R.; Taglauer, Elizabeth; Mitsialis, S.

26579,Control Strategies,2015-03-16,"Pharmacy assessment of pediatric patients is similar in many ways to that of adults; however there are many specific nuances that need to be considered in addition to the typical aspects included in an adult assessment. There is a lack of pediatric-specific medication research and a much higher rate of “off label” medication use, so children are at higher risk of medication errors and related harm. Pharmacokinetic differences and other age-related differences result in highly variable responses to medications throughout childhood. Pharmacists need to be aware of this variability and use every patient encounter as an opportunity for assessment of many aspects of medication including dose, formulation, administration, and indication. Infants and children also have physiological differences that need to be considered especially when assessing efficacy, toxicity, and the patient’s overall response to medications through physical exam or use of laboratory values. Lastly, a lack of appropriate medication formulations for children creates a requirement for pharmacists to specifically assess the formulations, measurement, and administration of pediatric medications. This chapter provides an approach to pediatric assessment, highlights common sources of error, and provides strategies for managing pediatric medications.","Dersch-Mills, Deonne",Patient Assessment in Clinical Pharmacy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123523/,53
26592,The Network Source Location Problem in the Context of Foodborne Disease Outbreaks,2019-02-08,"The last 20 years have seen many advances in transfusion therapy and safety. Blood products are biological products engendering complex interactions with the immune system. Prestorage leukoreduction results in a reduced risk of febrile reactions, CMV transmission, and immune modulation, proving to be safer for patients than non-leuko reduced products. Simple patient identification issues and clerical error continue to be the primary causes of ABO-incompatible transfusions. Rigorous donor screening as well as serologic and nucleic acid testing for transfusion transmitted infection have brought the blood supply to a very safe level, although transmission of these agents continues to be a problem in underdeveloped countries. Emerging infectious diseases, beyond current laboratory detection capabilities, combined with global travel, pose unknown imminent risks everywhere. We also briefly discuss the current risks of transfusion-transmitted infections. We review currently available hemostatic blood products, their compositions, and their clinical indications; we mention product modifications currently in development; and we touch upon the hemostatic properties and drawbacks of whole blood, which is currently gaining popularity as an alternative to split blood products. We conclude with an in-depth overview of the risks associated with transfusion, including incompatibility, hemolytic transfusion reactions, transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI).","Boyd, Theresa M.; Lockhart, Evelyn; Welsby, Ian",Perioperative Hemostasis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123538/,53

Recently, two main trends characterise its developments: the adoption of deep learning architectures and the consideration of textual material originating from historical and cultural heritage collections. While the former opens up new opportunities, the latter introduces new challenges with heterogeneous, historical and noisy inputs. If NE processing tools are increasingly being used in the context of historical documents, performance values are below the ones on contemporary data and are hardly comparable. In this context, this paper introduces the CLEF 2020 Evaluation Lab HIPE (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities) on named entity recognition and linking on diachronic historical newspaper material in French, German and English. Our objective is threefold: strengthening the robustness of existing approaches on non-standard inputs, enabling performance comparison of NE processing on historical texts, and, in the long run, fostering efficient semantic indexing of historical documents in order to support scholarship on digital cultural heritage collections.","Ehrmann, Maud; Romanello, Matteo; Bircher, Stefan; Clematide, Simon",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148064/,53

In order to study the histological picture of these proliferation phases, we used a mouse model of contact sensitivity in the oral mucosa and on skin. We also used bromodeoxyuridin (BrdU, an analogue to thymidin) that is incorporated into the nucleus during cell replication. The hapten oxazolone (OXA) was used to sensitize and elicit the oral mucosa and/or the ear skin. Mice were killed at various times after elicitation, and unsensitized animals were also exposed to the hapten as controls. BrdU (25 mg/kg animal) was injected i.p. 2 h before the kill. Specimens from the oral mucosa, ear skin and submandibular and auricular lymph nodes were cut and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. They were then treated with acid and biotinylated anti‐BrdU antibody and developed using ABC‐kit and DAB. The analyses were performed using a Leica light microscope and the computer program analysis. In the oral mucosa, the frequency of proliferating cells were increasing during the observation period, 4–24 h after elicitation, regardless of site of sensitization. The proliferating cells were found mainly in the basal cell layer of the epithelium. Similar patterns were found in ear skin. The regional lymph nodes demonstrated a few scattered proliferating cells 4 h after elicitation. After 24 h, these cells were found frequently in the whole lymph node. Control animals exhibited considerable less proliferating cells at all times. We conclude that most proliferating cells were found 24 h after elicitation locally at the hapten‐exposed sites (the oral mucosa or the ear skin) as well as in the regional lymph nodes.","Ahlfors, E.; Sveinhaug, M.

31368,Abstracts for the forthcoming EPG meeting in Glasgow,2005-08-05,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects about 200–400 million people worldwide and represents one of the leading causes for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Control over the HBV infection is achieved mainly by vaccination with Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). HBsAg contains N‐linked glycosylation side and is recognized by both MBL‐A and MBL‐C in a Ca‐dependent manner. HbsAg–MBL complexes activate complement and may thus affect humoural immunity. To investigate the role of MBL in humoural responses to HBsAg, we immununized mice that lack both MBL‐A and MBL‐C proteins with soluble HBsAg. It has been shown that deficiencies in other complement components like C1q, C4 and C3 result in decreased antibody responses. However, MBL double KO animals mounted dramatically increased humoural responses. After priming, MBL double KOs mounted HbsAg‐specific IgM responses, which were threefold higher than WT controls. After boosting the HBsAg, total IgG was 10‐fold higher in MBL KO than in WT control animals. Similar to the response to HbsAg, other glycosylated soluble antigens (e.g. invertase) induced better humoural responses in MBL double KO animals, suggesting that MBL plays an important role in a negative feedback regulation of adaptive immunity. Reconstitution experiments with rMBL partially rescued the KO phenotype. We propose that the clearance of glycoprotein antigens in MBL KO is handled differently from the WT, resulting in better stimulation of humoural responses. Alternatively, glycoprotein‐Ag‐MBL‐rich complexes inhibit B‐cell responsiveness via putative MBL receptors.","Ruseva, M.; Gajdeva, M.; Takahashi, K.; Ezekowitz, A.; Thiel, S.; Jensenius, J.

31371,Connecting Communities through a Translational Focus,2020-04-21,"We previously reported that in mice with large progressing T‐cell lymphoma tumours, dysfunctions in the antitumour CTL activity occur, associated with an accumulation of splenic arginase‐producing myeloid suppressor cells (MSCs). In this study, we first demonstrate that both the presence and the activation state of these MSC depends on tumour evolution. While in tumour regressors hardly any arginase‐producing MSC can be found, both the amount and the arginase activity of this population expands from early over late progressors. This gradual induction of MSCs is paralleled by an increasing suppression of CTL activity and Th1, but not Th2, cytokine production. Upon analysing the molecular repertoire of MSC in vitro, we found, besides arginase1, a well‐established marker for alternatively activated myeloid cells or M2, a strong upregulation of FIZZ1 and Ym, two additional recently identified markers for M2. Further evaluation of molecular markers by microarray analysis in MSC yielded genes involved in wound healing (e.g. coagulation factor XIIIa), anti‐inflammation (e.g. selenoprotein P), immunomodulation (e.g. PD‐L2) and fat and sugar metabolism (e.g. leptin receptor). Of note, many of these genes are regulated by type 2 cytokines (IL‐4, IL‐13 and IL‐10) and are therefore rather M2 associated. Overall, our data provide new markers for MSC in cancer and further establish their M2 activation state.","Meerschaut, S.; Liu, Y.; Hassanzadeh, G. H.

BCV propagation was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of the virus with EGCg (0.5–10 µg/mL) before virus inoculation in dose‐dependent, incubation time‐dependent and temperature‐dependent manners. The antiviral effect of pretreating MDBK cells with EGCg on BCV propagation was much weaker than that of pretreating BCV with EGCg. The hemagglutination activity of BCV was also reduced by EGCg in a dose‐dependent manner. These results demonstrate that EGCg possesses a distinct anti‐BCV activity and strongly suggest that EGCg interferes with the adsorption of BCV to MDBK cells by the interaction of EGCg with BCV particles. EGCg may therefore be a useful candidate for controlling BCV infection more effectively.","MATSUMOTO, Mitsuyo; MUKAI, Takao; FURUKAWA, Satoru; OHORI, Hitoshi",Anim Sci J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7187767/,53
32128,Tools and techniques for disease risk assessment in threatened wildlife conservation programmes,2007-07-28,"1.. Avian influenza (AI) viruses primarily circulate in wild waterfowl populations and are occasionally transmitted to domestic poultry flocks. However, the possible roles of other wildlife species, such as wild mammals, in AI virus ecology have not been adequately addressed. 2.. Due to their habitat and behaviour, many wild mammals may be capable of transmitting pathogens among wild and domestic populations. Exposure to AI viruses has been reported in an array of wild and domestic animals. The presence of wild mammals on farms has been identified as a risk factor for at least one poultry AI outbreak in North America. These reports suggest the need for seroprevalence studies examining the exposure of wild mammals to AI viruses. 3.. Serological tests are routinely used to assess domestic poultry, domestic swine and human exposure to influenza A viruses, but these tests have not been validated for use in wild mammals. As such, some of these protocols may require adjustments or may be inappropriate for use in serology testing of wild mammals. Herein, we review these serological techniques and evaluate their potential usefulness in AI surveillance of wild mammals. We call for care to be taken when applying serological tests outside their original area of validation, and for continued assay verification for multiple species and virus strains.","VANDALEN, KACI K.; SHRINER, SUSAN A.; SULLIVAN, HEATHER J.; ROOT, J.

33013,Agrariër Vraagt Niet Snel Om Hulp,2020-06-12,"Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) play an important role in antiviral innate immune responses. Although many ISGs have been identified in mammals, researchers commonly recognize that many more ISGs are yet to be discovered. Current information is still very limited particularly for the systematic identification of type III ISGs. Similarly, current research on ISGs in birds is still in its infancy. The aim of this study was to systematically identify chicken type I (IFN-α), II (IFN-γ) and III (IFN-λ) ISGs and analyze their respective response elements. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was employed to identify those genes with up-regulated expression following chicken IFN-α, IFN-γ and IFN-λ treatment. Two hundred and five type I ISGs, 299 type II ISGs, and 421 type III ISGs were identified in the chicken. We further searched for IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) and gamma-activated sequences (GAS) elements in the promoters region of ISGs. The GAS elements were common in the promoter of type II ISGs and were even detected in type I and III ISGs. However, ISRE were not commonly found in the promoters of chicken ISGs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ISRE in chicken cells were significantly activated by IFN-α or IFN-λ treatment, and expectedly, that GAS elements were also significantly activated by IFN-γ treatment. Interestingly, we also found that GAS elements were significantly activated by IFN-λ. Our study provides a systematic library of ISGs in the chicken together with preliminary information about the transcriptional regulation of the identified ISGs.","Dai, Manman; Xie, Tingting; Liao, Ming; Zhang, Xiquan; Feng, Min",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245633/,53

It is often necessary to transform a set of data stored in a relational database (RDB) into a document store. There are several approaches that execute such translation. However, it is difficult to evaluate which target document structure is the most appropriate. In this article, we present a set of query-based metrics for evaluating and comparing documents schemas against a set of existing queries, that represent the application access pattern. We represent the target document schema and the queries as DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), which are used to calculate the metrics. The metrics allow to evaluate if a given target document schema is adequate to answer the queries. We performed a set of experiments to calculate the metrics over a set of documents produced by existing transformation solutions. The metric results are related with smaller coding effort, showing that the metrics are effective to guide the choice of a target NoSQL document structure.","Kuszera, Evandro Miguel; Peres, Letícia M.; Didonet Del Fabro, Marcos",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266434/,53

They enjoy a great popularity in the filed of machine learning by achieving good and competitive classification results. Nonetheless, while these approaches work properly under a certain framework, they present some weaknesses basically related to their inability to deal with uncertainty. This is considered as an important challenge in real-world classification problems. Furthermore, using traditional AIRS approaches, all memory cells are considered with the same importance during the classification process which may affect the final generated results. To tackle these issues, we propose in this paper a new AIRS approach under the belief function framework. Our approach tends to handle the uncertainty pervaded in the classification stage while taking into account the number of training antigens represented by each memory cell. The performance of the proposed evidential AIRS approach is validated on real-world data sets and compared to state of the art AIRS under certain and uncertain frameworks.","Abdelkhalek, Rihab; Elouedi, Zied",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274700/,53

Over the past two decades, the usage of wind energy has been increased dramatically. Appropriate wind energy investment valuations are vital for both the public and private sectors. The fluctuations in the energy prices, the uncertainties in the production levels and the changes in the investment costs harden the wind energy investment decision. Using the traditional investment valuations overlooks the necessary managerial flexibility of investments, uncertainty and risk concepts. The spherical fuzzy sets enable us dealing with this uncertain structure with the hesitancy. In this study, a new Spherical fuzzy cost benefit analysis is developed and modified to the wind energy investment evaluation. In order to show the applicability of the proposed method a wind energy investment is analyzed with it. This new approach by taking into account the hesitancy may enable investments to be evaluated with more flexibility and accuracy.","Onar, Sezi Cevik; Oztaysi, Basar; Kahraman, Cengiz",Intelligent and Fuzzy Techniques: Smart and Innovative Solutions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7351578/,53

To reduce verification time, we sample executions from a featured transition system – a model that represents jointly the state spaces of all variants. The combination of this compact representation and the inherent efficiency of SMC allows us to find bugs much faster (up to 16 times according to our experiments) than other methods. As any simulation-based approach, however, the risk of Type-1 error exists. We provide a lower bound and an upper bound for the number of simulations to perform to achieve the desired level of confidence. Our empirical study involving 59 properties over three case studies reveals that our method manages to discover all variants violating 41 of the properties. This indicates that SMC can act as a low-cost-high-reward method for verifying VIS.","Cordy, Maxime; Papadakis, Mike; Legay, Axel",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418118/,53

In the second part, I apply lessons given to us by the later Heidegger, specifically those oriented around the movement away from calculative thinking, in an effort to define a loose, albeit fundamentally ennobling prescriptive aimed at easing the existential strain of the situation we have found ourselves in.","Wasser, Ryan",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532336/,53
40720,Surmédicalisation,2020-10-11,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was discovered during the 2019 outbreak in Mainland China and the first cases were reported in Italy on February 21, 2020. This study evaluates the emergency department (ED) attendances of an academic hospital in northern Italy before and after media reported the news of the first infected patients in Italy. METHODS: Adult attendances in ED in February 2020 were analysed dividing the period into 4 weeks (days 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28) compared with the same periods in 2019. The visits were analysed separately according to the Italian colour code of triage: white (non-critical), green (low-critical), yellow (medium critical), red (life-threatening). The mean weekly number of attendances was compared with t-test. RESULTS: February 2020 total ED attendances compared with February 2019 were 4865 vs 5029 (-3.3%), of which white codes were 834 vs 762 (+9.4%), green 2450 vs 2580 (-5.0%), yellow 1427 vs 1536 (-7.1%), red 154 vs 151 (+2.0%). February 2020 weekly mean ED attendances compared with February 2019 had statistically significant difference only in the fourth week (days 22-28) for green codes (75 vs 92, p = 0.007) and yellow codes (41 vs 52, p = 0.047), not for white (27 vs 26, p = 0.760) and red codes (5 vs 5, p = 0.817). The first three weeks of February 2020 compared with 2019 showed no statistically significant difference in weekly mean ED attendances. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant reduction of green and yellow codes attendances at ED in the fourth week of February 2020, corresponding to the initial phase of Italian COVID-19 outbreak. The fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2 by attending the ED probably acted as a significant deterrent in visits, especially for low and medium critical patients.

40751,European Society of Neuroradiology (ESNR),2020-10-13,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing has experienced a steady increase in popularity for direct manufacturing, where complex geometric items can be produced without the aid of templating tools, and manufacturing waste can be remarkably reduced. While customized medical devices and daily life items can be made by 3D printing of thermoplastics, microbial contamination has been a serious obstacle during their usage. A very clever approaches to overcome this challenge is to incorporate antimicrobial metal or metal oxide (M/MO) nanoparticles within the thermoplastics during or prior to 3D printing. Many M/MO nanoparticles can prevent contamination from a wide range of microorganism, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria via various antimicrobial mechanisms. Additionally, they can be easily printed with thermoplastic without losing their integrity and functionality. In this mini review, we summarize recent advancements and discuss future trends related to the development of 3D printed antimicrobial thermoplastic nanocomposites by addition of M/MO nanoparticles.","Abudula, Tuerdimaimaiti; Qurban, Rayyan O.; Bolarinwa, Sherifdeen O.; Mirza, Ahmed A.; Pasovic, Mirza; Memic, Adnan",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7523645/,53

This work is intended to save COVID-19-infected patients from conveyed hazardous volatile gases (VOCs) by the gas stream. The VOCs are generally generated from the pathways of medical respiratory devices. METHOD: Here, we present a surface acoustic wave-based sensor device for sensing dichloromethane (DCM) gas that can be connected with a gas pathway system used in medical devices. Dichloromethane is a volatile organic compound. Single- (polyisobutylene, PIB) and multi- (polyisobutylene/silicon nitride, PIB/Si(3)N(4)) surface acoustic wave-based sensors are designed on LiNbO(3) piezoelectric substrate. The designed models patterned with interdigitated transducer (IDT) aluminum (Al) electrodes are used to analyze gas sensing behavior for dichloromethane (CH(2)Cl(2), DCM) gas. RESULTS: The studies for DCM gas sensing are carried out for single- and multi-layer models using COMSOL Multi-physics software. The resonant frequency and displacement are also observed for 100 ppm gas concentration of DCM at room temperature. It has been found that multi-layer designed model shows higher sensitivity as compared to single layer (PIB/LiNbO(3)) model on exposing DCM gas. CONCLUSION: The estimation of various parameters observed by the proposed module is also explained. It is observed that the sensitivity of sensor for detection of VOCs (generated in gas pathways in medical devices) is best suited in the present crisis of COVID-19 pandemic.","Kumar, Mukesh; Bhadu, Deepak",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7585997/,53

This pandemic requires the execution of planned control strategies, incorporating quarantine, self-isolation, and tracing of asymptomatic cases. Mathematical modeling is one of the prominent techniques for predicting and controlling the spread of COVID-19. The predictions of earlier proposed epidemiological models (e.g. SIR, SEIR, SIRD, SEIRD, etc.) are not much accurate due to lack of consideration for transmission of the epidemic during the latent period. Moreover, it is important to classify infected individuals to control this pandemic. Therefore, a new mathematical model is proposed to incorporate infected individuals based on whether they have symptoms or not. This model forecasts the number of cases more accurately, which may help in better planning of control strategies. The model consists of eight compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), asymptomatic (A), quarantined (Q), recovered (R), deaths (D), and insusceptible (T), accumulatively named as SEIAQRDT. This model is employed to predict the pandemic results for India and its majorly affected states. The estimated number of cases using the SEIAQRDT model is compared with SIRD, SEIR, and LSTM models. The relative error square analysis is used to verify the accuracy of the proposed model. The simulation is done on real datasets and results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These results may help the government and individuals to make the planning in this pandemic situation.","Kumari, Preety; Singh, Harendra Pal; Singh, Swarn",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7662031/,53

I argue that posts often express experiences, thoughts, and fantasies in a schematic manner. They reproduce a paranoid-schizoid logic by which particular views on the current crisis are articulated and different ones are negated. The Kleinian framework is supplemented with Lacan’s notion of the Discourse of the Hysteric. I argue that the examples discussed in this article are instances of hysteric modes of relating to an Other (e.g. the expert) that is allegedly withholding important information from the subject. Splitting is amplified by the technological functioning of social media themselves which split users along a paranoid-schizoid dynamic for purposes of surveillance, advertising and profit maximization. I conclude by outlining steps towards the Kleinian ‘depressive position’ both in relation to how we engage with COVID-19 and social media. The depressive position acknowledges both good and bad aspects of a given situation. I further show how it can be supplemented via the Lacanian Discourse of the Analyst which includes a commitment to the limits of knowledge, certainty, and prediction.","Johanssen, Jacob",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7669451/,53

However, it is difficult to ascertain the M. hyopneumoniae infection state of sows due to limited detection methods. This report investigated sow herd stability by applying nested PCR to laryngeal swabs of suckling pigs, which is reportedly the most sensitive method. RESULTS: M. hyopneumoniae was detected in 14 farms (63.6%) and 127 piglets (6.5%). The prevalence of sows likely to transmit M. hyopneumoniae in herds (11.1%) was calculated. In addition, there was a significant difference in detection rates among farms depending on herd size, gilt replacement rate, acclimation method, and antibiotic usage, suggesting various parameters that influence sow stability. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that laryngeal swabs from suckling pigs have provided useful information regarding vertical transmission from sows in South Korean farm conditions. This result demonstrated that farms with larger herd sizes, higher gilt replacement rates, and a practice of naturally exposing gilts for acclimation had higher detection rates in weaning piglets, indicating an unstable sow infection state.","Oh, YuSik; Baek, JongHyuk; Lee, JoongBok; Cho, Sun-Hee; Park, Changhoon",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7681762/,53

The objective of this study was to examine relationships between material hardship, parenting stress, social support, and resilience and custodial grandparents’ psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and further investigate the moderating role of kinship license status. A cross-sectional survey was administered to collect data from custodial grandparents (N = 362) in the United States. T-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression models were conducted using STATA 15.0. Results indicated that material hardship (OR = 1.77, p < 0.001) was associated with higher odds of psychological distress, whereas custodial grandparents’ resilience (OR = 0.08, p < 0.001) and social support (OR = 0.39, p < 0.001) were associated with lower odds of experiencing psychological distress. Increased parenting stress in COVID-19 was not significantly associated with psychological distress. Kinship license status moderated the relationships between social support (OR = 0.23, p < 0.05), resilience (OR = 5.06, p < 0.05) and psychological distress. To address custodial grandparents’ psychological distress, more allocated emergency funds and tailored financial services should be provided to meet material needs, and interventions with a focus on resilience and social support are particularly needed. Although licensed custodial grandparents were more likely to experience psychological distress due to their pre-existing vulnerability than unlicensed counterparts, parallel services should be provided to all kinship caregivers.","Xu, Yanfeng; Jedwab, Merav; Wu, Qi; Levkoff, Sue; Xu, Ling",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741133/,53

Evaluation of donor fundamentally assesses the risk of infectious disease transmission to the recipient and improves the quality of hematopoietic progenitors cell (HPC) product. It also minimizes the chances of adverse donor reactions during the donation process. Ideally, the donor evaluation should involve eliciting a detailed medical history, high-risk behavior, and psychosocial evaluation followed by a complete physical examination and a battery of investigation. Any abnormal finding would not necessarily lead to donor deferral but help the clinical team to closely access the risk versus benefit. It is mandatory to take informed written consent from all donors. Special considerations are taken in autologous patients and pediatric donors to obtain a good quality HPC product. A thorough review and evaluation of all vital organ function in the recipients should be completed to determine transplant eligibility. The disease status at the time of HSCT will help the physician determine the conditioning regimen to prescribe. Pre-transplant psychosocial risk factors are said to predict survival after HSCT. The hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidity index (HCT-CI) is a commonly used tool to score pre-transplant comorbidities that predict non-relapse mortality and survival. Patient and donor education is a vital part of care for HSCT patients, their families, and informal caregivers.

Successful solutions to this problems over various commutative groups allow to efficiently perform number-theoretic tasks such as factoring or finding discrete logarithms. The latest successful generalization (Eisenträger et al. STOC 2014) considers the problem of finding a full-rank lattice as the hidden subgroup of the continuous vector space [Formula: see text] , even for large dimensions m. It unlocked new cryptanalytic algorithms (Biasse-Song SODA 2016, Cramer et al. EUROCRYPT 2016 and 2017), in particular to find mildly short vectors in ideal lattices. The cryptanalytic relevance of such a problem raises the question of a more refined and quantitative complexity analysis. In the light of the increasing physical difficulty of maintaining a large entanglement of qubits, the degree of concern may be different whether the above algorithm requires only linearly many qubits or a much larger polynomial amount of qubits. This is the question we start addressing with this work. We propose a detailed analysis of (a variation of) the aforementioned HSP algorithm, and conclude on its complexity as a function of all the relevant parameters. Our modular analysis is tailored to support the optimization of future specialization to cases of cryptanalytic interests.

Typical techniques used for high-accuracy positioning in indoor use case scenarios, such as systems using ultra-wide band radio signals (UWB), cannot be applied for underwater positioning because of the quick absorption of the positioning medium caused by the water. Acoustic and optic solutions for underwater positioning also face known problems, such as the multi-path effects, high propagation delay (acoustics), and environmental dependency. This paper presents an oscillating magnetic field-based indoor and underwater positioning system. Unlike those radio wave-based positioning modalities, the magnetic approach generates a bubble-formed magnetic field that will not be deformed by the environmental variation because of the very similar permeability of water and air. The proposed system achieves an underwater positioning mean accuracy of 13.3 cm in 2D and 19.0 cm in 3D with the multi-lateration positioning method and concludes the potential of the magnetic field-based positioning technique for underwater applications. A similar accuracy was also achieved for various indoor environments that were used to test the influence of cluttered environment and of cross environment.

Consequently, there is a significant attrition rate while awaiting transplantation. Lung procurement rates are lower than those of other solid organs. Lungs are procured from only 15–20% of donors compared with 30% of decreased donors for hearts. The reason for this low retrieval rate is related to a number of factors. Brain death is associated with neurogenic pulmonary edema. Additionally, injury to the lung itself may occur before or after brain death. Aspiration of gastric contents, pneumonia, previous thoracic trauma, ventilator-associated injury, atelectasis, and pulmonary thrombosis/embolism may all contribute to lung injury before consideration for harvest. Donation after circulatory death (DCD) is one category of nontraditional organ donation now being performed in increasing numbers as a way to increase the number of lungs available for transplantation.

Since the molecular mechanism underlying this entity of primary immunodeficiency has been recently described, more insight regarding the function and profile of immunity is required. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate stimulated antibody production, polyclonal vs. virus-specific T-cell response, and cytokine production of a CD70-deficient patient reported previously with early-onset antibody deficiency suffering from chronic viral infections and B-cell lymphoma. The patient and her family members were subjected to clinical evaluation, immunological assays, and functional analyses. The findings of this study indicate an impaired ability of B cells to produce immunoglobulins, and a poor effector function of T cells was also associated with the severity of clinical phenotype. Reduced proportions of cells expressing the memory marker CD45RO, as well as T-bet and Eomes, were observed in CD70-deficient T cells. The proportion of 2B4(+) and PD-1(+) virus-specific CD8(+) T cells was also reduced in the patient.

Indeed, in view of the important constraints these standards impose on European legislators, it is of utmost importance that they be involved early on when they are defined to avoid any democratic accountability gap from arising.","Fromage, Diane",J Bank Regul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8220431/,53

56199,Editorial on this Focus Issue on Key Corrosion Topics,2021-07-26,"Silver nanoparticles are widely used in the biomedical and agri-food fields due to their versatility. The use of biological methods for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles has increased considerably due to their feasibility and high biocompatibility. In general, microorganisms have been widely explored for the production of silver nanoparticles for several applications. The objective of this work was to evaluate the use of entomopathogenic fungi for the biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles, in comparison to the use of other filamentous fungi, and the possibility of using these nanoparticles as antimicrobial agents and for the control of insect pests. In addition, the in vitro methods commonly used to assess the toxicity of these materials are discussed. Several species of filamentous fungi are known to have the ability to form silver nanoparticles, but few studies have been conducted on the potential of entomopathogenic fungi to produce these materials. The investigation of the toxicity of silver nanoparticles is usually carried out in vitro through cytotoxicity/genotoxicity analyses, using well-established methodologies, such as MTT and comet assays, respectively. The use of silver nanoparticles obtained through entomopathogenic fungi against insects is mainly focused on mosquitoes that transmit diseases to humans, with satisfactory results regarding mortality estimates. Entomopathogenic fungi can be employed in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles for potential use in insect control, but there is a need to expand studies on toxicity so to enable their use also in insect control in agriculture.","Santos, Tárcio S.; Silva, Tarcisio M.; Cardoso, Juliana C.; de Albuquerque-Júnior, Ricardo L.

Fueled by considerable improvements in mass spectrometry sensitivity and sample processing, chemoproteomic strategies have revealed thousands of proteins that can be covalently modified by reactive small molecules. Fragment-based drug discovery, which has traditionally been used in a target-centric fashion, is now being deployed on a proteome-wide scale thereby expanding its utility to both the discovery of novel covalent ligands and their cognate protein targets. This powerful approach is allowing ‘high-throughput’ serendipitous discovery of cryptic pockets leading to the identification of pharmacological modulators of proteins previously viewed as “undruggable”. The reactive fragment toolkit has been enabled by recent advances in the development of new chemistries that target residues other than cysteine including lysine and tyrosine. Here, we review the emerging area of covalent fragment-based ligand discovery, which integrates the benefits of covalent targeting and fragment-based medicinal chemistry. We discuss how the two strategies synergize to facilitate the efficient discovery of new pharmacological modulators of established and new therapeutic target proteins.","Lu, Wenchao; Kostic, Milka; Zhang, Tinghu; Che, Jianwei; Patricelli, Matthew P.; Jones, Lyn H.; Chouchani, Edward T.; Gray, Nathanael S.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8341086/,53
57122,Sommaire,2021-08-27,"Creditors often critically shape the fate of bankruptcy reorganizations, yet the drivers and implications of creditors’ reorganization plan confirmations are still not completely understood. Exploring micro-level data on bankruptcy reorganization proceedings in Slovenia, we find that creditors, above all, demand a credible change in the exercise of control rights. The prospects of plan confirmation are positively associated with debt-to-equity conversion as well as those majority ownership changes that occur during the proceeding and feature a domestic incoming owner. In contrast, we find no evidence that plan confirmation is related to management turnover, majority ownership transfers involving a foreign incoming owner, pre-bankruptcy financial indicators other than leverage, the number of creditors, the value of different types of claims, and even the contractual details for the repayment of claims. The incidence of creditor-induced socially costly filtering failures is quite high, with estimates ranging between 41 and 78% based on the ex-post approach and between 40 and 61% based on the ex-ante approach. Confirmations of plans from non-viable businesses are more prevalent than rejections of plans from viable businesses.

57906,More Than a Motivational Poster,2021,"There is a general scholarly consensus that populist governments undermine liberal democracy at home, but less agreement over how they behave abroad. While many scholars still subscribe to the view that populism has no consistent impact on foreign policy, we argue that populist leaders engage in a characteristic set of behaviors calculated to elevate the state’s status on the international stage. However, the mechanism by which populist elite-versus people rhetoric translates into concrete foreign policy action remains underspecified. To address this gap, we develop a model showing how populism serves as a political argument to enable status elevation on the international stage. To illustrate this mechanism in action, we analyze the foreign policy rhetoric and behavior of the 2010–2020 Fidesz governments in Hungary, showing how populist argumentation was used to justify revisionist foreign policy through (1) the politicization of diplomatic machinery, (2) confrontation with traditional allies, and (3), the pursuit of more flexible partnerships. In these three respects, we show how populist arguments were used by Orbán to achieve a revolution in Hungarian foreign affairs.

58304,"The origins of viruses: discovery takes time, international resources, and cooperation",2021-09-30,"BACKGROUND: The 21st century already witnessed many deadly epidemics and pandemics. The major ones were respiratory tract infections like SARS (2003), H1N1 (2009), MERS (2012) and the most recent pandemic COVID-19 (2019). The COVID-19 story begins when pneumonia of unknown cause was reported in the WHO country office of China at the end of 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent that enters the host through the receptor ACE2, a component of the renin–angiotensin system. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Symptoms of COVID-19 varies from patient to patient. It is all about the immunity and health status of the individual that decides the severity of the disease. The review focuses on the significant and often prevailing factors, those that influence the lung function. The factors that compromise the lung functions which may prepare the ground for severe COVID-19 infection are interestingly looked into. Focus was more on air pollution and cigarette smoke. SHORT CONCLUSION: The fact that the forested areas across the world show very low COVID-19 infection rate suggests that we are in need of the “Clean Air” on the fiftieth anniversary of World Earth Day. As many policies are implemented worldwide to protect from SARS-CoV-2, one simple remedy that we forgot was clean air can save lives. SARS-CoV-2 infects our lungs, and air pollution makes us more susceptible. In this crucial situation, the focus is only on the main threat; all other conditions are only in words to console the situation.","Vijayakumar, Vijaytha; Sabu, A.; Haridas, M.",Egypt J Bronchol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475828/,53

Due to the several shortcomings of the available diagnostic methods, tuberculosis disease continues to spread. The difficulty to obtain sputum among the very ill patients and the children also affects the quick diagnosis of tuberculosis disease. These challenges warrant investigating different sample types that can provide results in a short time. Highlighted in this review are the approved pulmonary tuberculosis diagnostic methods and ongoing research to improve its diagnosis. We used the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews to search for studies that met the selection criteria for this review. In this review we found out that enormous biosignature research is ongoing to identify host biomarkers that can be used as predictors of active PTB disease. On top of this, more research was also being done to improve already existing diagnostic tests. Host markers required more optimization for use in different settings given their varying sensitivity and specificity in PTB endemic and non-endemic settings.","Namuganga, Anna Ritah; Chegou, Novel N.; Mayanja-Kizza, Harriet",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8495065/,53

DESIGN Analysis of paid Medicare claims via the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services DataLink Project. SETTING All U.S. acute-care hospitals, excluding federally operated hospitals (Veterans Administration and Defense Health Agency). PATIENTS All Medicare beneficiaries, January 2012-February 2020, with an explicit sepsis diagnostic code assigned during an inpatient admission. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The count of Medicare Part A/B (fee-for-service) plus Medicare Advantage inpatient sepsis admissions rose from 981,027 (CY2012) to 1,700,433 (CY 2019). The proportion of total admissions with sepsis in the Medicare Advantage population rose from 21.43% to 35.39%, reflecting the increasing beneficiary proportion enrolled in Medicare Advantage. In CY2019, 6-month mortality rates in Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries for sepsis continued to decline, but remained high: 59.9% for septic shock, 35.5% for severe sepsis, 30.8% for sepsis attributed to a specific organism, and 26.5% for unspecified sepsis. Total fee-for-service-only inpatient hospital costs rose from $17.79B (CY2012) to $22.98B (CY2019). We estimated that the aggregate cost of sepsis hospital care for the entire U.S. population was at least $57.47B in 2019. Inclusion of 14 months' (January 2019-February 2020) newer data exposed new trends: the cost per patient, number of admissions, and fraction of patients with sepsis labeled as present on admission inflected around November 2015, coincident with the change to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition, and introduction of the Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Management Bundle (SEP-1) metric. CONCLUSIONS Sepsis among Medicare beneficiaries precoronavirus disease 2019 imposed immense burdens upon patients, their families, and the taxpayers.","Frank, Charles E; Buchman, Timothy G; Simpson, Steven Q; Sciarretta, Kimberly L; Plopper, George E; Finne, Kristen P; Sowers, Nicole; Collier, Michael; Chavan, Saurabh; Lin, Cheng; Oke, Ibijoke; Rhodes, Kiersten E; Santhosh, Aathira; Chu, Steve; MaCurdy, Thomas E; Patel, Sandeep A; Disbrow, Gary L; Kelman, Jeffrey A",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582410/,53

As severe acute respiratory syndrome is the major cause of mortality after COVID-19 infection, patients with COVID-19 who are prone to severe acute respiratory problems may require mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; Alhazzani et al., 2020). Ongoing advances in intensive care medicine are continuing to improve survival in critically ill patients (Kaukonen, Bailey, Suzuki, Pilcher, & Bellomo, 2014). However, intensive care unit (ICU) survivors may experience complications and problems related to their disease and treatment such as critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, and post intensive care syndrome (PICS; Alhazzani et al., 2020). Harvey (2012) reported that 85%-95% of ICU patients have ICU-acquired weakness after ICU discharge and 74% of ICU patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome have cognitive impairment after ICU discharge. Physical disabilities, cognitive impairment, and mental or psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder) after ICU discharge may be symptoms of PICS, and may continue to affect surviving patients for several years after ICU discharge (Elliott et al., 2014; Held & Moss, 2019; Jackson et al., 2014; Jubran et al., 2010). Efforts to prevent and treat COVID-19 in Taiwan have proven more effective compared to most other places in the world. In addition to the low number of diagnosed cases, the mortality rate (seven of 440 confirmed cases) in Taiwan has been significantly lower than in most other countries (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, ROC, 2020, May 14). However, post-discharge care for ICU survivors, especially those hospitalized after a sudden onset of severe disease symptoms and then discharged after a long ICU stay or after receiving mechanical ventilation, require specialized care to minimize PICS. Nurses are responsible not only for treating patients with the disease but also for preventing the further spread of disease. Therefore, providing continued care to patients discharged from the ICU is essential. Specifically, interventions to avoid PICS must be implemented rapidly by multidisciplinary medical teams during and immediately after ICU discharge.","Lin, Yu-Hua",Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,https://doi.org/10.6224/jn.202006_67(3).01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32495323/,53

Will the PPF get improved or stay stable, or progress? Such questions could only be answered by follow-up and monitoring of the pulmonary function.

This study aims to investigate whether brief culturally sensitive and transdiagnostic psychoeducation is effective in increasing mental health literacy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The study is a parallel two-group randomised controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation to either culturally sensitive, low-threshold psychoeducation ('Tea Garden' (TG)) or a waitlist (WL) control group. It takes place at four study sites in Germany. A total of 166 adult asylum seekers who report at least mild mental distress will be randomly assigned. The TG consists of two 90 min group sessions and provides information about mental distress, resources and mental health services in a culturally sensitive manner. The primary outcome is the percentage of participants in the TG, as compared with the WL, achieving an increase in knowledge concerning symptoms of mental disorders, individual resources and mental healthcare from preintervention to postintervention. The further trajectory will be assessed 2 and 6 months after the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes include changes in mental distress, openness towards psychotherapy and resilience. Furthermore, healthcare utilisation and economics will be assessed at all assessment points. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study has been approved by the Ethics Commission of the German Psychological Society (ref: WeiseCornelia2019-10-18VA). Results will be disseminated via presentations, publication in international journals and national outlets for clinicians. Furthermore, intervention materials will be available, and the existing network will be used to disseminate and implement the interventions into routine healthcare.

Unfortunately, total parenteral nutrition was complicated by serious infective and metabolic side effects that undermined the beneficial effects of nutrient repletion. Consequently, creative ways of restoring upper gut function were designed, based on semielemental diets and novel feeding tube systems. The employment of specific protocols and acceptance of increased gastric residual volumes has allowed most patients in intensive care to be fed safely and early by nasogastric tube. However, nasogastric feeding is unsuitable for patients with severely compromised gastric emptying owing to partial obstruction or ileus. Such patients require postpyloric tube placement with simultaneous gastric decompression via double-lumen nasogastric decompression and jejunal feeding tubes. These tubes can be placed endoscopically 40-60 cm past the ligament of Treitz to enable feeding without pancreatic stimulation. In patients whose disorders last more than 4 weeks, tubes should be repositioned percutaneously, by endoscopic, open or laparoscopic surgery. Together, the advances in enteral access have improved patients' outcomes and led to a 70-90% reduction in the demand for total parenteral nutrition.","O'Keefe, Stephen J D",Nature reviews.

The use of the da Vinci(®) Robotic system has been postulated to improve outcomes, primarily by increasing the dexterity and facility with which complex dissections can be performed. We report a large, single institution, comparative study of laparoscopic and robotic colectomies, attempting to better elucidate the benefits of robotic surgery in patients with colorectal disease. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of 171 patients who underwent robotic and laparoscopic colectomies (79 and 92, respectively) at our institution between November 2004 and November 2009. Patients in both groups had well-matched preoperative parameters. All cases were further subdivided by their anatomical location into right-sided and left-sided colectomy, and analysis was performed within these two subgroups. Perioperative outcomes reported include operative time, operative blood loss, time to return of bowel function, time to discontinuation of patient controlled analgesia, length of stay, and intraoperative or postoperative complications. RESULTS Our results indicate that there is no statistical difference in length of stay, time to return of bowel function, and time to discontinuation of patient-controlled analgesia between robotic and laparoscopic left and right colectomies. Interestingly, the total procedure time difference between the laparoscopic and robotic colectomies was much smaller than previously published accounts (mean 140 min vs. 135 min for right colectomy; mean 168 min vs. 203 min for left colectomy). CONCLUSIONS Our study is one of the largest reviews of robotic colorectal surgery to date. We believe that our results further demonstrate the equivalence of robotic surgery to laparoscopic surgery in colorectal procedures. Future research should focus on surgeon-specific variables, such as comfort, ergonomics, distractibility, and ease of use, as other ways to potentially distinguish robotic from laparoscopic colorectal surgery.","Deutsch, Gary B; Sathyanarayana, Sandeep Anantha; Gunabushanam, Vikraman; Mishra, Nitin; Rubach, Eugene; Zemon, Harry; Klein, Jonathan D S; Denoto, George",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1977-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22044968/,53
63598,Development of a novel transgenic rat overexpressing the P2Y(2) nucleotide receptor using a lentiviral vector.,2009,"Community-acquired pneumonia by primary or superinfections with Streptococcus pneumoniae can lead to acute respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation. The pore-forming toxin pneumolysin alters the alveolar-capillary barrier and causes extravasation of protein-rich fluid into the interstitial pulmonary tissue, which impairs gas exchange. Platelets usually prevent endothelial leakage in inflamed pulmonary tissue by sealing inflammation-induced endothelial gaps. We not only confirm that S pneumoniae induces CD62P expression in platelets, but we also show that, in the presence of pneumolysin, CD62P expression is not associated with platelet activation. Pneumolysin induces pores in the platelet membrane, which allow anti-CD62P antibodies to stain the intracellular CD62P without platelet activation. Pneumolysin treatment also results in calcium efflux, increase in light transmission by platelet lysis (not aggregation), loss of platelet thrombus formation in the flow chamber, and loss of pore-sealing capacity of platelets in the Boyden chamber. Specific anti-pneumolysin monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies inhibit these effects of pneumolysin on platelets as do polyvalent human immunoglobulins. In a post hoc analysis of the prospective randomized phase 2 CIGMA trial, we show that administration of a polyvalent immunoglobulin preparation was associated with a nominally higher platelet count and nominally improved survival in patients with severe S pneumoniae-related community-acquired pneumonia. Although, due to the low number of patients, no definitive conclusion can be made, our findings provide a rationale for investigation of pharmacologic immunoglobulin preparations to target pneumolysin by polyvalent immunoglobulin preparations in severe community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, to counteract the risk of these patients becoming ventilation dependent.

63743,A Facile and General Method for the Encapsulation of Different Types of Imaging Contrast Agents Within Micrometer-Sized Polymer Beads.,2012-02-22,"PURPOSE Propofol anesthesia is usually accompanied by hypotensive responses, which are at least in part mediated by nitric oxide (NO). Arginase I (ARG1) and arginase II (ARG2) compete with NO synthases for their common substrate L-arginine, therefore influencing the NO formation. We examined here whether ARG1 and ARG2 genotypes and haplotypes affect the changes in blood pressure and NO bioavailability in response to propofol. METHODS Venous blood samples were collected from 167 patients at baseline and after 10 min of anesthesia with propofol. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction. Nitrite concentrations were measured by using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay, while NOx (nitrites + nitrates) levels were determined by using the Griess reaction. RESULTS We found that patients carrying the AG + GG genotypes for the rs3742879 polymorphism in ARG2 gene and the ARG2 GC haplotype show lower increases in nitrite levels and lower decreases in blood pressure after propofol anesthesia. On the other hand, subjects carrying the variant genotypes for the rs10483801 polymorphism in ARG2 gene show more intense decreases in blood pressure (CA genotype) and/or higher increases in nitrite levels (CA and AA genotypes) in response to propofol. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that ARG2 variants affect the hypotensive responses to propofol, possibly by modifying NO bioavailability.

The TMJ implants were tested in a randomized preclinical trial, conducted in 24 black Merino sheep TMJ, perfoming bilateral interventions. Histologic, imaging, and kinematics analysis was performed. No statistical changes were observed between the PGS+PCL disc and the control group. PCL+PEGDA and PCL groups were associated with statistical changes in histology (p=0.004 for articular cartilage mid-layer; p=0.019 for structure changes and p=0.017 for cell shape changes), imaging (p=0.027 for global appreciation) and dangerous material fragmentation was observed. No biomaterial particles were observed in the multi-organ analysis in the different groups. The sheep confirmed to be a relevant animal model for TMJ disc surgery and regenerative approaches. PCL and PCL+PEGDA discs presented a higher risk to increase degenerative changes, due to material fragmentation. None of the tested discs regenerate a new autologous disc, however, PGS+PCL was safe, demonstrated rapid resorption, and was capable to prevent condyle degenerative changes.

64335,"Editorial: Strategizing food: stick, carrot but not nearly enough dairy?",2021-08-19,"BACKGROUND Health care workers treating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients face significant stressors such as caring for critically ill and dying patients, physically demanding care requiring new degrees of personal protective equipment use, risk of contracting the disease, and putting loved ones at risk. This study investigates the stress impact from COVID-19 exposure and how nurses and medical providers (eg, physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) experience these challenges differently. METHODS An electronic, self-administered questionnaire was sent to all hospital staff over 6 weeks surveying exposure to COVID-19 patients and degree of stress caused by this exposure. Responses from medical providers and nurses were analyzed for significant contributors to stress levels, as well as comparing responses from medical providers versus nurses. RESULTS Stress levels from increased risk of disease contraction while on the job, fear of transmitting it to family or friends, and the resulting social stigma were highest in medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with medical providers, nurses had nearly 4 times the odds of considering job resignation due to COVID-19. However, most health care workers (77.4% of medical providers and 52.9% of nurses) strongly agreed or agreed with the statements indicating high levels of altruism in their desire to treat COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION The significant stress burden placed on nurses likely contributes to increased thoughts of job resignation. However, health care providers displayed high levels of altruism during this time of extreme crisis, despite their personal risks of caring for COVID-19 patients.","Chu, Everett; Lee, Kyung-Min; Stotts, Ronnie; Benjenk, Ivy; Ho, Geoffrey; Yamane, David; Mullins, Billy; Heinz, Eric R",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.s1.200343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622825/,53

Nasal swabs for PCR testing for identification of respiratory viruses were obtained on children aged 2-11 y at baseline and when parents thought their child was developing a cold. Parental-recorded severity of specific symptoms in children with and without a documented viral URI were compared. Nasal swabs were obtained on 108 children whose parents reported their child was developing a cold. A viral etiology was identified in 62 of 108 (57.4%) samples. Symptom measures that best differentiated children with a viral etiology from those without were significant runny nose and significant cough on days 1-4 of the illness. A URI symptom score was developed based on these symptoms, with a sensitivity of 81.4%, specificity of 61.9%, and accuracy of 73.3%. Parental impression is only a moderately accurate predictor of viral URI in children. Our URI symptom score provided a more accurate method for identifying children with viral URIs for clinical studies.","Taylor, James A; Weber, Wendy J; Martin, Emily T; McCarty, Rachelle L; Englund, Janet A",Pediatric research,https://doi.org/10.1203/00006450-201011001-00493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20520584/,53
64452,Issue Highlights.,2021-10-01,"Despite significant advances in research on racial microaggressions, key challenges remain regarding how to define and classify them. Resolving these challenges is necessary to reduce misunderstanding and the subsequent minimization of racial microaggression research. Our goals in this article are to discuss the definitional challenges, to discuss implications for the creation of taxonomies, and to offer directions for how a revised definition and corresponding taxonomies can be used to further racial microaggression research. Regarding our first aim, we assert that racial microaggressions are observable events that occur independently of intention (i.e., regardless of whether they are intentional or unintentional) or impact (i.e., regardless of how they are perceived by recipients). Moreover, we assert that racial microaggressions are most validly defined by people of color and can have different meanings on the basis of situational context. The second aim is to propose a refinement and expansion of racial microaggression taxonomies. Sue and colleagues' taxonomy has been invaluable, yet other ways of classifying microaggressions and moving toward dimensional taxonomies are needed to advance scholarship. We highlight key dimensions related to the experience, perpetration, characteristics, and sociopolitical function of racial microaggressions that may be useful for future taxonomies. Overall, overcoming definitional challenges and expanding taxonomies holds potential to advance the literature on racial microaggression.","Mekawi, Yara; Todd, Nathan R",Perspectives on psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science,https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691621995181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34498525/,53
64672,Correction to: Extinction training following cocaine or MDMA self-administration produces discrete changes in D2-like and mGlu5 receptor density in the rat brain.,2020-07-20,"OBJECTIVES Since the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak started in late 2019, the older population has accounted for a large proportion of severe and fatal cases. This study investigated the mental state and attitudes of older Chinese adults during this epidemic. DESIGN Cross-sectional online surveys on a convenience sample of China's general population at two different time points. Online surveys were disseminated through popular Chinese social media applications. Adults 18 or older living in China during the initial (N = 1148) and second stages (N=470) were included in the survey. The Worries, Strategies, and Confidence Questionnaire (WSQ) was created to assess worries and awareness of the disease. RESULTS Combined responses (N=1618), 76.1% were female and about 7.0% were 60 years or above. In the first wave, older adults were found less likely to worry about being infected by COVID-19 (p < 0.05) and reported less attention paid to protective measures (p = 0.004) than young adults. However, as the disease evolved, older participants in the second wave were more worried than young adults (p = 0.027) and older adults in the first wave (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS During the epidemic of COVID-19, watchfulness of the epidemic among older Chinese adults fluctuated over time. Initially they were slow to respond proactively, but their worries gradually increased. Health care and social service professionals need to address the vulnerabilities of older adults to this public health crisis. This article is protected by copyright.

65470,Vaccines and routine immunization strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-08-26,"BACKGROUND Expert systems can help alleviate problems related to the shortage of human resources in critical care, offering expert advice in complex situations. Expert systems use contextual information to provide advice to staff. In mechanical ventilation, it is crucial for an expert system to be able to determine the ventilatory mode in use. Different manufacturers have assigned different names to similar or even identical ventilatory modes so an expert system should be able to detect the ventilatory mode. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of an algorithm to detect the ventilatory mode in use. METHODS We compared the results of a two-step algorithm designed to identify seven ventilatory modes. The algorithm was built into a software platform (BetterCare® system, Better Care SL; Barcelona, Spain) that acquires ventilatory signals through the data port of mechanical ventilators. The sample analyzed compared data from consecutive adult patients who underwent >24 h of mechanical ventilation in intensive care units (ICUs) at two hospitals. We used Cohen's kappa statistics to analyze the agreement between the results obtained with the algorithm and those recorded by ICU staff. RESULTS We analyzed 486 records from 73 patients. The algorithm correctly labeled the ventilatory mode in 433 (89 %). We found an unweighted Cohen's kappa index of 84.5 % [CI (95 %) = (80.5 %: 88.4 %)]. CONCLUSIONS The computerized algorithm can reliably identify ventilatory mode.","Murias, Gastón; Montanyà, Jaume; Chacón, Encarna; Estruga, Anna; Subirà, Carles; Fernández, Rafael; Sales, Bernat; de Haro, Candelaria; López-Aguilar, Josefina; Lucangelo, Umberto; Villar, Jesús; Kacmarek, Robert M; Blanch, Lluís",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-016-1436-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27522580/,53

While waiting for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing results, an accurate evaluation of the symptoms and serologic features can help us make a first diagnostic hypothesis and quickly start correct treatment. Physicians need a collaborative effort to develop and share a common database reporting clinical (anosmia, dysgeusia), serologic, and radiologic data in ICI-treated patients with lung cancer developing interstitial disease to create an evidence-based clinical diagnostic algorithm.

65639,Reply.,2021-02-10,"The ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spilled over into humans from an animal reservoir. Notably, the virus is now spilling back into a variety of animal species. It appears striking that American (Neovison vison) and European (Mustela vison) minks are the first intensively farmed animal to experience outbreaks. Neither of these have occurred in Asia or Africa but rather in Europe - namely Spain, Denmark, Netherlands and in the US, at a mink farm in Utah. Current evidence indicates that the virus was transmitted to the animals through infected human workers on the farm.At the time of writing, SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been documented in any other intensively farmed species, suggesting that mustelids may exhibit a higher susceptibility to the virus. Studies have shown that domestic ferrets have an extremely low resistance to COVID-19 infection (Shi et al. 2020). Mustelids comprise approximately 60 different species (Kollas et al. 2015) and are widely distributed across a number of habitats, both aquatic (marine and freshwater), and terrestrial (prairies, steppes, tundra, forests). Several wild mustelids have become acclimated to urban areas - such as raccoons, otters and badgers, and some are raised in households as pets - such as ferrets. The latter are perhaps at greater risk of infection than their cousins inhabiting the wild, but it is the former that we should be most worried about. If infection by SARS-CoV-2 spills into wild mustelids, these have the potential to become a permanent reservoir of infection for other animal species. Such a scenario has been seen before with rabies in raccoons and skunks (Rupprecht et al. 1995) and with bovine tuberculosis in badgers (Gallagher and Clifton-Hadley 2000).We believe that it is important to prioritize studies in mustelids on their putative role as reservoirs and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals and subsequently humans. The development of appropriate surveillance and intervention strategies will determine if mustelids are one of the key links in the chain to the initiation of an unprecedented epochal event: a panzootic.","Manes, Costanza; Gollakner, Rania; Capua, Ilaria",Veterinaria italiana,https://doi.org/10.12834/vetit.2375.13627.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32909703/,53
66136,Grounded in the World: Developmental Origins of the Embodied Mind.,2000-01-01,"BACKGROUND Inguinal hernia recurrence after surgical repair is a major concern. The authors report their experience with open and laparoscopic repair of recurrent inguinal hernias. METHODS After institutional review board approval, a retrospective review was performed with the charts of 197 patients who had undergone surgical repair of recurrent inguinal hernias from January 2000 through August 2009, and the data for 172 patients who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. Surgical variables and clinical outcomes were compared using Student's t test, the Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square, and Fisher's exact test as appropriate. RESULTS The review showed that 172 patients had undergone either open mesh repair (n=61) or laparoscopic mesh repair (n=111) for recurrent inguinal hernias. Postoperative complications were experienced by 8 patients in the open group and 17 patients in laparoscopic group (p=0.70). Five patients (8.2%) in the open group and four patients (3.6%) in the laparoscopic group had re-recurrent inguinal hernias (p=0.28). Four patients in the open group (9.5%) and no patients in the laparoscopic group had recurrence during long-term follow-up evaluation (p=0.046). In the laparoscopic group, 76 patients (68.5%) underwent total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair, and 35 patients (31.5%) had transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair. Postoperative complications were experienced by 13 patients in the TEP group and 4 patients in the TAPP group (p=0.44). Two patients (2.6%) in the TEP group and two patients (5.7%) in the TAPP group had re-recurrent inguinal hernias (p=0.59). CONCLUSIONS This retrospective review showed no statistical difference in the re-recurrence rate between the two techniques during short-term follow-up evaluation. However, the laparoscopic technique had a significantly lower re-recurrence rate than the open technique during long-term follow-up evaluation. Both procedures were comparable in terms of intra- and postoperative complications. Among laparoscopic techniques, TEP and TAPP repair are acceptable methods for the repair of recurrent inguinal hernia. A multicenter prospective randomized control trial is needed to confirm the findings of this study.","Shah, Nilay R; Mikami, Dean J; Cook, Charles; Manilchuk, Andrei; Hodges, Clayton; Memark, Vanchad R; Volckmann, Eric T; Hall, Clinton R; Steinberg, Steven; Needleman, Bradley; Hazey, Jeffrey W; Melvin, W Scott; Narula, Vimal K",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1564-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21298523/,53

The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 in February by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. COVID-19 presents as fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia. In a small subset of severe cases, the disease quickly progresses to respiratory failure and even death. Since the 21st century, there have been three major outbreaks caused by human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that broke out in 2003, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and the recent pandemic of COVID-19. Since 2003, significant progress has been made in the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV concerning their natural origins, pathogenesis, antiviral development and vaccine design. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related, previous findings on SARS-CoV are highly relevant to a better understanding as well as diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we highlight recent progresses in the field; compare the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; summarize the urgently-needed diagnostic, treatment, prevention and control options; and provide future perspectives for the outcome of the outbreak and research questions to be answered, including some of the difficulties in vaccine development.

Among them was the fear of a mechanical ventilator shortage due to COVID-19's high contagion rate and pathophysiology. Fears of a ventilator shortage unleashed a wave of innovations. MATERIAL AND METHOD This manuscript describes the AmboVent, a ventilator, rapidly developed with a sense of urgency, by a group of Israeli volunteers. RESULTS Using a decentralized approach, we worked extensively and managed within ten days to create a working ventilator. It utilizes a 64-year-old technological concept, the bag valve mask (BVM), sometimes known by the proprietary name Ambu bag, which we transformed into an automatic, controlled, and feature-rich ventilator by endowing it with contemporary computing technology.

66677,PANI/BaFe12O19@Halloysite ternary composites as novel microwave absorbent.,2020-08-06,"OBJECTIVES Although cancer is seen in every state in the United States, it does not affect every geographic area and population equally. Kentucky has the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates in the country, with an unusually high number of cases localized in its Appalachian region. Risk factors such as sun exposure, tobacco use, poor diet/exercise, poverty, and lack of access to healthcare centers contribute to this disparity. Because education levels in the area are low, cancer literacy (defined as how well a person can understand the advice of a healthcare professional and make appropriate lifestyle decisions) also is low. In this study, we examined the short-term and long-term effects of a brief cancer-related intervention on the cancer literacy of Kentucky middle and high school students. METHODS This study targeted middle and high school students in Kentucky. We administered an online 10-item cancer literacy pretest, followed by a brief educational intervention and a posttest to 164 students at six Kentucky middle and high schools. This posttest also included questions asking how likely students would be to change their habits or to encourage others to change their habits as a result of the intervention. All of the participating students also were sent a 3-month follow-up online survey with items identical to the pretest; 48 students completed the 3-month follow-up test, leading to a response rate of 29.2%. The data were summarized as frequencies, averages, median, and confidence intervals (CIs) of correctly marked answers. A paired t test was used to test for significance. RESULTS We observed an increase in the overall average test score from 50.2% (95% CI 47.8%-52.6%) on the pretest to 77.1% (95% CI 74.6%-79.7%) on the posttest immediately following the intervention. There also was an increase in the average number of correct responses on each item. The 3-month follow-up test similarly showed average test score improvement (75.4%). When asked how likely students would be to change their habits as a result of the intervention on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 = extremely unlikely, 10 = extremely likely), the median was 6. When asked how likely students would be to encourage another to change their habits, the median was an 8. CONCLUSIONS These results provide evidence that a brief educational intervention can increase cancer literacy, improve cancer knowledge retention, and encourage behavior change in Appalachian Kentucky students. Increasing cancer literacy may result in increased participation in preventive cancer screenings and improved health habits, which could ultimately lower cancer rates in the region.","Hudson, Lauren; Prichard, Chris; Weiss, L Todd; Vanderford, Nathan L",Southern medical journal,https://doi.org/10.14423/smj.0000000000001171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140106/,53

68476,How should we theorize about justice in the genomic era?,2021-05-01,"OBJECTIVES The impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes remains unknown. We studied this by conducting a meta-analysis to evaluate (1) CRC outcomes with and without DM and (2) treatment patterns. METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and CINAHL for full-text English studies from 1970 to 12/31/2017. We searched keywords, subject headings, and MESH terms to locate studies of CRC outcomes/treatment and DM. Studies were evaluated by two oncologists. Of 14,332, 48 met inclusion criteria. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method, we extracted study location, design, DM definition, covariates, comparison groups, outcomes, and relative risks and/or hazard ratios. We utilized a random-effects model to pool adjusted risk estimates. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality (ACM), disease-free survival (DFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS). The secondary outcome was treatment patterns. RESULTS Forty-eight studies were included, 42 in the meta-analysis, and 6 in the descriptive analysis, totaling > 240,000 patients. ACM was 21% worse (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.15-1.28) and DFS was 75% worse (OR 1.75, 95% CI: 1.33-2.31) in patients with DM. No differences were detected in CSS (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.98-1.23) or RFS (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91-1.38). Descriptive analysis of treatment patterns in CRC and DM suggested potentially less adjuvant therapy use in cases with DM and CRC. CONCLUSIONS Our meta-analysis suggests that patients with CRC and DM have worse ACM and DFS than patients without DM, suggesting that non-cancer causes of death in may account for worse outcomes.","Becker, Daniel J; Iyengar, Arjun D; Punekar, Salman R; Kaakour, Dalia; Griffin, Megan; Nicholson, Joseph; Gold, Heather T",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-020-03666-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32564124/,53

METHODS We placed a 7 cm nonsterile saline-filled latex balloon intra-abdominally to mimic or induce an abscess or inflammatory mass. Seven days later, we advanced a single-channel endoscope transanally into the sigmoid colon of the animal, made a colotomy and then advanced the endoscope intraperitoneally. We evacuated the identified abscess and placed a drain transabdominally. We closed the colotomy endoluminally with a tissue approximation system using 2 polypropylene sutures attached to metal T-bars. Two weeks later, we evaluated the colotomy closure at laparotomy. RESULTS We studied 12 dogs: 8 had subphrenic balloon implants and 4 had interbowel loop implants. Eleven survived and underwent transcolonic peritonoscopy; we identified the ""abscess"" in 9. The colotomy was successfully closed in 10 of 11 dogs. Although abscesses were easily identified, the overall difficulty of the peritonoscopy was moderate to severe. One dog required colotomy closure via laparotomy, while 9 had successful endoluminal closure. After colotomy closure, 8 animals survived for 2 weeks (study end point) without surgical complications, sepsis or localized abdominal infections. On postmortem examination, all closures were intact without any adjacent organ damage or procedure-related complications. CONCLUSION Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery provides a novel alternative to treating intra-abdominal pathology. It is technically feasible to perform endoscopic transcolonic peritonoscopy and drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess with reliable closure of the colotomy in a canine experimental model.","Moustarah, Fady; Talarico, Joseph; Zinc, Jill; Gatmaitan, Patrick; Brethauer, Stacy",Canadian journal of surgery.

69462,Easy Access to Phosphine-Borane Building Blocks.,2020-06-30,"OBJECTIVE Two methods of subatmospheric pressure wound therapy--wall suction applied to a sealed gauze dressing (GSUC) and the vacuum-assisted closure device (VAC)--were compared in hospitalized patients at University of Chicago Medical Center. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA VAC therapy is widely used, but can be expensive and difficult to apply; it also fails in some patients. METHODS A randomized prospective study of 87 patients (N = 45 in the GSUC arm and N = 42 in the VAC arm) was undertaken between October 2006 and May 2008. The study comprised patients with acute wounds resulting from trauma, dehiscence, or surgery. RESULTS Demographics and wound characteristics were similar in both groups. There were significant reductions in wound surface area and volume in each group. In the GSUC group, the reductions in wound surface area and volume were 4.5%/day and 8.4%/day, respectively (P < 0.001 for both), and in the VAC group, this was 4.9%/day and 9.8%/day, respectively (P < 0.001 for both). The reductions in wound surface area and volume were similar in both groups (P = 0.60 and 0.19, respectively, for the group-by-time interaction). The estimated difference (VAC - GSUC) was 0.4% (95% confidence interval: -1.0, 1.7) for wound surface area and 1.4% (95% confidence interval: -0.7, 3.5) for volume. The mean cost per day for GSUC therapy was $4.22 versus $96.51 for VAC therapy (P < 0.01) and the average time required for a GSUC dressing change was 19 minutes versus 31 minutes for a VAC dressing change (P < 0.01). The sum of pain intensity differences was 0.50 in the GSUC group compared with 1.73 for the VAC group (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS GSUC is noninferior to VAC with respect to changes in wound volume and surface area in an acute care setting. In addition, GSUC dressings were easier to apply, less expensive, and less painful.","Dorafshar, Amir H; Franczyk, Mieczyslawa; Gottlieb, Lawrence J; Wroblewski, Kristen E; Lohman, Robert F",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0b013e318221286c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21712704/,53
70376,Proteomics in non-model organisms: a new analytical frontier.,2020-08-10,"Objective Since December 2019, new pneumonia of unknown aetiology broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Subsequently, a virus, later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent of the disease. Currently, the epidemic has spread all over the world. The most common manifestations of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue and dry cough. At the moment, the nuclide acid test is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of this infection. Methods In the present paper, we report our experience with all patients who came to the Emergency Department from March 1 to April 1, 2020, with suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Patients: they all underwent a first oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab in the emergency department and, if negative, a second one after at least 24 hours. Results Our study shows how the results obtained at time zero are usually identical to the ones obtained after 24 hours. We thus suggest, in patients with high suspicion of COVID19 and a negative result at the first swab, to repeat the test after at least 48 hours, during which patients with symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia disease should be kept in isolation to avoid the risk of contagion. Conclusions these measures and in particular the early identifica-tion of cases with consequent isolation will allow the containment of the spread of the virus, representing one of the fundamental measures to guarantee and strengthen the control of the infection to reduce hospital admissions, the overload of national health service and health costs.","Piccioni, A; Franza, L; Rosa, F; Cicchinelli, S; Saviano, A; Valletta, F; de Cunzo, T; Zanza, C; Covino, M; Ojetti, V; Franceschi, F; Franceschi, F; Candelli, M",La Clinica terapeutica,https://doi.org/10.7417/ct.2021.2319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33956042/,53

71040,This month on Twitter.,2020-12-01,"Characterization of vessels distal from occluded site is important when considering endovascular revascularization therapy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke. The goal of this study was to assess the clinical value of intra-arterial contrasted high-resolution cone-beam computed tomography from the ascending aorta (Ao-CBCT) for visualization of the vessels distal from occluded site. Acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion who were to undergo EVT were evaluated. In EVT, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and Ao-CBCT were performed with local anesthesia. Ao-CBCT images were acquired in a 20-second rotational scan. Contrast medium was injected (1 mL/s for a total of 30 seconds using a 4-Fr catheter and an imaging delay of 10 seconds) from the ascending aorta. We assessed the image quality of Ao-CBCT and compared the visualization of the vessels distal from occluded site among magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), DSA and Ao-CBCT. We analyzed 14 patients (mean age, 66 years; three female patients). Stroke subtypes were cardiogenic (n = 6), atherothrombotic (n = 5) and others/unknown (n = 3). Occluded sites were middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 (n = 8), MCA M2 (n = 2), internal carotid artery (ICA) (n = 2), MCA M4 (n = 1) and basilar artery (BA) (n = 1). All obtained Ao-CBCT images successfully characterized the vessels distal from occluded site, and 11 images (79%) were excellent. In all cases, Ao-CBCT images could depict distal vessels with more detail when compared with MRA and DSA. Ao-CBCT is an efficient method to obtain detailed information regarding vessels distal from occluded site when compared with conventional examination methods.","Amano, Tatsuo; Sato, Masayuki; Matsumaru, Yuji; Sakuma, Hideyuki; Yoda, Syogo; Hamada, Yusuke",Neurologia medico-chirurgica,https://doi.org/10.2176/nmc.tn.2016-0291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28450677/,53

MOF is considered the result of an inappropriate generalized inflammatory response of the newborn to a variety of acute insults. This study was aimed at analyzing, at histology, multiple organ pathological changes in two newborns admitted to the NICU center of our University Hospital, who showed a progressive clinical picture of MOF, in order to verify the pathological changes of vascular structures and of endothelial cells in the different organs affected by MOF. All the samples obtained at autopsy for histological examination showed specific organ pathological changes, especially related to modifications in vascular structures and, in particular, in endothelial cells. The most interesting findings were found in the intestinal barrier, in the lower respiratory tract and in the endothelial barrier. The loss of the gut barrier could allow the passage into the blood of microbial factors that could trigger the production of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) leading to endothelial damage. Our preliminary study underlines the principal role probably played by intestinal and vascular changes in the origin of MOF in newborns.","Faa, Gavino; Fanni, Daniela; Gerosa, Clara; Nemolato, Sonia; Faa, Armando; Obinu, Eleonora; Puxeddu, Elisabetta; Fraschini, Matteo; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Zaffanello, Marco; Fanos, Vassilios","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2012.714643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23025772/,53

Algae can be a source of essential micronutrients and bioactive phytochemicals, although select varieties also often contain elevated concentrations of heavy metal contaminants. Due to the effects thermal processing of foodstuffs can have on levels of nutrients, phytochemicals, and contaminants, it is important to consider the role processing has on the levels of these components in algae food products. Here, we evaluate the literature covering how different types of processing, including commercial thermal application and in-home preparation, affect constituents such as vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, pigment compounds, and metal contaminants. Overall, the literature suggests that there are optimum processing conditions and specific cooking techniques that can be used to increase retention of important nutritional components while also reducing concentrations of metal contaminants. Although further research is needed on how thermal processing affects individual compounds in algae and their ultimate bioavailability, these data should be taken into consideration in order to inform design of product processing to both increase retention of nutritional components and limit metal contaminants.","Ho, Kacie K H Y; Redan, Benjamin W",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2020.1821598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962399/,53

BACKGROUND COVID-19 has had widespread implications for primary healthcare nurses. Supporting these nurses' capacity to deliver quality care ensures that ongoing health needs can be met. METHODS Primary healthcare nurses were recruited to an online survey via social media and professional organisations in April 2020. RESULTS Six-hundred and thirty-seven responses were included in analysis. Participants provided 1213 statements about perceived supports required to provide quality clinical care. From these, seven key categories emerged, namely; personal protective equipment, communication, funding, industrial issues, self-care, workplace factors and valuing nurses. CONCLUSION A number of key issues relating to personal health and safety, care quality, and job security need to be addressed to support primary healthcare nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing these support issues can assist in retaining nurses and optimising the role of primary healthcare nurses during a pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT Responding to the needs of primary healthcare nurses has the potential to facilitate their role in providing community based healthcare. This knowledge can guide the provision of support for primary healthcare nurses during the current pandemic, as well as informing planning for future health crises across the health service.","Halcomb, Elizabeth; Williams, Anna; Ashley, Christine; McInnes, Susan; Stephen, Catherine; Calma, Kaara; James, Sharon",Journal of nursing management,https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32713047/,53

Methods The literature search was conducted using the open-access 'Evidence Finder', a comprehensive youth mental health-specific database that is systematically populated from MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. Results Sixteen publications were identified after meeting the following eligibility criteria: (1) participants were young people (mean age 12-25.9 years) with a mental disorder diagnosed by a trained clinician or by reaching a predefined cut score on a symptom measure, (2) interventions were exercise, (3) designs were randomised or non-randomised controlled trials, (4) outcomes were mental health related. Eight studies included young people with depression, three included people with psychosis/schizophrenia, three included people with eating disorders and two included people with anxiety. The available evidence suggests that moderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise may be beneficial, particularly for reducing depression. The available evidence for other intervention intensities, and for other mental disorders, is mixed. Conclusions Overall, the evidence regarding the impact of exercise interventions on a range of mental health outcomes in clinical populations of young people with various mental disorders looks promising but requires further development.

The first wave of a repeated cross-sectional monitoring survey was conducted between May 14-29, 2020 to assess the mental health impacts of the pandemic and to identify the disproportionate impacts on populations or groups identified as experiencing increased risks due to structural vulnerability and pre-existing health and social inequities. Respondents included a nationally representative probability sample (n = 3000) of Canadian adults 18 years and older. Overall, Canadian populations are experiencing a deterioration in mental health and coping due to the pandemic. Those who experience health, social, and/or structural vulnerabilities due to pre-existing mental health conditions, disability, income, ethnicity, sexuality, and/or gender are more likely to endorse mental health deterioration, challenging emotions, and difficulties coping. This monitoring study highlights the differential mental health impacts of the pandemic for those who experience health, social, and structural inequities. These data are critical to informing responsive, equity-oriented public health, and policy responses in real-time to protect and promote the mental health of those most at risk during the pandemic and beyond.","Jenkins, Emily K; McAuliffe, Corey; Hirani, Saima; Richardson, Chris; Thomson, Kimberly C; McGuinness, Liza; Morris, Jonathan; Kousoulis, Antonis; Gadermann, Anne",Preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509605/,53

73514,Evaluation of factors predicting diminished ovarian reserve before and after laparoscopic cystectomy for ovarian endometriomas: a prospective cohort study.,2016,"The past decade has seen remarkable technical advances in infectious disease diagnosis, and the pace of innovation is likely to continue. Many of these techniques are well suited to pathogen identification directly from pathologic or clinical samples, which is the focus of this review. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene sequencing are now routinely performed on frozen or fixed tissues for diagnosis of bacterial infections of animals. These assays are most useful for pathogens that are difficult to culture or identify phenotypically, when propagation poses a biosafety hazard, or when suitable fresh tissue is not available. Multiplex PCR assays, DNA microarrays, in situ hybridization, massive parallel DNA sequencing, microbiome profiling, molecular typing of pathogens, identification of antimicrobial resistance genes, and mass spectrometry are additional emerging technologies for the diagnosis of bacterial infections from pathologic and clinical samples in animals. These technical advances come, however, with 2 caveats. First, in the age of molecular diagnosis, quality control has become more important than ever to identify and control for the presence of inhibitors, cross-contamination, inadequate templates from diagnostic specimens, and other causes of erroneous microbial identifications. Second, the attraction of these technologic advances can obscure the reality that medical diagnoses cannot be made on the basis of molecular testing alone but instead through integrated consideration of clinical, pathologic, and laboratory findings. Proper validation of the method is required. It is critical that veterinary diagnosticians understand not only the value but also the limitations of these technical advances for routine diagnosis of infectious disease.","Cai, H Y; Caswell, J L; Prescott, J F",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985813511132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24569613/,53

We aimed to establish whether MRI can be used to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from endovascular reperfusion. METHODS In this prospective cohort study we consecutively enrolled patients scheduled to have endovascular treatment within 12 h of onset of stroke at eight centres in the USA and one in Austria. Aided by an automated image analysis computer program, investigators interpreted a baseline MRI scan taken before treatment to establish whether the patient had an MRI profile (target mismatch) that suggested salvageable tissue was present. Reperfusion was assessed on an early follow-up MRI scan (within 12 h of the revascularisation procedure) and defined as a more than 50% reduction in the volume of the lesion from baseline on perfusion-weighted MRI. The primary outcome was favourable clinical response, defined as an improvement of 8 or more on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale between baseline and day 30 or a score of 0-1 at day 30. The secondary clinical endpoint was good functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 2 or less at day 90. Analyses were adjusted for imbalances in baseline predictors of outcome. Investigators assessing outcomes were masked to baseline data. FINDINGS 138 patients were enrolled. 110 patients had catheter angiography and of these 104 had an MRI profile and 99 could be assessed for reperfusion. 46 of 78 (59%) patients with target mismatch and 12 of 21 (57%) patients without target mismatch had reperfusion after endovascular treatment. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for favourable clinical response associated with reperfusion was 8·8 (95% CI 2·7-29·0) in the target mismatch group and 0·2 (0·0-1·6) in the no target mismatch group (p=0·003 for difference between ORs). Reperfusion was associated with increased good functional outcome at 90 days (OR 4·0, 95% CI 1·3-12·2) in the target mismatch group, but not in the no target mismatch group (1·9, 0·2-18·7). INTERPRETATION Target mismatch patients who had early reperfusion after endovascular stroke treatment had more favourable clinical outcomes. No association between reperfusion and favourable outcomes was present in patients without target mismatch. Our data suggest that a randomised controlled trial of endovascular treatment for patients with the target mismatch profile is warranted.

Less invasive methods would be highly desirable. AIM To evaluate the utility of several EoE-associated blood and serum markers in order to non-invasively monitor the response to treatment with swallowed topical corticosteroids in adult EoE patients. METHODS In a randomised, controlled double-blind trial blood samples of EoE patients (n = 69) were collected at baseline and after 14 days of treatment with budesonide (n = 51) or placebo (n = 18) respectively. Absolute blood eosinophil count (AEC) as well as serum levels of CCL-17, CCL-18, CCL-26, eosinophil-cationic-protein (ECP) and mast cell tryptase (MCT) were determined and correlated with oesophageal eosinophil density and with symptom and endoscopy scores. RESULTS Histological remission, defined as mean number of <16 eos/mm(2) hpf at end-of-treatment, was achieved in 98% of the budesonide and 0% of the placebo recipients. AEC [380.2 vs. 214.7/mm(3) (P = 0.0001)], serum-CCL-17 [294.3 vs. 257.9 pg/mL (P = 0.0019)], -CCL-26 [26.7 vs. 16.2 pg/mL (P = 0.0058)], -ECP [45.5 ± 44.7 vs. 27.5 ± 25.0 μg/L (P = 0.0016)] and -MCT [5.3 ± 2.9 vs. 4.5 ± 2.6 μg/L (P = 0.0019)] significantly decreased under budesonide but not under placebo. AEC significantly correlated with oesophageal eosinophil density before (r = 0.28, P = 0.0236) and after (r = 0.42, P = 0.0004) budesonide treatment. In ROC-AUC analyses post-treatment values of AEC were significantly associated with histological remission (ROC-AUC 0.754; 95% CI: 0.617-0.891; P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS The budesonide-induced treatment response in EoE is mirrored by several blood and serum markers, and the absolute blood eosinophil count is the most valuable as it shows correlation with the oesophageal eosinophil density.","Schlag, C; Miehlke, S; Heiseke, A; Brockow, K; Krug, A; von Arnim, U; Straumann, A; Vieth, M; Bussmann, C; Mueller, R; Greinwald, R; Bajbouj, M",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.13386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26314389/,53

The objective of this study is to assess the short-term efficacy and safety outcomes of LS Small Jaw compared with clamp-and-tie technique or Harmonic Focus Scalpel in thyroidectomy. METHODS A literature search was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases (until June 12, 2016) that reported the comparisons between LS Small Jaw and other techniques in thyroidectomy. Quality assessments were performed according to The Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool and a modification of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs, respectively. All statistical analyses were conducted using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS Finally, 7 studies with 813 patients were included into the meta-analysis, and all included studies were comparable with moderate-to-high quality. There was significant reduced operative time in LS Small Jaw, compared with clamp-and-tie (mean difference [MD] = -17.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -22.20 to 12.77, P < 0.00001) or Harmonic Focus Scalpel (MD = -2.29, 95% CI: -3.19 to 1.39, P < 0.00001). Besides, other perioperative outcomes including intraoperative blood loss and postoperative blood loss favored LS Small Jaw compared with clamp-and-tie. In terms of complications, less-temporary hypocalcemia rate was observed in LS Small Jaw compared with clamp-and-tie (odds ratio [OR] = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.27-0.90, P = 0.02), although no significant difference was detected compared with Harmonic Focus Scalpel (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.14-1.56, P = 0.22). Other complications such as length of hospital stay, permanent hypocalcemia, temporary or permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, and hematomas were not significant. CONCLUSION In conclusion, LS Small Jaw is more favorable than clamp-and-tie technique or Harmonic Focus Scalpel in thyroidectomy.","Zhang, Lei; Li, Namei; Yang, Xuemei; Chen, Jie",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000006141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28296728/,53

Hybrid (endovascular/surgical) ischemic gastric preconditioning (IGP), might improve GCF perfusion. Sixteen pigs undergoing IGP were randomized: (1) Max-IGP (n = 6): embolization of left gastric artery (LGA), right gastric artery (RGA), left gastroepiploic artery (LGEA), and laparoscopic division (LapD) of short gastric arteries (SGA); (2) Min-IGP (n = 5): LGA-embolization, SGA-LapD; (3) Sham (n = 5): angiography, laparoscopy. At day 21 gastric tubulation occurred and GCF perfusion was assessed as: (A) Serosal-tissue-oxygenation (StO2) by hyperspectral-imaging; (B) Serosal time-to-peak (TTP) by fluorescence-imaging; (C) Mucosal functional-capillary-density-area (FCD-A) index by confocal-laser-endomicroscopy. Local capillary lactates (LCL) were sampled. Neovascularization was assessed (histology/immunohistochemistry).

Multiple sclerosis typically first manifests with a demyelination event, also known as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). We sought to examine the prevalence of prodromal bowel symptoms predating a CIS in patients with MS as part of a recently characterized prodromal phase of disease. METHODS We constructed a retrospective cohort of MS patients with bowel symptoms and an identifiable CIS at two tertiary care centers over 14 years using administrative and billing data. We determined the date of onset of reported bowel symptoms in comparison with the date of first CIS and determined the overall prevalence of prediagnosis bowel symptoms within 1, 2, 3, and >3 years from a CIS. We used multivariable modeling to determine demographic and clinical risk factors for prediagnosis bowel symptoms. KEY RESULTS Among 385 MS patients with reported bowel symptoms, 122 (31.6%) reported bowel symptoms prior to CIS. The most common first bowel symptom was constipation (50.0%), followed by diarrhea (29.5%). The average lead time between a first bowel symptom and a CIS event was 3.7 ± 3.4 years. Pre-CIS fatigue (OR 4.48, 95% CI: 2.68-7.51, P < 0.001) and pre-CIS sensory disturbances (OR 1.88, 95% CI: 1.15-3.08, P < 0.05) were all associated with bowel symptoms prior to a CIS event. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES Nearly a third of MS patients with bowel symptoms reported bowel symptoms prior to a demyelinating event/CIS. Characterization of a prodromal phase of disease may provide important insights into understanding disease progression.","Almeida, Mariana N; Silvernale, Casey; Kuo, Braden; Staller, Kyle",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30957307/,53

In this study, we study the spinescence traits from five different species rattan: Daemonorops lewisiana, Daemonorops geniculata, Calamus castaneus, Plectomia griffithii, and Korthalsia scortechinii. We tested length, width, angle, strength, spine density, cross-section surface, spine color, and leaf trichomes (only for D. lewisiana, C. castaneus and D. geniculata). We also tested whether the spines were capable of deterring small climbing mammals (for Plectomia griffithii and Calamus castaneus) by using a choice selection experiment. Due to a variety of spine traits, we could not categorize whether any species is more or less spinescent than the others. We suggest that spines have a much more significant role than merely as a physical defense and work together with other rattan characteristics. This is also evidenced by our choice selection experiment, in which the spines on a single stem donot deter small climbing mammals. However, this is a work in progress, and we have outlined several alternative methods to be used in future work.","Liu, Kunpeng; Mansor, Asyraf; Ruppert, Nadine; Fadzly, Nik",Plant signaling & behavior,https://doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2020.1795393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32693670/,53

This study assessed usability and acute effects of a newly developed bedside console (COPHYCON). Fifteen healthy elderly individuals performed a one-time 80-min intervention, including cognitive video games aimed at improving awareness and selective attention. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use (Technology Acceptance Model) were assessed together with measures of the achieved game level, reaction times, (in-) correct responses during ALERT and SELECT game play. Further, prefrontal cortical involvement of the regional cerebral hemoglobin saturation (rS02%) assessed with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) (n = 5) and EEG power (n = 10) was analyzed. All participants completed the study without any adverse events. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use (TAM scores range 1-7) of the system varied between 3.9 and 6.3. The game levels reached for awareness varied between 9 and 11 (initial score 8-10), for reaction speed between 439 and 469 ms, and for correct responses between 74.1 and 78.8%. The highest level for the selective attention games was 2 (initial score 1), where reaction speed varied between 439 and 469 ms, correct responses between 96.2 and 98.5%, respectively. The decrease of rS02% in the right prefrontal cortex during gameplay was significantly (p < 0.001) lower, compared to the left prefrontal cortex. Four participants yielded significant lower rS02% measures after exergaming with the ALERT games (p < 0.000), but not with the SELECT games. EEG recordings of theta power significantly decreased in the averaged ~0.25-0.75 time interval for the left prefrontal cortex sensor across the cognitive game levels between the ALERT 1 and SELECT 1, as well as between SELECT 1 and 2 games. Participants rated the usability of the COPHYCON training positively. Further results indicate that video gaming may be an effective measure to affect prefrontal cortical functioning in elderly. The results warrant a clinical explorative study investigating the feasibility of the COPHYCON in a clinical setting.","Knols, Ruud H; Swanenburg, Jaap; De Bon, Dino; Gennaro, Federico; Wolf, Martin; Krüger, Bernard; Bettex, Dominique; de Bruin, Eling D",Frontiers in systems neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2017.00085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29234277/,53

RECENT FINDINGS Clinical presentation of MIS-C is dominated by significant inflammation. Fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiac dysfunction, and hypotension are common features. Kawasaki disease-like findings are common, but epidemiologic data and recent mechanistic studies suggest that distinct inflammatory pathways mediate Kawasaki disease and MIS-C. A broad diagnostic approach is recommended, given overlapping presentations between MIS-C and many other disease processes. Current management of MIS-C is highly variable, depending on illness severity, and can range from supportive care to aggressive immune modulation. A multidisciplinary approach with early involvement of multiple pediatric subspecialists is recommended for complicated cases. SUMMARY Several studies have described the clinical manifestations of MIS-C, but definitive diagnosis remains challenging.

76989,Reply.,2021-05-13,"Climate-resilient crops and crop varieties have been recommended as a way for farmers to cope with or adapt to climate change, but despite the apparent benefits, rates of adoption by smallholder farmers are highly variable. Here we present a scoping review, using PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols), examining the conditions that have led to the adoption of climate-resilient crops over the past 30 years in lower- and middle-income countries. The descriptive analysis performed on 202 papers shows that small-scale producers adopted climate-resilient crops and varieties to cope with abiotic stresses such as drought, heat, flooding and salinity. The most prevalent trait in our dataset was drought tolerance, followed by water-use efficiency. Our analysis found that the most important determinants of adoption of climate-resilient crops were the availability and effectiveness of extension services and outreach, followed by education levels of heads of households, farmers' access to inputs-especially seeds and fertilizers-and socio-economic status of farming families. About 53% of studies reported that social differences such as sex, age, marital status and ethnicity affected the adoption of varieties or crops as climate change-adaptation strategies. On the basis of the collected evidence, this study presents a series of pathways and interventions that could contribute to higher adoption rates of climate-resilient crops and reduce dis-adoption.","Acevedo, Maricelis; Pixley, Kevin; Zinyengere, Nkulumo; Meng, Sisi; Tufan, Hale; Cichy, Karen; Bizikova, Livia; Isaacs, Krista; Ghezzi-Kopel, Kate; Porciello, Jaron",Nature plants,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-020-00783-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33051616/,53
77668,Variation of body temperature of active amphibians along elevation gradients in eastern Nepal Himalaya.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND It is often difficult to determine the correct size of endotracheal tubes (ETT) needed for intubating pediatric patients. Therefore, we evaluated the role of ultrasound in pediatric patients to compare the correct size of an uncuffed (ETT) with the minimal transverse diameter of the subglottic airway (MTDSA) measured by ultrasound and with tube size predicted by different age-related formulas. METHODS A total of 50 pediatric patients ≤ 5 years were enrolled. As a standard, we defined the adequate ETT size with no audible leakage below a ventilation pressure of 15 mbar and with an audible leakage above 25 mbar. The maximum allowed difference between the prediction method result and the ETT that fit was defined as 0.3 mm. Ultrasound was performed before the intubation procedure; the intubating anesthesiologists were blinded to the results of the ultrasound measurement. Agreement between the two age-based formulas most commonly used at our department and MTDSA with the correct ETT size (standard) was analyzed using a Bland-Altman plot. Correlation and regression analyses were performed and the numbers of correct intubation trials recorded. RESULTS The frequency of bias ≤ 0.3 mm between each method and the correct ETT in the first attempt was <50% and the mean number of reintubations 1.6 ± 1.3. In contrast to age-related formulas, however, the ultrasonographically determined MTDSA was not significantly different from the correct ETT. MTDSA was highly associated with the outer diameter of the ETT (r = 0.869, R(2) = 0.754). CONCLUSIONS Measuring MTDSA by ultrasound facilitates selection of the appropriate ETT in pediatric patients and may reduce the number of reintubations.","Schramm, Christoph; Knop, Jana; Jensen, Katrin; Plaschke, Konstanze",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9592.2012.03889.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22612446/,53

In a subgroup analysis of the PRACTICAL study, a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of budesonide-formoterol reliever therapy versus maintenance budesonide plus terbutaline reliever therapy in adults with mild asthma, we recently reported that about two-thirds preferred as-needed combination preventer and reliever therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the relative importance of attributes associated with these two asthma therapies in this subgroup of participants who indicated their preferred treatment in the PRACTICAL study. METHODS At their final study visit, a subgroup of participants indicated their preferred treatment and completed a discrete choice experiment using the Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives method and 1000minds software. Treatment attributes and their levels were selected from measurable study outcomes, and included: treatment regimen, shortness of breath, steroid dose and likelihood of asthma flare-up. RESULTS The final analysis dataset included 288 participants, 64% of whom preferred as-needed combination preventer and reliever. Of the attributes, no shortness of breath and lowest risk of asthma flare-up were ranked highest and second highest, respectively. However, the relative importance of the other two attributes varied by preferred therapy: treatment regimen was ranked higher by participants who preferred as-needed treatment than by participants who preferred maintenance treatment.

Convalescent plasma, donated by persons who have recovered from COVID-19, is the acellular component of blood that contains antibodies, including those that specifically recognize SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies, when transfused into patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, are thought to exert an antiviral effect, suppressing virus replication before patients have mounted their own humoral immune responses2,3. Virus-specific antibodies from recovered persons are often the first available therapy for an emerging infectious disease, a stopgap treatment while new antivirals and vaccines are being developed1,2. This retrospective, propensity score-matched case-control study assessed the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy in 39 patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Oxygen requirements on day 14 after transfusion worsened in 17.9% of plasma recipients versus 28.2% of propensity score-matched controls who were hospitalized with COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-0.98; chi-square test P value = 0.025).

The impact on resident physicians, including minority providers, had not yet been reported. We aimed to assess how primary care residents perceived increased TM in clinics during the pandemic, and assess resident burnout. Materials and Methods: An online survey was sent to 60 internal medicine (IM) and 18 family medicine (FM) residents who used TM to treat underserved patients, from March to May 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire included questions on resident demographics, satisfaction with TM, screening capability for COVID-19, effectiveness for patient education on COVID-19, impact on patient interactions and time management. Burnout was assessed with the Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results: A majority (62 of 78) eligible residents (79.5%) responded to the survey. Ninety-one percent of residents agreed that TM was a secure alternative to face-to-face encounters. Seventy-nine percent used it to screen for signs/symptoms of COVID-19 and 93% provided patient education on COVID-19. Average visit length decreased by 10-20 min with TM. Post-TM, scores for overall burnout were decreased (p = 0.0003) and less residents in total exhibited burnout (p = 0.0156). Discussion and Conclusions: IM and FM residents viewed TM as an efficient way to screen for and provide education on COVID-19, as well as a secure alternative to face-to-face encounters. With increased used of TM during COVID-19, there was decreased burnout among primary care residents.","Mills, Krystal; Peterson, Ashley; McNair, Macy; Abe, Temidayo; Igwe, Joseph; Sobukonla, Timothy; Surapaneni, Phani; Ajose, Taiwo; Yan, Fengxia; Chang, Eric; Volcy, Judith",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34077292/,53

This paper describes a methodology that combines geographic information systems (GIS), hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS), and the full multiplicative form of multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis (MULTIMOORA), to determine suitable locations for waste collection boxes (named AYPIKUT), which have been designed specifically for collection of domestic waste vegetable oil and waste batteries. It takes as case study, Atakum, a district of Samsun city, Turkey. As a solution to the problem, first, a total of 88 items have been identified for consideration by seven criteria elicited from the insights of experts, and spatial analyses were performed. Multi-criteria HFLTS was then used to determine weights of the criteria. Population density was the most significant criterion affecting the selection process, and proximity to housing complexes with more than 150 dwellings was the least important. According to the weights of the seven criteria, and three rules determined by the experts, 15 AYPIKUT locations were identified using GIS. As a final step, the alternative locations (A1-A15) were ranked with the MULTIMOORA method. A5 was the most suitable site, and A6 was the least suitable site for an AYPIKUT.

This study identifies organizational factors that promoted successful implementation of telehealth and adoption of ""no test"" medication abortion protocols. STUDY DESIGN We conducted 21 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with healthcare providers and clinic administrators implementing clinician-supported telehealth abortion during the COVID pandemic. We selected 15 clinical sites to represent four different practice settings: independent primary care practices, online medical services, specialty family planning clinics, and primary care clinics within multispecialty health systems. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided our thematic analysis. RESULTS Successful implementation of telehealth abortion included access to formal and informal inter-organizational networks, including professional organizations and informal mentorship relationships with innovators in the field; organizational readiness for implementation, such as having clinic resources available for telehealth services like functional electronic health records and options for easy-to-use virtual patient-provider interactions; and motivated and effective clinic champions. CONCLUSIONS In response to the need to offer remote clinical services, four different practice settings types leveraged key operational factors to facilitate successful implementation of telehealth abortion. Information from this study can inform implementation strategies to support the dissemination and adoption of this model. IMPLICATIONS Examples of successfully implemented telehealth medication abortion services provide a framework that can be used to inform and implement similar patient-centered telehealth models in diverse practice settings.","Godfrey, Emily M; Fiastro, Anna E; Jacob-Files, Elizabeth A; Coeytaux, Francine M; Wells, Elisa S; Ruben, Molly R; Bs, Sajal S Sanan; Bennett, Ian M",Contraception,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2021.04.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932401/,53

Developing antivirals against previously undefined targets is essential to treat existing drug-resistant HIV strains. Some peptides derived from HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env, gp120-gp41) have been shown to be effective in inhibiting HIV-1 infection. Therefore, we screened a peptide library from HIV-1 Env and identified a peptide from the cytoplasmic region, designated F9170, able to effectively inactivate HIV-1 virions and induce necrosis of HIV-1-infected cells, and reactivated latently infected cells. F9170 specifically targeted the conserved cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 Env and effectively disrupted the integrity of the viral membrane. Short-term monoadministration of F9170 controlled viral loads to below the limit of detection in chronically SHIV-infected macaques. F9170 can enter the brain and lymph nodes, anatomic reservoirs for HIV latency. Therefore, F9170 shows promise as a drug candidate for HIV treatment.","Wang, Qian; Su, Shan; Xue, Jing; Yu, Fei; Pu, Jing; Bi, Wenwen; Xia, Shuai; Meng, Yu; Wang, Cong; Yang, Wenqian; Xu, Wei; Zhu, Yun; Zheng, Qinwen; Qin, Chuan; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaz2254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32493792/,53

As patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD) may need modifications to their therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic, we voted online for general guidance that local practitioners needed. In this review, we have addressed the vulnerability of rheumatic patients and issues surrounding their optimum management. We base our recommendations on a synthesis of national/international guidelines and expert consensus among KAR members in the context of the Kuwaiti healthcare system caring for the patient population with RMD. The most recent reports from the World Health Organization, the Center for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health - National Medical Library, and the COVID-19 educational website of the United Kingdom National Health Service have been incorporated. We discuss the management of RMD in various clinical scenarios: screening protocols in an infusion clinic, medication protocols for stable patients and care for suspected or confirmed COVID infection and whether they are stable, in a disease flare or newly diagnosed. Besides, we also outline the conditions for the hospital admission.

81471,Vaccine Refusal and Measles Outbreaks in the US.,2020-08-14,"BACKGROUND Obesity is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction, all of which contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that gastric bypass would produce rapid improvements in endothelial function, reduce inflammation, and lead to a decrease in cardiovascular risk. METHODS We performed a prospective study of morbidly obese patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Clinical data, biochemical markers of inflammation, and parameters indicative of cardiovascular risk were collected preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Metabolic and inflammatory mediators that were quantified included C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, PAI-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1Ra, adiponectin, leptin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, glucose, insulin, and HbA1c. Brachial artery reactivity testing (BART) was performed to assess peripheral arterial endothelial function, and Framingham cardiovascular risk score (FRS) was calculated on all study participants pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS Fifteen patients (11 female) were enrolled (age = 49.2 ± 10.4 years; BMI = 48.1 ± 5.3 kg/m(2)). Six months post RYGB, mean BMI decreased to 35.4 ± 4.5, corresponding to 51.7% excess weight loss (P < 0.001). Mean waist circumference decreased significantly from 132 cm at baseline to 110 cm at 3 months (P = 0.003) and 107 cm at 6 months (P < 0.001). Six months after RYGB, weight loss led to significant improvements in clinical parameters indicative of cardiovascular disease or risk, including brachial artery diameter, endothelial independent vasodilation, and FRS. Favorable improvements in the proinflammatory markers CRP (P = 0.01) and leptin (P = 0.005), the anti-inflammatory mediator adiponectin (P = 0.002), and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR, P = 0.007) were evident at 3 months. At 6 months, improvements in CRP, leptin, and fasting insulin were maintained and fibrinogen levels also decreased (P = 0.047). Adiponectin continued to increase at 6 months (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION Gastric bypass is associated with early reversal of endothelial dysfunction, a more favorable inflammatory milieu, and, most importantly, a reduction in cardiovascular risk.","Brethauer, Stacy A; Heneghan, Helen M; Eldar, Shai; Gatmaitan, Patrick; Huang, Hazel; Kashyap, Sangeeta; Gornik, Heather L; Kirwan, John P; Schauer, Philip R",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1620-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21416179/,53

82313,Changes in legislator vaccine-engagement on Twitter before and after the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-05-10,"UNLABELLED Airborne disease transmission has always been a topic of wide interests in various fields for decades. Cough is found to be one of the prime sources of airborne diseases as it has high velocity and large quantity of droplets. To understand and characterize the flow dynamics of a cough can help to control the airborne disease transmission. This study has measured flow dynamics of coughs with human subjects. The flow rate variation of a cough with time can be represented as a combination of gamma-probability-distribution functions. The variables needed to define the gamma-probability-distribution functions can be represented by some medical parameters. A robust multiple linear regression analysis indicated that these medical parameters can be obtained from the physiological details of a person. However, the jet direction and mouth opening area during a cough seemed not related to the physiological parameters of the human subjects. Combining the flow characteristics reported in this study with appropriate virus and droplet distribution information, the infectious source strength by coughing can be evaluated. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS There is a clear need for the scientific community to accurately predict and control the transmission of airborne diseases. Transportation of airborne viruses is often predicted using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. CFD simulations are inexpensive but need accurate source boundary conditions for the precise prediction of disease transmission. Cough is found to be the prime source for generating infectious viruses. The present study was designed to develop an accurate source model to define thermo-fluid boundary conditions for a cough. The model can aid in accurately predicting the disease transmission in various indoor environments, such as aircraft cabins, office spaces and hospitals.","Gupta, J K; Lin, C-H; Chen, Q",Indoor air,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2009.00619.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19840145/,53

Until recently geroscience research was pursued in laboratory animals, but now this field requires specialized expertise in the care of vulnerable older patients with multiple chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes, the population likely to benefit the most from emerging therapies. While chronological aging measures the inevitable passage of clock time that occurs equally for everyone, biological aging varies among individuals, and importantly, it is modifiable. Advances in our understanding of biological aging, the discovery of strategies for modifying its rate, and an appreciation of aging as a shared risk factor for chronic diseases have jointly led to the Geroscience Hypothesis. This hypothesis states that interventions modifying aging biology can slow its progression-resulting in the delay or prevention of the onset of multiple diseases and disorders. Here we wish to report on the Third Geroscience Summit held at National Institutes of Health on November 4-5, 2019, which highlighted the importance of engaging other disciplines including clinicians. Involvement by scientists with expertise in clinical trials, health outcomes research, behavioral and social sciences, health policy, and economics is urgently needed to translate geroscience discoveries from the bench to clinical care and health policy. Adding to the urgency of broadening this geroscience coalition is the emergence of biological aging as one the most important modifiable factors of COVID-19, combined with the inability of our society to once again recognize and confront aging as a priority and opportunity when facing these types of public health emergencies.","Sierra, Felipe; Caspi, Avshalom; Fortinsky, Richard H; Haynes, Laura; Lithgow, Gordon J; Moffitt, Terrie E; Olshansky, S Jay; Perry, Daniel; Verdin, Eric; Kuchel, George A",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145908/,53

We evaluated the outcome of patients with May-Thurner syndrome who presented with deep vein thrombosis, managed with pharmacomechanical thrombolysis as the primary mode of intervention, in combination with angioplasty and stent placement. METHODS We reviewed all patients with May-Thurner syndrome managed in our institution between January 2009 to December 2015. Patency rate and postthrombotic syndrome were evaluated as primary end points. RESULTS A total of seven patients (6 females, 1 male) with a mean ± SD age of 48 ± 17 years and mean ± SD body mass index of 29.64 ± 7.25 kg/m were identified. Six patients presented with acute deep vein thrombosis and one presented with chronic venous insufficiency. Five patients underwent pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (TRELLIS and altepase) with concomitant stenting of the common iliac vein, one had only angioplasty with stent placement, and one had only pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. Median time from presentation to pharmacomechanical thrombolysis was 4 days (range = 1-9). Patency rate and postthrombotic syndrome at 12 months were 100% and 0%, respectively. No patient experienced major bleeding or pulmonary embolism. The median length of stay was 3 days (range = 0-4). There was no mortality associated with the procedure. The mean ± SD follow-up was 26 ± 15 months.

82861,Nucleosides with Transposed Base or 4'-Hydroxymethyl Moieties and Their Corresponding Oligonucleotides.,2015,"Determining previous infecting dengue virus (DENV) serotypes has been difficult due to highly cross-reactive immune responses from previous DENV infections. Determining the correlates of serotype-specific immune responses would be crucial in understanding dengue transmission in the community and would also help to determine the correlates of protective immune responses. Therefore, we set out to define highly conserved, serotype-specific regions of the DENVs. Serotype-specific and highly conserved regions of the four DENV serotypes were identified using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches and custom perl scripts. Using ex-vivo and cultured enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays, we identified serotype-specific T cell epitopes within the four DENV serotypes in healthy adult donors from Sri Lanka. We identified T cell responses to 19 regions of the four DENV serotypes. Six peptides were from the NS2A region and four peptides were from the NS4A region. All immune donors responded to peptides of at least two DENV serotypes, suggesting that heterologous infection is common in Sri Lanka. Eight of 20 individuals responded to at least two peptides of DENV-4, despite this serotype not being implicated previously in any of the epidemics in Sri Lanka. The use of these regions to determine past and current infecting DENV serotypes will be of value to characterize further the dynamics of silent dengue transmission in the community. In addition, these T cell responses to these regions could be used to characterize DENV serotype-specific immune responses and thus possibly help us to understand the immune correlates of a protective immune response.","Malavige, G N; McGowan, S; Atukorale, V; Salimi, M; Peelawatta, M; Fernando, N; Jayaratne, S D; Ogg, G",Clinical and experimental immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2012.04566.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22471283/,53

OBJECTIVE To characterize retinal vessel structures in patients with MS and CIS and to test for associations with MS disease activity. METHOD In all, 42 patients with MS or CIS and 50 healthy controls underwent retinal optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) with analysis of the superficial and deep vascular plexuses and the choriocapillaries. We tested OCT-A parameters for associations with retinal layer volumes, history of optic neuritis (ON), and the retrospective disease activity. RESULTS Inner retinal layer volumes correlated positively with the density of both the superficial and deep vascular plexuses. Eyes of MS/CIS patients with a history of ON revealed reduced vessel densities of the superficial and deep vascular plexuses as compared to healthy controls. Higher choriocapillary vessel densities were associated with ongoing inflammatory disease activity during 24 months prior to OCT-A examination in MS and CIS patients. CONCLUSION Optic neuritis is associated with rarefaction of the superficial and deep retinal vessels.

OBJECTIVES To determine the frequency and sites of contamination on the skin and clothing of personnel during PPE removal and to evaluate the effect of an intervention on the frequency of contamination. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a point-prevalence study and quasi-experimental intervention from October 28, 2014, through March 31, 2015. Data analysis began November 17, 2014, and ended April 21, 2015. Participants included a convenience sample of health care personnel from 4 Northeast Ohio hospitals who conducted simulations of contaminated PPE removal using fluorescent lotion and a cohort of health care personnel from 7 study units in 1 medical center that participated in a quasi-experimental intervention that included education and practice in removal of contaminated PPE with immediate visual feedback based on fluorescent lotion contamination of skin and clothing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were the frequency and sites of contamination on skin and clothing of personnel after removal of contaminated gloves or gowns at baseline vs after the intervention. A secondary end point focused on the correlation between contamination of skin with fluorescent lotion and bacteriophage MS2, a nonpathogenic, nonenveloped virus. RESULTS Of 435 glove and gown removal simulations, contamination of skin or clothing with fluorescent lotion occurred in 200 (46.0%), with a similar frequency of contamination among the 4 hospitals (range, 42.5%-50.3%). Contamination occurred more frequently during removal of contaminated gloves than gowns (52.9% vs 37.8%, P = .002) and when lapses in technique were observed vs not observed (70.3% vs 30.0%, P < .001). The intervention resulted in a reduction in skin and clothing contamination during glove and gown removal (60.0% before the intervention vs 18.9% after, P < .001) that was sustained after 1 and 3 months (12.0% at both time points, P < .001 compared with before the intervention). During simulations of contaminated glove removal, the frequency of skin contamination was similar with fluorescent lotion and bacteriophage MS2 (58.0% vs 52.0%, P = .45).

This systematic review and meta-analysis estimate the pooled prevalence and risk factors for mental health problems among police personnel worldwide. Three independent reviewers searched 16 databases and screened 11 506 articles published between January 1980 and October 2019. Eligible studies involved at least 100 active police professionals and used validated instruments to ascertain specific mental health problems. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. In total, 60 cross-sectional and seven longitudinal studies, involving 272 463 police personnel from 24 countries met criteria for inclusion. The overall pooled point prevalence was 14.6% for depression (95% CI 10.9% to 18.6%), 14.2% for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 95% CI 10.3% to 18.7%), 9.6% for a generalised anxiety disorder (95% CI 6.7% to 12.9%), 8.5% for suicidal ideation (95% CI 6.1% to 11.2%), 5.0% for alcohol dependence (95% CI 3.5% to 6.7%) and 25.7% for hazardous drinking (95% CI 19.6% to 32.4%). The strongest risk factor for depression and suicidal ideation was higher occupational stress, and the strongest risk factors for PTSD were higher occupational stress and avoidant coping strategies. Higher levels of peer-support were associated with significantly lower PTSD symptoms. Our findings suggest that the prevalence of mental health problems among police exceeds twice that previously reported in mixed samples of first responders, and is associated with poor social support, occupational stress and maladaptive coping strategies. Without effective intervention, psychological difficulties will remain a substantial health concern among police.","Syed, Shabeer; Ashwick, Rachel; Schlosser, Marco; Jones, Rebecca; Rowe, Sarah; Billings, Jo",Occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2020-106498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32439827/,53

Excluding WWH with surgical menopause, age at final menstrual period was summarized for postmenopausal WWH (group 3) and estimated among all WWH (groups 1-3) using an accelerated failure-time model. RESULTS Cardiometabolic and demographic parameters associated with advanced reproductive age (controlling for chronologic age) included waist circumference (>88 vs ≤88 cm) (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.80; P = .02), hemoglobin (≥12 vs <12 g/dL) (2.32; 1.71-3.14; P < .01), and region of residence (sub-Saharan Africa [1.50; 1.07-2.11; P = .02] and Latin America and the Caribbean [1.59; 1.08-2.33; P = .02], as compared with World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease high-income regions). The median age (Q1, Q3) at the final menstrual period was 48 (45, 51) years when described among postmenopausal WWH, and either 49 (46, 52) or 50 (47, 53) years when estimated among all WWH, depending on censoring strategy. CONCLUSIONS Among WWH in the REPRIEVE trial, more advanced reproductive age is associated with metabolic dysregulation and region of residence. Additional research on age at menopause among WWH is needed.

84623,Alternatives to Incomplete Colonoscopy.,2015,"INTRODUCTION In Asia, long-term weight loss results of gastric banding have been unsatisfactory. Bands are associated with higher complication rates, which result in a high reoperation rate. The aim of this paper is to discuss the choice of revisional procedure, operative technique and evaluate the postoperative complication rates. METHODS Between January 2007 and January 2010, we operated on 41 patients who were included retrospectively in this series. The most common reason for band removal was failure to lose adequate weight. Of those patients, 40 underwent band removal and conversion to a revisional bariatric surgery concomitantly; one patient's procedure was deferred to a later date. LSG was performed in 26 and LRYGB in 15. The highlights of the operative technique were meticulous dissection, complete removal of the pseudocapsule, choosing the right stapler cartridge, oversewing and inverting the entire staple line, and complete dissection of the left crus and pars flaccid. RESULT The median duration of surgery was 85 min (range, 55-180 min). There was no conversion to open surgery. The median stay in the hospital was 4 d (range, 2-7 d). There were no leaks or any other major complications in the postoperative period. CONCLUSION Concomitant revisional procedure after removal of gastric band is safe and feasible. The operative technique followed at our center has had an extremely low postoperative morbidity rate and a 0% leak rate.","Bhasker, A; Gadgil, M; Muda, N H; Lotwala, V; Lakdawala, M A",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1758-5910.2010.00062.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22776171/,53

84951,Review of the Breathability and Filtration Efficiency of Common Household Materials for Face Masks.,2021-04-06,"Nine infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains belonging to the GI-7 lineage were isolated between 2009 and 2017 in China. Phylogenetic analysis and comparisons of full-length sequences of the S1 gene suggested that the GI-7 lineage should be further classified as Taiwan (TW)-I and TW-II sublineages, which correspond to the previous TW-I and TW-II genotypes. The nine IBV strains were clustered in the TW-II sublineage. Further investigation revealed that viruses in the TW-I and TW-II were not only genetically but also antigenically different. Moreover, the TW-II sublineage contained various clades and recombinants. A recombinant was found to originate from recombination events between field strains (TW-II ck/CH/LJL/090608- and GI-19 ck/ CH/LDL/091022-like viruses) in which the recombination in the S1 subunit coding sequences had led to changes in antigenicity of the viruses. A more in-depth investigation demonstrated that TW-II viruses appear to have undergone a significant evolution following introduction in mainland China, which resulted in the viruses diverging into different clades. The viruses between the different clades in TW-II sublineage exhibited a significant change in genetic and antigenic characteristics. In addition, the five TW-II viruses selected on the basis of the results of S1 nucleotide sequence phylogenetic trees showed different pathogenicity to specific-pathogen-free chickens, although they could induce nephritis in the infected chickens and thus were identified as nephropathogenic strains.","Ren, Mengting; Zhang, Lili; Hou, Yutong; Zhao, Yan; Han, Zongxi; Sun, Junfeng; Liu, Shengwang",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/0005-2086-64.2.183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32550619/,53
85064,"Treating Bladder Cancer: Engineering of Current and Next Generation Antibody-, Fusion Protein-, mRNA-, Cell- and Viral-Based Therapeutics.",2021,"To infect host cells, most enveloped viruses must insert a hydrophobic fusion peptide into the host cell membrane. Thus, fusion peptides may be valuable targets for developing drugs that block virus entry. We have shown previously that a natural 20-residue fragment of α(1)-antitrypsin, designated VIRus-Inhibitory Peptide (VIRIP), that binds to the gp41 fusion peptide of HIV-1 prevents the virus from entering target cells in vitro. Here, we examine the efficacy of 10-day monotherapy with the optimized VIR-576 derivative of VIRIP in treatment-naïve, HIV-1-infected individuals with viral RNA loads of ≥10,000 copies per ml. We report that at the highest dose (5.0 grams per day), intravenous infusion of VIR-576 reduced the mean plasma viral load by 1.23 log(10) copies per ml without causing severe adverse effects. Our results are proof of concept that fusion peptide inhibitors suppress viral replication in human patients, and offer prospects for the development of a new class of drugs that prevent virus particles from anchoring to and infecting host cells.","Forssmann, Wolf-Georg; The, Yu-Han; Stoll, Matthias; Adermann, Knut; Albrecht, Uwe; Tillmann, Hanns-Christian; Barlos, Kleomenis; Busmann, Annette; Canales-Mayordomo, Angeles; Giménez-Gallego, Guillermo; Hirsch, Jochen; Jiménez-Barbero, Jesus; Meyer-Olson, Dirk; Münch, Jan; Pérez-Castells, Javier; Ständker, Ludger; Kirchhoff, Frank; Schmidt, Reinhold E",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3001697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21178138/,53
85566,Mechanical ventilation.,2008,"BACKGROUND The present study will focus on the rationale for the use of small tidal volume with 6 cmH2O positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) with the changes of arterial oxygen tension, plateau airway pressure, and static lung compliance during one lung ventilation for endoscopic thoracic surgery. METHODS Forty-three patients were intubated with a double-lumen endobronchial tube. After positioning the patients in the lateral decubitus, one-lung ventilation was started with 100% oxygen, tidal volume 10 ml/kg without PEEP; arterial oxygen tension, plateau airway pressure, and static compliance were checked as baseline values (T0). Fifteen minutes later, same parameters were measured (T15). The tidal volume had changed to 6 ml/kg with 6 cmH2O PEEP. Fifteen minutes later, the same parameters were measured (T30). RESULTS Oxygen tension had decreased at T15 (282.1 ± 83.4 mmHg) compared to T0 (477.2 ± 82.4 mmHg) (P < 0.0001), but was maintained at T30 (270.4 ± 81.9 mmHg). There was no difference in peak inspiratory pressure at T15 or T30 compared to T0, plateau airway pressure was increased at T15 and T30 (P < 0.05) and static lung compliance was decreased at T15 and T30 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS In carrying out one-lung ventilation for thoracic surgery using an endoscope, the addition of a PEEP of 6 cmH2O in the dependent lung, while reducing the tidal volume of 6 ml/kg, both oxygen tension and lung compliance are maintained without increasing the plateau airway pressure. Protective lung ventilation is useful for one lung ventilation.","Yun, Du Gyun; Han, Jong In; Kim, Dong Yeon; Kim, Jong Hak; Kim, Youn Jin; Chung, Rack Kyung",Korean journal of anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.4097/kjae.2014.67.5.329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25473462/,53

86224,Quantitative measurements in capsule endoscopy.,2015,"BACKGROUND Despite data suggesting improved outcomes with laparoscopic colectomy (LC), less than 10% of colectomies in the Unites States are currently performed laparoscopically. One mechanism for incorporating LC into practice is to attend an LC course (LCC). Postcourse mentorship is recommended by the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), in addition to course participation, to encourage adoption of the new techniques. Recommendations also include access to at least 25 colectomies annually. Because the use of LC likely will increase, access to mentorship is an important consideration for LCC participants. This study aimed to evaluate mentorship access and related factors for participants in an ongoing LCC. METHODS Participants in seven consecutive single-center LCCs were anonymously surveyed regarding age, specialty, surgical experience, practice, and mentorship availability. Factors associated with mentorship were identified via chi-square and univariate logistic regression. RESULTS Of the 90 participants surveyed, 81 (90%) were men, 51 (56.7%) were general surgeons, 43 (48.9%) were older than 40 years, and 49 (54.4%) had access to a mentor. A majority of the participants (86.7%) performed five or fewer open colorectal cases per month, and 81 (90%) performed five or fewer noncolorectal advanced laparoscopic cases monthly. Factors associated with lack of mentor access included age older than 40 years (P = 0.004), practice as a general surgeon (P = 0.014), and status as a senior attending surgeon (P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS A significant number of surgeons (45.6%) participating in LCC have limited or no access to mentors. In particular, older surgeons, senior attending surgeons, and general surgeons have the least access to mentors. To encourage adoption of LC, training methods should be adopted that accommodate general surgeons, surgeons with a limited advanced laparoscopic case load, and surgeons without access to mentors. Possible strategies include longer or multisession courses, simulator training, and remote mentoring.","Ho, Vanessa P; Trencheva, Koiana; Stein, Sharon L; Milsom, Jeffrey W",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1942-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22042582/,53
86327,New technologies laying a foundation for next generation clinical serology.,2021-09-23,"PURPOSE To investigate whether TGF-β2 had a different effect on the expression levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) in the subconjunctival fibroblasts from glaucoma patients who underwent a reoperation (RGSFs) compared with those from glaucoma patients who underwent first filtering surgery (GSFs) and control patients with cataracts (HSFs). METHODS Human subconjunctival fibroblasts were obtained from the three groups of patients. Different concentrations of TGF-β2 were added to the fibroblasts for 1, 3, and 5 days. The proliferation of the fibroblasts was determined by CCK-8 assays. Real-time PCR and western blotting were performed to analyze the mRNA and protein levels of LDLr. The uptake of DiI-labeled LDL was determined by confocal microscopy. RESULTS The results revealed that under TGF-β2 exposure, fibroblast proliferation was positively correlated with LDLr expression (all p<0.001). The LDLr mRNA and protein levels were affected by TGF-β2 in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner in the RGSFs, GSFs and HSFs. The maximal expression of LDLr after TGF-β2 stimulation was consistent with the peak uptake of DiI-LDL, which was obviously highest in the RGSFs, followed by the GSFs, and then the HSFs (all p<0.05). All 3 groups took up DiI-LDL in a similar time-dependent manner, with maximal uptake at 6 h following DiI-LDL incubation (all p<0.05). In addition, there were significant differences in the LDLr protein levels in the subconjunctival tissues isolated from the glaucoma patients during reoperation, the glaucoma patients during first filtering surgery and the control patients at day 3 (p<0.05). The highest protein expression of LDLr was observed in the RG group. CONCLUSION These data suggested that the RGSFs had the highest LDLr expression and the highest peak uptake of LDL among three groups. The LDLr-drug-LDL delivery system could potentially be used for targeted delivery of antimetabolite agents in anti-scarring therapy for glaucoma patients after filtering surgery.","Wang, Jiajian; Jiang, Chao; Jing, Qinghe; Jiang, Yongxiang; Shao, Tingting",Current eye research,https://doi.org/10.1080/02713683.2020.1789174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633666/,53

METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study utilizing all patients completing ≥ 1 Pl-OC cycle from 2016 to 2018 at a large single-center OC program. Subjects were categorized by age at retrieval and number of cycles. We extrapolated age-based oocyte thresholds for 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR from previously published data. We calculated the proportion of subjects overall, and for each age group, whose number of frozen oocytes was greater than or equal to their age-based threshold for a 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR after 1 and 2 cycles. OR for 60% eLBR with one cycle was calculated for age and AMH cutoff values and corroborated with logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 1241 subjects, completing 1799 Pl-OC cycles, were included. With one cycle, 66% (819/1241) achieved ≥ 50% eLBR and 51% (634/1241) achieved 70% eLBR. With two cycles, 79.6% (988/1241) attained ≥ 50% eLBR and 65.5% (813/1241) achieved 70% eLBR. Achieving 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR with 1-2 cycles was significantly associated with both age (p < 0.001) and AMH (p < 0.001). Age < 37.5 and AMH > 1.995 were independently associated with attaining 60% eLBR with one cycle (age: OR 13.73; 95%CI 9.16-20.57, p < 0.001; AMH: OR 7.32; 95% CI 5.50-9.76, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Younger age and higher AMH were associated with achieving 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR thresholds with Pl-OC. Nevertheless, almost all subjects were successfully able to preserve enough oocytes for ≥ 50% eLBR in 1-2 cycles.","Maslow, Bat-Sheva L; Guarnaccia, Michael M; Ramirez, Leslie; Klein, Joshua U",Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-020-01791-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418136/,53

This procedure is considered indicated for EGC located in the upper third of the stomach with clinical T1N0, but not when it can be treated endoscopically. No operative mortality or conversion to open surgery was reported in our review, suggesting that this procedure is technically feasible.

Through similar biological mechanisms, they may also increase the risk of community-acquired pneumonia. Our objective was to compare the rate of hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) with SGLT-2i compared to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) among patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS We used the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink Gold, linked to hospitalization data, to construct a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes. Using a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model, we estimated the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for HCAP with current use of SGLT-2i versus DPP-4i. RESULTS Among 29 896 patients, 705 HCAPs occurred over a mean follow-up of 1.7 years (standard deviation: 1.2). Incidence rates for SGLT-2i and DPP-4i users were 6.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7, 10.2) and 17.8 (95% CI: 15.3, 20.7) per 1000 person-years, respectively. Current use of SGLT-2i was associated with a decreased risk of HCAP compared to current use of DPP-4i (adjusted HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.82). However, a comparison of SGLT-2i versus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) found no difference in risk of HCAP (adjusted HR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.44, 1.89). CONCLUSIONS SGLT-2i are associated with a decreased rate of HCAP compared to DPP-4i, but not when compared to GLP-1 RA, among patients with type 2 diabetes.","Brunetti, Vanessa C; Reynier, Pauline; Azoulay, Laurent; Yu, Oriana Hoi Yun; Ernst, Pierre; Platt, Robert W; Filion, Kristian B",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.5192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33428309/,53

Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that cerebral rSO2 was independently associated with natural logarithm (Ln)-HD duration (standardized coefficient: -0.36), mean blood pressure (standardized coefficient: 0.13), pH (standardized coefficient: -0.10), serum albumin (standardized coefficient: 0.14), presence of diabetes mellitus (standardized coefficient: -0.20), and Hb level (standardized coefficient: 0.29). Furthermore, a generalized linear model with restricted cubic spline function was used to investigate the non-linear association between cerebral rSO2 and Hb levels. In the multivariable analysis for the adjustment with Ln-HD duration, mean blood pressure, pH, serum albumin, and presence of diabetes mellitus, a linear relationship was demonstrated between the two variables (p for linearity = 0.79). Hb levels revealed the positive and significant association with cerebral rSO2 in this study. Moreover, the relationship between cerebral rSO2 and Hb level was proven to be linear. Therefore, the target Hb level in renal anemia management would be considered to be the upper limits for the appropriate management of renal anemia by previous guidelines and position statement from the viewpoint of maintaining cerebral oxygenation in HD patients.","Ookawara, Susumu; Ito, Kiyonori; Sasabuchi, Yusuke; Hayasaka, Hideyuki; Kofuji, Masaya; Uchida, Takayuki; Horigome, Keita; Imai, Sojiro; Akikawa, Toshiko; Wada, Noriko; Kiryu, Satoshi; Imada, Satoru; Shindo, Mitsutoshi; Miyazawa, Haruhisa; Hirai, Keiji; Onishi, Yasushi; Shimoyama, Hirofumi; Watanabe, Akihisa; Tabei, Kaoru; Morishita, Yoshiyuki",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32776946/,53

The literature and clinical experience show that some individuals who meet the criteria for registration either decline or are not offered registration. The aim of this Orthoptic stroke service review is to determine the reason for declining and whether the individuals feel supported without registration and to recommend service changes to improve the certification process. A service evaluation of stroke survivors who had declined SI registration was undertaken. All those with a diagnosis of stroke, a full Orthoptic assessment, a period of monitoring and were discharged between September 2017 and August 2019 were identified. . Fifty-four stroke survivors were eligible to be registered SI at their last appointment; 31 (57%) were not offered registration for reasons including end of life care. Of the remaining 23s, 14 proceeded with SI registration and nine declined. Four who declined were excluded (44%), as two were registered at a subsequent ophthalmology appointment, two were inappropriate to contact. A telephone interview was undertaken with the remaining five individuals. Of the five stroke survivors that were contacted, three (60%) recalled declining SI registration at their last appointment. All felt they were given enough information to aid their decision. Reasons given for declining registration included not accepting the VI, hoping for recovery and having enough support. The individuals felt they were still able to access services and were happy to remain unregistered. The remaining two stroke survivors could not recall being offered SI registration and subsequently requested to be registered following the telephone call. Of those individuals who initially declined registration, two (40%) decided to proceed with registration following the telephone interview. Although numbers are small it is worth considering a post discharge telephone consultation to stroke survivors who decline registration.","Budd, Alysha; Mather, Faye; Gavin, Nicola; MacDiarmid, Sonia",Strabismus,https://doi.org/10.1080/09273972.2021.1914678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886426/,53

One of the most effective outbreak containment methods is vaccination. However, in order for this strategy to be effective, a majority of the susceptible population should be vaccinated in a short time. This may require changing the practice of immunization execution and changing attitudes toward vaccination. In the survey on the attitudes of Polish parents and guardians toward vaccinations, we asked about the acceptance of vaccination in places other than health-care facilities in both non-epidemic and epidemic conditions. The study was conducted using an anonymous questionnaire in two Warsaw hospitals between August 2018 and February 2019 and was addressed to parents and legal guardians of children. At the time of the survey, ""epidemic"" was a hypothetical term. Two hundred fifty respondents participated in the study. The pharmacy was the most accepted non-healthcare facility vaccination location, both normally and during an outbreak, with 54.4% (123/226) and 75.2% (170/226) of respondents finding pharmacies an acceptable location, respectively. A gas station had the lowest acceptance: 5.8% (13/226) and 28.8% (65/226), respectively. The only statistically significant demographic factors affecting acceptance of each vaccination location were male sex (p = .001) and higher education level (p = .001). Of those surveyed, 58.5% (131/224) would approve of vaccination in front of a hospital or outpatient clinic during an outbreak; 70.5% (43/61) of men versus 54.0% (88/163) of women, p = .026. In conclusion, during an outbreak, people would be more likely to accept vaccination at locations other than a health-care facility.","Talarek, Ewa; Chazan, Magdalena; Winiarska, Paulina; Dembiński, Łukasz; Sobierajski, Tomasz; Banaszkiewicz, Aleksandra",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1798152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32873126/,53

METHOD Retrospective review of all patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in a New Zealand hospital between 2011 and 2014 was conducted. Over this time period, routine UGI was replaced by CT swallow studies. All medical records and radiology were reviewed and pertinent findings reported. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients underwent LSG over this time period and one patient had to be excluded; 48 (61.5%) had a UGI study and 30 patients (38.5%) had CT swallow. There were no leaks in this study and no leaks became clinically significant. Sixteen of 30 patients (53.3%) undergoing CT swallow had significant incidental findings demonstrated on axial imaging that required follow-up. CONCLUSION CT swallow can provide the same information as a UGI but has a significant rate of incidental findings. The rate of incidental pathology on CT is higher than that quoted in the general population. In a bariatric population, this may allow early detection and treatment of co-existent pathology.","Meredith, Ineke; Lim, Yu Kai; Wickremesekera, Susrutha K; Bann, Simon",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.13284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26333708/,53

Given that many nodules will be incidentally found with lung cancer screening following the publication of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), the goal is to find an accurate, safe and minimally-invasive diagnostic modality to biopsy the concerning lesions. Unfortunately, conventional bronchoscopic techniques provide a poor diagnostic yield of 18-62%. In recent years advances in technology have led to the introduction of electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) as a tool to guide sampling of peripheral lung nodules. The same principle has also recently been expanded and applied to the transthoracic needle biopsy, referred to as electromagnetic transthoracic needle aspiration (E-TTNA). An improved diagnostic yield has afforded this technology a recommendation by the 2013 3(rd) Edition ACCP Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Lung Cancer which state that ""in patients with peripheral lung lesions difficult to reach with conventional bronchoscopy, ENB is recommended if the equipment and the expertise are available (Grade 1C)"".

91244,Clinically useful dilution factors for iodine and gadolinium contrast material: an animal model of pediatric digital subtraction angiography using state-of-the-art flat-panel detectors.,2013,"BACKGROUND South Asians are one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in western countries with a high incidence of chronic diseases like metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease occurring at younger ages and lower body weight compared with white Europeans. Physically active lifestyle and reduced sedentary time are modifiable risk factors that can decrease burden of chronic diseases. Population-level surveys based on self-report show South Asians engage in low levels of physical activity. Because of known limitations with self-report data, we aimed to synthesize available evidence to generate a physical activity /sedentary time profile of South Asians from studies using accelerometry. METHODS We systematically searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and SportDiscus. We included studies applying accelerometry to measure physical activity /sedentary time under free-living. Studies with an exclusive focus on drugs or including participants with health conditions/physical disability, and special populations (athletes/pregnant women) were excluded. Two authors independently adjudicated inclusion of citations at title/abstract and full text. We applied a standardized data abstraction form to extract relevant data. We evaluated methodological quality using Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Due to variability and inconsistencies in measurement and reporting of physical activity /sedentary time, we only provide a narrative synthesis. FINDINGS We identified only 14 studies(n = 1,338). Despite using similar accelerometry assumptions, we noted variability in reported outcomes for physical activity and sedentary time. Sedentary time ranged from 482(98) to 587 min/day. Mean light physical activity ranged from 211.69(67. 38) to 574(227) min/day. Moderate to vigorous physical activity among South Asian women ranged from 17-41 min/day and among men, 32-43 min/day. CONCLUSION South Asians exhibited higher levels of physical activity when compared to the Canadian population level survey but not when compared to the American population level survey. Overall, fewer studies, and small sample sizes led to considerable variability limiting any effective comparisons. Results highlight the importance of conducting methodologically robust studies based on random sampling to advance the field, and to capture true levels of sedentary time and physical activity in the South Asian population.","Mahmood, Bushra; Tang, Tricia S; Afshar, Rowshanak; Ashe, Maureen C",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32756595/,53

Here, a simple one-pot method of thermal polymerization is introduced to fabricate silk fibroin-dopted hydrogels (SFHs), which are both chemically and physically cross-linked by acrylamide (AM), acrylic acid (AA), and silk fibroin (SF). The addition of SF can effectively enhance the mechanical property of the SFH12% by 59% compared with SFH0% . Taking the advantage of its wide working range of stress (about 0.455-568.9 kPa), the SFH can work as a resistance-type pressure sensor to monitor different human motions. What is more, the excellent adhesion, about 75.17 N m-1 of SFH46% enables it to fit tightly to other objects during the testing, which significantly reduces the loss of small signals due to poor fit. In addition, the SFH demonstrates excellent self-healing property without requiring external excitation and a sensitive temperature response in the range of -10 to 60 °C. The SFH is expected to be applied in the field of electronic skin, soft robots, and other flexible electronic products as well as speech recognition.","Zhao, Li; Zhao, Jizhong; Zhang, Fan; Xu, Zijie; Chen, Fan; Shi, Yating; Hou, Chen; Huang, Yicheng; Lin, Changjian; Yu, Rui; Guo, Wenxi",Advanced healthcare materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202002083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763942/,53
91377,Prognostic classification of histopathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy in esophageal adenocarcinoma.,2014,": The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging our cardiovascular care of patients with heart diseases. In the setting of pericardial diseases, there are two possible different scenarios to consider: the patient being treated for pericarditis who subsequently becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the patient with COVID-19 who develops pericarditis or pericardial effusion. In both conditions, clinicians may be doubtful regarding the safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, colchicine, and biological agents, such as anti-IL1 agents (e.g. anakinra), that are the mainstay of therapy for pericarditis.For NSAIDs, there is no clear scientific evidence linking ibuprofen and other NSAIDs to worsening of COVID-19; however, it seems prudent to continue them, if necessary to control pericarditis, and on the other hand, to prefer paracetamol for fever and systemic symptoms related to COVID-19. Treatments with corticosteroids, colchicine, and anakinra appear well tolerated in the context of COVID-19 infection and are currently actively evaluated as potential therapeutic options for COVID infection at different stages of the disease. On this basis, currently most treatments for pericarditis do not appear contraindicated also in the presence of possible COVID-19 infection and should not be discontinued, and some (corticosteroids, colchicine, and anakinra) can be considered to treat both conditions.","Imazio, Massimo; Brucato, Antonio; Lazaros, George; Andreis, Alessandro; Scarsi, Mirko; Klein, Allan; De Ferrari, Gaetano Maria; Adler, Yehuda",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32658005/,53

91804,Creating space to build emotional resilience in the animal research community.,2020-08-31,"BACKGROUND International treatment guidelines now recognize the importance of thrombus removal to reduce postthrombotic morbidity when treating patients with extensive acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Studies have shown that thrombus resolution with catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with iliofemoral DVT reduces postthrombotic morbidity, although patients unsuccessfully treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) do not enjoy the same long-term benefit. The purpose of this study is to objectively assess whether the amount of clot reduction at the time of acute therapy correlates with long-term postthrombotic morbidity. METHODS Forty-two patients who underwent catheter-directed and/or pharmacomechanical lysis of iliofemoral DVT were quantitatively evaluated. Patients had their degree of clot lysis quantified and were divided into two main groups for comparison. Group I (n = 33) had >50% clot lysis (mean, 84%) and group II (n = 9) had < or =50% lysis (mean, 42%). At a mean follow-up interval of 14 months, the degree of chronic venous disease was assessed by evaluators blinded to the degree of clot lysis. Evaluation of postthrombotic morbidity was performed using the Villalta scale, and the clinical class of CEAP, and quality-of-life (QOL) was assessed using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS Mean CEAP scores were 0.85 and 3.13 (P = .005), and Villalta scores were 2.38 and 6.25 (P = .009) in group I and group II, respectively. Patient QOL in group I was higher than group II in all parameters. Physical functioning (P = .035), role physical (P = .012), general health (P = .014), vitality (P < .001), and social functioning (P = .012) were all significantly better in group I. Bodily pain (P = .117), role emotional (P = .624), and mental health (P = .096) strongly favored group I patients but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION Patients with extensive DVT treated with catheter-based interventions to eliminate thrombus suffer relatively little postthrombotic morbidity. The degree of clot lysis directly correlates with long-term outcome. Improved QOL, the Villalta scale, and clinical class of CEAP are linearly correlated with the amount of clot resolution.","Grewal, Nina K; Martinez, Jorge Trabal; Andrews, Linda; Comerota, Anthony J",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2009.12.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20347543/,53

92537,This month on Twitter.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the continuity of care of U.S. adults living with chronic diseases, including immunocompromised adults. Disruption in care may be a barrier to identifying COVID-19 associated sequelae, such as mental health symptoms, among the immunocompromised. Our objectives were (1) to evaluate COVID-19-related preventive behaviors, with a focus on canceling doctor's appointments as a proxy for continuity of care, and (2) to compare COVID-19-related mental health symptoms among the immunocompromised with the general population. METHODS We used nationally-representative data of 10,760 U.S. adults from the publicly-available COVID-19 Household Impact Survey. We defined immunocompromised as adults with a self-reported diagnosis of ""a compromised immune system"" (n=854,7.6%). We compared adherence to self-reported COVID-19 preventive behaviors among immunocompromised adults compared to others using χ2-tests. We focused on continuity of care and estimated determinants of canceling doctor's appointments among the immunocompromised using multivariable Poisson regression to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We evaluated associations of mental health symptoms with being immunocompromised using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS Immunocompromised adults were more likely to adhere to recommended COVID-19 preventive behaviors including washing or sanitizing hands (96.3% vs. 89.8%,χ2<0.001), maintaining social distance (91.9% vs. 83.7%,χ2<0.001), and canceling a doctor's appointment (47.1% vs. 29.7%,χ2<0.001). Hispanic adults (aPR:1.47,95% CI:1.12-1.92) and immunocompromised women (aPR:1.25,95% CI:1.00-1.56) were more likely to cancel doctor's appointments compared to NH-White adults and men, respectively. Immunocompromised adults reported higher odds of feeling nervous/anxious/on edge (cOR:1.89,95% CI: 1.44-2.51), depressed (cOR: 2.81,95% CI: 2.17-3.64), lonely (cOR: 2.28,95% CI: 1.74-2.98), and hopeless (cOR: 2.86,95% CI: 2.21-3.69) 3-7 days in the last week. CONCLUSION Immunocompromised adults were more likely to cancel their doctor's appointments and report COVID19-related mental health symptoms.

This study was undertaken with the aim of studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on perinatal mental health among women in Qatar. Objectives and Methods A cross- sectional survey of women accessing maternity services in Qatar was carried out during the months of June and July 2020 at the local peak of the pandemic. Background data including relevant demographic details, pregnancy and mental health history, concerns, as well as helpful stress-reducing factors reported by women was collected. Depression and anxiety symptomatology was studied using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results The survey results revealed a high prevalence of anxiety and Depressive symptomatology (34.4 and 39.2% respectively), based on PHQ-ADS scoring. These rates appeared much higher than the reported pre-pandemic prevalence and were not affected by occupation, previous mental health problems or pregnancy complications. Women's most commonly reported concerns as well as coping factors are discussed. Conclusions Results indicate a marked increase in anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, among pregnant and puerperal individuals, who constitute a vulnerable group with respect to mental health morbidity. These findings can be used to inform public health interventions, among which, consideration should be given to routine mental health screening of vulnerable groups during major health crises.","Farrell, Tom; Reagu, Shuja; Mohan, Suruchi; Elmidany, Riham; Qaddoura, Feras; Ahmed, Ebtehag Elfadil; Corbett, Gillian; Lindow, Stephen; Abuyaqoub, Salwa Mohammed; Alabdulla, Majid Ali",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975206/,53

To assess the sensitivity of environmental surveillance, stools from (re)vaccinated elderly persons with a low seroprevalence and from wastewater were concurrently collected and analyzed in the Netherlands over a prolonged period of time. A total number of 228 healthy individuals with different levels of immunity were challenged with monovalent oral polio vaccine serotype 1 or 3. Poliovirus concentrations were determined by the titration of fecal suspensions on poliovirus-sensitive L20B cells and of sewage concentrates by L20B monolayer plaque assay. Almost half of the individuals (45%) shed poliovirus on day 3 after challenge, which peaked (57%) on day 8 with an average poliovirus excretion of 1.3 × 10(5) TCID(50) per g of feces and gradually decreased to less than 5% on day 42. The virus concentrations in sewage peaked on days 6 to 8 at approximately 100 PFU per liter, remained high until day 14, and subsequently decreased to less than 10 PFU per liter on day 29. The estimated poliovirus concentration in sewage approximated the measured initial virus excretion in feces, within 1 log(10) variation, resulting in a sensitivity of detection of 100 infected but mostly asymptomatic individuals in tens of thousands of individuals. An additional second peak observed in sewage may indicate secondary transmission missed by enterovirus or AFP surveillance in patients. This enables the detection of circulating poliovirus by environmental surveillance, supporting its feasibility as an early warning system.","Lodder, W J; Buisman, A M; Rutjes, S A; Heijne, J C; Teunis, P F; de Roda Husman, A M",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.07972-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22447593/,53

We investigated the status of 113 pediatric hematological patients in Wuhan union hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic from January 23 to March 10, 2020. All the patients had routine blood and biochemical examination, as well as chest computed tomography scans, and the nucleic acid, immunoglobulin G-immunoglobulin M combined antibodies tests for SARS-CoV-2. After admission, all patients were single-room isolated for 5 to 7 days. The results showed that only 1 (0.88%) child with leukemia was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and 15 (13.2%) children were considered as suspected cases. Comparing to the nonsuspected patients, the suspected cases had lower white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, neutrophil count, serum calcium ion level and serum albumin concentration, as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein. All the suspected cases were ruled out of SARS-CoV-2 infection by twice negative tests for the virus. Therefore, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hematological malignancy children was low during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. COVID-19 got early detected and the virus spread out in the ward was effectively blocked by increasing test frequency and using single-room isolation for 5 to 7 days after admission.","Wang, Zhujun; Shen, Yaqing; Jin, Runming; Yu, Hui; Zhou, Fen; Xu, Jiawei; Qiu, Yining; Wang, Lin; Wu, Xiaoyan",Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mph.0000000000002133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33625077/,53

While urgent regulatory measures in control of the rapid spread of this virus are essential, scientists around the world have quickly engaged in this battle by studying the molecular mechanisms and searching for effective therapeutic strategies against this deadly disease. At present, the exact mechanisms of programmed cell death upon SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be elucidated, though there is increasing evidence suggesting that cell death pathways play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are several types of programmed cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. These distinct programs are largely controlled by the proteins of the death domain (DD) superfamily, which play an important role in viral pathogenesis and host antiviral response. Many viruses have acquired the capability to subvert the program of cell death and evade the host immune response, mainly by virally encoded gene products that control cell signaling networks. In this mini-review, we will focus on SARS-CoV-2, and discuss the implication of restraining the DD-mediated signaling network to potentially suppress viral replication and reduce tissue damage.","Ivanisenko, Nikita V; Seyrek, Kamil; Kolchanov, Nikolay A; Ivanisenko, Vladimir A; Lavrik, Inna N",Cell death discovery,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-020-00331-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34628471/,53

This study investigated dental students and clinical staff perceptions of health risks and impacts on clinical competence of working in teaching clinics during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS A 39-item survey composed of closed and open questions was sent to students and clinical staff of a prominent Australasian dental school. Questions focused on students and clinical staff perceived impact of COVID-19 on their health, clinical safety and dental education. RESULTS The majority of staff and students perceived their health to be at risk and this increased their stress and impacted clinical performance, particularly for students. The production of aerosols and violation of cross-infection protocols by some students were the main perceived contributors to COVID-19 cross-infection in teaching clinics. Both students and staff considered the closure of teaching clinics would cause extreme impacts on students' clinical competence; however, online case-based discussions and tutorials were suggested as potential alternative teaching methods that could be adopted during that period. CONCLUSION(S) The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic also bring opportunities for dental education development; mainly in terms of infection prevention and control improvement, preparedness to respond to future contagious diseases, and exploring the benefits of online learning in dentistry.","Loch, Carolina; Kuan, Ian B J; Elsalem, Lina; Schwass, Donald; Brunton, Paul A; Jum'ah, Ahmad",Journal of dental education,https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32914437/,53

This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Three piglets (5, 14, and 20 kg) were imaged using six different selectable detector air kerma (Kair) per frame values (100%, 70%, 50%, 35%, 25%, 17.5%) with and without the grid. Number of distal branches visualized with diagnostic confidence relative to the injected vessel defined image quality score. Five pediatric interventional radiologists evaluated all images. Image quality score and piglet Kair were statistically compared using analysis of variance and receiver operating curve analysis to define the preferred dose setting and use of grid for a visibility of 2nd and 3rd order vessel branches. Grid removal reduced both dose to subject and imaging quality by 26%. Third order branches could only be visualized with the grid present; 100% detector Kair was required for smallest pig, while 70% detector Kair was adequate for the two larger pigs. Second order branches could be visualized with grid at 17.5% detector Kair for all three pig sizes. Without the grid, 50%, 35%, and 35% detector Kair were required for smallest to largest pig, respectively. Grid removal reduces both dose and image quality score. Image quality scores can be maintained with less dose to subject with the grid in the beam as opposed to removed. Smaller anatomy requires more dose to the detector to achieve the same image quality score.","Strauss, Keith J; Racadio, John M; Abruzzo, Todd A; Johnson, Neil D; Patel, Manish N; Kukreja, Kamlesh U; den Hartog, Mark J H; Hoonaert, Bart P A; Nachabe, Rami A",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1120/jacmp.v16i5.5379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26699297/,53

The goal of this study was to develop an ovine model of ZIKV infection. Between 28-35 days gestation (DG), four pregnant animals were infected with two doses of 6 × 106 PFU of ZIKV; four control animals received PBS. Animals were evaluated for 45 days (D) post-infection (PI) and necropsies were performed. Viral RNA was detected in infected ewe peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) during the first week PI; however, all fluids and tissues were negative upon culture. Anti-ZIKV IgM (1:400) and neutralizing antibodies were detected in all infected animals. Clinical disease, virus, or ZIKV antibodies were not detected in control ewes. After two weeks PI, fetal loss occurred in two infected animals, and at necropsy, three infected animals had placental petechiation and ecchymosis and one had hydramnion. Fetal morphometrics revealed smaller cranial circumference to crown-rump length ratios (p < 0.001) and relative brain weights (p = 0.038) in fetuses of infected animals compared with control fetuses. Immunophenotyping indicated an increase in B cells (p = 0.012) in infected sheep. Additionally, in vitro experiments using both adult and fetal cell lines demonstrated that ovine cells are highly permissive to ZIKV infection. In conclusion, ZIKV infection of pregnant sheep results in a change in fetal growth and gestational outcomes.","Schwarz, Erika R; Pozor, Malgorzata A; Pu, Ruiyu; Barr, Kelli L; Beachboard, Sarah E; MacLachlan, N James; Prakoso, Dhani; Long, Maureen T",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v11090795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470560/,53
96550,miR-122-5p regulates hepatocytes damage caused by BaP and DBP co-exposure through SOCS1/STAT3 signaling in vitro.,2021-08-02,"Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular response to starvation that leads to the degradation of organelles and long-lived proteins in lysosomes and is important for cellular homeostasis, tissue development and as a defense against aggregated proteins, damaged organelles and infectious agents. Although autophagy has been studied in many animal species, reagents to study autophagy in avian systems are lacking. Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3/LC3) is an important marker for autophagy and is used to follow autophagosome formation. Here we report the cloning of avian LC3 paralogs A, B and C from the domestic chicken, Gallus gallus domesticus, and the production of replication-deficient, recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing these avian LC3s tagged with EGFP and FLAG-mCherry. An additional recombinant adenovirus expressing EGFP-tagged LC3B containing a G120A mutation was also generated. These vectors can be used as tools to visualize autophagosome formation and fusion with endosomes/lysosomes in avian cells and provide a valuable resource for studying autophagy in avian cells. We have used them to study autophagy during replication of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). IBV induced autophagic signaling in mammalian Vero cells but not primary avian chick kidney cells or the avian DF1 cell line. Furthermore, induction or inhibition of autophagy did not affect IBV replication, suggesting that classical autophagy may not be important for virus replication. However, expression of IBV nonstructural protein 6 alone did induce autophagic signaling in avian cells, as seen previously in mammalian cells. This may suggest that IBV can inhibit or control autophagy in avian cells, although IBV did not appear to inhibit autophagy induced by starvation or rapamycin treatment.","Maier, Helena J; Cottam, Eleanor M; Stevenson-Leggett, Phoebe; Wilkinson, Jessica A; Harte, Christopher J; Wileman, Thomas; Britton, Paul",Autophagy,https://doi.org/10.4161/auto.23465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23328491/,53

Despite global efforts to eradicate orthomyxoviral pathogens, these infections remain pervasive. One such orthomyxovirus, infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV), spreads easily throughout farmed and wild salmonids, constituting a significant economic burden. ISAV entry requires the interplay of the virion-attached hemagglutinin-esterase and fusion glycoproteins. Preventing infections will rely on improved understanding of ISAV entry. Here, we present the crystal structures of ISAV hemagglutinin-esterase unbound and complexed with receptor. Several distinctive features observed in ISAV HE are not seen in any other viral glycoprotein. The structures reveal a unique mode of receptor binding that is dependent on the oligomeric assembly of hemagglutinin-esterase. Importantly, ISAV hemagglutinin-esterase receptor engagement does not initiate conformational rearrangements, suggesting a distinct viral entry mechanism. This work improves our understanding of ISAV pathogenesis and expands our knowledge on the overall diversity of viral glycoprotein-mediated entry mechanisms. Finally, it provides an atomic-resolution model of the primary neutralizing antigen critical for vaccine development.","Cook, Jonathan D; Sultana, Azmiri; Lee, Jeffrey E",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1617993114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28320973/,53

METHODS Prospective study of 41 dogs with thoracolumbar spinal cord injuries investigated by magnetic resonance imaging. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the vertebral level of the cutaneous trunci reflex cut-off and the maximal and cranial lesion extent. The association between cutaneous trunci reflex cut-off and spinal cord injury severity was tested using a Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS Cutaneous trunci reflex cut-off was evident in 33 (80%) of dogs. The cut-off level was 0 to 4 vertebrae caudal to the maximal spinal cord lesion in all dogs. In 16 (48.5%) dogs the cut-off was either 2 or 3 vertebrae caudal to the lesion. The presence of a cut-off significantly correlated with increasing severity (P=0.0001). Loss of the reflex occurred at less severe grades than loss of ambulation and in dogs with ambulatory paresis it was significantly (P=0.0084) associated with increasing severity. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The cutaneous trunci reflex allows localisation of thoracolumbar spinal cord lesions within four vertebrae and facilitates clinical segregation of dogs with ambulatory paresis into mild and severe categories.,"Gutierrez-Quintana, R; Edgar, J; Wessmann, A; Cherubini, G B; Penderis, J",The Journal of small animal practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2012.01244.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22845846/,53

Sodium carbonate and calcium chloride mixed together in the presence of the organic thiol dithiothreitol (DTT) produced crystals of gypsum, or calcium sulfate, instead of the otherwise expected calcium carbonate. The possible sources of sulfate in the system are contaminants in the DTT or the oxidation product of the DTT sulfhydryl. The amount of gypsum produced implies that contaminants do not account for the total sulfate present in the system, suggesting that the DTT could be oxidized. The reaction quotient may be skewed in favor of this unexpected reaction by a combination of efficient removal of sulfate by precipitation, and the concentration of DTT at the leading edge of the precursor film through the coffee-ring effect during a brief drying step.","Melzak, Kathryn A; Laye, Fabrice; Heissler, Stefan",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c01653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32806892/,53

The search included the following keywords ""immune system"", ""immune cell"", or ""immune function""; ""aerobic training"", ""aerobic exercise"", or ""physical activity""; ""human"" or ""adult""; and ""cytokine"", ""killer cell"", ""T cell"", ""interleukin"", ""lymphocyte"", ""leukocyte"" or ""adhesion molecule"". RESULTS Eleven studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this search. The most used exercise prescriptions included walking, cycling, or running. The duration of exercise ranged from 18 to 60 min with an intensity of 55% to 80% of VO2max or 60%-80% of maximum heart rate. The frequency range was 1 to 3 times/week. The mainly increased immunological biomarkers included leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, IL-6, CD16-56, CD16, CD4, CD3, CD8, and CD19. CONCLUSIONS This review demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 should follow a regular program of aerobic exercise for 20-60 min. This program should be in the form of cycling or walking with an intensity of 55%-80% VO2max or 60%-80% of maximum heart rate. This program should be repeated 2-3 sessions/week.

98708,Conference report: inaugural Pharmacogenomics Access and Reimbursement Symposium.,2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND After total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery, patients with an incomplete mesorectum have an increased risk of local and overall recurrence. With the introduction of laparoscopic TME, an improved quality of the specimen was expected. However, the quality-related results were comparable to the results after traditional open surgery. Transanal TME is a new technique in which the rectum is mobilised by using a single-port and endoscopic instruments through the so called 'down to up' procedure. This new technique potentially leads to an improved specimen quality. This study was designed to investigate the pathological quality of specimens after transanal (TME) and to compare these with specimens after traditional laparoscopic TME. METHODS This matched case control study compared the specimens of a cohort of consecutive patients who underwent transanal TME with the specimens after traditional laparoscopic TME. The pathological quality of the mesorectum was determined by the definitions of Quirke as 'complete', 'nearly complete', or 'incomplete'. RESULTS From June 2012 until July 2013, 25 consecutive patients underwent transanal TME because of a rectum carcinoma. Within the transanal TME group, 96% of the specimens had a complete mesorectum, while in the traditional laparoscopic group, 72% was deemed complete (p < 0.05). Other pathological characteristics, such as the circumferential resection margin, were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Transanal TME appears associated with a significant higher rate of completeness of the mesorectum. Further studies are necessary to evaluate this novel technique.","Velthuis, Simone; Nieuwenhuis, Dorothee H; Ruijter, T Emiel G; Cuesta, Miguel A; Bonjer, H Jaap; Sietses, Colin",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3636-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972923/,53

The latest stage of this technique is a four-probe device (Habib Sealer), which we used for a variety of resections to find the best indications for the method. METHODS Between 2005 and 2006 we performed 28 liver resections in 20 consecutive patients. The most common indication was metastatic colorectal cancer (75%). We treated a heterogeneous patient collective in terms of tumour localization and extent of resection. Resection was performed after creating a necrotic zone. The device achieved an area of coagulation of 1-cm width in which even larger vessels and bile ducts were safely sealed. RESULTS Operative spectrum covered atypical resections (8), one- or bisegmentectomies at different locations (15), hemihepatectomies (4) and one extended right hepatectomy. With one exception intra-operative blood loss was lower than 100 mL. Four patients (20%) developed operation-related complications comprising abscess formation at the resection site. Follow-up shows tumour-free survival for 13 of 18 patients 12 months after resection. CONCLUSION Liver resection using the sealer device seems safe. In proximity of hilar structures or large vessels the method is not favourable for the fear of thermal damage. Extended resections are possible but not parenchyma saving.

BACKGROUND Limited information is available on the relative merits of radial compared with femoral access for cardiac catheterization in patients who had previously undergone CABG surgery. METHODS Consecutive patients (N = 128) having previously undergone CABG surgery and referred for cardiac catheterization were randomized to radial or femoral access. The primary study endpoint was contrast volume. Secondary endpoints included fluoroscopy time, procedure time, patient and operator radiation exposure, vascular complications, and major adverse cardiac events. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. RESULTS Compared with femoral access, diagnostic coronary angiography via radial access was associated with a higher mean contrast volume (142 ± 39 ml vs. 171 ± 72 ml, p < 0.01), longer procedure time (21.9 ± 6.8 min vs. 34.2 ± 14.7 min, p < 0.01), greater patient air kerma (kinetic energy released per unit mass) radiation exposure (1.08 ± 0.54 Gy vs. 1.29 ± 0.67 Gy, p = 0.06), and higher operator radiation dose (first operator: 1.3 ± 1.0 mrem vs. 2.6 ± 1.7 mrem, p < 0.01; second operator 0.8 ± 1.1 mrem vs. 1.8 ± 2.1 mrem, p = 0.01). Fewer patients underwent ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the radial group (37.5% vs. 46.9%, p = 0.28) and radial PCI procedures were less complex. The incidences of the primary and secondary endpoints was similar with femoral and radial access among PCI patients. Access crossover was higher in the radial group (17.2% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.01) and vascular access site complications were similar in both groups (3.1%). CONCLUSIONS In patients who had previously undergone CABG surgery, transradial diagnostic coronary angiography was associated with greater contrast use, longer procedure time, and greater access crossover and operator radiation exposure compared with transfemoral angiography.

This study demonstrates application of phytase and fermentation to a pea-oat protein blend with a good essential amino acid profile and subsequent texturization using extrusion cooking. Enzymatic treatment reduced the content of antinutrient phytic acid by 32%. Extrusion also degraded phytic acid by up to 18%, but the effect depended on the material. Differences in physicochemical, sensorial, and textural properties between untreated and phytase-treated extruded meat analogs were small. In contrast, fermented material was more difficult to texturize due to degradation of macromolecules; physicochemical and textural properties of extrudates were markedly different; sensory analysis showed enhancement of flavor, but also detected an increase in some unwanted taste attributes (bitterness, cereal and off-taste). Phytic acid was not degraded by fermentation. Analysis of volatile compounds showed extrusion eliminated volatiles from the raw material but introduced Maillard reaction products. Overall, phytase treatment and fermentation demonstrated the potential for application in extruded meat analogs but also highlighted the necessity of optimization of process conditions.","Kaleda, Aleksei; Talvistu, Karel; Tamm, Martti; Viirma, Maret; Rosend, Julia; Tanilas, Kristel; Kriisa, Marie; Part, Natalja; Tammik, Mari-Liis",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods9081059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764254/,53

The Seattle Washington metropolitan area was one of the first in the United States affected by the pandemic. As a result, the anatomic pathology services at the University of Washington experienced significant changes in operational volumes early in the pandemic. OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of COVID-19 and both state and institutional policies implemented to mitigate viral transmission (including institutional policies on non-urgent procedures) on anatomic pathology volumes. DESIGN Accessioned specimens from January 2020 to June 2020 was evaluated as COVID-19 and institutional policies changed. The data were considered in these contexts: subspecialty, billable CPT codes, and intraoperative consultation. Comparable data were retrieved from 2019 as a historical control. RESULTS There was a significant reduction in overall accessioned volume (up to 79%) from pre-pandemic levels, during bans on non-urgent procedures when compared to 2020 pre- COVID-19 volumes and historical controls. The gastrointestinal and dermatopathology services were most impacted, while breast and combined head&neck/pulmonary services were least impacted. CPT code 88305, for smaller/biopsy specimens, had a 63% reduction during non-urgent procedure bans. After all bans on procedures were lifted, the overall volume plateaued at 89% of pre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSIONS A significant decrease in specimen volume was most strongly associated with bans on non-urgent procedures. While all departmental areas had a decrease in volume, the extent of change varied across subspecialty and specimen types. Even with removing all bans, service volume did not reach pre-pandemic levels.","Miller, Timothy Isaac; Smith, Kelly D; Gonzalez-Cuyar, Luis Francisco; Swanson, Paul E",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0639-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307549/,53

We describe the case of a 70-year-old woman who presented with worsening reto-orbital left-sided pain and a large cavernous aneurysm. The patient underwent endovascular treatment with PED, and there was difficulty delivering the device due to significant vascular tortuosity. This resulted in poor PED deployment as the proximal end failed to open. Increasingly aggressive strategies were attempted to open the device, which resulted in an iatrogenic carotid cavernous fistula. We were finally able to rescue the device and open its proximal end with balloon inflation after using a contralateral trans-anterior communicating artery approach and crossing the PED in a retrograde fashion. Excessive vascular tortuosity poses a genuine risk of PED malfunction and poor deployment. Although we were able to rescue the device and our patient had no permanent morbidity, difficult vascular anatomy rendered the procedure extremely complicated with dreaded complications.","Navarro, Ramon; Yoon, Jang; Dixon, Tanya; Miller, David A; Hanel, Ricardo A; Tawk, Rabih G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-011009.rep; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510421/,53

Therefore, in the present study, the effect of bifurcation on the manner of hemodynamic changes and the rupture risk of the small middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm is investigated. 3D anatomical models of the MCAs of 21 healthy subjects, 19 patients/IA/bifurcation, and 19 patients/IA were generated, and the models were analyzed by the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis. The presence of bifurcation in the pathway of the blood flow in the parent artery of healthy subjects has reduced the maximum velocity, flow rate, and wall shear stress (WSS) by 25.8%, 38.6%, and 11.1%, respectively. The bifurcation decreased the maximum velocity and flow rate in the neck and sac of the aneurysm by 1.65~2.1 times, respectively. It increased the maximum WSS, and phase lag between the WSS graph of healthy subjects and patients by 12.8%~13.9% and 10.2%~40.4%, respectively. The effect of bifurcation on the Womersley number change in the aneurysm was insignificant, and the blood flow was in the laminar flow condition in all samples. The results also showed bifurcation increased the phase lag between the flow rate and pressure gradient graphs up to approximately 1.5 times. The rupture prediction index for patients/IA/bifurcation and patients/IA was 62.1%(CV = 4.1) and 51.8%(CV = 4.4), respectively. Thus, in equal conditions, the presence of bifurcation increased the probability of the rupture of the aneurysm by 19.9%.","Gholampour, Seifollah; Mehrjoo, Saeed",Neurosurgical review,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-020-01367-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803404/,53

Annual administration of LAIV to this age group is costly and poses substantial logistical issues. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prioritizing vaccination to age groups within the 2-16 year old age range to mitigate the operational and resource challenges of the current strategy. We performed economic evaluations comparing the influenza vaccination program from 1995-2013 to seven alternative strategies targeted at low risk individuals along the school age divisions Preschool (2-4 years old), Primary school (5-11 years old), and Secondary school (12-16 years old). These extensions are evaluated incrementally on the status quo scenario (vaccinating subgroups at high risk of influenza-related complications and individuals 65+ years old). Impact of vaccination was assessed using a transmission model from a previously published study and updated with new data. At all levels of coverage, all strategies had a 100% probability of being cost-effective at the current National Health Service threshold, £20,000/QALY gained. The incremental analysis demonstrated vaccinating Primary School children was the most cost-efficient strategy compared incrementally against others with an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio of £639 spent per QALY gained (Net Benefit: 404 M£ [155, 795]). When coverage was varied between 30%, 55%, and 70% strategies which included Primary school children had a higher probability of being cost-effective at lower willingness-to-pay levels. Although children were the vaccine target the majority of QALY gains occurred in the 25-44 years old and 65+ age groups. Influenza strain A/H3N2 incurred the greatest costs and QALYs lost regardless of which strategy was used. Improvement could be made to the current LAIV pediatric vaccination strategy by eliminating vaccination of 2-4 year olds and focusing on school-based delivery to Primary and Secondary school children in tandem.","Wenzel, Natasha S; Atkins, Katherine E; van Leeuwen, Edwin; Halloran, M Elizabeth; Baguelin, Marc",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.10.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280855/,53

Abnormal contact forces across the hip and alterations in bony morphology characteristic of FAI may be especially detrimental in this group, given their young age and active lifestyle. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to report the findings, outcomes, and return to sport percentage among adolescent athletes with FAI treated with hip arthroscopy. METHODS A retrospective review of all patients younger than 18 years who underwent hip arthroscopy for FAI at a single institution was performed. All athletes who were attempting to return to sport and underwent hip arthroscopy were included. Patients with previous hip surgery and/or hip conditions were excluded. Arthroscopic procedures and an assessment of intra-articular findings were recorded. Patient-reported outcome measures were recorded at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively, and included the modified Harris hip score, the nonarthritic hip score, hip outcome score-sports subscale, visual analogue scale for pain, and patient satisfaction. Return to sport percentage and ability levels were also noted. RESULTS There were 96 eligible cases of adolescent athletes treated with hip arthroscopy; 81 (84.4%) hips in 69 patients had 2-year follow-up. Running/track and field was the most common sport (25), followed by soccer (12), dance (10), baseball/softball (9), and basketball (6). There were 61 females and 20 males, whose average age was 15.9±1.2 y (range: 13.1 to 18.0 y). The most common procedures were labral repair (81.5%), iliopsoas fractional lengthening (72.8%), femoroplasty (69.1%), and acetabuloplasty (66.7%). Capsular repair or plication was performed in most patients (81.5%). Cartilage damage was more common on the acetabulum than the femur, with Outerbridge grade 2 or higher occurring in 23.5% and 4.9% of hips, respectively. Statistically significant improvements were seen in all patient-reported outcomes from preoperative to minimum 2-year follow-up. A total of 84.0% of patients had returned to their sport at latest follow-up. There were 6 (7.4%) patients who underwent revision arthroscopy at a mean of 37.3 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION Symptomatic FAI in adolescent athletes can be successfully treated with hip arthroscopy, with a higher return to sport rate and low complications and reoperation rate at minimum 2-year follow-up.","Litrenta, Jody; Mu, Brian H; Ortiz-Declet, Victor; Chen, Austin W; Perets, Itay; Wojnowski, Natalia M; Domb, Benjamin G",Journal of pediatric orthopedics,https://doi.org/10.1097/bpo.0000000000001411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31192888/,53

Fifty to 95% of all infants with NEC develop thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <150 × 109/L) within 24-72 h of receiving this diagnosis. In many patients, thrombocytopenia is severe and is treated with one or more platelet transfusions. However, the underlying mechanism(s) and biological implications of NEC-related thrombocytopenia remain unclear. This review presents current evidence from human and animal studies on the clinical features and mechanisms of platelet depletion in NEC. Anecdotal clinical experience is combined with evidence from laboratory studies and from an extensive literature search in databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus and the electronic archives of abstracts presented at the annual meetings of the Pediatric Academic Societies. To avoid bias in identification of existing studies, key words were short-listed prior to the actual search both from anecdotal experience and from PubMed's Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) thesaurus.

Recent clinical trials have reported effects on several rehabilitation outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This review summarizes the effects of physical therapy in COVID-19 patients. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases were systematically searched for studies investigating the effect of any physical therapy modality on impairments in adult COVID-19 patients. Included studies were (non)-randomized controlled trials, pre-experimental studies, and cohort studies in which a pre-post analysis was performed. DATA EXTRACTION After the screening process, data of interest were extracted from eligible studies and their risk of bias was assessed. Included outcome measures were divided into 3 groups: pulmonary function, physical function, and psychosocial function. DATA SYNTHESIS A total of 15 studies were included in this review. Physical therapy seems to have positive effects on pulmonary function, physical function, and psychosocial function. However, these effects differ between clinical settings (e.g. home care, intensive care unit, inpatient units). Due to the low-to-moderate quality of the included studies, no robust conclusions can be drawn.

METHODS We conducted comprehensive searches to March 2016 for published, English-language SRs and RCTs of acute management of moderate to severe TBI. Systematic reviews and RCTs were grouped under 12 broad intervention categories. For each review, we mapped the included and non-included RCTs, noting the reasons why RCTs were omitted. An SR was judged as 'current' when it included the most recently published RCT we found on their topic, and 'complete' when it included every RCT we found that met its inclusion criteria, taking account of when the review was conducted. Quality was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist (trichotomised into low, moderate and high quality). FINDINGS We included 85 SRs and 213 RCTs examining the effectiveness of treatments for acute management of moderate to severe TBI. The most frequently reviewed interventions were hypothermia (n = 17, 14.2%), hypertonic saline and/or mannitol (n = 9, 7.5%) and surgery (n = 8, 6.7%). Of the 80 single-intervention SRs, approximately half (n = 44, 55%) were judged as current and two-thirds (n = 52, 65.0%) as complete. When considering only the most recently published review on each intervention (n = 25), currency increased to 72.0% (n = 18). Less than half of the 85 SRs were judged as high quality (n = 38, 44.7%), and nearly 20% were low quality (n = 16, 18.8%). Only 16 (20.0%) of the single-intervention reviews (and none of the five multi-intervention reviews) were judged as current, complete and high-quality. These included reviews of red blood cell transfusion, hypothermia, management guided by intracranial pressure, pharmacological agents (various) and prehospital intubation. Over three-quarters (n = 167, 78.4%) of the 213 RCTs were included in one or more SR. Of the remainder, 17 (8.0%) RCTs post-dated or were out of scope of existing SRs, and 29 (13.6%) were on interventions that have not been assessed in SRs. CONCLUSION A substantial number of SRs in acute management of moderate to severe TBI lack currency, completeness and quality. We have identified both potential evidence gaps and also substantial research waste. Novel review methods, such as Living Systematic Reviews, may ameliorate these shortcomings and enhance utility and reliability of the evidence underpinning clinical care.","Synnot, Anneliese; Bragge, Peter; Lunny, Carole; Menon, David; Clavisi, Ornella; Pattuwage, Loyal; Volovici, Victor; Mondello, Stefania; Cnossen, Maryse C; Donoghue, Emma; Gruen, Russell L; Maas, Andrew",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29927963/,53
105232,Wireless monitoring in the ICU on the horizon.,2020-03-01,"In 2012, the U.S. FDA approved the first drug for use as HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), which is nearly 99% effective when taken as prescribed. Although the manifest function of PrEP is to prevent HIV infection in the event of exposure, the drug has also had a significant impact on various facets of sexuality. In this review, we focus on research that emerged in the near decade since PrEP's approval, with a specific focus on the ways in which different elements of sex and sexuality have been impacted by gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM), cisgender women, and transgender individuals. We highlight evidence showing how PrEP has enhanced sexual self-esteem, improved sexual pleasure, reduced sexual anxiety, and has increased sexual agency for those taking it. For many, PrEP also serves as a gateway to improve routine health and increase sexual health-care utilization. Additionally, we review the question of whether PrEP is associated with increased sexual risk taking (i.e. risk compensation), and note that, although some data are mixed, PrEP is not intended as an intervention to reduce condomless anal sex or STIs: it aims to prevent HIV. Finally, our review highlights that, although the volume of research on PrEP among GBMSM is robust, it is underdeveloped for cisgender women and transgender populations and insufficient for inclusion in such a review for cisgender heterosexual men was. PrEP research with these populations is an important direction for future research. Finally, from 2012 to 2019, a single PrEP formulation and delivery method was FDA approved (oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). As additional drug formulations (ie.g., emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) and delivery methods (e.g., microbiocides, vaginal ring, injectable) come to market, it will be important to examine how these, too, impact the spectrum of sexuality.","Grov, Christian; Westmoreland, Drew A; D'Angelo, Alexa B; Pantalone, David W",Journal of sex research,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2021.1936440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180743/,53

105392,Effects of insulin on IGF-1 receptors in equine lamellar tissue in vitro.,2020-07-29,"BACKGROUND Timely identification of patients at a high risk of clinical deterioration is key to prioritizing care, allocating resources effectively, and preventing adverse outcomes. Vital signs-based, aggregate-weighted early warning systems are commonly used to predict the risk of outcomes related to cardiorespiratory instability and sepsis, which are strong predictors of poor outcomes and mortality. Machine learning models, which can incorporate trends and capture relationships among parameters that aggregate-weighted models cannot, have recently been showing promising results. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to identify, summarize, and evaluate the available research, current state of utility, and challenges with machine learning-based early warning systems using vital signs to predict the risk of physiological deterioration in acutely ill patients, across acute and ambulatory care settings. METHODS PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed, original studies with keywords related to ""vital signs,"" ""clinical deterioration,"" and ""machine learning."" Included studies used patient vital signs along with demographics and described a machine learning model for predicting an outcome in acute and ambulatory care settings. Data were extracted following PRISMA, TRIPOD, and Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. RESULTS We identified 24 peer-reviewed studies from 417 articles for inclusion; 23 studies were retrospective, while 1 was prospective in nature. Care settings included general wards, intensive care units, emergency departments, step-down units, medical assessment units, postanesthetic wards, and home care. Machine learning models including logistic regression, tree-based methods, kernel-based methods, and neural networks were most commonly used to predict the risk of deterioration. The area under the curve for models ranged from 0.57 to 0.97. CONCLUSIONS In studies that compared performance, reported results suggest that machine learning-based early warning systems can achieve greater accuracy than aggregate-weighted early warning systems but several areas for further research were identified. While these models have the potential to provide clinical decision support, there is a need for standardized outcome measures to allow for rigorous evaluation of performance across models.

IL-6 is associated with different diseases and viral infections including COVID-19. To our knowledge no normal values were reported for IL-6 in the blood of healthy individuals. We have reviewed and performed a meta-analysis on a total of 140 studies including 12421 values for IL-6 in the blood of adult healthy donors. Among these studies 83 did not report a mean value and the standard deviation. Therefore, for the statistical analysis we used the values reported in 57 studies which included 3166 values for IL-6. RESULTS The reported values for IL-6 in the blood of healthy donors varied between 0 and 43.5 pg/ml. The pooled estimate of IL-6 was 5.186 pg/ml (95% CI: 4.631, 5.740). As the age increased by one year, IL-6 values increased by 0.05 pg/ml (95% CI: 0.02, 0.09; p<0.01). Though the heterogenicity as determined by I2 statistics was high in our study, the differences in IL-6 values are still at the level of a few pg/ml, which might be related to the differences in the conditions that influence IL-6 production in the healthy population. CONCLUSIONS This is the first meta-analysis reporting the levels of IL-6 in the blood of healthy donors based on a large number of studies and donors. Therefore the 95% CI values determined in our study could well serve as a reference range for quick decision making in clinical interventions particularly those aiming to inhibit IL-6 especially urgent interventions e.g. COVID-19.

105754,Mice with severe COVID symptoms could speed vaccine effort.,2021-05-11,"PURPOSE The pipeline embolization device (PED) is a flow diverter that has shown promise in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Close to one-fifth of aneurysms, however, fail to occlude after PED placement. This study aims to identify anatomical features and clinicopathologic factors that may predispose failed aneurysm occlusion with the PED. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all anterior circulation unruptured saccular aneurysms treated with the PED in a single-center. The primary outcome measure was angiographic occlusion. Anatomical features and potential predictors, including gender, aneurysm location, size, height, aspect ratio, neck width, prior treatment and the number of PED, were studied using binary logistic regression. RESULTS 29 anterior circulation unruptured saccular aneurysms with a mean size of 6.99 mm treated with the PED in a single center were retrospectively studied. The overall occlusion rate was 79.3% after a mean follow-up of 9.2 months. Four aneurysms were related to the fetal-type posterior communicating artery (PComA), and all were refractory to flow diverter treatment. Female gender was significantly associated with a higher occlusion rate. We present the anatomical features and propose possible pathophysiological mechanisms of these PComA aneurysms that failed flow diverter treatment. CONCLUSION A PComA aneurysm with persistent fetal-type circulation appears to be particularly refractory to flow diverter treatment, especially when the aneurysm incorporates a significant portion of the PComA. Our experience suggested that flow diverting stents alone may not be the ideal treatment for this subgroup of aneurysms, and alternative modalities should be considered. Female patients were found to have a significantly higher rate of treatment success.","Tsang, Anderson Chun On; Fung, Arthur Man Yuen; Tsang, Frederick Chun Pong; Leung, Gilberto Ka Kit; Lee, Raymand; Lui, Wai Man",Neurointervention,https://doi.org/10.5469/neuroint.2015.10.2.60; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26389008/,53

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are known to have an altered immune milieu which may be associated with a delay in viral clearance. Here, a cross-sectional observational study of 138 patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection at two large regional hospitals in Scotland, UK examined the median time to two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 in an inpatient population. The median time from admission to the first of two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs was 18 days (range = 1-44) in patients with CKD, compared with 11 days (range: 1-71) in patients without CKD (P = .0007). Multivariable linear regression analysis using explanatory variables of age, sex, SARS-CoV-2 disease severity, key comorbidities and renal function showed that declining estimated glomerular filtration rate was independently associated with prolonged time to viral clearance. Our data suggest that patients with CKD who are admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 take longer to achieve sequential negative nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results than those without CKD. This has implications for renal service provision, discharge planning and hospital capacity as well as a direct impact on patients due to extended hospital stay, anxiety and stigmatisation.","O'Sullivan, Eoin D; Lees, Jennifer S; Howie, Katie L; Pugh, Dan; Gillis, Keith A; Traynor, Jamie P; Macintyre, Iain; Mark, Patrick B",Nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/nep.13844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33368892/,53

Herein, we used a combination of thermosensitive biocompatible polymer and gold nanorods to specifically deliver, preserve and confine heat to the area of interest. Our data demonstrates that this technique can be used to kill both Gram positive and Gram negative antimicrobial resistant bacteria in vitro. Our approach significantly reduces the antimicrobial resistant bacteria load in experimentally infected wounds by 98% without harming the surrounding tissues. More importantly, this polymer-nanocomposite can be prepared easily and applied to the wounds, can generate heat using a hand-held laser device, is safe for the operator, and does not have any adverse effects on the wound tissue and healing process.","Abdou Mohamed, Mohamed A; Raeesi, Vahid; Turner, Patricia V; Rebbapragada, Anu; Banks, Kate; Chan, Warren C W",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.04.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27174687/,53
106163,Seeing through multimode fibers with real-valued intensity transmission matrices.,2020-07-06,"PSMA PET is more accurate than conventional imaging (CT/bone scan) for staging of intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer (PCa), but 5-10% of primary tumours have low PSMA ligand uptake. FDG PET has been used to further define disease extent in end-stage castrate-resistant PCa and may be beneficial earlier in the disease course for more accurate staging. The objective of this study was to review the available evidence for patients undergoing both FDG and PSMA PET for PCa staging at initial diagnosis and in recurrent disease. A systematic literature review was performed for studies with direct, intraindividual comparison of PSMA and FDG PET for staging of PCa. Assessment for radioligand therapy eligibility was not considered. Risk of bias was assessed. 543 citations were screened and assessed. 13 case reports, three retrospective studies, and one prospective study were included. FDG after PSMA PET improved the detection of metastases from 65% to 73% in high-risk early castration-resistant PCa with negative conventional imaging (M0). Positive FDG PET was found in 17% of men with negative PSMA PET for postprostatectomy biochemical recurrence. Gleason score ≥8 and higher PSA levels predicted FDG-avid metastases in BCR and primary staging. Variant histology (ductal and neuroendocrine) was common in case reports, resulting in PSMA-negative FDG-positive imaging for 3 patients. Dual-tracer PET for PCa may assist in characterising high-risk disease during primary staging and restaging. Further studies are required to determine the additive benefit of FDG PET and if the FDG-positive phenotype may indicate a poorer prognosis.","McGeorge, Stephen; Kwok, Michael; Jiang, Andrew; Emmett, Louise; Pattison, David A; Thomas, Paul A; Yaxley, John W; Roberts, Matthew J",Advances in urology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/1544208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34456998/,53
106364,Efficacy and safety of a vessel sealing system in oral cancer resection and reconstructive surgery.,2018,"Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an anionic phospholipid that is usually localized in the inner leaflets of the plasma membrane. However, the enzyme scramblase catalyzes the externalization of PS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during apoptosis or cellular stress. This event prompts the recognition of PS displaying cells by phagocytes leading to ""apoptotic clearance."" Multiple PS receptors (PSRs) mediate this process including members from the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mertk) receptor Tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by interacting with PS via bridging proteins like Gas6 and ProS1. Ironically, this network (PS/TAM) that evolved for boosting cellular health through clearance of apoptotic and necrotic cells, has been manoeuvred by pathogens and tumor cells using ""apoptotic mimicry."" Enveloped viruses, responsible for most of the lethal epidemics and pandemics including the current SARS-CoV2 outbreak, have employed apoptotic mimicry to their advantage. In the current chapter, we summarize the existing knowledge regarding the involvement of PS/Gas6, ProS1/TAM in facilitating infectivity in a diverse set of cell lines, animals as well as organoids. This network executes a largely proviral role in facilitating infection as seen with Zika, Ebola, Influenza and Dengue viruses. However, this response varies with strains and the cells infected, and in some cases, this same signaling displays an antiviral function. We also report multiple studies that have used neutralizing antibodies and small molecule inhibitors in successfully reducing viral replication and ameliorating pathogenicity. Knowledge about this unique signaling pathway and measures that can be taken to inhibit it is most valuable now given how enveloped viruses lead to plagues on the entire globe.","Ghosh Roy, Sounak",International review of cell and molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ircmb.2020.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33234246/,53
106629,2021: a new year for the WHO.,2021-01-01,"In laboratories and manufacturing settings, a rapid and inexpensive method for the preparation of a target protein is crucial for promoting resesrach in protein science and engineering. Inclusion-body-based protein production is a promising method because high yields are achieved in the upstream process, although the refolding of solubilized, unfolded proteins in downstream processes often leads to significantly lower yields. The most challenging problem is that the effective condition for refolding is protein dependent and is therefore difficult to select in a rational manner. Accordingly, considerable time and expense using trial-and-error approaches are often needed to increase the final protein yield. Furthermore, for certain target proteins, finding suitable conditions to achieve an adequate yield cannot be obtained by existing methods. Therefore, to convert such a troublesome refolding process into a routine one, a wide array of methods based on novel technologies and materials have been developed. These methods select refolding conditions where productive refolding dominates over unproductive aggregation in competitive refolding reactions. This review focuses on synthetic refolding additives and describes the concepts underlying the development of reported chemical additives or chemical-additive-based methods that contribute to the emergence of a universal refolding method.","Yamaguchi, Satoshi; Yamamoto, Etsushi; Mannen, Teruhisa; Nagamune, Teruyuki",Biotechnology journal,https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.201200025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22965925/,53

Behavioral economic interventions may reduce biases that are associated with poor adherence. The objective of this review is to map the available evidence on behavioral economic interventions to improve medication adherence in adults with chronic conditions in high-income settings. METHODS We conducted a scoping review and reported the study using the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual and the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Review checklist. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, EconLit, and CINAHL from database inception to 29 August, 2018 for peer-reviewed studies and included a search of the gray literature. Data on study characteristics, study design, and study outcomes were extracted by one reviewer. Twenty-five percent of the studies were verified by a second reviewer. RESULTS Thirty-four studies, targeting diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus, and cardiovascular and renal diseases met our inclusion criteria. All but two studies were from the USA. The majority of interventions used financial incentives, often in conjunction with other behavioral economic concepts. Non-financial interventions included framing, social influences, reinforcement, and feedback. The effectiveness of interventions was mixed. CONCLUSIONS Behavioral economic informed interventions show promise in terms of improving medication adherence. However, there is no single simple intervention. This review highlighted the importance of targeting non-adherent patients, understanding their reasons for non-adherence, providing reminders and feedback to patients and physicians, and measuring clinical outcomes in addition to medication adherence. Further research in settings that differ from the US health system is needed.","Roseleur, Jacqueline; Harvey, Gillian; Stocks, Nigel; Karnon, Jonathan",The patient,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40271-019-00377-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332723/,53

It may occur during deep anaesthesia, but also in the case of metabolic or haemodynamic brain injury. The goal of the study was to describe the occurrence of SR and to determine factors associated with SR during propofol-remifentanil general anaesthesia maintenance. METHODS We conducted a post hoc analysis of BIS recordings in consecutive patients included in two multi-centre trials, undergoing non-cardiac surgery using a dual closed-loop BIS controller allowing automated propofol-remifentanil administration. The percentage of time spent with a BIS value between 40 and 60 (T(BIS 40-60)) was measured. Two groups of patients were defined: the SR group, including patients with at least one episode of SR value >10% lasting more than 1 min, and the control group. Factors associated with SR were analysed using a stepwise multivariate analysis. RESULTS A total of 1494 patients [age=57 (17) yr; T(BIS 40-60)=76 (17%)] were analysed and 131 (8.7%) patients constituted the SR group. The main independent factors associated with SR were advanced age [odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=4.80 (1.85-12.43) (P=0.027), 10.59 (3.76-29.81) (P<0.0001), for categories of age 60-80 and >80 yr, respectively], history of coronary artery disease (CAD) [2.53 (1.47-4.37) (P=0.001)] and male gender [1.57 (1.03-2.40) (P=0.03)]. CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of SR during BIS-controlled propofol and remifentanil anaesthesia is mainly observed in elderly male patients or in patients with a history of CAD.

Methods A total of 57 patients who underwent SPA-TLH for a large uterine myoma and/or adenomyosis (uterine weight ≥500 g) between March 2013 and July 2017 were included. For specimen retrieval, TUM was performed for 30 patients and TVM for 27 patients. Results Perioperative outcomes, including total operative time, tissue extraction time, extension of skin incision length, estimated volume of blood loss, changes in postoperative hemoglobin level, length of postoperative hospital stay, postoperative pain, and uterine weight, were compared between the 2 groups. No significant differences were observed in the baseline characteristics except for a history of cesarean section (TUM vs. TVM: 83.3% vs. 14.8%, P=0.002) and history of vaginal delivery (TUM vs. TVM: 6.7% vs. 88.8%, P=0.001). The total operative time, tissue extraction time, extension of skin incision length, estimated volume of blood loss, changes in postoperative hemoglobin level, length of postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative pain did not significantly differ between the two groups. The uterine weight was significantly higher for patients who underwent TUM than for those who had TVM (median [range]: 735 g [520-1,380 g] vs. 622 g [514-975 g]; P=0.042). Conclusion TUM during SPA-TLH is a feasible technique for extracting large uteri weighing ≥500 g. This procedure is suitable for patients without a history of vaginal delivery or a narrow vaginal cavity.","Oh, Seung Ju; Lee, Seo Young; Kim, Woo Yong; Kang, Jieun; Han, Kyoung-Hee; Lee, San-Hui; Park, Ji Sun",Obstetrics & gynecology science,https://doi.org/10.5468/ogs.2020.63.3.379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32489984/,53
108034,A Less Perfect Union.,2020,"BACKGROUND Failed intubation may result in both increased morbidity and mortality. The combination of a video laryngoscope and a flexible tracheoscope used as a flexible video stylet may improve the success rate of securing a difficult airway. We tested the hypothesis that this combination is a feasible way to facilitate intubation in patients with a predicted difficult airway in that it will shorten intubation times and reduce the number of intubation attempts. METHODS We conducted a randomized, prospective trial in 140 patients with anticipated difficult airways undergoing elective or urgent surgery. After insertion of video laryngoscope, patients were randomly assigned to either having their tube placed with the use of a preformed stylet (control group) or with a flexible tracheoscope (intervention group). The primary outcome measures were time to successful intubation and number of intubation attempts. RESULTS The number of intubations requiring 2 or more intubation attempts was similar in the 2 groups (14% control vs 13% intervention, P = 1.0); the number of patients requiring 3 or more intubation attempts was not significantly different (8.6% control vs 1.4% intervention, P = 0.12). Distribution for time to intubation also did not differ between the control (median of 66 seconds, interquartile range 47-89) and the intervention group (median of 71 seconds, interquartile range 52-100; P = 0.35). In the control group, 4 patients, all with cervical spine pathology, had the trachea intubated successfully with the video laryngoscope plus flexible tracheoscope after 3 failed attempts with video laryngoscope and rigid stylet. For these 4 patients, time from the decision to change the intubation method to successful intubation with a flexible tracheoscope was 36 ± 14 seconds. Overall success probability for cervical spine patients was 100% (20/20) in the intervention group and 80% (16/20) in the control group, with an exact 95% confidence interval for the difference of 1.4% to 44%, P = 0.04. CONCLUSIONS Flexible tracheoscope-assisted video laryngoscopic intubation is a feasible alternative to video laryngoscope only intubation in patients with predicted difficult airways. A flexible tracheoscope used in combination with video laryngoscope may also further increase the success rate of intubation in select patients with a proven difficult airway, particularly when in-line stabilization is required.","Lenhardt, Rainer; Burkhart, Mary Tyler; Brock, Guy N; Kanchi-Kandadai, Sunitha; Sharma, Rachana; Akça, Ozan",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000000220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842175/,53

MATERIALS AND METHODS Mixed-method nested study within a pilot trial. Dental patients (n = 150) at an outreach primary dental care centre, ≥ 65 years old, were recruited and randomly allocated to e-Oral health text messages or leaflet intervention arms. Post-intervention (6 months), participants responded to open and closed-ended two-way survey phone texts. Survey questions investigated: (a) whether they would recommend the intervention, (b) intervention helpfulness and (c) OPEN feedback. Average helpfulness scores (Scale:1= Very Helpful to 5= Not Helpful at All) were compared for each arm using Independent Sample t-test.

109502,Gadolinium retention in the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus is dependent on the class of contrast agent.,2015,"In 2019, a new virus -SARS-COV2 emerged in china which infected many people affecting mainly the respiratory system. SARS-COV2 gets transmitted by inhalation of droplets from infected persons. Symptoms start to appear after the incubation period of the virus which ranges from 2 to 14 days. In most people, symptoms are usually mild such as fever, sore throat, cough, chest tightness and fatigue. In other people, the disease might progress into severe pneumonia leading to several fatal consequences. Treatment is usually supportive and the role of antiviral is not established yet. Home isolation for mild cases is important for the prevention of the transmission of infection. Although the rate of transmission of this virus is faster than other viruses from the family such as MERS-CoV, it has a lower fatality rate. The main difference in the genome structure of this family which make it distinguishable from other viruses is its use of (+) ssRNA as its genetic material which is comprised of 5' cap located at one end and 3' polyadenylation tract at the other end. During infection of an exposed host cell, viral-encoded protease cleaves the polyprotein that results from translation of 5' open reading frame (ORF) of the genome, culminating in releasing of multiple nonstructural proteins such as helicase (Hel), adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rep). These proteins are responsible for the replication process in addition to the syntheses of the sub genomic mRNA used as transcription templet strand. In this review article we discussed the transmission pathways, genetic sequence and current treatment approach of COVID-19.","Al Dhamen, Marwa Abduallah; Alhashim, Abrar Fouad; Alqattan, Hawra Hussain; Pottoo, Faheem Hyder",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612826666201222161312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393898/,53

This study aims to clarify the effect of exercise. METHODS Using the data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2007 and 2016, we identified 1572 elderly people with diabetes for this cross-sectional population-based study. Demographic characteristics, health conditions, comorbidities, HRQoL, and medical resource were compared among four groups (no exercise, low-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise, and high-intensity exercise). RESULTS The mean age of all participants was between 71.5 and 73.3 years. Male participants with higher education performed more exercise than their counterparts. The moderate- and high-intensity groups reported better general health condition than the no exercise group. Depression and worse health were more common in the no exercise group. Participants in the moderate-intensity exercise group had lower risk for depression than those in the no exercise group (adjusted odds ratio: 0.13, 95% confidence interval: 0.02-0.92) after adjusting for demographic characteristics, health conditions, and comorbidities, whereas participants in the low- and high-intensity exercise did not have a lower risk. The no exercise group had the highest proportions of emergency, hospitalization, and total healthcare visits. CONCLUSIONS Exercise is associated with better HRQoL, and lack of exercise is associated with higher medical resource use in elderly people with diabetes. Encouraging exercise is recommended in this population.","Huang, Chien-Cheng; Hsu, Chien-Chin; Chiu, Chong-Chi; Lin, Hung-Jung; Wang, Jhi-Joung; Weng, Shih-Feng",BMC geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-01750-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894048/,53

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 57 obese patients and their sexually active partners. Male participations were assessed with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Male Sexual Health Questionaries (MSHQ-4), and female participations were assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). RESULTS There were 31 (54.4%) male patients and 26 (45.6%) female patients in the study. The median IIEF score of the male patients statistically increased postoperatively (p<0.001). The IIEF subgroup areas were found to have increased after surgery. The median FSFI score of the female patients statistically increased postoperatively (p<0.001). The median FSFI of male patients' partners significantly increased postoperatively (p<0.001). All FSFI domains were statistically significantly increased (p<0.001, all areas). The median IIEF value of the postoperative partners of the female patients also increased statistically significant (p<0.001). In addition, the increases in the IIEF's sub-domains in terms of sexual desire (p<0.001), intercourse satisfaction (p<0.001), and general satisfaction (p<0.001) were statistically significant. CONCLUSION The sexual functions of both males and females and also their' partners were improved after bariatric surgery. Patients with preoperative poor sexual function achieve significant benefits over patients without sexual dysfunction.","Gokalp, Fatih; Koras, Omer; Ugur, Mustafa; Yildirak, Ekrem; Sigva, Hakan; Burak Porgali, Sefa; Tamkac, Nezih; Gorur, Sadik",Andrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.13000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33686805/,53

AIMS Review of innovations that have been implemented or have influenced civilian practice within the areas of trauma, disease outbreak management and civilian systems between 2009 and 2020. This review will also aim to explore the impact that working with or within the military can have on individuals within civilian healthcare systems and the future challenges we face to maintain skills. RESULTS Using a narrative approach to this review, we found that there have been numerous changes to trauma management within the UK, based on military practice and research during conflict, which have improved survival outcomes. In addition, the use of niche military skills as part of a coordinated response, during both internal and international disease outbreaks, are thought to have supported civilian systems enabling an efficient and prolonged response. Furthermore, adaptation of military concepts and their application to the NHS through consultant-led prehospital teams, centralisation of specialties in the form of major trauma centres and the introduction of guidelines to manage 'major incidents and mass casualty events' in 2018 have improved patient outcomes. CONCLUSION From 2009 to 2020, lessons learnt from the British and other nations' militaries have been integrated into UK practice and have likely contributed to improved outcomes in the management of major incidents both nationally and internationally.","France, Katherine; Handford, C",BMJ military health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472811/,53

Though non-pharmacological interventions have been investigated, to our knowledge, no summary of all systematic reviews on this topic has been reported. We will conduct a rapid overview of reviews to synthesise evidence available by identifying systematic reviews on non-pharmacological interventions for self-directed or interpersonal violence in people with severe mental illness. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a protocol for a rapid overview of reviews. The overview will include any systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster RCTs that examine the effect of non-pharmacological interventions on self-directed or interpersonal violence in people with severe mental illness. This protocol applies the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Protocols, the criteria for conducting overviews of reviews in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the criteria for the Cochrane Rapid Reviews. To identify studies, a search will be performed in the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, SciELO, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through the Cochrane Library and the Epistemonikos database of systematic reviews. The searches date from inception to September 2020. The study selection process will be described using a PRISMA flow diagram, we will assess the quality of evidence in systematic reviews included and the quality of the systematic reviews themselves and the main results will be summarised in categories to provide a map of the evidence available. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No patients or other participants will be involved in this study. The results will be presented at mental health conferences and for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

The 7th International Symposium on Pneumococci and Pneumococcal Diseases (ISPPD-7) was held on the 14-18 March 2010 in Tel Aviv, Israel. During this symposium, clinical and epidemiological features in the post-PCV-7 era, current studies about two new approved PCVs (PHiD-CV and PCV-13) and new data about protein-based vaccines were extensively evaluated. Routine surveillance for pneumococcal infections is essential for all countries whether pneumococcal vaccines are available or not, and long-term results of surveillance help us to understand the PCVs potential benefits. Current epidemiological data about serotype 6C have also been presented from different countries and existing PCVs' efficacy against serotype 6C should be evaluated. In the post-PCV7 era, we have some new emerging serotypes and we also need new vaccines or interventions focused on protection for children against serotypes prevalent in the developing world or broad protection across all pneumococcal serotypes. Effectiveness of the new PCVs against nasopharyngeal carriage, acute otitis media and invasive infections need to be investigated in the real world; immunogenicity of investigational protein-based vaccines, are still evaluated in different settings.

The author offers some considerations about the notion of ""background of the uncanny"", derived from Yolanda Gampel, which draws attention to the challenges when both patient and analyst are inserted into the same traumatic wider context.

114595,Carrier-resolved technology for homogeneous and multiplexed DNA assays in a 'one-pot reaction'.,2008,"Mammograms contain information that predicts breast cancer risk. We developed two novel mammogram-based breast cancer risk measures based on image brightness (Cirrocumulus) and texture (Cirrus). Their risk prediction when fitted together, and with an established measure of conventional mammographic density (Cumulus), is not known. We used three studies consisting of: 168 interval cases and 498 matched controls; 422 screen-detected cases and 1,197 matched controls; and 354 younger-diagnosis cases and 944 controls frequency-matched for age at mammogram. We conducted conditional and unconditional logistic regression analyses of individually- and frequency-matched studies, respectively. We estimated measure-specific risk gradients as the change in odds per standard deviation of controls after adjusting for age and body mass index (OPERA) and calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). For interval, screen-detected and younger-diagnosis cancer risks, the best fitting models (OPERAs [95% confidence intervals]) involved: Cumulus (1.81 [1.41 to 2.31]) and Cirrus (1.72 [1.38 to 2.14]); Cirrus (1.49 [1.32 to 1.67]) and Cirrocumulus (1.16 [1.03 to 1.31]); and Cirrus (1.70 [1.48 to 1.94]) and Cirrocumulus (1.46 [1.27 to 1.68]), respectively. The AUCs were: 0.73 [0.68 to 0.77], 0.63 [0.60 to 0.66], and 0.72 [0.69 to 0.75], respectively. Combined, our new mammogram-based measures have twice the risk gradient for screen-detected and younger-diagnosis breast cancer (P<10-12 ), have at least the same discriminatory power as the current polygenic risk score, and are more correlated with causal factors than conventional mammographic density.

METHODS Patients with less than a 28 body mass index (BMI) and a benign gall bladder disease were enrolled in this study. From January 2011 to February 2012, 30 consecutive patients who underwent SILC were compared with 30 patients who underwent CLC during the same period. In this study, all operations were performed by one surgeon. In each group, patient characteristics and perioperative data were collected. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the preoperative characteristics. There was no significant difference in the postoperative laboratory result (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase), number of conversion and complication cases, and length of hospital stay. The operation time was significantly longer in the SILC group (78.5 ± 17.8 minutes in SILC group vs. 34.9 ± 5.75 minutes in CLC group, P < 0.0001). The total nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug usage during perioperative period showed significantly higher in SILC groups (162 ± 51 mg in the SILC group vs. 138 ± 30 mg in the CLC group), but there was no statistically significant difference in opioid usage between two groups. The postoperative pain score was significantly higher in the SILC group at second, third, and tenth postoperative day. Satisfaction of postoperative wound showed superiority in SILC group.

115872,Novel bulking agent for faecal incontinence.,2011,"PURPOSE Reconstruction of abdominal wall defects is a challenging problem. Often, the surgeon is presented with a patient having multiple comorbidities, who has already endured numerous unsuccessful operations, leaving skin and fascia that are attenuated and unreliable. Our study investigated preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors and techniques during abdominal wall reconstruction to determine which variables were associated with poor outcomes. METHODS Data were collected on all patients who underwent ventral abdominal hernia repair by 3 senior-level surgeons at our institution during an 8-year period. In all cases, placement of either a synthetic or a biologic mesh was used to provide additional reinforcement of the repair. RESULTS A total of 106 patients were included. Seventy-nine patients (75%) had preoperative comorbid conditions. Sixty-seven patients developed a postoperative complication (63%). Skin necrosis was the most common complication (n = 21, 19.8%). Other complications included seroma (n = 19, 17.9%), cellulitis (n = 19, 17.9%), abscess (n = 14 13.2%), pulmonary embolus/deep vein thrombosis (n = 3, 2.8%), small bowel obstruction (n = 2, 1.9%), and fistula (n = 8, 7.5%). Factors that significantly contributed to postoperative complications (P < 0.05) included obesity, diabetes, hypertension, fistula at the time of the operation, a history of >2 prior hernia repairs, a history of >3 prior abdominal operations, hospital stay for >14 days, defect size > 300 square cm, and the use of human-derived mesh allograft. Factors that significantly increased the likelihood of a hernia recurrence (P < 0.05) included a history of >2 prior hernia repairs, the use of human-derived allograft, using an overlay-only mesh placement, and the presence of a postoperative complication, particularly infection. Hernia recurrences were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) by using a ""sandwich"" repair with both a mesh overlay and underlay and by using component separation. CONCLUSIONS A history of multiple abdominal operations is a major predictor of complications and recurrences. If needed, component separation should be used to achieve primary tension-free closure, which helps to reduce the likelihood of hernia recurrences. Our data suggest that mesh reinforcement used concomitantly in a ""sandwich"" repair with component separation release may lead to reduced recurrence rates and may provide the optimal repair in complex hernia defects.","Satterwhite, Thomas S; Miri, Sara; Chung, Christina; Spain, David; Lorenz, Hermann P; Lee, Gordon K",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0b013e31823b68b1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22421484/,53
116281,A parametric study of occupational radiation dose in interventional radiology by Monte-Carlo simulations.,2020-09-15,"INTRODUCTION In laparoscopy, it often is the case that port sites are enlarged for specimen extraction. This leads to higher risk of trocar site complications, such as infection or incisional hernia. Natural orifice surgery (NOTES) is beneficial for minimizing these complications, and this is emphasized when the extracted specimen is of large volume. We have been using transgastric technique for appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Of these transgastric operations, we focus on the one with relatively large-organ extraction: LSG with transoral remnant extraction (TORE). We describe the details and feasibility of this procedure and compare the outcomes to conventional LSG. METHODS All patients undergoing LSG were considered candidates for TORE and were consented for this procedure if interested after an informed discussion. Eighteen LSGs with TORE (TORE group) and ten conventional LSGs (non-TORE group) were performed from August 2010 to March 2011. We retrospectively compared these two groups for the age, sex, preoperative body mass index, operating room time, hospital stay, excess weight loss (EWL), and trocar site complications. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with TORE consists of conventional LSG and transgastric retrieval of the resected stomach. The procedure exceeds exactly the same manner as conventional LSG until the initial stapling of the stomach. For TORE, the gastrectomy is initiated 5 cm proximal to the pylorus than usual LSG to save the space for the gastrotomy used for specimen retrieval. After the gastrectomy is completed, the full thickness of the distal most part of the staple line is incised open as wide as 2 cm by using electric cautery or ultrasonic dissector. A flexible upper endoscope, which has been in the stomach already as a bougie for gastrectomy, is then guided into the peritoneal cavity through the gastrotomy. The specimen is grasped endoscopically with a snare and extracted transorally. Following this, the gastrotomy is closed laparoscopically. The final shape of the gastric sleeve is identical to the one of conventional LSG. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the TORE and the non-TORE group for patients' profile, operating room time, hospital stay, and EWL. Neither group has experienced perioperative complications. All specimens were extracted readily and safely in the TORE group. Of the ten cases in the non-TORE group, four required extension of the trocar site. No trocar site complications were found in the TORE group, whereas the extended trocar site developed panniculitis in two cases of the non-TORE group; one required panniculectomy for refractory induration. CONCLUSIONS TORE can be safely and easily performed by surgeons with laparoscopic and endoscopic skill, and with commonly available instruments. While producing identical outcomes, our initial experience with the TORE technique demonstrates an advantage over traditional LSG, because it minimizes trocar site complications. Transgastric organ extraction is potentially applicable to other large-organ extractions in laparoscopic surgery without excessive risk or resources. Larger case volume and longer follow-up period is awaited.","Dotai, Takayuki; Coker, Alisa M; Antozzi, Luciano; Acosta, Geylor; Michelotti, Marcos; Bildzukewicz, Nikolai; Sandler, Bryan J; Jacobsen, Garth R; Talamini, Mark A; Horgan, Santiago",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2473-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22806531/,53
116499,The need for a new strategy for Ebola vaccination.,2021-04-05,"IFNs are a family of cytokines that are essential for the antiviral response in vertebrates. Not surprisingly, viruses have adapted to encode virulence factors to cope with the IFN response. Intriguingly, we show here that all three types of interferons, IFN-α, IFN-γ, and IFN-λ, efficiently promote infection by a human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, one of the major etiological agents of common cold, through the induction of IFN-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins. IFITMs typically exert their antiviral function by inhibiting the entry of a broad spectrum of viruses into their host cells, presumably by trapping and degrading invading virions within the endocytic compartments. In contrast, HCoV-OC43 uses IFN-induced human IFITM2 or IFITM3 as an entry factor to facilitate its infection of host cells. Reverse genetics analyses suggest that the structural motifs critical for the IFITM proteins' enhancement of HCoV-OC43 infection are distinct from those required for inhibiting infection by other viruses. We also present evidence showing that IFITM family members work as homo- and hetero-oligomers to modulate virus entry. The observed enhancement of HCoV-OC43 infection by IFNs may underlie the propensity of the virus to invade the lower respiratory tract under inflammatory conditions.","Zhao, Xuesen; Guo, Fang; Liu, Fei; Cuconati, Andrea; Chang, Jinhong; Block, Timothy M; Guo, Ju-Tao",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320856111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24753610/,53

The mesenteric defects of Group A remained completely visible without any closure or adhesion. Multiple gaps were found between the Prolene suture and the mesentery along the suture line in Group B. The mesenteric defects of Group C were complete closed with multiple adhesions of the small intestine and the greater omentum. The mesenteric defects in both Group D and Group E closed completely. The average adhesion scores in Group A and Group B were 0 and 0.33 ± 0.52 respectively. The average adhesion score in group C (3.83 ± 0.41) was higher than the other groups (p<0.05). The average adhesion scores in Group D and E were similar (3.17 ± 0.41 and 3.00 ± 0.00 respectively). CONCLUSION Absorbable suture created a safe adhesion score between the mesentery which was not inferior to non-absorbable sutures.","Yao, Libin; Dolo, Ponnie Robertlee; Shao, Yong; Li, Chao; Widjaja, Jason; Hong, Jian; Zhu, Xiaocheng",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-019-0671-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31924213/,53

These small vesicles are attracting increasing research attention owing to their potential for disease diagnosis and therapy. However, their inherent heterogeneity and the complexity of bio-fluids pose significant challenges for their isolation. Even the ""gold standard,"" differential centrifugation, suffers from poor yields and is time-consuming. In this context, recent developments in microfluidic technologies have provided an ideal system for exosome extraction and these devices exhibit some fascinating properties such as high speeds, good portability, and low sample volumes. In this review, the focus is on the state-of-the-art microfluidic technologies for exosome isolation and highlight potential directions for future research and development by analyzing the challenges faced by the current strategies.","Ding, Lihua; Yang, Xiaonan; Gao, Zibo; Effah, Clement Yaw; Zhang, Xiaoju; Wu, Yongjun; Qu, Lingbo",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202007174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047052/,53

There is controversy regarding whether first-line treatment should be endoscopic therapy with cyanoacrylate glue or placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). We compared these methods on the basis of rebleeding, survival, and complications. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of cirrhotic patients with gastric variceal hemorrhage treated with endoscopic cyanoacrylate therapy or TIPS placement at a single U.S. center from 1997 to 2007. The groups were compared for rebleeding at 72 hours, 3 months, and 1 year; survival rates at 3 months and 1 year; and acute and extended complications and morbidity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS A total of 105 patients were included. There were no significant pretreatment differences between the 2 groups in age, sex, MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score at the time of admission, or cause of liver disease. There were no significant differences in rebleeding at 72 hours, 3 months, and 1 year; survival at 3 months and 1 year; and aggregate long-term survival or acute complications. However, the TIPS group had a higher rate of long-term morbidity requiring hospitalization (41% with a TIPS and 1.6% in the cyanoacrylate arm, P < .0001). LIMITATIONS Retrospective and uncontrolled samples. CONCLUSION In patients with similar characteristics, cyanoacrylate therapy performed as well as a TIPS in controlling and preventing gastric variceal hemorrhage with no significant differences in survival. Patients receiving cyanoacrylate therapy experienced significantly less long-term morbidity related to therapy than patients who received a TIPS. Cyanoacrylate therapy appears to be safe and effective and compares favorably with TIPS therapy.","Procaccini, Nicholas J; Al-Osaimi, Abdullah M S; Northup, Patrick; Argo, Curtis; Caldwell, Stephen H",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2009.03.1169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19559425/,53
117050,Calcium-based nanoparticles accelerate skin wound healing.,2011,"PD-L1 inhibitors are widely used in tumor immunotherapy, but their mechanism in colorectal cancer remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) regulation via the interferon-γ (IFN-γ)/janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling pathway, and its prognostic value in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). A cohort of 181 patients were recruited to determine the association between PD-L1 expression and CRC prognosis; the patients were newly diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma and had also undergone a physical tumorectomy. Immunohistochemical staining and survival analysis were used to evaluate the predictive value of PD-L1 protein expression in CRC. Gene set enrichment analysis, RT-qPCR and western blotting, etc were performed to confirm that PD-L1 is regulated by the IFN-γ/JAK/STAT signaling pathway. PD-L1 up-regulation was more frequently observed in patients with larger tumors, positive vascular or lymphatic infiltration and a poorly differentiated stage in addition to being associated with a poor survival in patients with CRC. Following the stimulation with IFN-γ, PD-L1 expression levels were revealed to be increased via the JAK2/STAT1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicated that the expression levels of PD-L1 may be associated with a poor prognosis in patients with CRC. In addition, the results suggested that the IFN-γ-mediated overexpression of PD-L1 in CRC cells may be regulated by the JAK2/STAT1 signaling pathway.","Zhao, Tiancheng; Li, Yezhou; Zhang, Jiayu; Zhang, Bin",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724352/,53

118129,Pre-Clinical Assessment of Single-Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy During In Vivo Porcine Wound Healing.,2020-07-07,"BACKGROUND Gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinomas are heterogeneous, comprising four molecularly distinct subtypes, namely EBV-positive, microsatellite instability (MSI), chromosomal instability (CIN) and genomically stable (GS) subtypes, and a part of this heterogeneity may hypothesized to be different cells-of-origin. Stem/progenitor cell hierarchy in the stomach is complex, which include the Lgr5(+) gastric stem cells (GSCs). METHODS While previous studies have focused on non-nuclear Lgr5 expression, nuclear Lgr5 expression has been reported in a subset of stem cells, and we examined nuclear Lgr5 expression in a local cohort of 95 cases of gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma. mRNA levels for LGR5 and other stem cell marker genes were examined in the TCGA cohort. RESULTS We observed nuclear Lgr5 expression in a 18/95 cases. Near mutual exclusivity was seen between nuclear Lgr5 and strong non-nuclear Lgr5. Both strong non-nuclear and nuclear Lgr5 expression tended to be seen more frequently with the intestinal histotype and approximated CIN molecular subtype. With respect to overall survival (OS), nuclear Lgr5 expression appears to be protective, with the worst survival being seen in the cases lacking nuclear Lgr5 and with low non-nuclear Lgr5 expression. When compared to other stem/progenitor cell markers, LGR5 mRNA expression clusters with other GSC marker genes, including VIL1. Higher expression of these GSC marker genes was associated with better OS. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that Lgr5 expression is dynamic in gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma and heterogeneous across the several disease attributes. We postulate that this may reflect ""retained stemness"" in the form of Lgr5High-GSC signature that appears to be associated with better survival.","Yoon, Ju-Yoon; Brezden-Masley, Christine; Streutker, Catherine J",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-07362-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894084/,53

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a multi-viral microbiological POCT for suspected respiratory tract infections (RTIs). METHODS In this observational, mixed-methods feasibility study practices were provided with a POCT machine for any patient aged ≥3 months with suspected RTI. Dual throat/nose swabs tested for 17 respiratory viruses and three atypical bacteria, 65 minutes per sample. RESULTS Twenty clinicians recruited 93 patients (estimated 1:3 of all RTI cases). Patient's median age was 29, 57% female, and 44% with co-morbidities. Pre-test diagnoses: upper RTI (48%); lower RTI (30%); viral/influenza-like illness (18%); other (4%). Median set-up time was 2.72 minutes, with 72% swabs processed <4 hours, 90% <24 hours. Tests detected ≥1 virus in 58%, no pathogen 37% and atypical bacteria 2% (3% inconclusive). Antibiotics were prescribed pre-test to 35% of patients with no pathogen detected and 25% with a virus. Post-test diagnoses changed in 20%, and diagnostic certainty increased (P = 0.02), more so when the test was positive rather than negative (P < 0.001). Clinicians predicted decreased antibiotic benefit post-test (P = 0.02). Interviews revealed the POCT has clear potential, was easy to use and well-liked, but limited by time-to-result and the absence of testing for typical respiratory bacteria. CONCLUSIONS This POCT was acceptable and appeared to influence clinical reasoning. Clinicians wanted faster time-to-results and more information about bacteria. Randomized trials are needed to understand the safety, efficacy and patient perceptions of these POCTs.","Khalid, Tanzeela Y; Duncan, Lorna J; Thornton, Hannah V; Lasseter, Gemma; Muir, Peter; Toney, Zara Abigail; Hay, Alastair D",Family practice,https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmab002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33684208/,53

119335,[A cloaked caged glutamate for in vivo optical activation of synapses].,2021,"PURPOSE A laparoscopic appendectomy is now commonly performed. The push in recent years toward reducing the number of ports required to perform this surgery has led to the development of a single-port laparoscopic appendectomy (SPA). We compared postoperative pain after an SPA using a glove port with a percutaneous organ-holding device (group 1) with that of an SPA using a commercially-available multichannel single-port device (group 2). METHODS Between March 2010 and July 2011, a retrospective study was conducted of a total of 77 patients who underwent an SPA by three surgeons at department of surgery, Kangbuk Samsung Medical Center. Thirty-eight patients received an SPA using a glove port with a percutaneous organ-holding device. The other 39 patients received an SPA using a commercially-available multichannel single port (Octo-Port or SILS Port). Operative details and postoperative outcomes were collected and evaluated. RESULTS There were no differences in the mean operative times, times to pass gas, postoperative hospital stays, or cosmetic satisfaction scores between the two groups. The pain score in the first 24 hours after surgery was higher in group 2 than group 1 patients (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the trocar used in group 2 was more expensive than that used in group 1. CONCLUSION An SPA using a glove port with a percutaneous organ-holding device was associated with a lower pain score during the first 24 hours after surgery because of the shorter fascia incision length and a cheaper cost than an SPA using a commercially-available multichannel single-port device.","Lee, Jieun; Lee, Sung Ryol; Kim, Hyung Ook; Son, Byung Ho; Choi, Wonjun",Annals of coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.3393/ac.2014.30.1.42; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24639970/,53
119456,A Tribute to Professor George M. Whitesides.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Selection of the PEEP associated with the best compliance of the respiratory system during decremental PEEP titration can be used for the treatment of patients suffering from ARDS. We describe changes in transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) and gas exchange during a decremental PEEP titration maneuver in subjects with pulmonary ARDS. METHODS Eleven subjects with early ARDS were included. After a recruitment maneuver they were ventilated in volume-controlled ventilation and PEEP was decreased from 30 to 0 cm H2O by steps of 3 cm H2O. Static airway pressure (Paw), esophageal pressure (Pes), Ptp (Paw - Pes), the ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT), and PaO2 were recorded at each step. RESULTS A linear correlation was found between Paw and Ptp. Expiratory Ptp became negative in all subjects when PEEP decreased below 8.9 ± 5.2 cm H2O. VD/VT was 0.67 ± 0.06 with 30 cm H2O of PEEP, and decreased 15.4 ± 8.5% during the maneuver, when PEEP and expiratory Ptp were 10.6 ± 4.1 cm H2O and 1.2 ± 2.8 cm H2O, respectively. VD/VT was significantly higher during ventilation at high (> 18 cm H2O), compared to low, inspiratory Ptp values (P < .001). PaO2 decreased when expiratory Ptp became negative (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS During decremental PEEP titration we sequentially observed high inspiratory Ptp that stressed lung tissue and increased VD/VT, and negative Ptp, indicating high risk of alveolar collapse, explaining worse oxygenation. PEEP selection based on Ptp and VD/VT in ARDS may help to avoid these situations.","Rodriguez, Pablo O; Bonelli, Ignacio; Setten, Mariano; Attie, Shiry; Madorno, Matias; Maskin, Luis P; Valentini, Ricardo",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23051849/,53

AIM Summarize the most relevant data from a literature systematic review on the impact on youths' physical health of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic. METHODS Authors of the original review searched on 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS Forty-two studies reporting the impact on physical health have been finally included. They have been conducted in 14 countries, most of which in Italy (30.9%) and UK (30.9%). The majority were cohort studies (40.5%) and the overall methodological quality, irrespective of study designs, was high for the 71.4% of the studies. Twenty-seven studies assessed the impact on health services utilization, whose results showed a relevant reduction of Emergency Departments accesses (64%-89.3%) and hospital admissions (31%-85%); however, an increase of acute cases was observed together with delayed admission. An important reduction of vaccine services utilization was also noted during the first period of lockdown. Domestic accidents and head trauma for suspected domestic violence increased. Health related behaviours worsened, with a relevant increase of screen time (mean of 2.9 hours to 5.1 hours), an important reduction of physical activity (up to 64%). Finally, sleep problems and increase of food consumption, particularly the unhealthy food were reported. CONCLUSIONS Relevant negative effects of school closure and social distances measures have observed. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of closures implemented for relatively short periods. If school closure and rigid social distances measures imposition will extend for a long time, an even more pronounced negative effect can be expected. In the context of health policies, in addition to the potential benefits of school closures and social distancing measures on the containment of infection, the potential damage on the physical health of young people should be taken into account by implementing policies to safeguard their health.","Saulle, Rosella; Minozzi, Silvia; Amato, Laura; Davoli, Marina",Recenti progressi in medicina,https://doi.org/10.1701/3608.35872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003187/,53

Of HEV's three ORFs, the function of ORF3 has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that via homophilic interactions ORF3 forms multimeric complexes associated with intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranes. HEV ORF3 shares several structural features with class I viroporins, and the function of HEV ORF3 can be maintained by replacing it with the well-characterized viroporin influenza A virus (IAV) matrix-2 protein. ORF3's ion channel function is further evidenced by its ability to mediate ionic currents when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Furthermore, we identified several positions in ORF3 critical for its formation of multimeric complexes, ion channel activity, and, ultimately, release of infectious particles. Collectively, our data demonstrate a previously undescribed function of HEV ORF3 as a viroporin, which may serve as an attractive target in developing direct-acting antivirals.","Ding, Qiang; Heller, Brigitte; Capuccino, Juan M V; Song, Bokai; Nimgaonkar, Ila; Hrebikova, Gabriela; Contreras, Jorge E; Ploss, Alexander",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1614955114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28096411/,53

Deep learning methods are promising in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images. Most of these works first train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an existing large-scale chest x-ray image dataset and then fine-tune the model on the newly collected COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset, often at a much smaller scale. However, simple fine-tuning may lead to poor performance due to two issues, firstly the large domain shift present in chest x-ray datasets and secondly the relatively small scale of the COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset. In an attempt to address these issues, we formulate the problem of COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification in a semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting and propose a novel domain adaptation method, Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network (SODA). SODA is designed to align the data distributions across different domains in the general domain space and also in the common subspace of source and target data. In our experiments, SODA achieves a leading classification performance compared with recent state-of-the-art models in separating COVID-19 with common pneumonia. We also present results showing that SODA produces better pathology localizations.","Zhou, Jieli; Jing, Baoyu; Wang, Zeya; Xin, Hongyi; Tong, Hanghang",IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcbb.2021.3066331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729944/,53

In the pre-cancerous state of cirrhosis, there is an accumulation of neoantigens that may be specifically targetable through immunotherapy. We asked if immune checkpoint inhibition could prevent tumorigenesis in a mouse model of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced HCC. We found that initiation of anti-PD-1 therapy prior to tumorigenesis could prevent up to 46% of liver tumors. This significant reduction in tumor burden was accompanied by infiltration of CD4+ T helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells into the liver parenchyma. Importantly, Anti-PD-1 therapy did not exacerbate liver dysfunction or worsen overall health in this liver disease model. Given the safety and preservation of quality of life observed with long-term immunotherapy use, an immunotherapy chemoprevention strategy is likely associated with a low risk-to-benefit ratio and high value care in select patients. These results encourage a prevention trial in cirrhotic patients with the highest risk of developing HCC.","Chung, Andrew S; Mettlen, Marcel; Ganguly, Debolina; Lu, Tianshi; Wang, Tao; Brekken, Rolf A; Hsiehchen, David; Zhu, Hao",Cancer prevention research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1940-6207.capr-20-0200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839204/,53

A group of 10 patients who previously underwent simple nephrectomies by 1 of the 2 surgeons were selected for comparison. The intraoperative and postoperative narcotic analgesia requirements were compared between the 2 groups. The Student t test was used to compare the means. All complications, clinical data, and technical issues with performing the procedure were noted. RESULTS All LESS simple nephrectomy procedures were completed uneventfully. There were no intraoperative complications in the LESS group. Postoperative complications included pyrexia and port site bruising with 2 patients. Operative time showed no significant difference in the LESS group compared to the traditional laparoscopic group (151 vs 165 minutes).

123134,Responding to Unexpected Crises - The Role of Surgical Leadership.,2020-10-14,"BACKGROUND Anesthesia in lactating women is frequently indicated for time-sensitive procedures such as postpartum tubal ligation. Ketamine and diazepam are two of the most commonly used anesthetic agents in low resource settings, but their safety profile in lactating women has not been established. METHODS Medical records of post-partum tubal ligations between 2013 and 2018 at clinics of the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit were reviewed for completeness of key outcome variables. Logistic regression identified presence or absence of associations between drug doses and adverse neonatal outcomes: clinically significant weight loss (≥95th percentile) and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy. RESULTS Of 358 records reviewed, 298 were lactating women with singleton, term neonates. There were no severe outcomes in mothers or neonates. On the first postoperative day 98.0% (290/296) of neonates were reported to be breastfeeding well and 6.4% (19/298) had clinically significant weight loss. Phototherapy was required for 13.8% (41/298) of neonates. There was no association between either of the outcomes and increasing ketamine doses (up to 3.8 mg/kg), preoperative oral diazepam (5 mg), or increasing lidocaine doses (up to 200 mg). Preoperative oral diazepam resulted in lower doses of intraoperative anesthetics. Doses of intravenous diazepam above 0.1 mg/kg were associated with increased risk (adjusted odds ratio per 0.1 mg/kg increase, 95%CI) of weight loss (1.95, 95%CI 1.13-3.35, p = 0.016) and jaundice requiring phototherapy (1.87, 95%CI 1.11-3.13, p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS In resource-limited settings ketamine use appears safe in lactating women and uninterrupted breastfeeding should be encouraged and supported. Preoperative oral diazepam may help reduce intraoperative anesthetic doses, but intravenous diazepam should be used with caution and avoided in high doses in lactating women.","Gilder, Mary Ellen; Tun, Nay Win; Carter, Annabelle; Tan, Ferdinand Frederik Som Ling; Min, Aung Myat; Eh, Hsa; Aye, Pan; Carrara, Verena I; Angkurawaranon, Chaisiri; McGready, Rose",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-03610-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33563234/,53

As of now, approximately 0.15 million people around the globe are infected with the novel coronavirus. In the last decade, two strains of the coronavirus family, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV also resulted in epidemics in south Asian and the Middle Eastern countries with high mortality rate. This scenario demands the development of a putative vaccine which may provide immunity against all current and new evolving coronavirus strains. In this study, we design an epitope-based vaccine using an immunoinformatic approach. This vaccine may protect against all coronavirus strains. The vaccine is developed by considering the geographical distribution of coronavirus strains and host genetics (Chinese population). Nine experimentally validated epitopes sequences from coronavirus strains were used to derive the variants considering the conservancy in all strains. Further, the binding affinities of all derived variants were checked with most abundant HLA alleles in the Chinese population. Three MHC class-I epitopes from Spike glycoprotein and Nucleoprotein showed sufficient binding while one MHC class-II epitope from Spike glycoprotein found to be an effective binder. A cocktail of these epitopes gave more than 95% population coverage in the Chinese population. Moreover, MD simulation also supported the above-mentioned predictions. Further, in vivo studies are needed to confirm the immunogenic potential of these vaccines. This article is protected by copyright.

This report describes 2 children with MIS-C who were initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome but who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. CASE REPORT Case 1. A 7-year-old boy with fever, cough, and dyspnea was treated with oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, and methylprednisolone and showed a worsening of clinical conditions, persistent fever, hypotension, and hematological parameters compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Three intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) were followed by a progressive resolution. Case 2. A 14-year-old girl with syncope, fever, diarrhea, oliguria, and increased creatinine levels required fluid infusion and correction of electrolyte imbalance. The increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was associated with grade I atrioventricular block and pericardial effusion. The patient showed myositis and severe muscular weakness, with hematological parameters compatible with MIS-C. She started IVIG and 3 intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone. However, bradycardia, tachypnea, severe hypotension, loss of consciousness, oliguria, bilateral ground-glass pneumonia, bilateral pleural, and peritoneal effusion, in the absence of thromboembolism, required treatment with furosemide, albumin, and enoxaparin, and was followed by a prompt resolution. CONCLUSIONS These 2 pediatric cases highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in all patients with acute symptoms and signs of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, cases of MIS-C can become more prevalent, and pediatricians should be aware of diagnostic and management guidelines.","Giordano, Salvatore; Failla, Maria Concetta; Li Cavoli, Maria Grazia; Romano, Domenico; Vanella, Veronica; Caruso, Chiara; Chillura, Ilenia; Maggio, Maria Cristina",The American journal of case reports,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.931570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34635631/,53

METHODS Viral metagenomics and general PCR methods were used to detected viral nucleic acid in the samples from a diseased and healthy giant pandas. RESULTS A novel polyomavirus, the giant panda polyomavirus 1 (GPPyV1) from the nasal cavity of a dead giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) was characterized. The GPPyV1 genome is 5144 bp in size and reveals five putative open-reading frames coding for the classic small and large T antigens in the early region, and the VP1, VP2 and VP3 capsid proteins in the late region. Phylogenetic analyses of the large T antigen of the GPPyV1 indicated GPPyV1 belonged to a putative new species within genus Deltapolyomavirus, clustering with four human polyomavirus species. The GPPyV1 VP1 and VP2 clustered with genus Alphapolyomavirus. Our epidemiologic study indicated that this novel polyomavirus was also detected in nasal swabs and fecal samples collected from captive healthy giant pandas. CONCLUSION A novel polyomavirus was detected in giant pandas and its complete genome was characterized, which may cause latency infection in giant pandas.","Qi, Dunwu; Shan, Tongling; Liu, Zhijian; Deng, Xutao; Zhang, Zhihe; Bi, Wenlei; Owens, Jacob Robert; Feng, Feifei; Zheng, Lisong; Huang, Feng; Delwart, Eric; Hou, Rong; Zhang, Wen",Virology journal,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0867-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29078783/,53

We show that multivalent biologics, engineered using carbohydrate-binding modules specific for sialic acid, mask the cell-surface receptor recognized by the influenza virus and protect mice from a lethal challenge with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. The most promising biologic protects mice when given as a single 1-μg intranasal dose 7 d in advance of viral challenge. There also is sufficient virus replication to establish an immune response, potentially protecting the animal from future exposure to the virus. Furthermore, the biologics appear to stimulate inflammatory mediators, and this stimulation may contribute to their protective ability. Our results suggest that this host-targeted approach could provide a front-line prophylactic that has the potential to protect against any current and future influenza virus and possibly against other respiratory pathogens that use sialic acid as a receptor.","Connaris, Helen; Govorkova, Elena A; Ligertwood, Yvonne; Dutia, Bernadette M; Yang, Lei; Tauber, Sandra; Taylor, Margaret A; Alias, Nadiawati; Hagan, Robert; Nash, Anthony A; Webster, Robert G; Taylor, Garry L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1404205111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24733924/,53

Ineffective clearance of Bpm by antibiotics is believed to be due to persistence, a hibernation-like survival mechanism modulated, in part, by toxin-antitoxin systems (TAS). Several organisms possess a repertoire of TASs but defining environmental cues eliciting their activity is hindered by laborious in vitro experiments, especially when there are many toxins with redundant function. Here, we identified which of 103 proteins in Bpm that share features found in toxins of the TAS and repurposed transcriptional data to identify which ones play a role in surviving intracellular host defenses. Putative toxins with the strongest transcriptional response were found to have low conservation between Bpm strains, while toxins that were constitutively expressed were highly conserved. Further examination of highly conserved toxins BPSS0899, BPSS1321, and BPSL1494 showed that they were functional, and their mutation led to reduce survival within macrophages and reduced in vivo persistence-associated pathology (abscesses) during treatment, but did not affect macrophages persistence. These findings highlight the utility of a data-driven approach to select putative toxins and suggests a selective role for some TAS in host survival.","Ross, Brittany N; Thiriot, Joseph D; Wilson, Shane M; Torres, Alfredo G",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73887-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33037311/,53
125501,In the Midst of Two Realities.,2020-10-27,"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to deferral of many non-urgent procedures in most healthcare systems worldwide. With this study we aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on interventional treatment of structural heart disease (SHD) in Italy. METHODS Numbers of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), percutaneous mitral valve repair (PMVR), left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO), patent foramen ovale (PFO) closures performed over a 4-week period during the national lockdown in Italian centers performing over 60 structural heart interventions (SHI)/year were compared with the same 4-week period in 2019. Incidence rate reductions (IRR) were estimated by zero-inflated negative binomial regression. RESULTS According to our nationwide analysis, SHIs were reduced by 79% as compared to the same period in 2019 (IRR 0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.29). This reduction was more substantial for PFO closure (IRR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.07), LAAO (IRR 0.11, 95% CI 0.05-0.25) and PMVR (IRR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.36) as compared to TAVR (IRR 0.31, 95% CI 0.22-0.47). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic caused a 79% drop in SHI volumes in Italy. PFO closure, LAAO and PMVR decreased more significantly as compared to TAVR. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of this reduction on outcomes of patients with SHD.","Tarantini, Giuseppe; Nai Fovino, Luca; Scotti, Andrea; Marchese, Alfredo; Berti, Sergio; Saia, Francesco; Gregori, Dario; Chieffo, Alaide; Musumeci, Giuseppe; Esposito, Giovanni",Giornale italiano di cardiologia,https://doi.org/10.1714/3487.34672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33295334/,53

125851,"Anterior eye shape in emmetropes, low to moderate myopes, and high myopes.",2020-08-20,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common vector-borne viral disease with nearly 400 million worldwide infections each year concentrated in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Severe dengue complications are often associated with a secondary heterotypic infection of one of the four circulating serotypes. In this scenario, humoral immune responses targeting cross-reactive, poorly-neutralizing epitopes can lead to increased infectivity of susceptible cells via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In this way, antibodies produced in response to infection or vaccination are capable of contributing to enhanced disease in subsequent infections. Currently, there are no available therapeutics to combat DENV disease, and there is an urgent need for a safe and efficacious vaccine. Here, we developed a nucleotide-modified mRNA vaccine encoding for the membrane and envelope structural proteins from DENV serotype 1 encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (prM/E mRNA-LNP). Vaccination of mice elicited robust antiviral immune responses comparable to viral infection with high levels of neutralizing antibody titers and antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Immunocompromised AG129 mice vaccinated with the prM/E mRNA-LNP vaccine were protected from a lethal DENV challenge. Vaccination with either a wild-type vaccine, or a vaccine with mutations in the immunodominant fusion-loop epitope, elicited equivalent humoral and cell mediated immune responses. Neutralizing antibodies elicited by the vaccine were sufficient to protect against a lethal challenge. Both vaccine constructs demonstrated serotype specific immunity with minimal serum cross-reactivity and reduced ADE compared to a live DENV1 viral infection.IMPORTANCEWith 400 million worldwide infections each year, dengue is the most common vector-born viral disease. 40% of the world's population is at risk with dengue experiencing consistent geographic spread over the years. With no therapeutics available and vaccines performing sub optimally, the need for an effective dengue vaccine is urgent. Here we develop and characterize a novel mRNA vaccine encoding for the dengue serotype 1 envelope and premembrane structural proteins that is delivered via a lipid nanoparticle. Our DENV1 prM/E mRNA-LNP vaccine induces neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses in immunocompetent mice and protects an immunocompromised mouse from a lethal DENV challenge. Existing antibodies against dengue can enhance subsequent infections via antibody-dependent enhancement. Importantly our vaccine only induced serotype specific immune responses and did not induce ADE.","Wollner, Clayton J; Richner, Michelle; Hassert, Mariah A; Pinto, Amelia K; Brien, James D; Richner, Justin M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02482-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762420/,53
125893,In-plane uniaxial pressure-induced out-of-plane antiferromagnetic moment and critical fluctuations in BaFe2As2.,2020-11-12,"OBJECTIVE Intrahospital transports (IHTs) of neurosurgical intensive care unit (NICU) patients can be hazardous. Increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) and/or decreasing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) as well as cardiopulmonary alterations are common complications of an IHTs, which can lead to secondary brain injury. This study was performed to assess several serum biomarkers concerning their potential to improve safety of IHTs in mechanically ventilated NICU patients. METHODS All IHTs of mechanically ventilated and sedated NICU patients from 03/2017 to 01/2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Intracranial pressure and CPP measurements were performed in all patients. Serum hemoglobin, hematocrit, and serum sodium were defined as serum biomarkers. Demographic data, computed tomography scan on admission, Simplified Acute Physiology Score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, modified Rankin Scale, indication and consequence of IHTs were analyzed. Alteration of ICP/CPP, hemodynamic and pulmonary events were defined as complications. The study population was stratified into patients with the occurrence of a complication and absence of a complication. RESULTS We analyzed a total number of 184 IHTs in 70 NICU patients with an overall complication rate of 57.6%. Of all, 32.1% IHTs had no direct therapeutic consequence. In patients with higher hemoglobin values prior to IHT less complications occurred, concerning ICP (P = .001), CPP (P = .001), hemodynamic (P = .005), and pulmonary (P < .0001) events. In addition, complications concerning ICP (P = .001), CPP (P = .001), hemodynamic (P = .005), and pulmonary problems (P = .002) were significantly lower in patients with higher hematocrit values before IHT. CONCLUSION Intrahospital transports of mechanically ventilated NICU patients carry a high risk of increased ICP and hemodynamic complications and should be performed restrictively. Higher values of hemoglobin and hematocrit prior to IHT were associated with less complications with regard to ICP, CPP as well as hemodynamic and pulmonary events and could be helpful to assess the potential risk of complications prior to IHTs.","Bender, Michael; Stein, Marco; Kim, Seong Woong; Uhl, Eberhard; Schöller, Karsten",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066619891063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31777310/,53

127241,"A cross-platform informatics system for the Gut Cell Atlas: integrating clinical, anatomical and histological data.",2021,"BACKGROUND Considerable technical variation exists when performing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). However, little is known about which techniques are associated with optimal outcomes. OBJECTIVE To compare technical variation among surgeons with the lowest complication rates and whose patients achieved the most weight loss. METHODS Practicing bariatric surgeons (n = 30) voluntarily submitted a video of a typical LSG performed between 2015 and 2016. Technique-specific data captured from videos and a questionnaire included bougie size, stapler vendor, number of staple loads, use of staple line reinforcement, fibrin sealant, intraoperative leak test, endoscopy, and drain placement. Surgeon-specific outcomes were obtained from cases performed by surgeons during the study period (n = 7023) using a state-wide bariatric-specific data registry. Surgeons were ranked based on 30-day risk-adjusted surgical complication rates (""safety"") and excess body weight loss (EBWL) % (""efficacy"") at 1 year after surgery. Technique-specific variables were compared between surgeons ranked in the top and bottom quartile for both safety and efficacy. RESULTS Surgical complication rates ranged from 0 to 4.32% while EBWL varied from 45.3 to 65.3%. There was no correlation between surgeon rankings for safety and efficacy (Pearson's r = 0.063, p = 0.741). Surgeons ranked in the top quartile for safety and efficacy had significantly shorter mean operative times than surgeons ranked in the bottom quartile (65 min vs. 69 min, p < 0.0001). Surgeons with the highest leak rates were more likely to use buttressing (85.7% vs 40.0%, p = 0.032), otherwise operative techniques varied considerably. CONCLUSIONS Technical variation appears to have minimal effect on the safety or efficacy of sleeve gastrectomy among surgeons participating in a state-wide quality improvement collaborative. Top ranked surgeons did have faster mean operative times indicating that there may be other metrics of technical quality that correlate to optimal outcomes.","Varban, Oliver A; Thumma, Jyothi R; Finks, Jonathan F; Carlin, Arthur M; Kemmeter, Paul R; Ghaferi, Amir A; Dimick, Justin B",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6382-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30112611/,53

However, quantitative evaluation of the reflux has hardly been performed. The aim of this study was to clarify the superiority of the double-flap technique of LAPG with esophagogastrostomy compared with the OrVil technique in terms of preventing gastroesophageal reflux. METHODS A total of 40 and 51 patients who underwent LAPG with esophagogastrostomy using the double-flap and OrVil techniques, respectively, for upper one-third gastric cancer were included in this study. Of these, 22 and 13 patients in the double-flap and OrVil groups, respectively, consented to undergo a 24-h impedance-pH monitoring test at 3 months postoperatively. Postoperative complications, including gastroesophageal reflux and anastomotic stricture, were assessed retrospectively. RESULTS No significant differences were observed in the patients' background between both groups, except for a higher D1+ dissection rate observed in double-flap group than in the OrVil group (93% vs 25%, P < 0.001). Operative time was significantly longer in the double-flap group than in the OrVil group (353 min vs 280 min, P < 0.001). All reflux % time was significantly lower in the double-flap group than in the OrVil group (1.29% vs 2.62%, P = 0.043). On the other hand, the proportion of anastomotic stricture requiring endoscopic balloon dilatation was lower in the double-flap group than in the OrVil group but without statistical significance (18% vs 27%; P = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS Despite its longer operative time and still relatively high anastomotic stricture rate, the double-flap technique would be better than the OrVil technique in terms of preventing gastroesophageal reflux in patients who underwent LAPG with esophagogastrostomy.","Hosoda, Kei; Washio, Marie; Mieno, Hiroaki; Moriya, Hiromitsu; Ema, Akira; Ushiku, Hideki; Watanabe, Masahiko; Yamashita, Keishi",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-018-1743-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612151/,53

The claim that outgroups suffer dehumanization is near ubiquitous in the social sciences. We challenge the most prominent psychological model of dehumanization - infrahumanization theory - which holds outgroup members are subtly dehumanized by being denied human emotions. We examine the theory across seven intergroup contexts in thirteen pre-registered and highly powered experiments (N = 1690). We find outgroup members are not denied uniquely human emotions relative to ingroup members. Rather, they are ascribed prosocial emotions to a lesser extent but antisocial emotions to a greater extent. Apparent evidence for infrahumanization is better explained by ingroup preference, outgroup derogation and stereotyping. Infrahumanization theory may obscure more than it reveals about intergroup bias.","Enock, Florence E; Tipper, Steven P; Over, Harriet",Cognition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2021.104865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358774/,53

This information is vital to develop targeted strategies to improve the health of diverse migrant communities. We did a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019157473; Jan 1, 2000, to May 22, 2020) adhering to PRISMA guidelines, to identify studies on vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks (measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, hepatitis A, varicella, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae) involving migrants residing in the EU/EEA and Switzerland. We identified 45 studies, reporting on 47 distinct vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks across 13 countries. Most reported outbreaks involving migrants were of measles (n=24; 6496 cases), followed by varicella (n=11; 505 cases), hepatitis A (n=7; 1356 cases), rubella (n=3; 487 cases), and mumps (n=2; 293 cases). 19 (40%) outbreaks, predominantly varicella and measles, were reported in temporary refugee camps or shelters. Of 11 varicella outbreaks, nine (82%) were associated with adult migrants. Half of measles outbreaks (n=11) were associated with migrants from eastern European countries. In conclusion, migrants are involved in vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks in Europe, with adult and child refugees residing in shelters or temporary camps at particular risk, alongside specific nationality groups. Vulnerability varies by disease, setting, and demographics, highlighting the importance of tailoring catch-up vaccination interventions to specific groups in order to meet regional and global vaccination targets as recommended by the new Immunisation Agenda 2030 framework for action. A better understanding of vaccine access and intent in migrant groups and a greater focus on co-designing interventions is urgently needed, with direct implications for COVID-19 vaccine delivery.","Deal, Anna; Halliday, Rae; Crawshaw, Alison F; Hayward, Sally E; Burnard, Amelia; Rustage, Kieran; Carter, Jessica; Mehrotra, Anushka; Knights, Felicity; Campos-Matos, Ines; Majeed, Azeem; Friedland, Jon S; Edelstein, Michael; Mounier-Jack, Sandra; Hargreaves, Sally",The Lancet.

As this public health emergency endures, family therapists must continue to engage in TBH practice professionally and ethically. The rapid adoption of TBH with minimal training and experience during this public health emergency can result in crises for both individual therapists as well as for the profession in implementing electronic record-keeping, conducting virtual sessions, and communicating online with various clinical populations. The risk of insufficient training and supervision create a challenge to new and experienced family therapists.

128588,Synthesis of α-Heteroaryl Propionic Esters by Palladium-Catalyzed α-Heteroarylation of Silyl Ketene Acetals.,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND It is widely acknowledged that health policy and management decisions rarely reflect research evidence. Therefore, it is important to determine how to improve evidence-informed decision-making. The primary aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of research implementation strategies for promoting evidence-informed policy and management decisions in healthcare. The secondary aim of the review was to describe factors perceived to be associated with effective strategies and the inter-relationship between these factors. METHODS An electronic search was developed to identify studies published between January 01, 2000, and February 02, 2016. This was supplemented by checking the reference list of included articles, systematic reviews, and hand-searching publication lists from prominent authors. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. RESULTS After duplicate removal, the search strategy identified 3830 titles. Following title and abstract screening, 96 full-text articles were reviewed, of which 19 studies (21 articles) met all inclusion criteria. Three studies were included in the narrative synthesis, finding policy briefs including expert opinion might affect intended actions, and intentions persisting to actions for public health policy in developing nations. Workshops, ongoing technical assistance, and distribution of instructional digital materials may improve knowledge and skills around evidence-informed decision-making in US public health departments. Tailored, targeted messages were more effective in increasing public health policies and programs in Canadian public health departments compared to messages and a knowledge broker. Sixteen studies (18 articles) were included in the thematic synthesis, leading to a conceptualisation of inter-relating factors perceived to be associated with effective research implementation strategies. A unidirectional, hierarchal flow was described from (1) establishing an imperative for practice change, (2) building trust between implementation stakeholders and (3) developing a shared vision, to (4) actioning change mechanisms. This was underpinned by the (5) employment of effective communication strategies and (6) provision of resources to support change. CONCLUSIONS Evidence is developing to support the use of research implementation strategies for promoting evidence-informed policy and management decisions in healthcare. The design of future implementation strategies should be based on the inter-relating factors perceived to be associated with effective strategies.

The initial high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images of seven patients with diagnosed COVID-19 in the Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University, China, were collected and analyzed. The study showed that all patients had close contact with COVID-19 patient and presented with fever. The initial white blood cell counts of all patients were normal. The percentage of lymphocytes decreased in three patients. In all seven patients with COVID-19, ground glass opacity (GGO) was found in the HRCT images, mainly distributed in the subpleural region of the lungs. The HRCT scans of six patients showed bilateral lobar lesions, mainly peripheral subpleural distribution; one patients showed unilateral lobar involvement. The right lung was more extensively involved than the left lung in six patients, and the lower lobe was more extensively involved than the upper lobe in five patients. The initial chest HRCT images of the lungs of COVID-19 patients had specific characteristics; the typical manifestations of the bilateral lungs showed extensive GGO-type infiltrate, with thickened vascular bundles and focal center consolidation.

These patients often rapidly deteriorate, leading to death. We aim to evaluate end-of-life laboratory values time trends among deceased long-term inpatients. METHODS Time-stamped laboratory data for adult inpatients who had died in the hospital were extracted. The data were normalized and time-series analysis was performed. The patients were also clustered based on the laboratory result trends. RESULTS Laboratory results from 257 patients were evaluated. Significant time trends were observed: serum urea nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and potassium increased while platelets and albumin decreased. Most patients showed significant shifts in at least four major laboratory indices within the last week of life. CONCLUSIONS In the last week of life in chronically hospitalized patients, an alteration of the physiologic state of the patient occurs that manifests as subtle changes in metabolite levels compared with the patient's baseline.","Boroujeni, Amir Momeni; Yousefi, Elham; Zuretti, Alejandro",American journal of clinical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqy163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30689683/,53
129535,Attention and capacity limits in perception: A cellular metabolism account.,2020-07-24,"TAR-DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy is seen in multiple brain diseases. A standardized terminology was recommended recently for common age-related TDP-43 proteinopathy: limbic-predominant, age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and the underlying neuropathological changes, LATE-NC. LATE-NC may be co-morbid with Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes (ADNC). However, there currently are ill-defined diagnostic classification issues among LATE-NC, ADNC, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). A practical challenge is that different autopsy cohorts are composed of disparate groups of research volunteers: hospital- and clinic-based cohorts are enriched for FTLD-TDP cases, whereas community-based cohorts have more LATE-NC cases. Neuropathological methods also differ across laboratories. Here, we combined both cases and neuropathologists' diagnoses from two research centres-University of Pennsylvania and University of Kentucky. The study was designed to compare neuropathological findings between FTLD-TDP and pathologically severe LATE-NC. First, cases were selected from the University of Pennsylvania with pathological diagnoses of either FTLD-TDP (n = 33) or severe LATE-NC (mostly stage 3) with co-morbid ADNC (n = 30). Sections from these University of Pennsylvania cases were cut from amygdala, anterior cingulate, superior/mid-temporal, and middle frontal gyrus. These sections were stained for phospho-TDP-43 immunohistochemically and evaluated independently by two University of Kentucky neuropathologists blinded to case data. A simple set of criteria hypothesized to differentiate FTLD-TDP from LATE-NC was generated based on density of TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the neocortical regions. Criteria-based sensitivity and specificity of differentiating severe LATE-NC from FTLD-TDP cases with blind evaluation was ∼90%. Another proposed neuropathological feature related to TDP-43 proteinopathy in aged individuals is 'Alpha' versus 'Beta' in amygdala. Alpha and Beta status was diagnosed by neuropathologists from both universities (n = 5 raters). There was poor inter-rater reliability of Alpha/Beta classification (mean κ = 0.31). We next tested a separate cohort of cases from University of Kentucky with either FTLD-TDP (n = 8) or with relatively 'pure' severe LATE-NC (lacking intermediate or severe ADNC; n = 14). The simple criteria were applied by neuropathologists blinded to the prior diagnoses at University of Pennsylvania. Again, the criteria for differentiating LATE-NC from FTLD-TDP was effective, with sensitivity and specificity ∼90%. If more representative cases from each cohort (including less severe TDP-43 proteinopathy) had been included, the overall accuracy for identifying LATE-NC was estimated at >98% for both cohorts. Also across both cohorts, cases with FTLD-TDP died younger than those with LATE-NC (P < 0.0001). We conclude that in most cases, severe LATE-NC and FTLD-TDP can be differentiated by applying simple neuropathological criteria.","Robinson, John L; Porta, Sílvia; Garrett, Filip G; Zhang, Panpan; Xie, Sharon X; Suh, EunRan; Van Deerlin, Vivianna M; Abner, Erin L; Jicha, Gregory A; Barber, Justin M; Lee, Virginia M-Y; Lee, Edward B; Trojanowski, John Q; Nelson, Peter T",Brain : a journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830216/,53
129593,A critical review on sulfur reduction of aqueous selenite: Mechanisms and applications.,2021-08-08,"OBJECTIVE To synthesize and summarize the studies examining the correlates and predictors of anxiety in older adults living in residential aged care. METHODS Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, five electronic databases were searched using key terms and subject headings, as well as reference lists of relevant papers. The search was limited to peer-reviewed literature published in English. Eligible studies examined the association between at least one correlate/factor and anxiety disorders or symptoms in aged care residents aged 50+ years. RESULTS A total of 3741 articles were identified, of which 34 studies (with a total of 1 543 554 participants) were included in this review. Correlates associated with anxiety included pain, use of anti-depressants/lithium, depression, and lower perceived quality of life. Less consistent and/or less studied variables included younger age, female gender, higher educational level, functional dependence, subjective health status, more prescribed medications, impaired vision, insomnia, external locus of control, fear of falling, attachment, hope, meaning in life, and the influence of social, environmental, and staff/policy correlates. CONCLUSIONS While several variables were found to have strong associations with anxiety in aged care residents, a number of factors have been examined by only one or two studies. Further research (preferably prospective studies) is therefore needed to reliably confirm findings and to help plan and develop preventative and intervention strategies.

130362,The deubiquitinase USP44 promotes Treg function during inflammation by preventing FOXP3 degradation.,2020-07-09,"We previously reported that recombinant Newcastle disease virus LaSota (rLS) expressing infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) Arkansas (Ark)-type trimeric spike (S) ectodomain (Se; rLS/ArkSe) provides suboptimal protection against IBV challenge. We have now developed rLS expressing chicken granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) and IBV Ark Se in an attempt to enhance vaccine effectiveness. In the current study, we first compared protection conferred by vaccination with rLS/ArkSe and rLS/ArkSe.GMCSF. Vaccinated chickens were challenged with virulent Ark, and protection was determined by clinical signs, viral load, and tracheal histomorphometry. Results showed that coexpression of GMCSF and the Se from rLS significantly reduced tracheal viral load and tracheal lesions compared with chickens vaccinated with rLS/ArkSe. In a second experiment, we evaluated enhancement of cross-protection of a Massachusetts (Mass) attenuated vaccine by priming or boosting with rLS/ArkSe.GMCSF. Vaccinated chickens were challenged with Ark, and protection was evaluated. Results show that priming or boosting with the recombinant virus significantly increased cross-protection conferred by Mass against Ark virulent challenge. Greater reductions of viral loads in both trachea and lachrymal fluids were observed in chickens primed with rLS/ArkSe.GMCSF and boosted with Mass. Consistently, Ark Se antibody levels measured with recombinant Ark Se protein-coated ELISA plates 14 days after boost were significantly higher in these chickens. Unexpectedly, the inverse vaccination scheme, that is, priming with Mass and boosting with the recombinant vaccine, proved somewhat less effective. We concluded that a prime and boost strategy by using rLS/ArkSe.GMCSF and the worldwide ubiquitous Mass attenuated vaccine provides enhanced cross-protection. Thus, rLS/GMCSF coexpressing the Se of regionally relevant IBV serotypes could be used in combination with live Mass to protect against regionally circulating IBV variant strains.","Khalid, Z; He, L; Yu, Q; Breedlove, C; Joiner, K; Toro, H",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/aviandiseases-d-21-00032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34427409/,53

131157,Oculomotor anticipation reveals a multitude of learning processes underlying the serial reaction time task.,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues the pandemic spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), over 60 million people confirmed infected and at least 1.8 million dead. One of the most known features of this RNA virus is its easiness to be mutated. In late 2020, almost no region of this SARS-CoV-2 genome can be found completely conserved within the original Wu-Han coronavirus. Any information of the SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged through as time being will be evaluated for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. METHODS We extracted more than two million data of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from the open COVID-19 dashboard. The sequences of the 38-aminoi acid putative Orf10 protein within infected patients were gather output through from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the mutation rates in each position were analyzed and presented in each month of 2020. The mutation rates of A8 and V30 within orf10 are displayed in selected counties: America, India, German and Japan. RESULTS The numbers of COVID-19 patients are correlated to the death numbers, but not with the death rates (stable and lower than 3%). The amino acid positions locating at A8(F/G/L), I13 and V30(L) within the Orf10 sequence stay the highest mutation rate; N5, N25 and N36 rank at the lowest one. A8F expressed highly dominant in Japan (over 80%) and German (around 40%) coming to the end of 2020, but no significant finding in other countries. CONCLUSION The results demonstrate via mutation analysis of Orf10 can be further combined with advanced tools such as molecular simulation, artificial intelligence (AI) and biosensors that can practically revealed for protein interactions and thus to imply the authentic orf10 function of SARS-CoV-2 in the future.","Yang, De-Ming; Lin, Fan-Chi; Tsai, Pin-Hsing; Chien, Yueh; Wang, Mong-Lien; Yang, Yi-Ping; Chang, Tai-Jay",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883466/,53
131284,Reusable fibrous adsorbent prepared via Co-radiation induced graft polymerization for iodine adsorption.,2020-10-15,"COVID 19 is much more than an infectious disease by SARS-CoV-2 followed by a disproportionate immune response. An older age, diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease, especially hypertension, but also chronic heart failure and coronary artery disease among others, are between the most important risk factors. In addition, during the hospitalization both hyperglycaemia and heart failure are frequent. Less frequent are acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias and stroke. Accordingly, not all prolonged stays or even deaths are due directly to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, this is the first review, focusing both on cardiovascular and metabolic aspects of this dreadful disease, in an integrated and personalized way, following the guidelines of the Cardiometabolic Health/Medicine. Therefore, current personalized aspects such as ACEIs and ARBs, the place of statins and the most appropriate management of heart failure in diabetics are analysed. Aging, better than old age, as a dynamic process, is also considered in this review for the first time in the literature, and not only as a risk factor attributed to cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities. Immunosenescence is also approached to build healthier elders, so they can resist present and future infectious diseases, and not only in epidemics or pandemics. In addition, to do this we must start knowing the molecular mechanisms that underlying Aging process in general, and immunosenescence in particular. Surprisingly, the endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy are implicated in both process. Finally, with a training in all the aspects covered in this review, not only the hospital stay, complications and costs of this frightening disease in high-risk population should be reduced.

131749,Mapping the Terrain of Moral Suffering.,2021,"BACKGROUND We assessed cerebrovascular autoregulation (CAR) in preterm infants with definite necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), Bell's stage 2 or 3, and infants without NEC, using near-infrared spectroscopy. We hypothesized that CAR would be more often impaired in infants with NEC compared with infants without NEC. METHODS We measured cerebral regional tissue oxygen saturation, arterial oxygen saturation, and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) during 48 h. We calculated the correlation between cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction and MABP for each patient. A statistically significant negative correlation reflected impaired CAR. RESULTS We included 15 infants with definite NEC (median (range) gestational age 27.4 (25.6-34.7) wk; birth weight 1,070 (670-2,400) g) and 13 infants without NEC (gestational age 27.9 (26.3-34.7) wk; birth weight 980 (640-2,640) g). Fourteen infants had a statistically significant negative correlation (ρ -0.468 to-0.104), of whom five were infants without NEC (5/13; 38%) and nine with definite NEC (9/15; 60%). The difference in prevalence of impaired CAR was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION Impaired CAR is present in a substantial proportion of infants with definite NEC, which may predispose them to NEC-associated neurological damage.","Schat, Trijntje E; van der Laan, Michelle E; Schurink, Maarten; Hulscher, Jan B F; Hulzebos, Christian V; Bos, Arend F; Kooi, Elisabeth M W",Pediatric research,https://doi.org/10.1038/pr.2015.184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26383883/,53
131758,Skin closure after laparotomy with staples or sutures: a study of the mature scar.,2014,"BACKGROUND Cucumber plants suffer from a serious threatening disease, downy mildew, throughout the growing seasons irrespective of the weather temperature. The causal agent, Pseudoperonospora cubensis, tends to evolve rapidly upon sequential applications of chemical fungicides and generate new progeny possessing tolerance to such fungicides. Glycoproteins represent an environmentally safe alternative for chemically synthetized fungicides and do not trigger fungicide resistance. We studied the antifungal activity of four glycoproteins namely soybean β-conglycinin, chickpea vicilin, duck egg ovomucin and catfish p22 against Pseudoperonospora cubensis. Ten commercial fungicides of different chemical groups were used as positive controls of glycoprotein treatments. RESULTS The results revealed that soybean β-conglycinin and catfish p22 glycoproteins possess significant antifungal activity against P. cubensis. The amount of disease suppression caused by β-conglycinin and p22 was comparable to the highly efficient chemical fungicides containing copper oxychloride, cymoxanil and fosetyl Al as active ingredients. Vicilin and ovomucin were less efficient biocides as they gave moderate suppression of disease severity. However, all tested glycoproteins provided full protection for the newly emerged cucumber leaves. Microscopic examination of glycoprotein-treated leaves inferred the ability of catfish p22 and soybean β-conglycinin to disrupt the integrity of sporangial cell walls of P. cubensis rendering them nonviable comparing to untreated ones. Expression levels of total phenolic compounds and the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were elevated upon glycoproteins application, which infers their involvement in disease suppression. CONCLUSION This report emphasizes the direct and indirect roles of glycoproteins in safe management of cucumber downy mildew disease. This article is protected by copyright.

To understand the successes in Rwanda and Australia, a comparative policy analysis was conducted based on key informant interviews and a review of peer-reviewed literature and policy briefs. Notable findings were identified that offer lessons for countries across the income spectrum. To address cervical cancer, low- and middle-income countries can leverage foreign aid, international collaboration, and strong political advocacy, as Rwanda did. High-income countries can invest in translational research that builds capacity from basic science research to implementation of novel and impactful health products and services, as Australia did. All countries can consider rolling out HPV vaccination by targeting the social and/or physical environment (e.g., a school-based vaccination program, as both Rwanda and Australia did). Cervical cancer is preventable, and eradication is within reach for countries across the income spectrum around the world. Cervical cancer screening programs are needed to minimize the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in the short term, and HPV vaccination programs are the best strategy to eradicate cervical cancer in the long term.","Kramer, Julia",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33454969/,53
132519,This month on Twitter.,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND We studied the effects of endovascular treatment (EVT) and the impact of the extent of recanalization on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation parameters in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and large vessel occlusion (LVO). METHODS Forty-seven patients with anterior LVO underwent computed tomography perfusion (CTP) before and immediately after EVT. The entire ischemic region (Tmax >6 s) was segmented before intervention, and tissue perfusion (time-to-maximum (Tmax), time-to-peak (TTP), mean transit time (MTT), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF)) and oxygenation (coefficientof variation (COV), capillary transit time heterogeneity (CTH), metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF)) parameters were quantified from the segmented area at baseline and the corresponding area immediately after intervention, as well as within the ischemic core and penumbra. The impact of the extent of recanalization (modified Treatment in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI)) on CTP parameters was assessed with the Wilcoxon test and Pearson's correlation coefficients. RESULTS The Tmax, MTT, OEF and CTH values immediately after EVT were lower in patients with complete (as compared with incomplete) recanalization, whereas CBF and COV values were higher (P<0.05) and no differences were found in other parameters. The ischemic penumbra immediately after EVT was lower in patients with complete recanalization as compared with those with incomplete recanalization (P=0.002), whereas no difference was found for the ischemic core (P=0.12). Specifically, higher mTICI scores were associated with a greater reduction of ischemic penumbra volumes (R²=-0.48 (95% CI -0.67 to -0.22), P=0.001) but not of ischemic core volumes (P=0.098). CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that the ischemic penumbra is the key target of successful EVT in patients with AIS and largely determines its efficacy on a tissue level. Furthermore, we confirm the validity of the mTICI score as a surrogate parameter of interventional success on a tissue perfusion level.","Brugnara, Gianluca; Herweh, Christian; Neuberger, Ulf; Bo Hansen, Mikkel; Ulfert, Christian; Mahmutoglu, Mustafa Ahmed; Foltyn, Martha; Nagel, Simon; Schönenberger, Silvia; Heiland, Sabine; Ringleb, Peter Arthur; Bendszus, Martin; Möhlenbruch, Markus; Pfaff, Johannes Alex Rolf; Vollmuth, Philipp",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-017163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762405/,53

Less invasive methods are now available. Three fixation modalities were compared: the ProGrip™ laparoscopic self-fixating mesh; the fibrin glue Tisseel™ with Bard™ Soft Mesh; and the SorbaFix™ absorbable fixation system with Bard™ Soft Mesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS Meshes (6 cm ×6 cm) were implanted in the preperitoneal space of swine. Samples were explanted 24 hours after surgery. Centered defects were created, and samples (either ten or eleven per fixation type) were loaded in a pressure chamber. For each sample, the pressure, the mesh displacement through the defect, and the measurements of the contact area were recorded. RESULTS At all pressures tested, the ProGrip™ laparoscopic self-fixating mesh both exhibited a significantly lower displacement through the defect and retained a significantly higher percentage of its initial contact area than either the Bard™ Soft Mesh with Tisseel™ system or the Bard™ Soft Mesh with SorbaFix™ absorbable fixation system. Dislocations occurred with the Bard™ Soft Mesh with Tisseel™ system and with the Bard™ Soft Mesh with SorbaFix™ absorbable fixation system at physiological pressure (,225 mmHg).

133220,Intraoperative endoscopic ultrasound guidance for laparoscopic excision of invisible symptomatic deep intramural myomas.,2018,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and is associated with poor prognosis. The current study aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of resveratrol when administered alone and in combination with nicotinamide against alcohol-aflatoxin B1-induced HCC. Results reveal that during the development and progression of cancer, there was a decline in the level of antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase (GR), antioxidant glutathione, and glutathione S-transferase, which is an enzyme of detoxification pathways. Treatment of resveratrol restored the level of catalase and glutathione peroxidase toward normal in alcohol-aflatoxin B1-induced HCC; however, nicotinamide worked in concert with resveratrol only in upregulating the activity of glutathione reductase, glutathione level, and glutathione S-transferase. SIRT1 agonist resveratrol was observed to modulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes by negatively regulating the expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in alcohol-aflatoxin B1-induced HCC, thereby suggesting a cross-talk between antioxidant enzymes SIRT1 and NF-κB during the development and progression of HCC and its therapeutics by resveratrol and nicotinamide.","Rawat, Divya; Chhonker, Saurabh Kumar; Naik, Rayees Ahmad; Koiri, Raj Kumar",Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jbt.22625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894639/,53
133306,Biodegradable plastics in the air and soil environment: Low degradation rate and high microplastics formation.,2021-06-05,"The outbreak of COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 rapidly spread across the globe and has become pandemic. Little is known about the protective factors of this infection, which is equally distributed between genders and different ages while severe and poor prognosis cases are strongly associated to old males and the presence of comorbidities. Thus, preventive measures aiming at reducing the number of infection and/or their severity are strongly needed. Vitamin D has got great attention and has been claimed as potentially protective against the infection since it may be associated with immunocompetence, inflammation, aging, and those diseases involved in determining the outcomes of COVID-19. This narrative review aims at collecting the literature available on the involvement of the vitamin D status in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the putative utility of vitamin D supplementation in the therapeutics. It emerges that a poor vitamin D status seems to associate with an increased risk of infection whereas age, gender and comorbidities seem to play a more important role in COVID-19 severity and mortality. While randomized control trials are needed to better inquire into this topic, vitamin D supplementation may be useful beside its potential effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.","Ferrari, Davide; Locatelli, Massimo; Briguglio, Matteo; Lombardi, Giovanni",Cell biochemistry and function,https://doi.org/10.1002/cbf.3597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33137851/,53

DESIGN Prospective task-performing study. SETTING Intensive care research laboratory, university hospital. METHODS Ten physicians experienced in mechanical ventilation, but without prior knowledge of the ventilators, were asked to perform eight specific tasks [turning the ventilator on; recognizing mode and parameters; recognizing and setting alarms; mode change; finding and activating the pre-oxygenation function; pressure support setting; stand-by; finding and activating non-invasive ventilation (NIV) mode]. The time needed for each task was compared to a reference time (by trained physiotherapist familiar with the devices). A time >180 s was considered a task failure. RESULTS For each of the tests on the ventilators, all physicians' times were significantly higher than the reference time (P < 0.001). A mean of 13 +/- 8 task failures (16%) was observed by the ventilator. The most frequently failed tasks were mode and parameter recognition, starting pressure support and finding the NIV mode. Least often failed tasks were turning on the pre-oxygenation function and alarm recognition and management. Overall, there was substantial heterogeneity between machines, some exhibiting better user-friendliness than others for certain tasks, but no ventilator was clearly better that the others on all points tested. CONCLUSIONS The present study adds to the available literature outlining the ergonomic shortcomings of mechanical ventilators. These results suggest that closer ties between end-users and manufacturers should be promoted, at an early development phase of these machines, based on the scientific evaluation of the cognitive processes involved by users in the clinical setting.","Vignaux, Laurence; Tassaux, Didier; Jolliet, Philippe",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-009-1580-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19639302/,53

Thus, there is an immediate need for novel therapeutics that can combat this deadly infection. In this study, we report the therapeutic assessment of azurin and its peptides: p18 and p28 against the viral structural S-protein and non-structural 3CLpro and PLpro proteins. Among the analyzed complexes, azurin docked relatively well with the S2 domain of S-protein compared to the other viral proteins. The derived peptide p18 bound to the active site domain of the PLpro protein; however, in other complexes, lesser interactions were recorded. The second azurin derived peptide p28, fared the best among the docked proteins. p28 interacted with all the three viral proteins and the host ACE-2 receptor by forming several electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with the S-protein, 3CLpro, and PLpro. MD simulations indicated that p28 exhibited a strong affinity to S-protein and ACE-2 receptor, indicating a possibility of p28 as a protein-protein interaction inhibitor. Our data suggest that the p28 has potential as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent and can be further exploited to establish its validity in the treatment of current and future SARS-CoV crisis.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

133666,The level of exposure affects the arsenic urinary methylation profile of a population of children.,2021-03-12,"BACKGROUND Despite its preventable nature, poisoning remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. In Lebanon, this population is poorly studied and there is no poison center to which healthcare providers and the public can refer in case of toxicological exposure, leading to unnecessary Emergency Department (ED) visits. This study describes the pediatric toxicological exposures seen at the largest tertiary care center in Lebanon. It also evaluates the appropriateness of ED visits among confirmed or suspected toxicological exposures in children, in order to assess the role of a national poison center in reducing unnecessary ED visits. METHODS This is a secondary analysis of a database for a telephonic medical toxicology service at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, the largest tertiary care center in Lebanon. Data relating to all pediatric patients aged 0-19 years of age were entered into the database by the medical toxicology team. The cases were independently reviewed by 2 medical toxicologists for the adequacy of referral to the ED and performance of invasive procedures. RESULTS Two hundred and nine exposures were recorded between 15 April 2015 and 31 December 2019, of which 53.1% were females. Children aged less than 5 years were involved in 67.0% of cases while adolescents aged 13-19 years were involved in 21.1%. The most commonly involved substances were analgesics (14.8%) and cardiovascular drugs (10.0%). The majority had no (59.3%) or minor (26.3%) effects and were treated and discharged home (67.5%). More than a third of ED visits were deemed unnecessary by the toxicologists (Kappa = 0.705), and when including only unintentional cases, around 45% of the ED visits were deemed unnecessary (Kappa = 0.677). CONCLUSION Our data show that 37% of all pediatric poisoning ED visits and 45% of ED visits due to unintentional pediatric poisonings were unnecessary. Additionally, more often than not lavage suctions were done unnecessarily. Future research investigating the possibility of preventing unnecessary visits by establishing a national poison center is needed.","El Zahran, Tharwat; Mostafa, Hala; Hamade, Hani; Hitti, Eveline; Morgan, Brent W; Kazzi, Ziad",Clinical toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2021.1874404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33555968/,53

Pathogens associated with development or exacerbation of MS include bacteria, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus-produced enterotoxins that function as superantigens, and viruses of the Herpesviridae (Epstein-Barr virus and human herpes virus 6) and human endogenous retrovirus families. However, to date, no single pathogen has been accepted as causal agent. In addition, common upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tract infections have also been associated with MS exacerbations. Although evidence of an infectious etiology as cause of MS in humans remains inconclusive, microbial agents may modulate the neuroimmunological system of genetically susceptible individuals. Decoding the epidemiological contribution of different microorganisms to MS, along with their pathogenic mechanisms, may help develop new treatment strategies and prevent relapses.","Marrodan, Mariano; Alessandro, Lucas; Farez, Mauricio F; Correale, Jorge",Multiple sclerosis,https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458518823940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30638421/,53

Significant economic losses associated with this disease include morbidity, mortality, and direct cost of treatment. Multiple pathogens are responsible for infectious diarrhea, including, but not limited to, Bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine Rotavirus A (BRV), and Cryptosporidium spp. Identification and isolation of carrier calves are essential for disease management. Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory current methods for calf diarrhea pathogen identification include electron microscopy (EM) for BCV and BRV and a direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT) for organism detection of Cryptosporidium spp. A workflow was developed consisting of an optimized fecal nucleic acid purification and multiplex reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for single tube concurrent detection of BCV, BRV, and Cryptosporidium spp., and an internal control to monitor nucleic acid purification efficacy and PCR reagent functionality. In ""spike-in"" experiments using serial dilutions of each pathogen, the analytical sensitivity was determined to be <10 TCID(50)/ml for BCV and BRV, and <20 oocysts for Cryptosporidium spp. Analytical specificity was confirmed using Canine and Feline coronavirus, Giardia spp., and noninfected bovine purified nucleic acid. Diagnostic sensitivity was ≥98% for all pathogens when compared with respective traditional methods. The results demonstrate that the newly developed assay can purify and subsequently detect BCV, BRV, and Cryptosporidium spp. concurrently in a single PCR, enabling simplified and streamlined calf diarrhea pathogen identification.","Schroeder, Megan E; Bounpheng, Mangkey A; Rodgers, Sandy; Baker, Rocky J; Black, Wendy; Naikare, Hemant; Velayudhan, Binu; Sneed, Loyd; Szonyi, Barbara; Clavijo, Alfonso","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638712456976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22914823/,53

We investigated whether local treatment using 2-diethylaminoethyl-dextran methyl methacrylate copolymer with p53 (DDMC-p53) with or without cisplatin and/or microwave ablation enhances disease control in BALBC mice. We used a Lewis lung carcinoma cell line to inoculate 140 BALBC mice, which were divided into the following seven groups; control, cisplatin, microwave ablation, DDMC-p53, DDMC-p53 plus cisplatin, DDMC-p53 plus microwave, and DDMC-p53 plus cisplatin plus microwave. Microwave ablation energy was administered at 20 W for 10 minutes. Cisplatin was administered as 1 mL/mg and the DDMC-p53 complex delivered was 0.5 mL. Increased toxicity was observed in the group receiving DDMC-p53 plus cisplatin plus microwave followed by the group receiving DDMC-p53 plus cisplatin. Infection after repeated treatment administration was a major issue. We conclude that a combination of gene therapy using DDMC-p53 with or without cisplatin and microwave is an alternative method for local disease control.

The ability to detect influenza or any respiratory virus increased as the number of samples tested increased. When analysed by chronological order of when samples were received at the laboratory, percent positivity of outbreaks testing positive for any respiratory virus including influenza increased with the number of samples tested up to the ninth sample, with minimal benefit beyond the fourth sample tested. Testing up to four respiratory samples per outbreak was sufficient to detect viral organisms and resulted in significant savings for outbreak investigations.","Peci, A; Marchand-Austin, A; Winter, A-L; Gubbay, J B",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268812002531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23146341/,53

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic Video Conferencing (VC) was utilized by a small fraction of medical specialties. However, since the start of the pandemic, CMS and the largest private health insurance companies have relaxed regulations to allow the majority of specialties to use VC in lieu of in-person visits. Most importantly, VC minimizes patient and physician exposure in situations such as these, and decreases risk in the immunocompromised population. VC, which has been shown to be just as safe and efficacious in treating patients, offers the ability to follow up with physicians while saving time on travel, as well as travel-related expenses. This, in turn correlates with increased patient satisfaction. VC also allows physicians to expand their reach to patients in rural areas seeking advanced professional advice.

We compared postoperative delirium in elderly patients following laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) versus open gastrectomy (OG). METHODS In total, 130 patients aged ≥ 65 years with gastric cancer undergoing LG and OG were enrolled prospectively. Postoperative delirium and cognitive status were assessed daily using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), respectively, for 3 days postoperatively. For CAM-positive patients, delirium severity was then assessed using the Delirium Index (DI). RESULTS In total, 123 subjects (LG, n = 60; OG, n = 63) were included in the analysis. In both groups, the overall incidences of postoperative delirium were similar: 31.6% (19/60) in the LG group and 41.2% (26/63) in the OG group. When considering only those with delirium, the severity, expressed as the highest DI score, was similar between the groups. A decline in cognitive function (reduction in MMSE ≥ 2 points from baseline) during 3 days postoperatively was observed in 23 patients in the LG group (38.3%) and 27 patients in the OG group (42.9%) (P = 0.744). In both groups, postoperative cognitive decline was significantly associated with postoperative delirium (P < 0.001).

METHODS A pixel-based analysis of pre-treatment CT perfusion (CTP) was undertaken to define the optimum CTP permeability thresholds to predict the likelihood of HT. We then compared previously proposed predictors of HT using regression analyses and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis to produce an Area Under the Cure (AUC), and compared AUCs using Chi Square analysis. RESULTS From 5 centres, 1407 patients were included in this study, 282 had HT. The cohort was split into a derivation (1025, 70% patients) and validation cohort (382 patients or 30%). The E permeability map at a threshold of 30% relative to contralateral had the highest AUC at predicting any HT (derivation AUC 0.85, 95% CI, 0.79-0.91, validation AUC 0.84, 95% CI, 0.77-0.91). The AUC improved when permeability was assessed within the acute perfusion lesion for the E maps at a threshold of 30% (derivation AUC 0.91, 95% CI, 0.86-0.95, validation AUC 0.89, 95% CI, 0.86-0.95). Previously proposed associations with HT and PH showed lower AUC values than the permeability measure. INTERPRETATION In this large multi-centre study, we have validated a highly accurate measure of HT prediction. This measure may be useful in clinical practice to predict haemorrhagic transformation in ischemic stroke patients before receiving alteplase alone. This article is protected by copyright.

137907,[Transmission of Influenza A].,2011,"Due to the risk of adverse reactions to metal debris resulting from increased wear of the arthroplasty more than one million metal-on-metal (MoM) hip replacements worldwide are in active follow-up. Follow-up usually includes measurement of both whole blood cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) concentrations. Our experience is that Cr is seldom independently elevated. We wanted to ascertain whether blood Cr measurements could be omitted from follow-up protocols without lowering the quality of follow-up. We identified 8438 whole blood Co and Cr measurements performed without or prior to revision surgery. When the cut-off levels 5 µg/L and 7 µg/L were used, Cr was independently elevated in only 0.5% (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.3 to 0.6) and 0.2% (CI 0.1 to 0.3) of the measurements. The models with continuous variables showed that the higher the blood metal concentrations are the lower the percentage of measurements with Cr higher than Co. Our results suggest that whole blood Cr is very rarely independently elevated and therefore the authorities should consider omitting Cr measurements from their screening guidelines of MoM hip replacements. We believe this change in practice would simplify follow-up and lead to cost savings without decreasing the quality of follow-up.","Lainiala, Olli; Karsikas, Mari; Reito, Aleksi; Eskelinen, Antti",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91512-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117287/,53

The high mortality and its poor response to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir have been attributed to uncontrolled virus-induced cytokine storm. We challenged BALB/c mice with 1,000 LD50 of influenza A/Vietnam/1194/04. Survival, body weight, histopathology, inflammatory markers, viral loads, T lymphocyte counts, and neutralizing antibody response were documented in infected mice treated individually or in combination with zanamvir, celecoxib, gemfibrozil, and mesalazine. To imitate the real-life scenario, treatment was initiated at 48 h after viral challenge. There were significant improvements in survival rate (P = 0.02), survival time (P < 0.02), and inflammatory markers (P < 0.01) in the group treated with a triple combination of zanamivir, celecoxib, and mesalazine when compared with zanamivir alone. Zanamivir with or without immunomodulators reduced viral load to a similar extent. Insignificant prolongation of survival was observed when individual agents were used alone. Significantly higher levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and less pulmonary inflammation were also found in the group receiving triple therapy. Zanamivir alone reduced viral load but not inflammation and mortality. The survival benefits of adding celecoxib and mesalazine to zanamivir could be caused by their synergistic effects in reducing cytokine dysfunction and preventing apoptosis. Combinations of a neuraminidase inhibitor with these immunomodulators should be considered in randomized controlled treatment trials of patients suffering from H5N1 infection.","Zheng, Bo-Jian; Chan, Kwok-Wah; Lin, Yong-Ping; Zhao, Guang-Yu; Chan, Chris; Zhang, Hao-Jie; Chen, Hong-Lin; Wong, Samson S Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Jin, Dong-Yan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0711942105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18523003/,53

We investigated avelumab (anti-programmed death ligand-1 [PD-L1]) maintenance after first-line induction chemotherapy for GC/GEJC. PATIENTS AND METHODS JAVELIN Gastric 100 was a global, open-label, phase III trial. Eligible patients had untreated, unresectable, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic GC or GEJC. Patients without progressive disease after 12 weeks of first-line chemotherapy with oxaliplatin plus a fluoropyrimidine were randomly assigned 1:1 to avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or continued chemotherapy, stratified by region (Asia v non-Asia). The primary end point was overall survival (OS) after induction chemotherapy in all randomly assigned patients or the PD-L1-positive randomly assigned population (≥ 1% of tumor cells; 73-10 assay). RESULTS A total of 805 patients received induction; 499 were randomly assigned to avelumab (n = 249) or continued chemotherapy (n = 250). Median OS was 10.4 months (95% CI, 9.1 to 12.0 months) versus 10.9 months (95% CI, 9.6 to 12.4 months) and 24-month OS rate was 22.1% versus 15.5% with avelumab versus chemotherapy, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.11; P = .1779). In the PD-L1-positive population (n = 54), the HR for OS was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.57 to 2.23; P = .6352). In an exploratory analysis of the PD-L1-positive population, defined as combined positive score ≥ 1 (22C3 assay; n = 137), median OS was 14.9 months (95% CI, 8.7 to 17.3 months) with avelumab versus 11.6 months (95% CI, 8.4 to 12.6 months) with chemotherapy (unstratified HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.05). With avelumab and chemotherapy, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 149 (61.3%) and 184 (77.3%) patients, including grade ≥ 3 TRAEs in 31 (12.8%) and 78 (32.8%) patients, respectively.

Biogas-AD produced, represents a useful source of green energy, while its by-product (digestate) is a waste, that needs to be safely disposal. The sustainability of anaerobic digestion plants partly depends on the management of their digestion residues. This study has been focused on the environmental and economic benefits of co-digest recalcitrant agricultural wastes such olive wastes and citrus pulp, in combination with livestock wastes, straw and cheese whey for biogas production. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of two different bioenergy by-products on soil carbon stock, enzymes involved in nutrient cycling and microbial content. The two digestates were obtained from two plants differently fed: the first plant (Uliva) was powered with 60% of recalcitrant agricultural wastes, and 40% of livestock manure milk serum and maize silage. The second one (Fattoria) was fed with 40% of recalcitrant agricultural wastes and 60% of livestock manure, milk serum and maize silage. Each digestate, separated in liquid and solid fractions, was added to the soil at different concentrations. Our results evidenced that mixing and type of input feedstock affected the composition of digestates. Three months after treatments, our results showed that changes in soil chemical and biochemical characteristics depended on the source of digestate, the type of fraction and the concentration used. The mainly affected soil parameters were: Soil Organic Matter (SOM), Microbial Biomass Carbon (MBC), Fluorescein Diacetate Hydrolysis (FDA), Water Soluble Phenol (WSP) and Catalase (CAT) that can be used to assess the digestate agronomical feasibility. These results show that the agronomic quality of a digestate is strictly dependent on percentage and type of feedstocks that will be used to power the digester.","Muscolo, Adele; Settineri, Giovanna; Papalia, Teresa; Attinà, Emilio; Basile, Carmelo; Panuccio, Maria Rosaria",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.02.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28214122/,53

140868,Opportunities and Challenges for the Next Phase of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery: A Review.,2021-04-21,"INTRODUCTION In the UK, it is estimated that a disabling hearing loss (HL) affects 1 in 6 people. HL has functional, economic and social-emotional consequences for affected individuals. Intervention for HL focuses on improving access to the auditory signal using hearing aids or cochlear implants. However, even if sounds are audible and speech is understood, individuals with HL often report increased effort when listening.Listening effort (LE) may be measured using self-reported measures such as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs are validated questionnaires completed by patients to measure their perceptions of their own functional status and well-being. When selecting a PROM for use in research or clinical practice, it is necessary to appraise the evidence of a PROM's acceptability to patients, validity, responsiveness and reliability. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of studies evaluating the measurement properties of PROMs available to measure LE in HL will be undertaken. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Web of Science will be searched electronically. Reference lists of included studies, key journals and the grey literature will be hand-searched to identify further studies for inclusion. Two reviewers will independently complete title, abstract and full-text screening to determine study eligibility. Data on the characteristics of each study and each PROM will be extracted. Methodological quality of the included studies will be appraised using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments, the quality of included PROMs appraised and the credibility of the evidence assessed. A narrative synthesis will summarise extracted data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical permission is not required, as this study uses data from published research. Dissemination will be through publication in peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations and the lead author's doctoral dissertation. Findings may inform the selection of PROMs used to measure LE in HL.","Hughes, Sarah E; Rapport, Frances L; Boisvert, Isabelle; McMahon, Catherine M; Hutchings, Hayley A",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28592576/,53
141276,Antibiotic-releasing microspheres prevent mesh infection in vivo.,2016,"BACKGROUND The influence of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) on post-thrombolytic hemorrhagic transformation (HT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke remains controversial. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of CMBs with HT and clinical outcomes among patients with large-vessel occlusion strokes treated with mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS We analyzed patients with acute stroke treated with Merci Retriever, Penumbra system or stent-retriever devices. CMBs were identified on pretreatment T2-weighted, gradient-recall echo MRI. We analyzed the association of the presence, burden, and distribution of CMBs with HT, procedural complications, in-hospital mortality, and clinical outcome. RESULTS CMBs were detected in 37 (18.0%) of 206 patients. Seventy-three foci of microbleeds were identified. Fourteen patients (6.8%) had ≥2 CMBs, only 1 patient had ≥5 CMBs. Strictly lobar CMBs were found in 12 patients, strictly deep CMBs in 12 patients, strictly infratentorial CMBs in 2 patients, and mixed CMBs in 11 patients. There were no significant differences between patients with CMBs and those without CMBs in the rates of overall HT (37.8% vs 45.6%), parenchymal hematoma (16.2% vs 19.5%), procedure-related vessel perforation (5.4% vs 7.1%), in-hospital mortality (16.2% vs 18.3%), and modified Rankin Scale score 0-3 at discharge. CMBs were not independently associated with HT or in-hospital mortality in patients treated with either thrombectomy or intravenous thrombolysis followed by thrombectomy. CONCLUSIONS Patients with CMBs are not at increased risk for HT and mortality following mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke. Excluding such patients from mechanical thrombectomy is unwarranted. The risk of HT in patients with ≥5 CMBs requires further study.","Shi, Zhong-Song; Duckwiler, Gary R; Jahan, Reza; Tateshima, Satoshi; Gonzalez, Nestor R; Szeder, Viktor; Saver, Jeffrey L; Kim, Doojin; Ali, Latisha K; Starkman, Sidney; Vespa, Paul M; Salamon, Noriko; Villablanca, J Pablo; Viñuela, Fernando; Feng, Lei; Loh, Yince; Liebeskind, David S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25994939/,53

However, its benefits in clinical practice are not demonstrated. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to evaluate the impact of intraoperative pupillometry monitoring on perioperative opioid consumption in major gynecologic surgery. METHODS After receiving ethics committee approval and written consent of patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists status I to II women undergoing gynecologic surgery were included in this single-blinded, prospective, parallel-arm randomized study. General anesthesia was standardized with propofol-remifentanil target-controlled infusion. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups. In the pupillometry group, remifentanil administration was guided by pupillary diameter changes. In the standard group, remifentanil administration was left to the discretion of the anesthesiologist. The primary outcome was intraoperative remifentanil consumption. RESULTS Fifty-five patients were analyzed. Remifentanil consumption was markedly decreased in the pupillometry group (3.8 [3.4 to 4.8 µg · kg · h] vs. 7.9 µg · kg · h [6.5 to 9.0 µg · kg · h] in the standard group; difference = 4.2 µg · kg · h [95% CI, 3.0 to 5.3 µg · kg · h]; P < 0.001). Cumulative 0- to 12-h morphine consumption was reduced in the pupillometry group (two-way repeated measures ANOVA 0.3 ± 0.1 vs. 0.4 ± 0.2 mg/kg; P = 0.048). A telephone survey 3 months after surgery revealed that 15 of 29 patients in the standard group still experienced procedure-related pain versus 3 of 23 in the pupillometry group (chi-square P = 0.037). No adverse events associated with pupillometry were observed during the study. CONCLUSIONS The use of pupillometry to guide intraoperative analgesia reduced intraoperative remifentanil consumption and postoperative morphine requirements. The possible consequences of decreasing intraoperative remifentanil in terms of chronic pain require further investigation.","Sabourdin, Nada; Barrois, Jérôme; Louvet, Nicolas; Rigouzzo, Agnès; Guye, Marie-Laurence; Dadure, Christophe; Constant, Isabelle",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000001705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28719527/,53

The sardine is a source of omega-3 and taurine that, in isolation or in synergy, would produce T2D-delaying through different molecular mechanism. HYPOTHESIS The consumption of twice a week of sardine, during one year would reduce T2D-developing risk in a population with prediabetes (preDM) and old age. DESIGN 152 subjects with fasting glucose between 100-124 mg/dL aged ≥65 yo were recruited from three primary care centers in Barcelona and were randomly distributed among two interventional groups: control group (CG) and sardine group (SG). Both groups received same T2D-prevention nutritional during a year but only SG had to add 200 g of sardine per week. All variables were collected before to start and at the end of the diet. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03557541). RESULTS 152 people were randomized into CG (n=77) and SG (n=75) with 18 and 12 drop outs respectively. Subjects in SG, significantly compared to CG, decreased percentage classified-individuals in a very high risk group to develop T2D according to FINDRISC (p=0.035). In addition to increasing HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin and decreasing triglycerides (p<0.05) and blood pressure (<0.05), SG showed a lower HOMA-IR (p=0.032). The consumption of sardine characteristics nutrients as omega-3, EPA and DHA, vitamin D, fluorine and taurine were higher for SG (p<0.05). These results agreed with the increased of taurine, fatty acid (FA) omega-3 and bile acids circulating metabolites (p<0.05). Changes erythrocyte membrane FA were detected only in SG with a decrease of 5 omega-6 FA (p<0.001) and an increase of 3 omega-3 FA types (p<0.001).

We aimed to determine the HRQL instruments most commonly used to assess children surviving critical care and describe study methodology, patient populations, and instrument characteristics to identify areas of deficiency and guide investigators conducting HRQL research. METHODS We queried PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane Registry for studies evaluating pediatric critical care survivors published 1970-2017. We used dual review for article selection and data extraction. RESULTS Of 60,349 citations, 66 articles met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were observational (89.4%) and assessed HRQL at one post-discharge time-point (86.4%), and only 10.6% of studies included a baseline assessment. Time to the first follow-up assessment ranged from 1 month to 10 years post-hospitalization (median 3 years, IQR 0.5-6). For 26 prospective studies, the median follow-up time was 0.5 years [IQR 0.25-1]. Parent/guardian proxy-reporting was used in 83.3% of studies. Fifteen HRQL instruments were employed, with four used in >5% of articles: the Health Utility Index (n = 22 articles), the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (n = 17), the Child Health Questionnaire (n = 16), and the 36-Item Short Form Survey (n = 9).

142507,Electroceutical Management of Bacterial Biofilm and Surgical Infection.,2020-05-29,"Autonomously replicating subgenomic Bungowannah virus (BuPV) RNAs (BuPV replicons) with deletions of the genome regions encoding the structural proteins C, ERNS, E1 and E2 were constructed on the basis of an infectious cDNA clone of BuPV. Nanoluciferase (Nluc) insertion was used to compare the replication efficiency of all constructs after electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA from the different clones. Deletion of C, E1, E2 or the complete structural protein genome region (C-ERNS-E1-E2) prevented the production of infectious progeny virus, whereas deletion of ERNS still allowed the generation of infectious particles. However, those ΔERNS viral particles were defective in virus assembly and/or egress and could not be further propagated for more than three additional passages in porcine SK-6 cells. These ""defective in third cycle"" BuPV ΔERNS mutants were subsequently used to express the classical swine fever virus envelope protein E2, the N-terminal domain of the Schmallenberg virus Gc-protein and the receptor binding domain of the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus spike protein. The constructs could be efficiently complemented and further passaged in SK-6 cells constitutively expressing the BuPV ERNS protein. Importantly, BuPV are able to infect a wide variety of target cell lines, allowing the expression in a very wide host spectrum. Therefore, we suggest that packaged BuPV ΔERNS replicon particles have the potential as broad spectrum viral vectors.IMPORTANCE The proteins Npro and ERNS are unique for the genus pestivirus, but only Npro was demonstrated to be non-essential for in vitro growth. While this was also speculated for ERNS, it was previously always shown that pestivirus replicons with deletions of the structural proteins ERNS, E1 or E2 did not produce any infectious progeny virus in susceptible host cells. Here, we could for the first time demonstrate that BuPV ERNS is dispensable for the generation of infectious virus particles, but still important for efficient passaging. The ERNS defective BuPV particles showed a clearly limited growth in cell culture, but were capable for several rounds of infection, expression of foreign genes and highly efficient trans-complementation to rescue virus replicon particles (VRP). The non-cytopathic characteristics and the absence of preexisting immunity to BuPV in human populations and livestock also provides a significant benefit for a possible use e.g. as a vector vaccine platform.","Dalmann, Anja; Reimann, Ilona; Wernike, Kerstin; Beer, Martin",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00436-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404522/,53

143179,COVID-19 vaccines buoy hope.,2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND Norwood palliation for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome typically results in retrograde perfusion of the native aortic root. This may predispose to native aortic root thrombosis (NART). METHODS Patients who underwent Stage 1 Norwood palliation at Children' Hospital Colorado between 2003 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed for NART. Additional cases were identified by a systematic literature review. Patient factors, operative details, presentation, diagnostic modalities, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Three cases were identified among 241 patients who had undergone Stage 1 Norwood palliation at Children's Hospital Colorado (mean follow-up 48 months). A 4th case identified at Children's Hospital Colorado had undergone stage 1 palliation elsewhere. Twelve additional cases were identified from the systematic literature review. Cases presented with new arrythmias (38%, n=6/16), evidence of ischemia (31%, n=5/16), incidentally (19%, n=3/16), inability to wean from post-operative support (6%, n=1/16) and cardiac arrest (6%, n=1/16). The diagnosis was made by TTE (50%, n=8/16), TEE (19%, n=3/16), cardiac catheterization (25%, n=4/16), and cardiac CT (6%, n=1/16). Importantly, 44% (n=7/16) of cases were missed by TTE and subsequently diagnosed by other modalities. Treatment strategies were surgical thrombectomy (38%, n=6/16), anticoagulation alone (38%, n=6/16), direct catheter thrombolysis (19%, n=3/16), and systemic thrombolysis (6%, n=1/16). The rate of mortality or transplant listing was 44% (n=7/16). CONCLUSIONS NART is an underappreciated complication of Norwood palliation with high mortality. There should be a high index of suspicion for NART in patients after Norwood palliation with an unexplained complicated clinical course. Importantly, NART is frequently missed by TTE.","Rajab, Taufiek Konrad; Mitchell, Max B",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.07.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987016/,53

METHODS We retrospectively analysed 412 patients with HBV-related single HCC treated with percutaneous RFA between January 2004 and December 2013. AFP and DCP levels were measured before (pre-ablation) and 1 month after treatment (post-ablation). We assessed predictive factors for overall and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS On univariate analysis, Child-Pugh score, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, platelet count, tumour size, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, and pre- and post-ablation DCP were significant for overall survival; and age, Child-Pugh score, MELD score, platelet count, tumour size, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score, BCLC stage, and pre- and post-ablation AFP and DCP were significant for recurrence-free survival. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences in overall survival by MELD score and tumour size and in recurrence-free survival by BCLC stage. Among the tumour markers, post-ablation DCP was an independent prognostic factor for overall and recurrence-free survival [hazard ratio (HR), 3.438; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.331-8.877; P = 0.011 and HR, 4.934; 95% CI, 2.761-8.816; P < 0.001 respectively]. Post-ablation AFP was associated with recurrence-free survival (HR, 1.995; 95% CI, 1.476-2.697; P < 0.001) but not overall survival.

Mathematical models of infectious diseases permit quantitative description of epidemic processes based on the underlying biological mechanisms. Mathematical models have been widely used in the past decade to aid pandemic planning by allowing detailed predictions of the speed of spread of an influenza pandemic and the likely effectiveness of alternative control strategies. During the initial waves of the 2009 influenza pandemic, mathematical models were used to track the spread of the virus, predict the time course of the pandemic and assess the likely impact of large-scale vaccination. While mathematical modeling has made substantial contributions to influenza pandemic preparedness, its use as a realtime tool for pandemic control is currently limited by the lack of essential surveillance information such as serological data. Mathematical modeling provided a useful framework for analyzing and interpreting surveillance data during the 2009 influenza pandemic, for highlighting limitations in existing pandemic surveillance systems, and for guiding how these systems should be strengthened in order to cope with future epidemics of influenza or other emerging infectious diseases.","Wu, Joseph T; Cowling, Benjamin J",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1258/ebm.2010.010271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21727183/,53
144908,Trifunctional metasurface based on spoof surface plasmon polaritons.,2020-07-06,"Immediate recall of lists of items in random serial order has been examined in thousands of studies throughout the history of experimental psychology. In most studies, though, there have been no repetitions of items within a list, or occasionally a single repetition. These stimuli differ from the common uses of item series, which often include multiple repetitions (e.g., identification numbers; orders of people at a restaurant table). To begin to understand such cases we presented lists that, in some trial blocks, were constructed with no restrictions on repetitions. Specifically, we examined immediate serial recall of visually-presented, nine-digit lists, either spatially separated into three separate groups of three digits (Experiment 1) or undivided (Experiment 2). Many of the lists included single or multiple repetitions of digits, with repeated digits either adjacent or non-adjacent in an unpredictable manner. We assessed theoretical expectations derived from prior research. Effects of repetition were often helpful but, when repetitions favoured a grouping that conflicted with the presented grouping into threes in Experiment 1, repetition was disadvantageous. We suggest a theoretical analysis in which participants can use presented grouping cues or, when those cues are absent, create their own groupings to exploit repetitions among the stimuli.","Cowan, Nelson; Hardman, Kyle O",Memory,https://doi.org/10.1080/09658211.2021.1942920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34148530/,53
145059,The effect of simple heat treatment on apatite formation on grit-blasted/acid-etched dental Ti implants already in clinical use.,2021-07-29,"INTRODUCTION Even though literature provides compelling evidence of the value of simulators for training of basic laparoscopic skills, the best way to incorporate them into a surgical curriculum is unclear. This study compares the training outcome of single modality training with multimodality training of basic laparoscopic skills. METHODS Thirty-six medical students without laparoscopic experience performed six training sessions of 45 min each, one per day, in which four different basic tasks were trained. Participants in the single-modality group (S) (n = 18) practiced solely on a virtual reality (VR) simulator. Participants in the multimodality group (M) (n = 18) practiced on the same VR simulator (2x), a box trainer (2x), and an augmented reality simulator (2x). All participants performed a pre-test and post-test on the VR simulator (the four basic tasks + one additional basic task). Halfway through the training protocol, both groups performed a salpingectomy on the VR simulator as interim test. RESULTS Both groups improved their performance significantly (Wilcoxon signed-rank, P < 0.05). The performances of group S and group M in the additional basic task and the salpingectomy did not differ significantly (Mann-Whitney U test, P > 0.05). Group S performed the four basic tasks in the post-test on the VR faster than group M (P ≤ 0.05), which can be explained by the fact that they were much more familiar with these tasks. CONCLUSIONS Training of basic laparoscopic tasks on single or multiple modalities does not result in different training outcome. Both training methods seem appropriate for the attainment of basic laparoscopic skills in future curricula.","Brinkman, Willem M; Havermans, Sanne Y; Buzink, Sonja N; Botden, Sanne M B I; Jakimowicz, Jack J; Schoot, Benedictus C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2184-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22350237/,53
145474,Editor Profile: Albert Heck.,2021-09-01,"Rationale To prevent recurrent venous thrombotic events after acute cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis, guidelines recommend long-term oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant experience in cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis is limited to case reports and series. Aim To compare dabigatran with dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis for the prevention of recurrent venous thrombotic event. Sample size One hundred and twenty patients. Methods and design This study is a phase III, prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter, exploratory trial with blinded endpoint adjudication. Patients with acute cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis after 5-15 days of treatment with parenteral heparin are randomized to either dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily or dose-adjusted (international normalized ratio 2-3) warfarin (≤24 weeks). Study outcome The primary endpoint is a composite of patients with new venous thrombotic event (recurring cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis of any limb, pulmonary embolism, and major bleeding (International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis definition)) during the treatment period. Statistics will be descriptive (number and frequencies). Study timelines Inclusion started in December 2016. Final results are expected by the end of 2018. Discussion This exploratory trial is the first to compare vitamin K with non-vitamin K antagonists in cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis. It will provide evidence to guide physicians and patients in choosing oral anticoagulants to prevent venous thrombotic event after acute cerebral venous or dural sinus thrombosis.

STUDY DESIGN We conducted a retrospective chart review of 14 women with unexpected ovarian malignancy who underwent laparoscopic restaging surgery including peritoneal washing cytology, laparoscopic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy up to the left renal vein level, omentectomy, and multiple peritoneal biopsies, and hysterectomy except three fertility saving surgery. RESULTS The median age and median body mass index women were 49 years (range, 22-63) and 24.2m/kg(2) (range, 18.9-25.3), respectively. The median operating time was 230min (range, 155-370). The median numbers of harvested pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes were 26 (range, 6-41) and 18 (range, 2-40), respectively. The median return of bowel activity was 28h (range, 21-79). Four of the women were upstaged from the initial presumed stage. There were two intraoperative complications, laceration of the inferior vena cava and cisterna chyli rupture. There was one postoperative complication, port-site metastasis. There was no conversion to laparotomic surgery. The median follow-up period was 33 months. Thirteen of the patients have no evidence of recurrences, however one patient died after 22 months after the surgery. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic restaging surgery, performed by a specialized laparoscopic oncologist with sufficient laparoscopic experience and a well-trained operating team, is both feasible and effective in the management of unexpected ovarian malignancies.","Bae, Jaeman; Choi, Joong Sub; Lee, Won Moo; Koh, A Ra; Jung, Un Suk; Ko, Jung Hwa; Lee, Jung Hun","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2015.06.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26232726/,53
145596,"Five percent CO₂ is a potent, fast-acting inhalation anticonvulsant.",2011,"Purpose Inflammatory contributions from diet and adiposity may interact with respect to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We investigated the degree to which adiposity modified the association between dietary inflammatory potential and incident T2DM. Methods Data from 6,016 US men in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study who completed a 3-day diet record were used. The inflammatory potential of diet was characterized by the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®), and adiposity was assessed with body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage (BF) and waist-to-height ratio. Inverse probability weights were used in modified Poisson regression models to examine whether adiposity modifies the relationship between the DII and T2DM, while accounting for selection bias from participants who were lost to follow-up. Results There were 336 incident cases of T2DM after a mean follow-up of 6.5 years. DII scores were not significantly associated with T2DM incidence in multivariable models, but point estimates were consistently elevated across increasing DII quartiles compared to the most anti-inflammatory DII quartile. In the model that evaluated BF, the term for overall effect modification was significant (p = 0.02), but there was no evidence of effect modification on the multiplicative and additive scales when examined further. Effect modification was not present for any other adiposity measures. Conclusions We did not observe evidence that a pro-inflammatory diet, as measured by the DII, is associated with incidence of T2DM, nor evidence that adiposity modifies a potential relationship. Further investigation is needed in larger cohorts with longer follow-up.","Guinter, Mark A; Merchant, Anwar T; Tabung, Fred K; Wirth, Michael D; Shivappa, Nitin; Hurley, Thomas G; Hebert, James R; Sui, Xuemei; Blair, Steven N; Steck, Susan E",Journal of nutrition & intermediary metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnim.2019.100095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832587/,53
146412,Potential gingival crevicular fluid and serum biomarkers by stage of HIV infection.,2017,"The objective of this study was to describe the footprint location of the iliopsoas tendon on the lesser trochanter to clarify the surgical implications of the lesser trochanterplasty for treating ischiofemoral impingement. Ten non-matched, fresh-frozen, cadaveric hemipelvis specimens (average age, 62.4 years; range, 48-84 years; 7 male and 3 female) were included. Registered measures included bony parameters of the lesser trochanter (lesser trochanteric area, distances from the tip to the base in a coordinate system, height and area) and tendinous iliopsoas footprint descriptions (areas and detailed location). The mean height of the lesser trochanter was 13.1 (SD ± 1.8) mm, with female having a smaller lesser trochanter on average (11.3, SD ± 2.0). A double tendinous footprint was found in 7 (70%) specimens. The average area of the single- and double-footprint was 211.2 mm(2) and 187.9 mm(2), respectively. An anterior cortical area with no tendinous insertion on the anterior aspect of lesser trochanter was present in all specimens and measured 4.9 mm (SD ± 0.6) on average. The mean ratio between the bald anterior wall and the lesser trochanter height was 38% (SD ± 0.05). The iliopsoas tendon footprint is double (psoas and iliacus) in most cases and is located on the anteromedial tip of the lesser trochanter. A bald anterior wall on the bottom of the lesser trochanter indicates that a partial or total lesser trochanterplasty for increasing the ischiofemoral space without detaching partially or entirely the iliopsoas tendon is improbable.","Gómez-Hoyos, Juan; Schröder, Ricardo; Palmer, Ian J; Reddy, Manoj; Khoury, Anthony; Martin, Hal David",Journal of hip preservation surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/jhps/hnv060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27011863/,53
146774,Chronic tubal pregnancy manifesting as a heterogeneous adnexal mass with prominent neovascularization in a woman with a negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin level.,2019,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to place an immense burden on societies and health care systems. A key component of COVID-19 control efforts is serological testing to determine the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and quantify individual immune responses to prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. Here, we describe a laboratory-developed antibody test that uses readily available research-grade reagents to detect SARS-CoV-2 exposure in patient blood samples with high sensitivity and specificity. We further show that this sensitive test affords the estimation of viral spike-specific IgG titers from a single sample measurement, thereby providing a simple and scalable method to measure the strength of an individual's immune response. The accuracy, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness of this test make it an excellent option for clinical deployment in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.IMPORTANCE Serological surveillance has become an important public health tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Detection of protective antibodies and seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination can help guide patient care plans and public health policies. Serology tests can detect antibodies against past infections; consequently, they can help overcome the shortcomings of molecular tests, which can detect only active infections. This is important, especially when considering that many COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic. In this study, we describe an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based qualitative and quantitative serology test developed to measure IgG and IgA antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The test can be deployed using commonly available laboratory reagents and equipment and displays high specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IgG titers in patient samples can be estimated from a single measurement, enabling the assay's use in high-throughput clinical environments.","Bortz, Robert H; Florez, Catalina; Laudermilch, Ethan; Wirchnianski, Ariel S; Lasso, Gorka; Malonis, Ryan J; Georgiev, George I; Vergnolle, Olivia; Herrera, Natalia G; Morano, Nicholas C; Campbell, Sean T; Orner, Erika P; Mengotto, Amanda; Dieterle, M Eugenia; Fels, J Maximilian; Haslwanter, Denise; Jangra, Rohit K; Celikgil, Alev; Kimmel, Duncan; Lee, James H; Mariano, Margarette C; Nakouzi, Antonio; Quiroz, Jose; Rivera, Johanna; Szymczak, Wendy A; Tong, Karen; Barnhill, Jason; Forsell, Mattias N E; Ahlm, Clas; Stein, Daniel T; Pirofski, Liise-Anne; Goldstein, D Yitzchak; Garforth, Scott J; Almo, Steven C; Daily, Johanna P; Prystowsky, Michael B; Faix, James D; Fox, Amy S; Weiss, Louis M; Lai, Jonathan R; Chandran, Kartik",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00224-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883259/,53

While telemedicine in cardiology is well documented, reports on virtual care in the form of synchronous, real-time communication between healthcare providers and patients are limited. As a result of the immediate suspension of ambulatory services for cardiology in Alberta, Canada, due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, we undertook a rapid review on the impact of non-virtual visits in cardiovascular ambulatory settings on patients' healthcare utilization and mortality. Evidence from 12 randomized control trials and 7 systematic reviews was included in the rapid review, with the majority of papers (n = 15) focusing on telemedicine in heart failure. Based on our appraisal of evidence from the last 5 years, virtual visits are non-inferior, or more effective, in reducing hospitalizations and visits to emergency departments in patients with CVD compared to traditional standard in-clinic/ambulatory care. The evidence for a superior effect of virtual visits in reducing mortality was not supported in this review. While telemedicine is an appropriate tool for CVD follow-up care, more research into the efficacy of different components of telemedicine and virtual visits is required.","Piskulic, Danijela; McDermott, Susanna; Seal, Lauren; Vallaire, Shelley; Norris, Colleen M",European journal of cardiovascular nursing : journal of the Working Group on Cardiovascular Nursing of the European Society of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjcn/zvab084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34632501/,53

OBJECTIVES To compare the rima glottidis area during DRE pre- and post LP; document all forms of dynamic upper airway obstruction (DUAO) pre- and post LP and investigate the relationship between post operative abduction at rest and exercise. STUDY DESIGN Prospective case series. METHODS Thoroughbred racehorses with pre- and post LP DRE were included. Left-to-right arytenoid cartilage angle ratios and rima glottidis area ratios were used to quantify laryngeal function during rest and exercise, pre- and post LP. RESULTS In 35 horses, mean pre-LP ratios were greater during rest (left-to-right quotient angle ratio [LRQ] 0.76 ± 0.13; left-to-right arytenoid ratio [LRR] 0.72 ± 0.14; rima glottidis area ratio [RGA] 0.40 ± 0.10) than exercise (LRQ 0.39 ± 0.16, P < 0.001; LRR 0.38 ± 0.16, P < 0.001; RGA 0.15 ± 0.05, P < 0.001). Exercising ratios were larger post LP (LRQ 0.61 ± 0.13; LRR 0.60 ± 0.12; RGA 0.30 ± 0.08) than pre-LP (LRQ 0.39 ± 0.16, P < 0.001; LRR 0.38 ± 0.16, P < 0.001; RGA 0.15 ± 0.05, P < 0.001). A positive linear relationship was found between post LP resting and exercising ratios (R(2) = 0.48; P < 0.001) and post operative abduction grades (R(2) = 0.63; P < 0.001). Pre-LP all horses demonstrated left arytenoid cartilage collapse with bilateral vocal cord collapse and 37% had aryepiglottic fold collapse. Post LP 13 horses (37%) developed additional DUAOs and these horses had smaller RGAs (0.25 ± 0.08) than horses that did not develop DUAOs (0.32 ± 0.07, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Multiple forms of DUAO occurred pre-LP and additional forms often developed post LP. Post LP the degree of arytenoid cartilage abduction at rest was useful to predict the degree of abduction during exercise.","Leutton, J L; Lumsden, J M",Equine veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/evj.12331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25124793/,53

Simultaneous values of cerebral tissue oxygenation (StO2) are measured using both devices in 15 term and 15 preterm clinically stable newborns on the first and third day of life. Values are recorded simultaneously in two periods between which oximeter sensor positions are switched to the contralateral side. Agreement between StO2 values before and after the change of sensor position is analyzed. We find that mean cerebral StO2 values are similar between devices for term and preterm babies, but INVOS shows StO2 values spread over a wider range, with wider standard deviations than shown by the FORE-SIGHT. There is relatively good agreement with a bias up to 3.5% and limits of agreement up to 11.8%. Measurements from each side of the forehead show better repeatability for the FORE-SIGHT monitor. We conclude that performance of the two devices is probably acceptable for clinical purposes. Both performed sufficiently well, but the use of FORE-SIGHT may be associated with tighter range and better repeatability of data.","Szczapa, Tomasz; Karpiński, Łukasz; Moczko, Jerzy; Weindling, Michael; Kornacka, Alicja; Wróblewska, Katarzyna; Adamczak, Aleksandra; Jopek, Aleksandra; Chojnacka, Karolina; Gadzinowski, Janusz",Journal of biomedical optics,https://doi.org/10.1117/1.jbo.18.8.087006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23974347/,53

Laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy (LsTG) is reported to be suitable procedure compared with laparoscopic proximal and total gastrectomy (LPG, LTG), regarding postoperative nutritional status and surgical safety. However, whether LsTG is an oncologically acceptable procedure for early gastric cancer in the upper gastric body is unclear. METHODS We analyzed 215 patients with cT1N0M0 gastric cancer limitedly located in the upper gastric body. The frequency of conversion from each intended procedure to an alternative procedure, the width of the pathological margin, the incidence of lymph node metastasis at each station and the 3-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were evaluated. RESULTS LsTG was planned for 65 patients, and LPG for 72 and LTG for 78, respectively. Conversion to other procedures was required in about 10% of patients for whom LsTG or LPG was planned. The width of the pathological margin in patients who underwent LsTG was significantly shorter than patients who underwent the others. No patients who underwent LsTG, LPG or LTG had metastases in station no. 2 or 4sa lymph node. The 3-year OS and RFS rates of patients for whom each procedure was planned were not different. CONCLUSIONS LsTG could be an oncologically acceptable procedure for cT1N0M0 gastric cancer in the upper gastric body. LsTG could be one option for such disease.","Kano, Yosuke; Ohashi, Manabu; Ida, Satoshi; Kumagai, Koshi; Nunobe, Souya; Sano, Takeshi; Hiki, Naoki",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-019-00947-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830641/,53

In the outbreak of COVID-19, we generated a lipopeptide EK1V1 by modifying EK1 with cholesterol, which exhibited significantly improved antiviral activity. In this study, we surprisingly found that EK1V1 also displayed potent cross-inhibitory activities against divergent HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates. Consistently, the recently reported EK1 derivative EK1C4 and SARS-CoV-2 derived fusion inhibitor lipopeptides (IPB02 ∼ IPB09) also inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion and infection efficiently. In the inhibition of a panel of HIV-1 mutants resistant to HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, EK1V1 and IPB02-based inhibitors exhibited significantly decreased or increased activities, suggesting the heptad repeat-1 region (HR1) of HIV-1 gp41 being their target. Furthermore, the sequence alignment and molecular docking analyses verified the target site and revealed the mechanism underlying the resistance. Combined, we conclude that this serendipitous discovery provides a proof-of-concept for a common mechanism of viral fusion and critical information for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals.","Yu, Danwei; Zhu, Yuanmei; Yan, Hongxia; Wu, Tong; Chong, Huihui; He, Yuxian",Emerging microbes & infections,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1917309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33847245/,53

Our study objective was to understand changes in emergency department (ED) utilization following a nonfatal opioid overdose during COVID-19 compared to historical controls in 6 healthcare systems across the United States. METHODS Opioid overdoses were retrospectively identified among adult visits to 25 EDs in Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island from January 2018 to December 2020. Overdose visit counts and rates per 100 all-cause ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with the levels predicted based on 2018 and 2019 visits using graphical analysis and an epidemiologic outbreak detection cumulative sum algorithm. RESULTS Overdose visit counts increased by 10.5% (n=3486; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.18% to 17.0%) in 2020 compared with the counts in 2018 and 2019 (n=3020 and n=3285, respectively), despite a 14% decline in all-cause ED visits. Opioid overdose rates increased by 28.5% (95% CI 23.3% to 34.0%) from 0.25 per 100 ED visits in 2018 to 2019 to 0.32 per 100 ED visits in 2020. Although all 6 studied health care systems experienced overdose ED visit rates more than the 95th percentile prediction in 6 or more weeks of 2020 (compared with 2.6 weeks as expected by chance), 2 health care systems experienced sustained outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION Despite decreases in ED visits for other medical emergencies, the numbers and rates of opioid overdose-related ED visits in 6 health care systems increased during 2020, suggesting a widespread increase in opioid-related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanded community- and hospital-based interventions are needed to support people with opioid use disorder and save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Soares, William E; Melnick, Edward R; Nath, Bidisha; D'Onofrio, Gail; Paek, Hyung; Skains, Rachel M; Walter, Lauren A; Casey, Martin F; Napoli, Anthony; Hoppe, Jason A; Jeffery, Molly M",Annals of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.03.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34119326/,53
147985,Standardizing and auditing OR cleaning to reduce surgical site infections.,2020-12-01,"Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 infection of mice is a useful tool for studying virus-host interaction during hepatitis development. The NS2H126R mutant is attenuated in liver replication due to loss of phosphodiesterase activity, which the wild-type (WT) virus uses to block the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L (RNase L) antiviral pathway. The activation of RNase L by NS2H126R is cell type dependent and correlates with high basal expression levels of OAS, as found in myeloid cells. We tested the hypothesis that the resident liver macrophages, Kupffer cells (KC), represent the cell type most likely to restrict NS2H126R and prevent hepatitis. As found previously, A59 and NS2H126R replicate similarly in hepatocytes and neither activates RNase L, as assessed by an rRNA degradation assay. In contrast, in KC, A59 exhibited a 100-fold-higher titer than NS2H126R and NS2H126R induced rRNA degradation. Interestingly, in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), the cells that form a barrier between blood and liver parenchymal cells, NS2H126R activates RNase L, which limits viral replication. Similar growth kinetics were observed for the two viruses in KC and LSEC from RNase L-/- mice, demonstrating that both use RNase L to limit NS2H126R replication. Depletion of KC by gadolinium(III) chloride or of LSEC by cyclophosphamide partially restores liver replication of NS2H126R, leading to hepatitis. Thus, during mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection, hepatitis, which damages the parenchyma, is prevented by RNase L activity in both KC and LSEC but not in hepatocytes. This may be explained by the undetectable levels of RNase L as well as by the OASs expressed in hepatocytes. IMPORTANCE Mouse hepatitis virus infection of mice provides a useful tool for studying virus-host interactions during hepatitis development. The NS2H126R mutant is attenuated in liver replication due to loss of phosphodiesterase activity, by which the wild-type virus blocks the potent OAS-RNase L antiviral pathway. RNase L activation by NS2H126R is cell type dependent and correlates with high basal expression levels of OAS, as found in myeloid cells. We showed that the hepatocytes that comprise the liver parenchyma do not activate RNase L when infected with NS2H126R or restrict replication. However, both Kupffer cells (KC) (i.e., the liver-resident macrophages) and the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) which line the sinusoids activate RNase L in response to NS2H126R These data suggest that KC and LSEC prevent viral spread into the parenchyma, preventing hepatitis. Furthermore, hepatocytes express undetectable levels of OASs and RNase L, which likely explains the lack of RNase L activation during NS2H126R infection.","Li, Yize; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01423-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27558415/,53
148056,Determining the kinetic constants leading to mineralization of dilute carbamazepine and estradiol-containing solutions under continuous supercritical water oxidation conditions.,2021-08-02,"INTRODUCTION Complete pancreatic rupture is a rare injury. The typical mechanism by which this occurs is overstretching of the pancreas across the vertebral column during blunt abdominal trauma. The management of this injury depends on the location and extent of the injury. CASE PRESENTATION A 45-year-old Caucasian woman presented with blunt abdominal trauma after she fell onto the end of a handlebar during a bicycle accident. She arrived in the emergency room with stable vital signs and an isolated bruise just above the umbilicus. A computed tomography scan revealed a complete rupture of the pancreas, just ventral to her superior mesenteric vein, and an accompanying hematoma but no additional injuries. An emergency laparotomy was performed; the head of the pancreas was oversewn with interrupted sutures and this was followed by a two-layer pancreaticojejunostomy with the tail of the pancreas. The recovery after surgery was completely uneventful. CONCLUSIONS Isolated complete pancreatic rupture is a rare injury that can be managed with complete organ preservation. The combination of suturing the pancreatic head and two-layer pancreaticojejunostomy with the pancreatic tail is a feasible technique to manage this condition.","Kreis, Martin E; Albertsmeier, Markus; Graser, Anno; Krenz, Detlef; Jauch, Karl-Walter; Thasler, Wolfgang E",Journal of medical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-1947-5-456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21917159/,53

To identify the issue, we examined the relationship of hand dimensions and grip force with the operation force of a mechanical circular stapler. METHODS Hand dimensions and grip force were measured in 113 Japanese surgeons (52 men and 61 women). We then evaluated the relationship between grip width and the operation force required to push the lever of the stapler, at three points on the lever, using a digital force gauge. RESULTS The optimal grip width of the dominant hand was 62.5 ± 8.5 mm for men and 55.5 ± 5.9 mm for women (p < 0.001). The maximum grip force of the dominant hand was 44.2 ± 6.1 kg for men and 29.7 ± 4.5 kg for women (p < 0.001) and the maximum operation force required to push the lever 7.0, 45.0, and 73.0 mm from the end of the lever was 21.8, 28.6, and 42.4 kg, respectively. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first ergonomic study of a surgical stapler to be conducted in Asia. Firing the stapler by gripping the proximal side of the lever is physically impossible for most Japanese women surgeons since the required operation force exceeds the maximum grip force, which probably accounts for the stress perceived by these women.","Kono, Emiko; Tada, Mitsunori; Kouchi, Makiko; Endo, Yui; Tomizawa, Yasuko; Matsuo, Tomoko; Nomura, Sachiyo",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-013-0666-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23893125/,53

This process can be burdensome for both patients and clinicians but is necessary to assess the efficacy and complication rate of nerve blocks. METHODS We present our experience developing an automated system for completing follow-up via short message service text messaging and our preliminary results using it at three clinical sites. The system is built on REDCap, a secure online research data capture platform developed by Vanderbilt University and currently available worldwide. RESULTS Our automated system queried patients who received a variety of nerve block techniques, assessed patient-reported nerve block duration, and surveyed patients for potential complications. Patient response rate to text messaging averaged 91% (higher than our rates of daily phone contact reported previously) for patients aged 18 to 90 years. CONCLUSIONS Given the wide availability of REDCap, we believe this automated text messaging system can be implemented in a variety of health systems at low cost with minimal technical expertise and will improve both the consistency of patient follow-up and the service efficiency of regional anesthesia practices.","Gessner, Daniel; Hunter, Oluwatobi O; Kou, Alex; Mariano, Edward R",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2021-102472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33649155/,53

We aimed to compare the operative, hospitalization, and total economic costs of open (OLR) vs. laparoscopic (LLR) vs. robotic liver resection (RLR). METHODS We performed a systematic literature review (end-of-search date: July 3, 2020) according to the PRISMA statement. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Quality assessment was performed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-randomized studies. RESULTS Thirty-eight studies reporting on 3847 patients (1783 OLR; 1674 LLR; 390 RLR) were included. The operative costs of LLR were significantly higher than those of OLR, while subgroup analysis also showed higher operative costs in the LLR group for major hepatectomy, but no statistically significant difference for minor hepatectomy. Hospitalization costs were significantly lower in the LLR group, with subgroup analyses indicating lower costs for LLR in both major and minor hepatectomy series. No statistically significant difference was observed regarding total costs between LLR and OLR both overall and on subgroup analyses in either major or minor hepatectomy series. Meta-analyses showed higher operative, hospitalization, and total costs for RLR vs. LLR, but no statistically significant difference regarding total costs for RLR vs. OLR. CONCLUSION LLR's higher operative costs are offset by lower hospitalization costs compared to OLR leading to no statistically significant difference in total costs, while RLR appears to be a more expensive alternative approach.","Ziogas, Ioannis A; Evangeliou, Alexandros P; Mylonas, Konstantinos S; Athanasiadis, Dimitrios I; Cherouveim, Panagiotis; Geller, David A; Schulick, Richard D; Alexopoulos, Sophoclis P; Tsoulfas, Georgios",The European journal of health economics : HEPAC : health economics in prevention and care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-021-01277-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740153/,53

The potential interplay between several factors, including inherently lower estradiol (E2) and slightly higher estrogen receptor β (ERβ) levels in males, with inflammatory mediators are described. Altogether, there seems to be a sexually dimorphic response towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a possibility that COVID-19 severity is dependent on both E2 levels and ERα:ERβ expression ratio in lymphoid and lung cells.","Ulhaq, Z S; Soraya, G V; Zambrano, L E A; Garcia, C P",Acta endocrinologica,https://doi.org/10.4183/aeb.2020.522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084248/,53
151052,Lockdown.,2020-04-01,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus is an emerging bunyavirus that causes a hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate. The virus is likely tick-borne and replicates primarily in hemopoietic cells, which may lead to disregulation of proinflammatory cytokine induction and loss of leukocytes and platelets. The viral genome contains L, M, and S segments encoding a viral RNA polymerase, glycoproteins G(n) and G(c), nucleoprotein (NP), and a nonstructural S segment (NSs) protein. NSs protein is involved in the regulation of host innate immune responses and suppression of IFNβ-promoter activities. In this article, we demonstrate that NSs protein can form viroplasm-like structures (VLSs) in infected and transfected cells. NSs protein molecules interact with one another, interact with NP, and were associated with viral RNA in infected cells, suggesting that NSs protein may be involved in viral replication. Furthermore, we observed that NSs-formed VLS colocalized with lipid droplets and that inhibitors of fatty acid biosynthesis decreased VLS formation or viral replication in transfected and infected cells. Finally, we have demonstrated that viral dsRNAs were also localized in VLS in infected cells, suggesting that NSs-formed VLS may be implicated in the replication of SFTS bunyavirus. These findings identify a novel function of nonstructural NSs in SFTSV-infected cells where it is a scaffolding component in a VLS functioning as a virus replication factory. This function is in addition to the role of NSs protein in modulating host responses that will broaden our understanding of viral pathogenesis of phleboviruses.","Wu, Xiaodong; Qi, Xian; Liang, Mifang; Li, Chuan; Cardona, Carol J; Li, Dexin; Xing, Zheng",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.13-243857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599967/,53

This study investigates whether providing caregivers with one-time tailored information on the vaccination schedule improves the vaccine uptake among children.Methods: The study participants were 534 women each with a child age 8 months or less; they were from 11 settlements in Jada, a local government area in Adamawa state, Nigeria. The study was conducted on September 2019 to June 2020. Women were randomly selected to be assigned to a treatment group to be provided with one-time tailored information on their children's current vaccination status and the next schedule for vaccination, while women in the control group were provided with generic information on the vaccination schedule. We employed the ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression depending on the type of dependent variables to analyze the treatment effect.Results: After the women received tailored information on the vaccination schedule, the number of clinic visits for vaccination increased. However, the tailored information did not improve the vaccine uptake among children at a particular age nor the full vaccination rate.Conclusion: One-time tailored information has an immediate but no sustainable effect.

151138,In reply to Giuliani et al.,2021-06-14,"- CLEAN VERSION Introduction: There are growing concerns among European health authorities regarding increasing prices for new cancer medicines, prices not necessarily linked to health gain and the implications for the sustainability of their healthcare systems. Areas covered: Narrative discussion principally among payers and their advisers regarding potential approaches to the pricing of new cancer medicines. Expert commentary: A number of potential pricing approaches are discussed including minimum effectiveness levels for new cancer medicines, managed entry agreements, multicriteria decision analyses (MCDAs), differential/tiered pricing, fair pricing models, amortization models as well as de-linkage models. We are likely to see a growth in alternative pricing deliberations in view of ongoing challenges including the considerable number of new cancer medicines in development including new gene therapies and being launched with uncertainty regarding their value, continued high prices coupled with the extent of confidential discounts for reimbursement; however, balanced against the need for new cancer medicines. This will lead to greater scrutiny over the prices of patent oncology medicines as more standard medicines lose their patent, calls for greater transparency as well as new models including amortization models. We will be monitoring these developments.","Godman, Brian; Hill, Andrew; Simoens, Steven; Selke, Gisbert; Selke Krulichová, Iva; Zampirolli Dias, Carolina; Martin, Antony P; Oortwijn, Wija; Timoney, Angela; Gustafsson, Lars; Voncina, Luka; Kwon, Hye-Young; Gulbinovic, Jolanta; Gotham, Dzintars; Wale, Janet; Silva, Wânia Cristina da; Bochenek, Tomasz; Allocati, Eleonora; Kurdi, Amanj; Ogunleye, Olayinka O; Meyer, Johanna C; Hoxha, Iris; Malaj, Admir; Hierländer, Christian; Sauermann, Robert; Hamelinck, Wouter; Petrova, Guenka; Laius, Ott; Langner, Irene; Yfantopoulos, John; Joppi, Roberta; Jakupi, Arianit; Greiciute-Kuprijanov, Ieva; Vella Bonanno, Patricia; Piepenbrink, Jf Hans; de Valk, Vincent; Wladysiuk, Magdalene; Marković-Peković, Vanda; Mardare, Ileana; Fürst, Jurij; Tomek, Dominik; Obach Cortadellas, Mercè; Zara, Corinne; Pontes, Caridad; McTaggart, Stuart; Laba, Tracey-Lea; Melien, Øyvind; Wong-Rieger, Durhane; Bae, SeungJin; Hill, Ruaraidh",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2021.1884546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33535841/,53

Mammals express at least four distinctly regulated groups of MAPKs which include extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)-1/2, p38 proteins, Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3) and ERK5. p38 MAPK is activated by a wide range of cellular stresses and modulates activity of several downstream kinases and transcription factors which are involved in regulating cytoskeleton remodeling, cell cycle modulation, inflammation, antiviral response and apoptosis. In viral infections, activation of cell signalling pathways is part of the cellular defense mechanism with the basic aim of inducing an antiviral state. However, viruses can exploit enhanced cell signalling activities to support various stages of their replication cycles. Kinase activity can be inhibited by small molecule chemical inhibitors, so one strategy to develop antiviral drugs is to target these cellular signalling pathways. In this review, we provide an overview on the current understanding of various cellular and viral events regulated by the p38 signalling pathway, with a special emphasis on targeting these events for antiviral drug development which might identify candidates with broad spectrum activity.","Chander, Yogesh; Kumar, Ram; Khandelwal, Nitin; Singh, Namita; Shringi, Brij Nandan; Barua, Sanjay; Kumar, Naveen",Reviews in medical virology,https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33450133/,53

152043,Some aspects of the airborne transmission of infection.,2009,"Background Major burns are life threatening. Fluid resuscitation is required for survival to maintain intravascular volumes and prevent hypovolemic shock. Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) has been recognised as a potential method of monitoring fluid shifts after burn and in other disease states. The aims of this study were to examine the reliability of BIS across different dressing conditions and electrode positions, establish the influence of Acticoat™ on BIS variable measures and determine the validity of whole-body BIS to assess net fluid shift in the presence of moderate to major burns. Methods An observational longitudinal cohort study was conducted from December 2014 to February 2016. Patients with over 15% total body surface area (TBSA) burns and injury less than 48 h were enrolled in the study. BIS triplicate measures were collected in an open wound and with an ActicoatTM dressing (at 5 half hour intervals). Standard and alternate electrode placements were utilised for the reliability analysis and standard placement only for determining the validity of BIS in moderate to major burns. The ImpediMde SFB7 was used to collect whole-body and segmental BIS measures. Stata statistical software, release 14 was utilised to analyse all results. Descriptive analyses were performed and were reported using the means and standard deviations (SD). Results BIS-repeated measures established BIS raw resistance (R), and predicted volume variables were reliable in any condition (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.996-0.999, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.996-0.999) without a systematic difference. Acticoat™ dressings significantly influenced all BIS-predicted volumes (p ≤ 0.01) as determined by multilevel mixed effects (MLME) linear regression analysis. Validity of BIS was demonstrated by resistance variables significantly decreasing with increasing net ionic fluid shift and increased TBSA (severity of injury) and calculated fluid volumes increasing with increasing net fluid shift and TBSA. BIS resistance also decreased with time as oedema reduced. For clinical use, a calculator was developed to adjust BIS variables when an Acticoat™ dressing is in situ, thus facilitating BIS variable change estimates in real time, with dressings intact. Conclusion BIS may be used clinically to monitor fluid volume change in major acute burns.","Kenworthy, Pippa; Phillips, Michael; Grisbrook, Tiffany L; Gibson, William; Wood, Fiona M; Edgar, Dale W",Burns & trauma,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41038-017-0105-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30009191/,53

DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. SETTING The Ottawa Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS Patients who gave birth at The Ottawa Hospital and were >20 days post partum between 17 March and 16 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Perinatal IPV was defined as regular controlling behaviours or act-based forms of emotional/physical/sexual abuse in the 12 months before pregnancy, during pregnancy and/or post partum. Log-binomial multivariable regression models were used to compute adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs to identify potential risk factors for IPV: maternal age, postpartum depression, parity, increase in partner substance use and household income. RESULTS Among 216 participants, the median maternal age was 33 years (IQR: 30-36). In total, 52 (24.07%) reported some form of perinatal IPV, 37 (17.13%) reported regular controlling behaviour and 9 (4.17%) reported both. Household income below the municipal median was the strongest risk factor for perinatal IPV (aRR: 3.24, 95% CI: 1.87 to 5.59). There was no apparent association between maternal age (aRR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.04), postpartum depression (aRR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.07), nulliparity (aRR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.97) or increases in partner substance use (aRR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.25) with IPV. CONCLUSION One in four individuals in this study experienced perinatal IPV. Household income was the strongest risk factor, and surprisingly, many hypothesised risk factors (eg, mental health, partner substance use, etc) were not significantly associated with perinatal IPV in this sample. This highlights the challenges in both measuring IPV and identifying individuals exposed to perinatal IPV during the high stress of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Muldoon, Katherine A; Denize, Kathryn M; Talarico, Robert; Boisvert, Carlie; Frank, Olivia; Harvey, Alysha L J; Rennicks White, Ruth; Fell, Deshayne B; O'Hare-Gordon, Meagan Ann; Guo, Yanfang; Murphy, Malia S Q; Corsi, Daniel J; Sampsel, Kari; Wen, Shi Wu; Walker, Mark C; El-Chaar, Darine",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045216/,53

Those affected suffer from severe functional impairment that can persist for years. First studies suggest a positive effect of physiotherapy and early mobilisation. However, the ideal intervention for a preferential functional outcome is not known. So far no randomised controlled trial has been conducted to specifically evaluate an early endurance and resistance training in the mechanically ventilated, critically ill patient. METHODS/DESIGN A randomised controlled trial with blinded assessors and 6-month follow-up will be conducted in a tertiary, interdisciplinary intensive care unit in Switzerland. Participants (n = 115; expected dropouts: n = 15) will be randomised to a control group receiving standard physiotherapy and to an experimental group that undergoes early mobilisation combined with endurance and resistance training. The inclusion criteria are being aged 18 years or older, expected mechanical ventilation for more than 72 h and qualitative independence before the illness. Primary endpoints are functional capacity (6-Minute Walk Test) and the ability to perform activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure) measured at hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints include muscle strength (Medical Research Council sum score, handgrip strength and handheld dynamometry for quadriceps muscle), joint contractures (range of motion), exercise capacity (Timed 'Up & Go' Test) and health-related quality of life (Short Form 36). Safety will be monitored during interventions by indirect calorimetry and continuous intensive care standard monitoring. All previously defined adverse events will be noted. The statistical analysis will be by intention-to-treat with the level of significance set at p < 0.05. DISCUSSION This prospective, single-centre, allocation-concealed and assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial will evaluate participant's function after an early endurance and resistance training compared to standard care. Limitations of this study are the heterogeneity of the critically ill and the discontinuity of the protocol after relocation to the ward. The strengths lie in the pragmatic design and the clinical significance of the chosen outcome measures.

153694,Dare to be different.,2020-12-11,"BACKGROUND Alström syndrome (ALMS) is a monogenic ultra-rare disorder with a prevalence of one per million inhabitants caused by pathogenic variants of ALMS1 gene. ALMS1 is located on chromosome 2p13, spans 23 exons and encodes a predicted 461.2-kDa protein of 4169 amino acids. The infantile cone-rod dystrophy with nystagmus and severe visual impairment is the earliest and most consistent clinical manifestation of ALMS. In addition, infantile transient cardiomyopathy, early childhood obesity with hyperphagia, deafness, insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), systemic fibrosis and progressive renal or liver dysfunction are common findings. ALMS1 encodes a large ubiquitously expressed protein that is associated with the centrosome and the basal body of primary cilium. CURRENT RESEARCH The localisation of ALMS1 to the ciliary basal body suggests its contribution to ciliogenesis and/or normal ciliary function, or centriolar stability. ALMS1 regulate glucose transport through the actin cytoskeleton, which plays an important role in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 transport. Both extreme IR and β-cell failure are the two determinant factors responsible for the development of glucose metabolism alterations in ALMS. TREATMENT Currently, there is no known cure for ALMS other than managing the underlying systemic diseases. When possible, individuals with ALMS and families should be referred to a centre of expertise and followed by a multidisciplinary team. Lifestyle modification, aerobic exercise and dietary induced weight loss are highly recommended as primary treatment for ALMS patients with T2DM and obesity. CONCLUSION Managing a rare disease requires not only medical care but also a support network including patient associations.","Dassie, Francesca; Favaretto, Francesca; Bettini, Silvia; Parolin, Matteo; Valenti, Marina; Reschke, Felix; Danne, Thomas; Vettor, Roberto; Milan, Gabriella; Maffei, Pietro",Endocrine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-021-02643-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566311/,53

The rapidly adapting cation channel PIEZO2 has been identified as necessary for muscle spindle afferent stretch sensitivity, but the properties of this channel suggest additional molecular elements are necessary for mediating the complex slowly adapting response of muscle spindle afferents. We report that glutamate increases muscle spindle afferent static sensitivity in an ex vivo mouse muscle nerve preparation, while blocking glutamate packaging into vesicles by the sole vesicular glutamate transporter, VGLUT1, either pharmacologically or by transgenic knock out of one allele of VGLUT1 decreases muscle spindle afferent static but not dynamic sensitivity. Our results confirm that vesicle-released glutamate is an important contributor to maintained muscle spindle afferent excitability and may suggest a therapeutic target for normalizing muscle spindle afferent function. ABSTRACT Muscle spindle afferents are slowly adapting low threshold mechanoreceptors which have both dynamic and static sensitivity to muscle stretch. The exact mechanism by which these neurons translate muscle movement into action potentials is not well understood, although the PIEZO2 mechanically sensitive cation channel is essential for stretch sensitivity. PIEZO2 is rapidly adapting, suggesting the requirement for additional molecular elements to maintain firing during stretch. Spindle afferent sensory endings contain glutamate-filled synaptic-like vesicles which are released in a stretch and calcium dependent manner. Previous work has shown that glutamate can increase and a phospholipase-D coupled metabotropic glutamate antagonist can abolish firing during static stretch. Here we test the hypothesis that vesicle-released glutamate is necessary for maintaining muscle spindle afferent excitability during static but not dynamic stretch. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse muscle-nerve ex vivo preparation to measure identified muscle spindle afferent responses to stretch and vibration. In C57BL/6 adult mice, bath applied glutamate significantly increased the firing rate during the plateau phase of stretch, but not during the dynamic phase of stretch. Blocking the packaging of glutamate into vesicles by the sole vesicular glutamate transporter, VGLUT1, either with xanthurenic acid or by using a transgenic mouse with only one copy of the VGLUT1 gene (VGLUT1+/- ) decreased muscle spindle afferent firing during sustained stretch, but not during vibration. Our results suggest a model of mechanotransduction where calcium entering the PIEZO2 channel can cause the release of glutamate from synaptic-like vesicles which then helps to maintain afferent depolarization and firing.

This condition is frequently misdiagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis, lymphoma, schistosomiasis, Wegener's granuloma, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or severe community-acquired pneumonia. Herein, we report a case in which computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous lung biopsy was used to diagnose EP without alveolar eosinophilia or peripheral eosinophilia. A roundworm identified in the patient's stool confirmed the precise diagnosis to be parasitic EP. This is, to our knowledge, the first reported case of EP confirmed by CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy.

The SARS-CoV M(pro) and related CoV proteases have several distinct features, such as an uncharged Cys-His catalytic dyad embedded in a chymotrypsin-like protease fold, that clearly separate these enzymes from archetypical cysteine proteases. To further characterize the catalytic system of CoV main proteases and to obtain information about improved inhibitors, we performed comprehensive simulations of the proton-transfer reactions in the SARS-CoV M(pro) active site that lead to the Cys(-)/His(+) zwitterionic state required for efficient proteolytic activity. Our simulations, comprising the free enzyme as well as substrate-enzyme and inhibitor-enzyme complexes, lead us to predict that zwitterion formation is fostered by substrate binding but not inhibitor binding. This indicates that M(pro) employs a substrate-induced catalytic mechanism that further enhances its substrate specificity. Our computational data are in line with available experimental results, such as X-ray geometries, measured pKa values, mutagenesis experiments, and the measured differences between the kinetic parameters of substrates and inhibitors. The data also provide an atomistic picture of the formerly postulated electrostatic trigger involved in SARS-CoV M(pro) activity. Finally, they provide information on how a specific microenvironment may finely tune the activity of M(pro) toward specific viral protein substrates, which is known to be required for efficient viral replication. Our simulations also indicate that the low inhibition potencies of known covalently interacting inhibitors may, at least in part, be attributed to insufficient fostering of the proton-transfer reaction. These findings suggest ways to achieve improved inhibitors.","Paasche, Alexander; Zipper, Andreas; Schäfer, Simon; Ziebuhr, John; Schirmeister, Tanja; Engels, Bernd",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bi400604t; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25196915/,53
154524,Percutaneous Removal of Filter-Induced Iliocaval Thrombus Using the AngioVac Device.,2015,"OBJECTIVE Retailers that primarily or exclusively sell electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or vaping products represent a new category of tobacco retailer. We sought to identify (a) how vape shops can be identified and (b) sales and marketing practices of vape shops. DATA SOURCES A medical librarian iteratively developed a search strategy and in February 2017 searched seven academic databases (ABI/INFORM Complete, ECONLit, Embase, Entrepreneurship, PsycINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus). We hand searched Tobacco Regulatory Science and Tobacco Prevention & Cessation. STUDY SELECTION We used dual, independent screening. Records were eligible if published in 2010 or later, were peer-reviewed journal articles and focused on vape shops. DATA EXTRACTION We used dual, independent data abstraction and assessed risk of bias. Of the 3605 records identified, 22 were included. DATA SYNTHESIS We conducted a narrative systematic review. Researchers relied heavily on Yelp to identify vape shops. Vape shop owners use innovative marketing strategies that sometimes diverge from those of traditional tobacco retailers. Vape shop staff believe strongly that their products are effective harm-reduction products. Vape shops were more common in areas with more White residents. CONCLUSIONS Vape shops represent a new type of retailer for tobacco products. Vape shops have potential to promote e-cigarettes for smoking cessation but also sometimes provide inaccurate information and mislabelled products. Given their spatial patterning, vape shops may perpetuate inequities in tobacco use. The growing literature on vape shops is complicated by researchers using different definitions of vape shops (eg, exclusively selling e-cigarettes vs also selling traditional tobacco products).","Lee, Joseph G L; Orlan, Elizabeth N; Sewell, Kerry B; Ribisl, Kurt M",Tobacco control,https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2017-054015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29208738/,53

155224,This issue of Acta.,2020-06-01,"PURPOSE Although ethanol ablation (EA) is effective in the treatment of cystic thyroid nodules, it is less effective in nodules with solid component. Therefore refractory cases with solid component require another treatment modality such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which is effective in both solid and cystic thyroid nodules. We prospectively evaluated the efficacy of additional RFA and factors related to volume reduction in patients showing unsatisfactory results after a single session of EA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Of 94 patients with predominantly cystic thyroid nodules who underwent EA, 20 patients underwent additional RFA because of incompletely resolved clinical problems (symptomatic score reduction <50%) and presence of residual solid component at 1-month follow-up on ultrasonography. Improvement of clinical symptoms and nodule volume reduction were evaluated 6 month later. We evaluated factors related to nodule volume reduction after EA and RFA. RESULTS RFA after a single session of EA was effective in reducing mean symptom score from 4.8 to 1.1 (p<0.001), mean cosmetic score from 3.5 to 1.4 (p<0.001) and mean nodule volume from 11.3 to 0.9 mL (p<0.001). The only independent factor related to volume reduction after EA was the presence of a solid component (p<0.001), and EA was less effective in nodules when solid component >20% (p=0.001). We identified no factors related to volume reduction after RFA. CONCLUSION RFA is effective in treatment of benign predominantly cystic thyroid nodules in patients whose clinical problems were incompletely resolved after EA.","Jang, Seung Won; Baek, Jung Hwan; Kim, Jae Kyun; Sung, Jin Yong; Choi, Hoon; Lim, Hyun Kyung; Park, Jee Won; Lee, Ha Young; Park, Soonchan; Lee, Jeong Hyun",European journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2011.02.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21388767/,53

155622,Vaccines in the fast lane.,2020-12-01,"UNLABELLED (90)Y radioembolization is a promising therapy for patients with primary and secondary liver malignancies. Pretherapeutic assessment consists of hepatic angiography and (99m)Tc-macroaggregated albumin ((99m)Tc-MAA) perfusion scintigraphy to estimate the liver-to-lung shunt and exclude extrahepatic (99m)Tc-MAA deposition. However, the predictive value of intratumoral (99m)Tc-MAA uptake remains unclear. METHODS One hundred four patients with chemotherapy-refractory liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer were treated with (90)Y radioembolization between December 2006 and December 2010. All of the patients underwent angiographic assessment and perfusion scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-MAA before lobar (90)Y radioembolization. For inclusion, patients must have undergone pretherapeutic and follow-up MR imaging (6 wk and 3 mo after radioembolization, respectively). The degree of intratumoral (99m)Tc-MAA uptake was rated, and liver metastases were classified according to changes in tumor diameter on both an individual and a patient basis using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Response at both time points, MAA uptake, and catheter position were then statistically analyzed in a linear and generalized linear mixed model at a significance level of 0.05 (P value). RESULTS Sixty-six patients with a total of 435 colorectal liver metastases (mean number of lesions ± SD, 6.6 ± 2.8; mean lesion size ± SD, 33.8 ± 21.2 mm; lesion size range, 10-154 mm) were included in this analysis. According to the patient-based analysis, 3 patients had partial response, 49 stable disease, and 6 progressive disease after 6 wk. After 3 mo, 5 patients showed partial response, 26 stable disease, and 17 progressive disease. There was no association of patient-based tumor response with overall (99m)Tc-MAA uptake (P = 0.172) or with catheter position (P = 0.6456). Furthermore, an interaction effect of (99m)Tc-MAA uptake and catheter position in relation to tumor response was not found (P = 0.512). Moreover, in lesion-based analysis according to RECIST 1.1 there was no association of tumor response with degree of (99m)Tc-MAA uptake, catheter position, or interaction of (99m)Tc-MAA uptake and catheter position (P = 0.339, 0.593, and 0.658, respectively). CONCLUSION Response to (90)Y radioembolization was found to be independent of the degree of (99m)Tc-MAA uptake. Therefore, therapy should not be withheld from patients with colorectal liver metastases lacking intratumoral (99m)Tc-MAA accumulation.","Ulrich, Gerhard; Dudeck, Oliver; Furth, Christian; Ruf, Juri; Grosser, Oliver S; Adolf, Daniela; Stiebler, Marvin; Ricke, Jens; Amthauer, Holger","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.112.112508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23447653/,53

Here we introduce tin oxide (SnO2) nanobelts as a photonic platform for the transport of surface and volume phonon polaritons in the mid- to far-infrared frequency range. This report brings a comprehensive description of the polaritonic properties of SnO2 as a nanometer-sized dielectric and also as an engineered material in the form of a waveguide. By combining accelerator-based IR-THz sources (synchrotron and free-electron laser) with s-SNOM, we employed nanoscale far-infrared hyper-spectral-imaging to uncover a Fabry-Perot cavity mechanism in SnO2 nanobelts via direct detection of phonon-polariton standing waves. Our experimental findings are accurately supported by notable convergence between theory and numerical simulations. Thus, the SnO2 is confirmed as a natural hyperbolic material with unique photonic properties essential for future applications involving subdiffractional light traffic and detection in the far-infrared range.","Feres, Flávio H; Mayer, Rafael A; Wehmeier, Lukas; Maia, Francisco C B; Viana, E R; Malachias, Angelo; Bechtel, Hans A; Klopf, J Michael; Eng, Lukas M; Kehr, Susanne C; González, J C; Freitas, Raul O; Barcelos, Ingrid D",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22209-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33790286/,53

We identified variants of the two known human astrovirus species plus, based on genetic distance criteria, three novel astrovirus species all distantly related to mink and ovine astroviruses, which we provisionally named HMOAstV species A-C. The complete genome of species A displayed all the conserved characteristics of mammalian astroviruses. Each of the now three groups of astroviruses found in human stool (HAstV, AstV-MLB and HMOAstV) were more closely related to animal astroviruses than to each other, indicating that human astroviruses may periodically emerge from zoonotic transmissions.

DESIGN Cross-sectional data were collected using a survey conducted with Kuna Indians residing off the coast of Panama. Data sources included measures from the Panamanian Prevalence of Risk Factors Associated with Cardiovascular Disease Survey, and validated measures for psychosocial factors and standardized health outcome measures. Regression models with each of the mental health outcomes (depression, serious psychological distress, perceived stress) were used to examine the association between food insecurity and mental health outcomes. SETTING Indigenous Kuna community residing on the San Blas Islands of Panama. PARTICIPANTS 209 adults. RESULTS Food insecurity was reported by 83% of the participants. Across demographic categories, the only significant difference was by age with higher prevalence in younger ages. After adjusting for demographics, higher food insecurity was significantly associated with higher number of depressive symptoms and more serious psychological distress, but not with levels of perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS Based on these findings, treatment for mental health in the Kuna community may need to account for social determinants of health and be tailored to meet the needs of younger age groups in this population. In addition, interventions designed to decrease food insecurity should be considered as a possible means for improving mental health.","Walker, Rebekah J; Dawson, Aprill Z; Campbell, Jennifer A; Egede, Leonard E",Public health nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021003554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407903/,53

METHODS rcSO2 values were recorded, fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) was calculated, cerebral ultrasound scans were performed, and resistive indices and ventricular width were collected before and after decompression. Where possible, amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded before and after decompression. RESULTS We included nine preterm infants: nine with cranial ultrasound scan data, eight with NIRS data, seven with aEEG data and four with VEPs. The resistive index was stable and remained unchanged after decompression in all patients. Before decompression, the mean rcSO2 value was 42.6 ± 12.9% and increased to 55 ± 12.2% after decompression. With increasing ventricular width, FTOE showed a mean value of 0.51 ± 0.05 and decreased to a mean of 0.39 ± 0.12 after decompression.

Nevertheless, these manifold defenses are susceptible to failure as a result of stress, glucocorticoids, viral infections, abrupt exposure to cold air, and poor air quality. When some of these defenses fail, the lung can be colonized by bacterial pathogens that are equipped to evade the remaining defenses, resulting in the development of pneumonia. This review considers the mechanisms by which these predisposing factors compromise the defenses of the lung, with a focus on the development of bacterial pneumonia in cattle and supplemented with advances based on mouse models and the study of human disease.

DESIGN Ongoing, prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING 16 centres that perform endovascular treatment in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS 1488 patients included in the Multicentre Randomised Controlled Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischaemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) Registry who had received endovascular treatment, including stent retriever thrombectomy, aspiration, and all alternative methods for acute ischaemic stroke within 6.5 hours from onset of symptoms between March 2014 and June 2016. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death) at 90 days after the onset of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were excellent functional outcome (mRS score 0-1), good functional outcome (mRS score 0-2), and favourable functional outcome (mRS score 0-3) at 90 days; score on the extended thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scale at the end of the intervention procedure; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 24-48 hours after intervention; and complications that occurred during intervention, hospital admission, or three months' follow up period. Outcomes and safety variables in the MR CLEAN Registry were compared with the MR CLEAN trial intervention and control arms. RESULTS A statistically significant shift was observed towards better functional outcome in patients in the MR CLEAN Registry compared with the MR CLEAN trial intervention arm (adjusted common odds ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.67) and the MR CLEAN trial control arm (1.85, 1.46 to 2.34). The reperfusion rate, with successful reperfusion defined as a score of 2B-3 on the extended thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score, was 58.7%, the same as for patients in the MR CLEAN trial. Duration from onset of stroke to start of endovascular treatment and from onset of stroke to successful reperfusion or last contrast bolus was one hour shorter for patients in the MR CLEAN Registry. Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage occurred in 5.8% of patients in the MR CLEAN Registry compared with 7.7% in the MR CLEAN trial intervention arm and 6.4% in the MR CLEAN trial control arm. CONCLUSION In routine clinical practice, endovascular treatment for patients with acute ischaemic stroke is at least as effective and safe as in the setting of a randomised controlled trial.","Jansen, Ivo G H; Mulder, Maxim J H L; Goldhoorn, Robert-Jan B",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29523557/,53

Because the complement system plays a central role in innate immunity and because aberrant complement activation is associated with a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, we investigated the complement involvement in the pathogenesis of ALI induced by H5N1 virus infection. We showed that ALI in H5N1-infected mice was caused by excessive complement activation, as demonstrated by deposition of C3, C5b-9, and mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-C in lung tissue, and by up-regulation of MBL-associated serine protease-2 and the complement receptors C3aR and C5aR. Treatment of H5N1-infected mice with a C3aR antagonist led to significantly reduced inflammation in lungs, alleviating ALI. Furthermore, complement inhibition with an anti-C5a antibody or complement depletion with cobra venom factor after H5N1 challenge resulted in a similar level of protection to that seen in C3aR antagonist-treated mice. These results indicate that excessive complement activation plays an important role in mediating H5N1-induced ALI and that inhibition of complement may be an effective clinical intervention and adjunctive treatment for H5N1-induced ALI.","Sun, Shihui; Zhao, Guangyu; Liu, Chenfeng; Wu, Xiaohong; Guo, Yan; Yu, Hong; Song, Hongbin; Du, Lanying; Jiang, Shibo; Guo, Renfeng; Tomlinson, Stephen; Zhou, Yusen",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2012-0428oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23526211/,53

The eradication of TB disease requires, amongst others, diagnostic tests with high specificity and sensitivity that will work at the point of care (POC) in low-resource settings. The TB surface glycolipid antigen, mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) currently serves as the only POC molecular diagnostic biomarker suitable for use in low cost immunoassays. Here, we demonstrate the high affinity and exceptional specificity of microvirin-N (MVN), a 14.3 kDa cyanobacterial lectin, toward H37Rv TB ManLAM and utilize it to develop a novel on-bead ELISA. MVN binds to ManLAM with sub-picomolar binding affinity, but does not bind to other variants of LAM expressed by non-pathogenic mycobacteria - a level of binding specificity and affinity that current commercially available anti-LAM antibodies cannot achieve. An on-bead ELISA was subsequently developed using MVN-functionalized magnetic beads which allows for the specific capture of ManLAM from human urine with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.14 ng mL-1 and no cross-reactivity when tested with PILAM, a variant of LAM found on non-pathogenic mycobacteria.","van der Horst, Megan; Karamchand, Leshern; Bauer, Westley S; Nel, Andrew J M; Blackburn, Jonathan M; Wright, David W",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0an01725f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33367346/,53

Anecdotal reports indicate that solo diners tend to use information and communication technology devices, for example, the smartphone, as part of the eating experience. While lab studies suggest that the devices contribute to an increased high-calorie food intake and decreased feeling of satiety, these studies disregard the everyday experience and motivation of solo diners. We conducted an exploratory study to investigate how solo diners use digital devices as part of their daily eating experience. Semi-structured interviews with solo diners (N=12) were analysed using thematic analysis in an inductive approach leading to six themes. The themes focus on (1) the perception of a meal; (2) the experience of a solo diner; (3) the purpose of using an information and communication technology device; (4) the perceived influence of the devices; (5) factors decreasing and increasing the use; (6) and the potential to promote healthier food consumption. Our results indicate that the use of digital devices while eating alone can lead to distraction, being unaware of the food texture and the amount that is eaten. The devices can also induce a positive influence by providing entertainment and mitigating negative emotions like loneliness and boredom. The devices have the potential to contribute to healthy eating practices by providing education and by influencing the speed of eating through elements of sound. Although the use of devices might negatively affect eating behavior, their ubiquitous presence also offers the opportunity to reach specific, vulnerable populations.","Lemke, Mailin; Schifferstein, Hendrik Nj",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33989698/,53

Recurrent rate is high after curative resection and most recurrences occur within residual liver parenchyma. The aim of this study was to elucidate the impact of different treatment modalities on recurrent diseases in patients with IHCC after primary liver resection. Methods Between February 1999 and December 2015, we retrospectively identified patients who received curative resection for IHCC. Patients who experienced recurrences were included. Locoregional therapies included re-hepatectomy, radiofrequent ablation, and transhepatic arterial chemoembolization. These patients were categorized into three groups: intrahepatic recurrence without locoregional therapies (group A), intrahepatic recurrence with locoregional therapies (group B) and extrahepatic metastases (group C). Results Forty-three patients were included and there were 12, 15, and 16 patients in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The median disease-free survival times were 8.3, 9.1, and 8.7 months in groups A, B, and C (p = 0.099). The median after-recurrence overall survival times (period between recurrence and death/censor) were 6.4, 34.0, and 8.3 months in groups A, B, and C (p = 0.001). Locoregional therapies showed favorable benefit in multivariant analysis (hazard ratio: 0.274, confidence interval: 0.083-0.908, p = 0.010).

158892,Comparing BTEX concentration related to surgical smoke in different operating rooms.,2020-10-15,"The innate immune system represents the host's first-line defense against pathogens, dead cells or environmental factors. One of the most important inflammatory pathways is represented by the activation of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) protein family. Some NLRs induce the assembly of large caspase-1-activating complexes called inflammasomes. Different types of inflammasomes have been identified that can respond to distinct bacterial, viral or fungal infections; sterile cell damage or other stressors, such as metabolic imbalances. Epigenetic regulation has been recently suggested to provide a complementary mechanism to control inflammasome activity. This regulation can be exerted through at least three main mechanisms, including CpG DNA methylation, histones post-translational modifications and noncoding RNA expression. The repression or promotion of expression of different inflammasomes (NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRP4, NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP12 and AIM2) through epigenetic mechanisms determines the development of pathologies with variable severity. For example, our team recently explored the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting and modulating the components of the inflammasome as potential biomarkers in bladder cancer and during therapy. This suggests that the epigenetic control of inflammasome-related genes could represent a potential target for further investigations of molecular mechanisms regulating inflammatory pathways.","Poli, Giulia; Fabi, Consuelo; Bellet, Marina Maria; Costantini, Claudio; Nunziangeli, Luisa; Romani, Luigina; Brancorsini, Stefano",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21165758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796686/,53

IL-6 inhibitors are actively used to neutralize and prevent the cytokine storm. Olokizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody belonging to the G4/Kappa immunoglobulin isotype that selectively binds to human IL-6 and effectively neutralizes it. AIM To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Artlegia (olokizumab) for the treatment of subjects with a disease caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus in a real-world clinical setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS The analysis included data of 610 subjects aged 55.0812.68 years who received olokizumab at a single dose of 160 mg/mL 0.4 mL subcutaneously as a preemptive anti-inflammatory therapy. The comparison group included 511 subjects aged 55.2311.23 years who received standard therapy without IL-6 inhibitors. Control Endpoints: 1. Positive clinical changes on Day 7. 2. Changes in the CRP levels on Days 1, 2, and 7. 3. Duration of oxygen therapy. 4. Number of days in hospital. 5. Number of adverse events. 6. Disease outcome. RESULTS If a cytokine storm occurs, immune regulatory events will trigger the development of either a protective immune response or an exacerbated inflammatory response. The use of preemptive anti-inflammatory therapy has both a short-term and, most importantly, a long-term effect on the T and B parts of the immune process. These aspects definitely require further research and observation. CONCLUSION The use of olokizumab to treat the new COVID-19 coronavirus disease has demonstrated a positive effect on clinical and laboratory parameters. Primarily, it affects the severity of clinical parameters by improving the general condition already on the first day of observation, and decreasing body temperature to normal values.

Antiseptics have become an alternative for antimicrobial applications as antibiotic resistance is increasing; they have multiple targets with a broad spectrum of activity. Hence, the risk for developing resistance should be low. However, concerns have been raised that their growing use may result in bacteria that are less susceptible. METHODS The capacity of common antiseptics such as silver nitrate, polihexanide, octenidine, chlorhexidine and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-iodine to induce adaptation in a Staphylococcus aureus strain was analyzed in vitro using microplate laser nephelometry. S. aureus was repeatedly incubated with the respective half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) over a time period of 100 days. The influence of the continued treatment was determined by in situ monitoring of changes in the dose-response curves and calculation of the current IC(50) values for the substances tested. RESULTS During the experiment, S. aureus quickly adapted to high concentrations of the antibiotic mupirocin during repeated treatment. Moreover, a significant increase of the IC(50) for silver nitrate was observed over time. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed for polihexanide or chlorhexidine. While the IC(50) for octenidine was also found to increase significantly, although the change was only marginal, reiterated incubation with PVP-iodine led to a decrease in the IC(50). CONCLUSION Repeated treatment of S. aureus with polihexanide, chlorhexidine, octenidine and PVP-iodine did not trigger bacterial adaptation to these substances.","Wiegand, C; Abel, M; Ruth, P; Hipler, U-C",Skin pharmacology and physiology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000341222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22890487/,53

Timely serotype identification provides valuable epidemiological information and significantly contributes to prevention (vaccination) strategies. The prevalence of specific serotypes causing ARD varies geographically. HAdV-3, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, HAdV-14, and HAdV-21 are the serotypes most commonly found in adult populations in the Western Hemisphere. Unfortunately, conventional serotype identification is a tedious process which can take a week or longer. For this reason, new molecular methods for serotype identification are needed. Commercially available rapid antigen and PCR assays for the detection of HAdV are universal but do not distinguish between the different serotypes. We describe the development of a sensitive and specific multiplex assay capable of identifying serotypes 3, 4, 7, 14, and 21. Two sets of primers were used for nonspecific (universal) PCR amplification, and serotype-specific probes coupled to Luminex tags were used for target-specific extension (TSE). PCR and TSE primers were designed using known hexon gene sequences of HAdV. The TSE products of HAdV-3, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, HAdV-14, and HAdV-21 were correctly identified using the Luminex xMAP fluid microsphere-based array system. No cross-reactivity with other respiratory pathogens or other HAdV serotypes was observed. This multiplexed assay can be expanded to include more serotypes and will allow broad and rapid detection and identification of adenoviral serotypes in a high-throughput environment.","Washington, Cicely; Metzgar, David; Hazbón, Manzour Hernando; Binn, Leonard; Lyons, Arthur; Coward, Carl; Kuschner, Robert",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00029-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20410343/,53

This study aimed to assess whether training to proficiency using a novel laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) simulation curriculum improved operating room (OR) performance. METHODS For this study, 17 surgical residents [postgraduate years (PGYs) 2-5] participated in a didactic LIHR course and then were randomized to a training (T) or a control (C, standard residency) group. Performance of totally extraperitoneal (TEP) LIHR in the OR at baseline and after the study was measured using the Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills-Groin Hernia (GOALS-GH). RESULTS Of the 17 residents, 14 (5 T and 9 C) completed their final evaluations. The two groups showed no differences in terms of LIHR experience. The baseline GOALS-GH scores in the OR were similar (T 14.8; range 12.8-16.8 vs. C 13.6; range 12.3-14.8; P = 0.20). The mean number of training sessions needed to achieve proficiency was 4.8 (range 4.4-5.2), and the mean total training time was 109 min (range 61.9-149.1 min). After training, OR performance improved in the T group by 3.4 points (range 2.0-4.8 points; P = 0.002), whereas no significant change was seen in the C group [1.2; (range -1.1 to 3.6; P = 0.27)].

160529,Letter to Editor: Predicting survival after hepatocellular carcinoma resection using deep-learning on histological slides.,2020-09-07,"Background: Heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation, whether secondary to drugs, genetics including congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), and/or systemic diseases including SARS-CoV-2-mediated COVID19, can predispose to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Currently, QTc assessment and monitoring relies largely on 12-lead electrocardiography. As such, we sought to train and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm to determine the QTc, and then prospectively test this algorithm on tracings acquired from a mobile ECG (mECG) device in a population enriched for repolarization abnormalities. Methods: Using over 1.6 million 12-lead ECGs from 538,200 patients, a deep neural network (DNN) was derived (n = 250,767 patients for training and n = 107,920 patients for testing) and validated (n = 179,513 patients) to predict the QTc using cardiologist over-read QTc values as the gold standard. The ability of this DNN to detect clinically-relevant QTc prolongation (e.g. QTc ≥ 500 ms) was then tested prospectively on 686 genetic heart disease (GHD) patients (50% with LQTS) with QTc values obtained from both a 12-lead ECG and a prototype mECG device equivalent to the commercially-available AliveCor KardiaMobile 6L. Results: In the validation sample, strong agreement was observed between human over-read and DNN-predicted QTc values (-1.76 ± 23.14 ms). Similarly, within the prospective, GHD-enriched dataset, the difference between DNN-predicted QTc values derived from mECG tracings and those annotated from 12-lead ECGs by a QT expert (-0.45 ± 24.73 ms) and a commercial core ECG laboratory [+10.52 ms ± 25.64 ms] was nominal. When applied to mECG tracings, the DNN's ability to detect a QTc value ≥ 500 ms yielded an area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.97, 80.0%, and 94.4%, respectively. Conclusions: Using smartphone-enabled electrodes, an AI-DNN can predict accurately the QTc of a standard 12-lead ECG. QTc estimation from an AI-enabled mECG device may provide a cost-effective means of screening for both acquired and congenital LQTS in a variety of clinical settings where standard 12-lead electrocardiography is not accessible or cost-effective.","Giudicessi, John R; Schram, Matthew; Bos, J Martijn; Galloway, Connor D; Shreibati, Jacqueline B; Johnson, Patrick W; Carter, Rickey E; Disrud, Levi W; Kleiman, Robert; Attia, Zachi I; Noseworthy, Peter A; Friedman, Paul A; Albert, David E; Ackerman, Michael J",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.120.050231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33517677/,53

Preliminary data suggested incorporation of the Stentrode into the blood vessel wall was associated with improved recording sensitivity. We now investigate neointimal incorporation of the Stentrode, implanted in a cohort of sheep for up to 190 days. METHODS Micro-CT, obtained from the Imaging and Medical Beamline at the Australian Synchrotron, and histomorphometic techniques developed specifically for evaluation of cerebral vasculature implanted with a stent-electrode array were compared as measures to assess device incorporation and vessel patency. RESULTS Both micro-CT analysis and histomorphometry, revealed a strong correlation between implant duration and the number of incorporated stent struts. <10% (26/268) of stent struts were covered in neointima in sheep implanted for <2 weeks, increasing to >78% (191/243) between 2 and 4 weeks. Average strut-to-lumen thickness from animals implanted >12 weeks was comparable across both modalities, 339 ±15 μm measured using micro-CT and 331 ±19 μm ( n = 292) measured histologically. There was a strong correlation between lumen areas measured using the two modalities ( ), with no observation of vessel occlusion observed from any of the 12 animals implanted for up to 190 days. CONCLUSION Micro-CT and the histomorphometric techniques we developed are comparable and can both be used to identify incorporation of a Stentrode implanted in cerebral vessels.

We sought to explore the suitability of a reinforced nanostructured cellulose (NC) patch for chest wall reconstruction in an animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS In four domestic pigs, a standardized 10 × 10 cm chest wall defect was created by resecting three rib segments. Subsequently the defect was reconstructed via a biosynthetic NC patch (16 × 12 cm) reinforced by polytetrafluoroethylene mesh. After 1, 2, 4, and 5 months respectively, gross examination of NC patches was performed following sacrifice of the animals. Specimens of NC patches and surrounding connective tissue underwent histological examinations after staining with Hematoxylin-eosin and Elastica van Gieson. RESULTS All animals survived their observation period without encountering major adverse events. On gross examination all NC patches were intact and well integrated into the surrounding tissue. Histological examination showed clearly demarked zones of foreign body reaction at the patch/host-tissue interface. After 5 months a slight increase in foreign body reaction, fibrous capsule formation and cellular infiltration were observed. No signs of fibroblast proliferation or neovascularization were seen within NC patches at any point. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest a quick healing process and good overall biocompatibility following NC patch implantation.NC might prove an efficient and suitable biomaterial for complex chest wall reconstruction.","Zhang, Ruoyu; Mägel, Lavinia; Jonigk, Danny; Länger, Florian; Lippmann, Torsten; Zardo, Patrick; Pölzing, Frank",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.1080/08941939.2016.1244310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27768401/,53

The treatment response was described using a drug-disease model accounting for multiple components such as the dosage regimen, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a drug (including the mechanism and the rate of drug delivery), and the exposure-response relationship. Then, the clinical benefit of a treatment was defined as a function of the diseases and the clinical endpoints and was estimated as a function of the target pharmacodynamic endpoints used to evaluate the treatment effect. A case study is presented to illustrate how the treatment performances of paliperidone extended release (ER) and paliperidone long-acting injectable (LAI) can be improved. A convolution-based approach was used to characterize the pharmacokinetics of ER and LAI paliperidone. The drug delivery properties and the dosage regimen maximizing the clinical benefit (defined as the target level of D2 receptor occupancy) were estimated using a nonlinear optimizer. The results of the analysis indicated that a substantial improvement in clinical benefit (from 15% to 27% for the optimization of the in vivo release and from ∼30% to ∼70% for the optimization of dosage regimen) was obtained when optimal strategies were deployed either for optimizing the in vivo drug delivery properties of ER formulations or for optimizing the dosage regimen of LAI formulations.","Gomeni, Roberto; Bressolle-Gomeni, Françoise; Fava, Maurizio",Journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26899406/,53
161823,Hyperendemicity associated with increased dengue burden.,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND Although single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is safe and effective, inherent surgeons' discomfort has prevented a large-scale adaptation of this technique. Recent advances in robotic technology suggest that da Vinci Single-Site™ cholecystectomy (dVSSC) may overcome this issue by reducing the stress load of the surgeon compared to SILC. However, evidence to objectively assess differences between the two approaches is lacking. METHODS 60 patients [36 women, 24 men (mean age 52 years)] with benign gallbladder disease were randomly assigned to dVSSC (n = 30) or SILC (n = 30) in this single-centre, single-blinded controlled trial. The primary endpoint was surgeon's stress load. Secondary endpoints included operating time, conversion rates, additional trocar placement, blood loss, length of hospital stay, procedure costs, health-related quality of life, cosmesis and complications. Data were collected preoperatively, during the hospital stay, and at 1 and 12 months' follow-up. RESULTS The dVSSC group showed a significant reduction of mental stress load of the surgeon compared to SILC [Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire (SMEQ) score: median 25.0 (range 8-89) vs. 42.5 (range 13-110) points; p = 0.002] and a trend towards reduced physical stress load [Local Experienced Discomfort (LED) score: median 8 (range 2-27) vs. 12 (range 0-64) points; p = 0.088]. The length of hospital stay was longer in the SILC group [mean 3.06 (median 2; range 1-26) vs. 1.9 (median 2; range 1-4) days, p = 0.034] but overall hospital costs were higher for dVSSC [median 9734 (range 5775-16729) vs. 6900 (range 4156-99977) CHF; p = 0.001]. There were no differences in the rate of postoperative complications that required re-intervention (Dindo-Clavien grade ≥ IIIa; SILC n = 2 vs. dVSSC n = 0, p = 0.492) or other secondary endpoints. CONCLUSIONS Da Vinci Single-Site™ cholecystectomy provides significant benefits over Single-Port Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in terms of surgeon's stress load, matches the standards of the laparoscopic single-incision approach with regard to patients' outcomes but increases expenses.

162131,The second coming: The comeback of the live vaccines.,2020-09-01,"In 2019, the United States of America experienced the emergence of the vaping associated lung injury (VALI) epidemic. Vaping is now known to result in the development and progression of severe lung disease in young and healthy. Lack of regulation on electronic cigarettes in the US has resulted in over 2,000 patients and 68 deaths. We examine the clinical representation of VALI and the delve into the scientific evidence of how deadly exposure to electronic cigarettes can be. E-cigarette vapour is shown to affect numerous cellular processes, cellular metabolism and cause DNA damage (implications with cancer). E-cigarette use is associated with a higher risk of developing crippling lung conditions such as COPD, which would develop several years from now, increasing the already existent smoking-related burden. The role of vaping and virus susceptibility is yet to be determined; however vaping can increase the virulence and inflammatory potential of several lung pathogens and is also linked to an increased risk of pneumonia. As it has emerged for cigarette smoking, great caution should also be given to vaping in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the COVID-19 pandemic. Sadly, e-cigarettes are continually promoted and perceived as a safer alternative to cigarette smoking. E-cigarettes and their modifiable nature are harmful, as the lungs are not designed for the chronic inhalation of e-cigarette vapour. It is of interest; e-cigarettes have been shown to be of no help with smoking cessation. A true danger lies in vaping, of which if ignored, will lead to disastrous future costs.","McAlinden, Kielan Darcy; Eapen, Mathew Suji; Lu, Wenying; Sharma, Pawan; Sohal, Sukhwinder Singh",American journal of physiology.

162346,The Blossoming of Economic Epidemiology,2021,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is an ancient and ubiquitous human pathogen recovered previously only from primates. The sole species of the genus Hepatovirus, existing in both enveloped and nonenveloped forms, and with a capsid structure intermediate between that of insect viruses and mammalian picornaviruses, HAV is enigmatic in its origins. We conducted a targeted search for hepatoviruses in 15,987 specimens collected from 209 small mammal species globally and discovered highly diversified viruses in bats, rodents, hedgehogs, and shrews, which by pairwise sequence distance comprise 13 novel Hepatovirus species. Near-complete genomes from nine of these species show conservation of unique hepatovirus features, including predicted internal ribosome entry site structure, a truncated VP4 capsid protein lacking N-terminal myristoylation, a carboxyl-terminal pX extension of VP1, VP2 late domains involved in membrane envelopment, and a cis-acting replication element within the 3D(pol) sequence. Antibodies in some bat sera immunoprecipitated and neutralized human HAV, suggesting conservation of critical antigenic determinants. Limited phylogenetic cosegregation among hepatoviruses and their hosts and recombination patterns are indicative of major hepatovirus host shifts in the past. Ancestral state reconstructions suggest a Hepatovirus origin in small insectivorous mammals and a rodent origin of human HAV. Patterns of infection in small mammals mimicked those of human HAV in hepatotropism, fecal shedding, acute nature, and extinction of the virus in a closed host population. The evolutionary conservation of hepatovirus structure and pathogenesis provide novel insight into the origins of HAV and highlight the utility of analyzing animal reservoirs for risk assessment of emerging viruses.","Drexler, Jan Felix; Corman, Victor M; Lukashev, Alexander N; van den Brand, Judith M A; Gmyl, Anatoly P; Brünink, Sebastian; Rasche, Andrea; Seggewiβ, Nicole; Feng, Hui; Leijten, Lonneke M; Vallo, Peter; Kuiken, Thijs; Dotzauer, Andreas; Ulrich, Rainer G; Lemon, Stanley M; Drosten, Christian",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1516992112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26575627/,53

These factors include the composition of substrates in food waste coAD as well as pre-treatment methods and anaerobic reactor system designs in both food waste AD and coAD. Due to the characteristics of the substrates used, the biogas production performance varies as different effects are exhibited on nutrient balance, inhibitory substance dilution, and trace metal element supplement. Various types of pre-treatment methods such as mechanical, chemical, thermal, and biological methods are discussed to improve the rate-limiting hydrolytic step in the digestion processes. The operation parameters of a reactor system are also reviewed with consideration of the characteristics of the substrates. Since the environmental awareness and concerns for waste management systems have been increasing, this paper also addresses possible environmental impacts of AD and coAD in food waste treatment and recommends feasible methods to reduce the impacts. In addition, uncertainties in the life cycle assessment (LCA) studies are also discussed.","Chiu, Sam L H; Lo, Irene M C",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7159-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27380183/,53

The first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2 is in the upper respiratory tract, yet we know very little about whether COVID-19 vaccines induce immunity in this compartment, if at all. We analysed salivary antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD) following 2 i.m. injections of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines. Salivary anti-Spike/RBD IgG was detected after 1 dose and increased further after dose 2, reflecting the systemic immune response. Interestingly, salivary anti-Spike/RBD IgA associated with the secretory component (sIgA) was detected in nearly all vaccinated participants after one dose of mRNA vaccine, with anti-Spike sIgA diminishing after dose 2. Vaccination with ChAdOx1-S (Ad) followed by mRNA induced similar levels of salivary anti-Spike/RBD IgG and IgA, and both mRNA/mRNA and Ad/mRNA regimes provoked modest neutralizing capacity in this biofluid. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA/mRNA and Ad/mRNA vaccination induces antibodies in the saliva, and in response to one dose of mRNA, a compartmentalized and transient antigen-specific sIgA response is generated that does not correlate with systemic immunity.","Mohamed, S.

We evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses after the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine comparing the response of individuals affected by abdominal obesity (AO) to those without, discerning between individuals with or without prior infection. Methods. IgG neutralizing antibodies against the Trimeric complex (IgG-TrimericS) were measured at four time points: at baseline, at day 21 after vaccine dose-1, at one month and three months after dose-2. Nucleocapsid antibodies were assessed to detect prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Waist circumference was measured to determine abdominal obesity. Results. Between the first and third month after vaccine dose-2, the drop in IgG-TrimericS levels was more remarkable in individuals with AO compared to those without AO (2.44 fold [95%CI: 2.22-2.63] vs 1.82 fold [95%CI: 1.69-1.92], respectively, p<0.001). Multiple linear regression confirmed this result even when adjusting for possible confounders (p<0.001). Conclusions.

Mobile learning (ML) has been considered an educational, social platform in private and public higher education institutes. Since several fears are connected with COVID-19, this study's key hypotheses are related to how COVID-19 influences Mobile Learning (ML) adoption. Educators, teachers, and students may face some common types of fear in the course of the coronavirus pandemic, such as fear of losing social relationships, fear of educational loss and failure, and fear because of the lockdown of the family in the prevailing circumstances. Different theoretical models, named Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), are combined to develop an integrated model for this study. The proposed model was analyzed with the development of a questionnaire survey. The survey served as a data collection instrument to collect data from students of the University of Sharjah in Sharjah city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Three hundred twenty undergraduate students participated in the study. The collected data was evaluated using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The significant predictors revealed by experimental results included perceived fear, perceived ease of use, expectation confirmation, satisfaction, and perceived usefulness, explaining the intention to use the mobile learning platform. According to our study, teaching and learning can be benefitted to a great extent by the adoption of mobile learning (ML) during this pandemic for educational purposes;however, this process may be negatively affected by the fear of future educational results, fear of losing social relations and fear of stressful family situations.

We placed the anodal electrode over the right motor region (C4) while the cathodal or return electrode was placed either over a left supraorbital region (unihemispheric montage) or over the left motor region (C3 in the bihemispheric montage). Performance changes in the finger sequence task for both hands (left hand: p = 0.0026, and right hand: p = 0.0002) showed a linear tDCS dose response but no montage effect. rCBF in the right hemispheric perirolandic area increased with dose under the anodal electrode (p = 0.027). In contrast, in the perirolandic ROI in the left hemisphere, rCBF showed a trend to increase with dose (p = 0.053) and a significant effect of montage (p = 0.00004). The bihemispheric montage showed additional rCBF increases in frontomesial regions in the 4mA condition but not in the 2mA condition. Furthermore, we found correlations between rCBF changes in the right perirolandic region and improvements in the finger sequence task performance (FSP) for the left and right hand. Our data support not only a strong direct tDCS dose effect for rCBF and FSP as surrogate measures of targeted brain regions but also indirect effects on rCBF in functionally connected regions (e.g., frontomesial regions), particularly in the higher dose condition and on FSP of the ipsilateral hand (to the anodal electrode). At a higher dose and irrespective of polarity, a wider network of sensorimotor regions is positively affected by tDCS. Highlights tDCS-DOSE had a linear effect on finger sequence performance for both hands rCBF changes in both perirolandic ROIs demonstrated tDCS-DOSE effects, and left perirolandic ROI demonstrated tDCS-MONTAGE effects.

167772,Novel Electrodes for Reliable EEG Recordings on Coarse and Curly Hair,2020-02-27,"Batteries stacks are made of cells in certain series-parallel arrangements. Unfortunately, cell performance degrades over time in terms of capacity, internal resistance, or self-discharge rate. In addition, degradation rates are heterogeneous, leading to cell-to-cell variations. Balancing systems can be used to equalize those differences. Dissipative or non-dissipative systems, so-called passive or active balancing, can be used to equalize either voltage at end-of-charge, or state-of-charge (SOC) at all times. While passive balancing is broadly adopted by industry, active balancing has been mostly studied in academia. Beyond that, an emerging research field is multi-functional balancing, i.e., active balancing systems that pursue additional goals on top of SOC equalization, such as equalization of temperature, power capability, degradation rates, or losses minimization. Regardless of their functionality, balancing circuits are based either on centralized or decentralized control systems. Centralized control entails difficult expandability and single point of failure issues, while decentralized control has severe controllability limitations. As a shift in this paradigm, here we present for the first time a distributed multi-objective control algorithm, based on a multi-agent consensus algorithm. We implement and validate the control in simulations, considering an electro-thermal lithium-ion battery model and an electric vehicle model parameterized with experimental data. Our results show that our novel multi-functional balancing can enhance the performance of batteries with substantial cell-to-cell differences under the most demanding operating conditions, i.e., aggressive driving and DC fast charging (2C).

Acute ischemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusions (LVO) is a major contributor to stroke deaths and disabilities; however, identification for emergency treatment is challenging. Aims. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a panel of biomarkers for LVO prediction. Methods. 170 patients with suspected stroke were recruited retrospectively at one hospital. We analysed the plasma levels of D-dimer, OPN, OPG, GFAP, vWF, and ADAMTS13 in LVO vs non-LVO. Diagnostic performance was estimated by using blood biomarkers alone or in combination with NIHSS-derived stroke severity scales. Results. Our patient cohort comprised 20% stroke mimics, 11% transient ischemic attack, 11% hemorrhagic stroke, 15% LVO ischemic stroke, 28% non-LVO ischemic stroke, and 15% ischemic stroke with unknown LVO status. Multivariable analysis found that the optimal set of blood biomarkers for LVO prediction was D-dimer (OR 15.4, 95% CI 4.9 to 57.6; p-value<0.001) and GFAP (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.99; p-value=0.03). The combination of D-dimer and GFAP with stroke scales significantly improved LVO prediction, compared to the stroke scales alone (p-value<0.001). The combination of biomarkers with constructed FAST-ED or EMSA scales achieved an AUC of 95% (95% CI 91-100%) or 93% (CI 95% 89-97%), a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI 71-98%) or 86 (95% CI 66-97%), and a specificity of 95% (95% CI 89-98%) or 94% (95% CI 88-98%), for LVO prediction, respectively. Conclusions. The combination of D-dimer, GFAP, and stroke scales could provide a simple and highly accurate tool for identifying LVO patients.","Gaude, E.; Nogueira, B.; Graham, S.; Smith, S.; Shaw, L.; Graziadio, S.; Ladreda, G.; Sloan, P.; Bernstock, J.

Understanding of sample types that may harbour virus is important for evaluating risk. Objectives To determine if SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery or obstetrical care is present in: 1) the peritoneal cavity of males and females 2) the female reproductive tract, 3) the environment of the surgery or delivery suite (surgical instruments, equipment used, air or floors) and 4) inside the masks of the attending health care workers. Methods The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in patient, environmental and air samples was identified by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Air samples were collected using both active and passive sampling techniques. Results In this multi-centre observational case series, 32 patients with COVID-19 underwent urgent surgery or obstetrical delivery and 332 patient and environmental samples were collected and analyzed to determine if SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in: 4/24(16.7%) patient samples, 5/60(8.3%) floor, 1/54(1.9%) air, 10/23(43.5%) surgical instruments/equipment, 0/24 cautery filters and 0/143 inner surface of mask samples. Conclusions While there is evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the surgical and obstetrical operative environment (6% of samples taken), the finding of no detectable virus inside the masks worn by the medical teams would suggest a low risk of infection for our health care workers using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).","Lee, P.; Kozak, R.; Alavi, N.; Mbareche, H.; Kung, R.; Murphy, K.; Perruzza, D.; Jarvi, S.; Salvant, E.; Ladhani, N.

167869,epitopepredict: A tool for integrated MHC binding prediction,2021-02-07,"Purpose: The main objective of this manuscript is to describe the current situation of a sample of family business and their response to COVID-19 pandemic. This exploratory study analyzes a series of challenges faced by this type of firm in Latin America. This study puts special focus on how the pandemic is impacting transgenerational and family entrepreneurship and the sense of legacy in family businesses. Design/methodology/approach: The authors performed an online survey during June–July 2020. The survey includes 20 questions to owners or executives of family businesses about how they had been facing the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic in their companies. The authors received 194 valid respondents from firms that have their headquarters in Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Chile and other Latin American countries. Findings: The empirical analysis shows that family firms in Latin America have managed to survive and stay current through family entrepreneurship, protecting their heritage and relying on legacy. Out of four main competencies, “family entrepreneurship” was the most important on which business families relied to face this crisis. Research limitations/implications: The authors were able to gather information from just under 300 participants. However, the authors decided to take into account only those complete responses in the survey, so the present analysis was carried out on the valid sample of 194 respondents. Practical implications: The results of this study show that business families have managed to survive and stay current through family entrepreneurship, protecting their heritage and relying on legacy. Strategic leadership and intergenerational dynamics alone are not enough to face this crisis. Social implications: Family firms, like other companies, have shifted their mindset over the last months from “how can we grow” to “how can we survive”. Consequently, what competencies are necessary to develop so that family businesses can cope with this and the following crises? How are Mexico and Latin America’s family-owned businesses navigating the economic disruptions resulting from COVID-19? This paper explores the role of family firms in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. Originality/value: This study provides an overview of the coping mechanisms that some family businesses are implementing to overcome the challenges during the pandemic, putting focus on the specific context of Latin America. Family businesses represent approximately 60% of the region’s GDP, so their survival is completely relevant in terms of not only economic impact but also social development.

Most of the recent works to measure the physical distancing between people aims for easy-to-deploy systems such as contact tracing applications to speed up the deployment process. However, these systems, which rely heavily on the Bluetooth proximity sensor, tend to have serious performance and reliability issues. This paper proposes and explores using Thermal Sensor Array (TSA) towards physical distancing measurement. Distance estimation is achieved through using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network to measure the sensor-to-human distance and then to compute the physical distancing accordingly.

This intersection, which has been described as “biocybersecurity” (BCS), can become a major front of the 21st-century conflicts. There are three lines of BCS which make it a critical component of overall cybersecurity: (1) cyber operations within the area of BCS have life threatening consequences to a greater extent than other cyber operations, (2) the breach in health-related personal data is a significant tool for fatal attacks, and (3) health-related misinformation campaigns as a component of BCS can cause significant damage compared to other misinformation campaigns. Based on the observation that rather than initiating the necessary cooperation COVID-19 helped exacerbate the existing conflicts, the authors suggest that BCS needs to be considered as an essential component of the cyber doctrine, within the Defending Forward framework.

171504,Potential Neutralizing Antibodies Discovered for Novel Corona Virus Using Machine Learning,2020-03-20,"Re-emerging viral threats have continued to challenge the medical and public health systems. It has become clear that a significant number of severe viral infection cases are due to an overreaction of the immune system, which leads to hyperinflammation. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of the dexamethasone nanomedicine in controlling the symptoms of influenza infection. We found that the A/Wisconsin/WSLH34939/2009 (H1N1) infection induced severe pneumonia in mice with a death rate of 80%, accompanied by significant epithelial cell damage, infiltration of immune cells, and accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the airway space. Moreover, the intranasal delivery of liposomal dexamethasone during disease progression reduced the death rate by 20%. It also significantly reduced the protein level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2) as well as the number of infiltrated immune cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids as compared to the free drug. It was found that the liposomal dexamethasone was mainly distributed into the monocyte/macrophages in the lungs, suggesting its mode of action via the specific delivery of the drug into myeloid cells as a major cell population for inducing the cytokine storm. Taken together, the intranasal delivery of liposomal dexamethasone may serve as a novel promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of influenza A-induced pneumonia. Importance Influenza A virus causes annual epidemics and sporadic pandemics of respiratory diseases. An excessive immune response, called a cytokine storm, caused by the influenza virus is the most common complication of influenza infection that is associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Here, we report that the liposomal dexamethasone targeting the monocytes/macrophages during disease progression reduced the death rate as well as the protein level of inflammatory cytokines and the number of immune cells. Therefore, the findings of this study may be applied to address the limitations of the current strategies for the treatment of influenza.","Kwon, Jung Won; Quan, Hailian; Song, Juha; Chung, Hyewon; Jung, Daun; Hong, Jung Joo; Na, Yi Rang; Seok, Seung Hyeok",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.02.454850,53

Therefore, understanding transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases has become critical to formulating global public health policy. This systematic review assessed the evidence for the military as a disease vector, an historically relevant one, yet overlooked in times of COVID-19. Methods: We searched 3 electronic databases without temporal restrictions. We identified 2010 of 6477 studies spanning over two centuries (1810 - 2020) that met our inclusion criteria and provided evidence for the military as a pathogen transmitter, within itself or between it and civilians. Two researchers independently extracted study data using a standardized form. Through team discussions, studies were grouped according to their type of transmission mechanism and direct quotes were extracted to generate themes and sub-themes. A content analysis was later performed and frequency distributions for each theme were generated. Results: Biological mechanisms driving transmission included person-to-person transmission, contaminated food and water, vector-borne, and airborne routes. Social mechanisms facilitating transmission included crowded living spaces, unhygienic conditions, strenuous working, training conditions, absent or inadequate vaccination programs, pressure from military leadership, poor compliance with public health advice, contractor mismanagement, high-risk behaviours, and occupation-specific freedom of movement. Contaminated food and/or water was the most common biological transmission route. Living conditions were the most common social transmission mechanism, with young, low ranking military personnel repeatedly reported as the most affected group. Certain social mechanisms, such as employment-related freedom of movement, were unique to the military as a social institution. While few studies explicitly studied civilian populations, considerably more contained information that implied that civilians were likely impacted by outbreaks described in the military. Conclusions: Features of the military identified in this study pose a significant public health threat, especially to countries with substantial military presence or underdeveloped health systems. Many social transmission mechanisms, unlike biological ones, were unique to the military, facilitating large-spreader events and affecting civilian health. As an increasingly interconnected world faces the challenges of COVID-19 and future infectious diseases, the identified features of the military may exacerbate current and similar challenges and impair attempts to implement successful and equitable pandemic policies.","Chaufan, C.; Dutescu, I.

173626,Prevalence and phenology of mycorrhizal colonization across populations of Lycopodiella inundata,2020-05-25,"For the control of COVID-19, vaccination programmes provide a long-term solution. The amount of available vaccines is often limited, and thus it is crucial to determine the allocation strategy. While mathematical modelling approaches have been used to find an optimal distribution of vaccines, there is an excessively large number of possible schemes to be simulated. Here, we propose an algorithm to find a near-optimal allocation scheme given an intervention objective such as minimization of new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths, where multiple vaccines are available. The proposed principle for allocating vaccines is to target subgroups with the largest reduction in the outcome of interest, such as new infections, due to vaccination that fully immunizes a single individual. We express the expected impact of vaccinating each subgroup in terms of the observed incidence of infection and force of infection. The proposed approach is firstly evaluated with a simulated epidemic and then applied to the epidemiological data on COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Our results reveal how the optimal allocation depends on the objective of infection control. In the case of COVID-19, if we wish to minimize deaths, the optimal allocation strategy is not efficient for minimizing other outcomes, such as infections. In simulated epidemics, an allocation strategy optimized for an outcome outperforms other strategies such as the allocation from young to old, from old to young, and at random. Our simulations clarify that the current policy in the Netherlands (i.e., allocation from old to young) was concordant with the allocation scheme that minimizes deaths. The proposed method provides an optimal allocation scheme, given routine surveillance data that reflect ongoing transmissions. The principle of allocation is useful for providing plausible simulation scenarios for complex models, which give a more robust basis to determine intervention strategies.","Miura, F.; Leung, K.

174112,Switch-like and persistent memory formation in individual Drosophila larvae,2021-05-13,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) continue to attract interest for their potential role in targeted therapeutics and as biomarkers of disease and drug response. In order to achieve clinical utility, it is important to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of candidate EVs during preclinical development using in vivo animal models. To date, no methods exist for studying EV kinetics without modification to surface ligands that may affect normal behavior. Here we introduce an accessible method for labeling and quantifying EVs administered to conscious animals, without disrupting endogenous ligands. Our method relies upon established laboratory techniques and can be tailored to a variety of biological questions. Digital PCR is leveraged to detect a non-homologous oligonucleotide tracer introduced into the vesicles, allowing for quantification over a wide dynamic range. Using an application of this method, we found differences in the in vivo kinetics of EVs from three different cell types using non-linear mixed effects modeling. We propose that this method will provide a complementary approach for the of study EV ligand-receptor interactions in the context of EV uptake and targeted therapeutics.","De Luca, Thomas; Stratford, Robert E.; Edwards, Madison E.; Ferreira, Christina R.; Benson, Eric A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.22.306969,53
174156,Visual input into the Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body,2020-05-02,"Background: Sport activities were interrupted due to a quarantine imposed to limit the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy. This study aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 on sports and on daily activities in an Italian cohort of school children signed up in a football school. Methods: A total of 44 children from an Italian football school were enrolled. An online survey was distributed to these children and their parents in May 2020. The questionnaire collected information on the daily use of electronic devices and on the number of hours per week spent in activities regarding nonsport activities, highlighting the differences between those who interrupted sports and those who continued driven remotely by their instructors during the lockdown. Results: A total of 26 players continued practicing sports during the COVID-19 quarantine, while 18 players suspended their sports. Daily time spent on electronic devices increased significantly in both groups during the pandemic (p <.0001), regardless of whether they continued to practice sports (p >.05). On the other hand, in the group of children who interrupted sports, the time spent on activities regarding nonsport physical activity significantly changed during pandemic, with a 50% decrease (p =.0027) of those who spent more than 3 hr per week before the quarantine in favor of those who spent less than 3 hr per week. Conclusion: Quarantine increases screen time, which is a sedentary behavior that represents a risk factor for the health of children. Maintaining regular physical activity during quarantine due to COVID-19 was important to preserve some aspects of a healthy lifestyle in children, such as physical activity regardless of sport. While reducing physical activity and adapting it remotely, it is desirable that it be encouraged by experienced instructors in order to limit potential physical and psychological harm to children.

174225,Appendix E Precautions and breastfeeding recommendations for selected maternal infections,2005-12-31,"Abstract An organization’s culture is a significant contributor to its success with Lean transformations and structured problem solving practices are essential to achieving continuous improvement. This research focuses on establishing whether a relationship exists between the organization’s culture and the capability of team members to engage in structured problem solving practices. Six hypotheses were formulated based on potential relationships between steps required for structured problem solving, and critical organizational culture traits that influence an organization’s problem solving capabilities. A survey was administered to gather data as are necessary for evaluating the hypotheses. Results indicate there is a positive correlation between organizational cultural traits and the ability of team members to engage in structured problem solving practices for continuous improvement. For all hypotheses, the survey results permitted their rejection. This study examined the relationship between one organizational culture trait and one (or a few) problem solving step(s). It is, however, likely that multiple culture traits affect multiple problem solving steps and vice versa. Further studies to examine such relationships can be very useful to help ascertain how best to develop an organizational culture (traits) to succeed and sustain lean transformations. Study findings can guide organizations in their journey towards Lean transformation by helping identify organizational culture traits that must be promoted. Promoting the desired culture traits can create an environment where team members can engage in structured problem solving effectively to help continuous improvement for Lean transformations. The empirical examination of potential relationships between an organization’s cultural traits and the ability of team members to engage in continuous improvement through the problem solving for lean transformations is lacking. The work presented in this paper helps address that gap.","Fadnavis, Saket; Najarzadeh, Amir; Badurdeen, Fazleena",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314669; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314669,53

Many postsecondary institutions shifted outreach efforts to online formats. This qualitative study examines how virtual recruitment at an emerging HSI incorporates culturally responsive practices from the perspective of institutional agents (IAs) who were involved in these efforts. We also consider how IAs perceive the broader commitment of the institution to serve Latinx/a/o students. Our findings expose limitations in effectively recruiting Latinx/a/os in virtual formats due to the digital divide. The IAs identify ways in which the university was not equipped to overcome unreliable broadband access and technology. These agents maintain a critical lens to identify how the institution can expand capacity and ensure that the work of supporting Latinx/a/o students is a shared responsibility and not concentrated on a few staff. The findings further raise awareness of the continued language divide in disseminating information to families who do not speak English. Our study provides insights on how universities nationwide and across the world can transform recruitment practices to more intentionally support minoritized students and families as they make enrollment decisions into college.,"Deeb-Sossa, Natalia Cuellar Marcela G.; Nuñez Martinez, Mayra Sanchez Nava Yadira Guerrero Blas G.",Education Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11090454,53
176550,Importance of epidemic severity and vaccine mode of action and availability for delaying the second vaccine dose,2021-07-05,"The 'Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE)' national plan aims to reduce annual HIV incidence in the United States from 38,000 in 2015 to 9,300 by 2025 and 3,300 by 2030. Diagnosis and treatment are two most effective interventions, and thus, identifying corresponding optimal combinations of testing and retention-in-care rates would help inform implementation of relevant programs. Considering the dynamic and stochastic complexity of the disease and the time dynamics of decision-making, solving for optimal combinations using commonly used methods of parametric optimization or exhaustive evaluation of pre-selected options are infeasible. Reinforcement learning (RL), an artificial intelligence method, is ideal; however, training RL algorithms and ensuring convergence to optimality are computationally challenging for large-scale stochastic problems. We evaluate its feasibility in the context of the EHE goal. We trained an RL algorithm to identify a 'sequence' of combinations of HIV-testing and retention-in-care rates at 5-year intervals over 2015-2070, which optimally leads towards HIV elimination. We defined optimality as a sequence that maximizes quality-adjusted-life-years lived and minimizes HIV-testing and care-and-treatment costs. We show that solving for testing and retention-in-care rates through appropriate reformulation using proxy decision-metrics overcomes the computational challenges of RL. We used a stochastic agent-based simulation to train the RL algorithm. As there is variability in support-programs needed to address barriers to care-access, we evaluated the sensitivity of optimal decisions to three cost-functions. The model suggests to scale-up retention-in-care programs to achieve and maintain high annual retention-rates while initiating with a high testing-frequency but relaxing it over a 10-year period as incidence decreases. Results were mainly robust to the uncertainty in costs. However, testing and retention-in-care alone did not achieve the 2030 EHE targets, suggesting the need for additional interventions. The results from the model demonstrated convergence. RL is suitable for evaluating phased public health decisions for infectious disease control.","khatami, S.

The aim of this work is to present a low-cost alternative as an FFP2-like filter for a reusable respirator face mask. This study presents the comparison of different cellulose-based filtering materials performed by retention testing, time saturation testing, aerosol penetration testing, nanoparticle (~140 nm) filtration testing, bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE), analysis of material morphology and usability. The reusable respirator face mask used in this study is an open-source innovation, using 3D printing. Cotton disc proved to be the best filter material for the reusable mask, with satisfactory results and a performance similar to that shown by the N95-type mask. The cotton disc ensured effectiveness over 6 h of use, and after that, the reusable respirator face mask (here, Delfi-TRON®) needed to be sanitized and replenished with a new cotton disc. Upon preliminary analyses of filtration efficiency, the selected filter was shown to be a low-cost biodegradable and biocompatible alternative.","Araújo, Alyne R. de Nunes Lívio C.

To understand how unexpected short-term shocks such as a global pandemic may require long-term changes in a company’s outlook and planning. Discuss the marketing mix strategy that the Al Junaid Industrial group business products and services elements follow. To understand the competitiveness of Al Junaid group’s business environment and to identify the potential for business growth. To gain skills at developing a marketing strategy using the products, price, place and promotion model. Case overview/synopsis: Al Junaid Industrial group is a small to medium-sized HVAC manufacturing company created over 12 years ago, in the United Arab Emirates. It has a production line company in the Sharjah industrial area with a capacity of 5,000 ft. The company not only manufactures air conditioning and its accessories but also provides installation and maintenance services. As for its international connections, it imports raw materials such as aluminum and exports air conditioning grills and accessories, offering installation services to many destinations, including Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The company has recently suffered a setback due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020 its net revenue and profits decreased by an average of 40%. As a result, Al Junaid Industrial group currently faces several internal and external challenges affecting its business performance such as high operating expenses, low market demand and stiff competition. Due to these challenges, this case study argues that Mr. Obaid Al Junaid, the Chief Executive Officer, should develop a new marketing strategy aimed at raising revenues to levels closer to those observed before the onset of the epidemic. Complexity academic level: This case could be used in undergraduate and graduate classes of the business management field, as well as in development programs for managers in small to medium-sized enterprises (SME). Students (final year students of an undergraduate program for a bachelor’s degree) are expected to have a basic knowledge of Strategic management and business in general. It is preferred that the students have basic knowledge about small-to-medium businesses. Additionally, the managers in SME should be familiar with operational management, business management and marketing strategy and some of the challenges faced by managers in industrial businesses.

177215,25 Years of Pathway Figures,2020-05-31,"An alarming rise in hospital outbreaks implicating hand-washing sinks has led to widespread acknowledgement that sinks are a major reservoir of antibiotic resistant pathogens in patient-care areas. An earlier study using a GFP-expressing Escherichia coli (GFP-E. coli) as a model organism demonstrated dispersal from drain biofilm in contaminated sinks. The present study further characterizes the dispersal of microorganisms from contaminated sinks. Replicate hand-washing sinks were inoculated with GFP-E. coli, and dispersion was measured using qualitative (settle plates) and quantitative (air sampling) methods. Dispersal caused by faucet water was captured with settle plates and air sampling methods when bacteria were present on the drain. In contrast, no dispersal was captured without or in between faucet events amending earlier theory that bacteria aerosolize from P-trap and disperse. Numbers of dispersed GFP-E. coli diminished substantially within 30 minutes after faucet usage, suggesting that the organisms were associated with larger droplet-sized particles that are not suspended in the air for long periods. IMPORTANCE Among the possible environmental reservoirs in a patient care environment, sink drains are increasingly recognized as potential reservoir of multidrug resistant healthcare-associated pathogens to hospitalized patients. With increasing antimicrobial resistance limiting therapeutic options for patients, better understanding of how pathogens disseminate from sink drains is urgently needed. Once this knowledge gap has decreased, interventions can be engineered to decrease or eliminate transmission from hospital sink drains to patients. The current study further defines the mechanisms of transmission for bacteria colonizing sink drains.","Kotay, Shireen; Donlan, Rodney M.; Ganim, Christine; Barry, Katie; Christensen, Bryan E.; Mathers, Amy J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/392431,53
177244,Effects of indoor air stability on exhaled contaminant flow and thermal plume in the interpersonal breathing microenvironment,2021,"Evidence on vaccine-specific protection over time and boosting impact against the Delta variant across different clinical endpoints and age groups is urgently needed. To address this, we used a previously published model, combined with neutralization data for four vaccines - mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, NVX-CoV2373, and CoronaVac - to evaluate long-term dynamics of neutralizing antibody and to predict time-varying efficacy against the Delta variant by specific vaccine, age group, and clinical severity. We found that booster vaccination produces higher neutralization titers compared with titers observed following primary-series vaccination for all vaccines studied. We estimate the efficacies of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 against Delta variant infection to be 63.5% (95%CI: 51.4-67.3%) and 78.4% (95%CI: 72.2-83.5%), respectively, 14-30 days after the second dose, and that efficacies decreased to 36.0% (95%CI: 24.1-58.0%) and 38.5% (95%CI: 28.7-49.1%) 6-8 months later. After administration of booster doses, efficacies against the Delta variant would be 97.0% (95%CI: 96.4-98.5%) and 97.2% (95.7-98.1%). All four vaccines are predicted to provide good protection against severe illness from the Delta variant after both primary and booster vaccination. Long-term monitoring and surveillance of antibody dynamics and vaccine protection, as well as further validation of neutralizing antibody or other markers that can serve as correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are needed to inform COVID-19 pandemic preparedness.","Chen, X.; Wang, W.; Wu, Q.; Sun, R.; Ge, S.; Zheng, N.; Lu, W.; Yang, J.; Rodewald, L.; Yu, H.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.23.21263715v1?rss=1,53

This information can explain the daily routine, economic and cultural cycle of citizens. In the last year, the pattern of human trajectories is expected to change over cities due to Covid-19. This paper investigates the change in human trajectories based on the social media data (SMD) before and after the Covid-19. This study aims to find out the differences between the years 2018, 2020, and 2021. Firstly, all accounts for each year are classified based on movement behaviors. Secondly, spatial distributions of the tweets in terms of classified accounts are visualized after the hierarchical clustering applied to each dataset. Lastly, the average step lengths (ASL) are calculated for each account and classified in terms of step length levels as no movement, neighborhood, district, inter-districts, inter periphery, and center, outbound. The number of tweets and distinct accounts decreased by 90% and 84% from 2018 to 2021. The decrease in the number of single tweeting accounts is 84%, it is 60% in stationary accounts, and 94% in moving ac-counts. The size of the spatial clusters also decreased for all types of accounts maps, however, some of the previously visited spatial points are disappeared while new ones appeared on maps of single tweeting and moving accounts. The ASL of moving accounts also confirms the human movement decrease. According to that, the max, mean, and median ASL decreased 22%, 13%, and 35%.

ICEES was designed initially to support dynamic cohort creation and bivariate contingency tests. The objective of the present study was to develop an open approach to support multivariate analyses using existing ICEES functionalities and abiding by all regulatory constraints. We first developed an open approach for generating a multivariate table that maintains contingencies between clinical and environmental variables using programmatic calls to the open ICEES application programming interface. We then applied the approach to data on a large cohort (N = 22,365) of patients with asthma or related conditions and generated an eight feature table. Due to regulatory constraints, data loss was incurred with the incorporation of each successive feature variable, from a starting sample size of N = 22,365 to a final sample size of N = 4,556 (20.5%), but data loss was < 10% until the addition of the final two feature variables. We then applied a generalized linear model to the subsequent dataset and focused on the impact of seven select feature variables on asthma exacerbations, defined as annual emergency department or inpatient visits for respiratory issues. We identified five feature variables sex, race, obesity, prednisone, and airborne particulate exposure as significant predictors of asthma exacerbations. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of ICEES open multivariate analysis and conclude that, despite limitations, ICEES can provide a valuable resource for open multivariate analysis and can serve as an exemplar for regulatory compliant informatics solutions to open patient data, with capabilities to explore the impact of environmental exposures on health outcomes.","Fecho, K.; Haaland, P.; Krishnamurthy, A.; Lan, B.; Ramsey, S.

Emission from the 44 and 95 GHz transitions shows strong correlations in peak velocity, peak flux density, and integrated flux density, indicating that they are likely cospatial. We found that the peak flux density ratio Spk,95/Spk,44 decreases as the 44 GHz peak flux density increases.

First, the basic reaction of modern states when faced with uncertainty is to apply national-territorial logics of controls. Second, bureaucracies consider the virus as a danger to security and organise public health emergencies according to the rules of the game of national security, creating tensions between internal security, public health and the economy because policymakers may be unsure about the priorities and may prioritise border controls. Third, resistance against the chosen national policies show that people are not led by a politics of fear and/or protection, but rather their own concerns about themselves with peer-to-peer surveillance as a key element of their compliance. Contact tracing technologies and strategies of border controls are key elements to analyse.

Enterprises need to find suitable investment opportunities in the rapidly changing business environment to promote the long-term growth of enterprise value. Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, business environment has undergone major changes, which has a profound impact on the enterprise’s investment behavior. This paper selects A-share listed companies from 2014 to 2018. Based on the study of the impact of environment uncertainty on investment efficiency, the paper analyzes the mechanism of the impact of accounting information quality on this correlation. It is found that when the enterprise is facing uncertain environment, improving accounting information quality can effectively alleviate the inefficient investment of the enterprise.","Mu, Wen Dai Wei Cao Qilin",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1629/1/012080,53
181837,Digital Perspectives to Bring Dissonant Heritage Back to Life. the Military Landscape of the Galla Placidia Line,2021,"Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of telehealth-enhanced prenatal care. Data Sources: We searched for primary literature in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Methods of Study Selection: Studies were included if they were written in English and used telehealth as an adjunct to or substitute for elements of a comprehensive prenatal care system, with pregnant women as the study population. Studies were excluded if they did not involve comprehensive prenatal care, were not in English, or were abstracts only. Two reviewers independently screened studies by titles, abstracts, and full text. Conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Remaining conflicts were resolved by a fourth reviewer. Risk of bias was performed independently by two reviewers. Conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Tabulation, Integration and Results: The initial search identified 2707 studies, of which 7 met inclusion criteria. One additional study was identified in the grey literature. Studies included 4 non-randomized controlled studies, 1 randomized controlled trial, 2 qualitative studies, and 1 active clinical trial. Telehealth-enhanced prenatal care included remote monitoring and/or virtual visits. Interventions reduced the number of in-person appointments. Patients and providers had high rates of satisfaction with prenatal care delivered via telehealth. Pregnancy outcomes were similar between the intervention and control groups with the exception of one study identifying higher rates of pre-eclampsia and another showing higher rates of gestational diabetes in the telehealth group. Risk of bias assessment revealed moderate bias in all of the non-randomized studies. The randomized controlled trial had low risk of bias. Conclusion: Telemedicine-enhanced prenatal care may decrease the number of in-person prenatal care visits and increase access to care. Future studies should be done to determine neonatal and maternal outcomes of remote care and to study effectiveness of these interventions for women of color and low socioeconomic status.","Nguyen, E.; Engle, G.; Subramanian, S.; Fryer, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.14.21257232v1?rss=1,53

183057,"‘All changed, changed utterly’",2020-10-21,"Aim: This research examines the spatial equity, and associated health equity implications, of the geographic distribution of Covid-19 vaccination services in Aotearoa New Zealand. Method: We mapped the distribution of Aotearoa's population and used the enhanced-two-step-floating-catchment-method (E2SFCA) to estimate spatial access to vaccination services, taking into account service supply, population demand, and distance between populations and services. We used the Gini coefficient and both global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation to assess the spatial equity of vaccination services across Aotearoa. Additional statistics included an analysis of spatial accessibility for priority populations, including M[a]ori (Indigenous people of Aotearoa), Pacific, over 65-year-olds, and people living in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. We also examined vaccination service access according to rurality, and by District Health Board region. Results: Spatially accessibility to vaccination services varies across Aotearoa, and appears to be better in major cities than rural regions. A Gini coefficient of 0.426 confirms that spatial accessibility scores are not shared equally across the vaccine-eligible population. Furthermore, priority populations including M[a]ori, older people, and residents of areas with socioeconomic constraint have, on average, statistically significantly lower spatial access to vaccination services. This is also true for people living in rural areas. Spatial access to vaccination services, also varies significantly by District Health Board (DHB) region as does equality of access, and the proportion of DHB priority population groups living in areas with poor access to vaccination services. A strong and significant positive correlation was identified between average spatial accessibility and the M[a]ori vaccination rate ratio of DHBs. Conclusion: Covid-19 vaccination services in Aotearoa are not equitably distributed. Priority populations, with the most pressing need to receive Covid-19 vaccinations, have the worst access to vaccination services.","Whitehead, J.; Atatoa Carr, P.; Scott, N.; Lawrenson, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.26.21262647v1?rss=1,53

I base my findings on the analysis of a questionnaire-based survey administered to a sample of students. My research aims at examining the efficiency of the implementation of digital instruction and the accompanying challenges at various levels of the education sphere. I was interested in students’ Information and Communications Technology (ICT) preferences and usage habits and whether or not they possess vital digital competences in their own view. The digitally scheduled education programs introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could not fully reach a level required for effective learning according to research findings. The responses revealed that several schools did not implement uniform systems, the educational materials were not suitable for independent learning, the given materials did not have a modular structure, the respective texts did not reflect a system oriented perspective, and it was proven that neither students nor teachers possessed digital literacy skills considered to be currently vital. The most important result of this statistical analysis entails that those students were more successful in the digital home-based education, who spent more time with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) use, regularly played with or used experience-oriented software and relied on smart devices for most of their studies. © 2021, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

Design/methodology/approach The research analyses the rhetoric in global clothing retailers' and NGOs' counter-rhetoric during the first seven months of 2020. Findings During this period, retailers employed rhetorical strategies to legitimise irresponsible actions (corporate hegemony prevailed), while NGOs embraced forms of counter-rhetoric trying to delegitimise the retailers' logic, stressing the role of neoliberalism in worsening the situation. Originality/value The authors contribute to the literature by providing new insight into the consequences of COVID-19 for retailers' neoliberal practices and the livelihood of workers in global supply chains. Findings of this study extend authors' knowledge about retailers' COVID-19 measures: These have contributed to the plights of workers working for their supply factories in the global South.","Ahmad, N.; Haque, S.; Islam, M.

Here, we report protection activity against a spectrum of SARS-COV-2 and variants by immunization with protein-based recombinant RBD-C-tag administered with aluminum-phosphate adjuvant intramuscularly. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with RBD-C-tag resulted in the in vivo production of IgG antibodies recognizing the immune-critical spike protein of the SARS-COV-2 virus as well as the SARS-COV-2 variants alpha (“United Kingdom”), beta (“South Africa”), gamma (“Brazil/Japan”), and delta (“India”) as well as wt-spike protein. RBD-C-tag immunization led to a desired Th1 polarization of CD4 T cells producing IFNγ. Importantly, RBD-C-tag immunization educated IgG production delivers antibodies that exert neutralizing activity against the highly transmissible SARS-COV-2 virus strains “Washington”, “South Africa” (beta), and “India” (delta) as determined by conservative infection protection experiments in vitro. Hence, the protein-based recombinant RBD-C-tag is considered a promising vaccination candidate against COVID-19 and a broad range of emerging SARS-COV-2 virus variants.","Subramani, Jaganathan; Shaabani, Namir; Shetty, Dhwani; Wu, Haiwa; Kwon, Sunkuk; Li, Wenzhao; Yue, Chanyu; Lahtz, Christoph; Ramirez-Torres, Adela; Zhou, Heyue; Zhang, Yanliang; Allen, Robert; Farley, Bill; Emalfarb, Mark; Tchelet, Ronen; Markku, Soloheimo; Marika, Vitikainen; Wiebe, Marilyn; Huuskonen, Anne; Ben-artzi, Hannah; Avigdor, Avi; Ji, Henry; Herrmann, Andreas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.17.456704,53

Teaching and learning at dental schools across the country were drastically changed to online approach as the nation enforced Movement Control Order (MCO). However, translation of psychomotor skills still require hands-on approach to produce competent dentists upon graduation, but most dental schools were not prepared for the prevention of COVID-19 transmission that require more strict cross infection protocol. The aim of this paper was to describe the response by a dental school in Malaysia to COVID-19 in modifying the clinical teaching and learning, infrastructure, facilities, and clinical services, and enhancing the infection control protocol through risk assessment of COVID-19 transmission and prevention strategies. The paper also discusses the limitations of our approach, challenges in providing clinical services and supervision as well as implications of changes to our practice. In conclusion, COVID-19 has modified the delivery and implementation of clinical teaching and learning in Malaysia.

Sequence analysis revealed that MAK7 is RPL4A, one of the two genes encoding ribosomal protein L4 of the 60S subunit. We further found that mutants with mutations in 18 MAK genes (including mak1 [top1], mak7 [rpl4A], mak8 [rpl3], mak11, and mak16) had decreased free 60S subunits. Mutants with another three mak mutations had half-mer polysomes, indicative of poor association of 60S and 40S subunits. The rest of the mak mutants, including the mak3 (N-acetyltransferase) mutant, showed a normal profile. The free 60S subunits, L-A copy number, and the amount of L-A coat protein in the mak1, mak7, mak11, and mak16 mutants were raised to the normal level by the respective normal single-copy gene. Our data suggest that most mak mutations affect M1 propagation by their effects on the supply of proteins from the L-A virus and that the translation of the non-poly(A) L-A mRNA depends critically on the amount of free 60S ribosomal subunits, probably because 60S association with the 40S subunit waiting at the initiator AUG is facilitated by the 3' poly(A).","Ohtake, Y; Wickner, R B",Molecular and cellular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7739558/,53

Never a significant welfare state in the usual mold, the Malaysian state nonetheless has been a dominant social and economic presence dictated by its affirmative action-type policies, which eventually metamorphosed into state-led indigenous capitalism. Privatisation is also intimately linked with emergence of an indigenous bourgeoisie with favored access to the vast accumulation of state assets and prerogatives. Internationally, it is conditioned by the fluid relationships of converging alliances and contested compromise with international capital, including transnational health services industries. As part of its vision of a maturing, diversified economy, the Malaysian government is fostering a private-sector advanced health care industry to cater to local demand and also aimed at regional and international patrons. The assumption is that, as disposable incomes increase, a market for such services is emerging and citizens can increasingly shoulder their own health care costs. The government would remain the provider for the indigent. But the key assumption remains: the growth trajectory will see the emergence of markets for an increasingly affluent middle class. Importantly, the health care and social services market would be dramatically expanded as the downsizing of public-sector health care proceeds amid a general retreat of government from its provider and financing roles.","Khoon, Chan Chee",New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17208722/,53

Therefore it is critical to determine efficiency of frozen section performance periodically. Objective To evaluate the accuracy of frozen section tests at different anatomical sites by comparing the frozen section diagnosis with the histological diagnosis. Method We conducted a retrospective study in Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital, Dhulikhel, and compared the results of 47 cases of frozen section with their final permanent section diagnosis during a period of January 2017 to December 2018. Result A total of 47 cases were studied on frozen section while no case was deferred for permanent paraffin section. The indication of frozen section was for presence/ typing of neoplasm in 38 cases (80.75%), clearance of margin in eight cases (17%) and diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease in one case (2.1%). The overall accuracy of frozen section was 91.4% (43 cases) with 8.5% (four cases) discordant with the diagnosis, reported as false negative. None of the cases were reported as false positive. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of frozen section in comparison with permanent section (as gold standard) were 85.18%, 100%, 100% and 83.33% respectively. Conclusion The accuracy of frozen section diagnosis at our institute was 91.4% which can be interpreted as comparable with most national and international studies. The overall error rate is 8.5% which is higher than previously published studies.

190801,Are nidoviruses hijacking the autophagy machinery?,2008,"We propose a new fast method of measuring distances between large numbers of related high dimensional datasets called the Diffusion Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). We model the datasets as distributions supported on common data graph that is derived from the affinity matrix computed on the combined data. In such cases where the graph is a discretization of an underlying Riemannian closed manifold, we prove that Diffusion EMD is topologically equivalent to the standard EMD with a geodesic ground distance. Diffusion EMD can be computed in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time and is more accurate than similarly fast algorithms such as tree-based EMDs. We also show Diffusion EMD is fully differentiable, making it amenable to future uses in gradient-descent frameworks such as deep neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate an application of Diffusion EMD to single cell data collected from 210 COVID-19 patient samples at Yale New Haven Hospital. Here, Diffusion EMD can derive distances between patients on the manifold of cells at least two orders of magnitude faster than equally accurate methods. This distance matrix between patients can be embedded into a higher level patient manifold which uncovers structure and heterogeneity in patients. More generally, Diffusion EMD is applicable to all datasets that are massively collected in parallel in many medical and biological systems.","Tong, Alexander; Huguet, Guillaume; Natik, Amine; MacDonald, Kincaid; Kuchroo, Manik; Coifman, Ronald; Wolf, Guy; Krishnaswamy, Smita",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655017/,53

We cloned and sequenced the 3' terminal 9.8 kb of the genomic RNA and analyzed the structure of the viral genome. As with mouse hepatitis coronaviruses (MHVs), the SDAV genome was able to code for a spike protein, a small membrane protein, a membrane-associated protein, and a nucleocapsid protein. In addition, the hemagglutinin-esterase gene capable of encoding a protein of 439 amino acids (aa) was identified. The putative functional site for acetylesterase activity was present in the HE protein as Phe-Gly-Asp-Ser (FGDS), suggesting that the SDAV HE protein might have retained the esterase activity. Immediately upstream of the HE gene and downstream of the polymerase 1b gene, the NS2 nonstructural-protein gene was identified with a coding capacity of 274 aa. A motif of UCUAAAC was identified as a potential transcription signal for subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Large insertions of 172, 127, and 44 aa were detected in the N-terminal half of the predicted S protein of SDAV when its sequence was compared to the sequences of MHV 2, MHV JHM, and MHV A59, respectively. The sequence information on the SDAV S-protein gene was applied to a differential diagnostic PCR to detect and distinguish the rat coronavirus from mouse coronaviruses.

Cloning and sequence analysis of the PEC Cowden full-length genome revealed that it is most closely related genetically to the human Sapporo-like viruses. In this study, the complete PEC capsid gene was subcloned into the plasmid pBlueBac4.5 and the recombinant baculoviruses were identified by plaque assay and PCR. The PEC capsid protein was expressed in insect (Sf9) cells inoculated with the recombinant baculoviruses, and the recombinant capsid proteins self- assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) that were released into the cell supernatant and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation. The PEC VLPs had the same molecular mass (58 kDa) as the native virus capsid and reacted with pig hyperimmune and convalescent-phase sera to PEC Cowden in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. The PEC capsid VLPs were morphologically and antigenically similar to the native virus by immune electron microscopy. High titers (1:102,400 to 204,800) of PEC-specific antibodies were induced in guinea pigs inoculated with PEC VLPs, suggesting that the VLPs could be useful for future candidate PEC vaccines. A fixed-cell ELISA and VLP ELISA were developed to detect PEC serum antibodies in pigs. For the fixed-cell ELISA, Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing PEC capsids, followed by cell fixation with formalin. For the VLP ELISA, the VLPs were used for the coating antigen. Our data indicate that both tests were rapid, specific, and reproducible and might be used for large-scale serological investigations of PEC antibodies in swine.","Guo, M; Qian, Y; Chang, K O; Saif, L J",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11283075/,53
193489,Legionella pneumophila.,1988,"Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bind linear or conformational epitopes on monomeric or oligomeric human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins were screened for their recognition of maturational intermediates. On the basis of reactivities with gp160 at different times after pulse-labeling, the MAbs were sorted into groups that exhibited binding which was immediate and constant, immediate but transient, delayed, late, or very late. This grouping was consistent with the selectivity of the MAbs for structural features of gp160. Thus, a MAb to the V3 loop reacted with envelope proteins at all times, in accord with the relative conformational independence and accessibility of the epitope. Several MAbs that preferentially react with monomeric gp160 exhibited diminished binding after the pulse. A 10-min tag occurred before gp160 reacted with conformational MAbs that inhibited CD4 binding. The availability of epitopes for other conformational MAbs, including some that react equally with monomeric and oligomeric gp160 and some that react better with oligomeric forms, was half-maximal in 30 min and closely followed the kinetics of gp160 oligomerization. Remarkably, there was a 1- to 2-h delay before gp160 reacted with stringent oligomer-specific MAbs. After 4 h, approximately 20% of the gp160 was recognized by these MAbs. Epitopes recognized by monomerspecific or CD4-blocking MAbs but not by oligomer-dependent MAbs were present on gp160 molecules associated with the molecular chaperone BiP/GRP78. MAbs with a preference for monomers reacted with recombinant or HIV-1 envelope proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the oligomer-specific MAbs recognized them in the Golgi complex. Additional information regarding gp160 maturation and intracellular trafficking was obtained by using brefeldin A, dithiothreitol, and a low temperature.","Otteken, A; Earl, P L; Moss, B",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8648672/,53
193581,[RISK ASSESSMENT FOR AEROSOL INFECTION BY THE NEW CORONA VIRUS AND PROTECTION BY RESPIRATORS].,2020-06-01,"Band 3 protein is a typical multispanning membrane protein whose membrane topology has been extensively studied from various protein chemical approaches. To clarify the membrane topogenesis of this multispanning protein on the endoplasmic reticulum, the topogenic functions of the anticipated transmembrane segments were individually assessed in an in vitro system using two series of model proteins in which each segment was placed in either a ""stop-transfer"" context or a ""translocation initiation"" context. They were expressed in a cell-free system containing rough microsomal membranes, and their topologies were evaluated by taking advantage of either sensitivity to protease or accessibility to N-glycosylation. We found that some segments seem to possess insufficient topogenic functions for membrane integration: the second transmembrane segment (TM2) is insufficient for the stop-transfer sequence, and TM3, TM5, and TM7 are not sufficient for the translocation initiation. In contrast to these phenomena, we herein demonstrate that TM2 shows an efficient stop-transfer function when it is near the preceding TM1 and suggest that TM3, TM5, and TM7 are followed by TM segments with a strong topogenic function to form Nexo/Ccyt topology, via which the preceding segments are integrated into the membrane. From these results, we propose that the interactions between the TMs should be operative during membrane integration, and that the segments with a weak topogenic function are given a transmembrane orientation by their following TMs.","Ota, K; Sakaguchi, M; Hamasaki, N; Mihara, K",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9774451/,53

194632,Nonparametric survival analysis of infectious disease data.,2013,"Fospropofol is an intravenous sedative-anesthetic agent that is FDA-approved for monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation in adult patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. As a prodrug of propofol, fospropofol's pharmacologic activity results from its breakdown by alkaline phosphatase and release of propofol, which is the active molecule. It exhibits a longer time to peak clinical effect and a more prolonged action compared to propofol. Thus patients may exhibit smoother hemodynamic and respiratory depression compared to propofol lipid emulsion bolus. Another advantage over propofol is that it does not induce a burning sensation on IV administration. Side effects include perineal paresthesia and itching, respiratory depression, hypoxemia, hypotension, loss of consciousness, and apnea with higher IV boluses. Therefore, current recommendations call for it to be administered only by clinicians trained in general anesthesia, who are thus skilled in advanced airway management. Fospropofol has a unique dosing regimen, with a standard dose for adults 18-65 years of age, and a modified dose (75% of the standard dose) for patients > 65 years of age and for sicker adult patients whose American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status score is ≥ 3. Also, the minimum and maximun IV bolus doses are body-weight adjusted to 60 and 90 kg respectively. Available evidence demonstrates that fospropofol in MAC sedation is successful in patients undergoing esophagogastroscopy, colonoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy. The use of fospropofol is also now being explored in many other perioperative settings. In light of current shortages of many anesthetic drugs, whether forspropofol can take the place of propofol in ICUs and operating rooms remains to be determined.","Abdelmalak, Basem; Khanna, Ashish; Tetzlaff, John",Current pharmaceutical design,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22762463/,53

After the epidemic, a serological survey was conducted involving the asymptomatic household contacts. Household contacts of 13 index patients were enrolled in the study. Contact history and clinical symptoms of the household contacts were recorded by standardized questionnaires. Blood samples of patients and household contacts were collected at least 28 days after symptom onset in the index patients or household exposure in the contacts for SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) IgG testing. On the basis of this investigation, 29 persons (25 adults and 4 children) were identified as having had unprotected exposure to the index cases before infection-control practices were implemented. Laboratory evaluation of clinical specimens showed no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV infection to any contacts.

METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 13 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who hospitalized in a Changsha hospital. RESULTS All 13 children had the disease onset due to family aggregation. Of the 13 children, 2 had no symptoms, and the other 11 children had the clinical manifestations of fever, cough, pharyngeal discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, convulsions, or vomiting. As for clinical typing, 7 had mild type, 5 had common type, and 1 had severe type. The median duration of fever was 2 days in 6 children. All 13 children had normal levels of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, immunoglobulins, CD4, CD8, and interleukin-6. The median time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was 13 days in the nasopharyngeal swabs of the 13 children. Three children presented false negatives for RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in stools for 12 days after the nasopharyngeal swab test yielded a negative result. Abnormal CT findings were observed in 6 children. All 13 children were cured and discharged and they were normal at 2 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSIONS Intra-family contact is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, and there is also a possibility of fecal-oral transmission. Mild and common types are the major clinical types in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cytokine storm is not observed. Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to have a good short-term prognosis, and follow-up is needed to observe their long-term prognosis. Multiple nucleic acid tests should be performed for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their close contacts by multiple site sampling.","Tan, Xin; Huang, Juan; Zhao, Fen; Zhou, Yan; Li, Jie-Qiong; Wang, Xiang-Yun",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32312364/,53

199319,TRAPPIST Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison (THAI) workshop report,2021-04-02,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is one of the most popular bariatric procedures. The procedure is associated with serious staple-line complications such as bleeding, leaks, and stenosis. AIM To determine whether oversewing the staple line, compared with clipping, in LSG reduces the incidence of postoperative bleeding. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a parallel-group, prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 100 patients who underwent LSG for obesity at a single institution between May 2014 and August 2015. Patients were assigned to one of two groups for reinforcement of the staple line: the oversewing group (staple line oversewn) or the clipping group (staple line clipped). The primary outcome was reoperation for hemodynamic instability caused by staple-line bleeding within 72 h postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were operative duration, length of hospital stay, postoperative leaks, and postoperative stenosis. RESULTS Mean operative duration was longer in the oversewing group (78.2 ±20.5 min) than in the clipping group (64.1 ±16.5 min, p < 0.001). Mean length of hospital stay was comparable in both groups. Postoperatively, there was no significant between-group difference in bleeding (oversewing, n = 0 vs. clipping, n = 2 (4.6%); p = 0.21) or in stenosis and leakage (both outcomes: oversewing, n = 0, vs. clipping, n = 1 (2.3%); p = 0.46). CONCLUSIONS Oversewing the staple line prolongs operative duration. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of oversewing on staple-line bleeding, postoperative leakage and stenosis, or length of hospital stay.","Kwiatkowski, Andrzej; Janik, Michał R; Paśnik, Krzysztof; Stanowski, Edward",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27829937/,53
201813,"[Corona Virus, Breastfeeding and Guidelines - a Worldwide Review]",2021,"The practice of coercion on the basis of psychosocial disability is plainly discriminatory. This has resulted in a demand from the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the CRPD Committee) for a paradigm shift away from the traditional biomedical model and a global ban on compulsion in the psychiatric context. However, that has not occurred. This paper considers conflicting pronouncements of the CRPD Committee and other United Nations bodies. Assuming the former's interpretations of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD) are accurate, involuntary psychiatric detention and enforced treatment on the basis of psychosocial disability are prima facie discriminatory and unlawful practices. However, dedicated mental health legislation both permits discrimination and protects and enhances rights. This paper proposes a practical way out of the present impasse: the global introduction of interim ""holding"" legislation lacking full compliance with the CRPD. While imperfect, such a framework would facilitate a move toward a complete ban on psychiatric coercion. The paper outlines four essential ingredients that any interim legislation ought to contain, including clear timebound targets for full CRPD implementation. It concludes by urging the CRPD Committee to take the unprecedented step of issuing a general comment providing reluctant ""permission"" for the progressive realization of respect for articles 12 and 14 of the CRPD.","Davidson, Laura",Health and human rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32669798/,53

To describe the clinical profile and factors associated with mortality among the first 200 patients confirmed to have COVID-19 infection admitted in the University of the Philippines – Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH). Methodology. We conducted a review of adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the UP-PGH, a designated COVID-19 referral center. Demographic, clinical data and clinical outcomes were extracted from medical records. Frequencies and distributions of various clinical characteristics were described, and factors associated with mortality were investigated. Results. Of the 200 patients in our cohort, most were male (55.5%), and the median age was 56 years old. Underlying comorbid illnesses were present in 67.5% of patients, which included hypertension (49.5%), diabetes mellitus (26.5%), and other cardiovascular diseases (20.5%). The most frequent presenting symptoms were cough (69.0%), fever (58.5%), or shortness of breath (53.0%). Most patients presented with mild (n=41, 20.5%) to moderate illness (n=99, 49.5%) and only 60 were considered severely (n=32, 16.0%) or critically ill (n=28, 14.0%). Many (61%) received empiric antibiotics, while 44.5% received either repurposed drugs or investigational therapies for COVID-19. Bacterial co-infection was documented in 11%, with Klebsiella pneumoniae commonly isolated. In-hospital mortality was 17.5%, which was highest for critical COVID-19 (71.4%). Mortality was observed to be higher among patients aged 60 and above, requiring oxygen, ventilatory support, and ICU admission, and those who developed acute kidney injury, acute stroke, sepsis, and nosocomial pneumonia. Conclusion. Our study confirmed that COVID-19 affects older individuals and those with underlying comorbid conditions. Empiric antimicrobial treatment was given for most patients, despite documentation of bacterial infection in only 11%. K. pneumoniae was commonly isolated, reflecting local epidemiology. The mortality rate during this early period of the pandemic was high and comparable with other institutions. Factors associated with mortality were related to critical COVID-19 and were similar to other studies. © 2021 University of the Philippines Manila. All rights reserved.","Salamat, M. S.

We evaluated the use of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) for the outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 74 patients with COVID-19. Clinical data were collected, and survival predictors were calculated. Blood was collected within 24âh after admission (day 1) and on day 7. H2S was measured in sera by monobromobimane derivation followed by high-performance liquid chromatography and correlated to other markers like procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP). Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 were also measured in serum. RESULTS: Survivors had significantly higher H2S levels on days 1 and 7 after admission. A cut-off point of 150.44âµM could discriminate survivors from non-survivors with 80% sensitivity, 73.4% specificity, and negative predictive value 95.9%. Mortality after 28 days was 32% with admission levels lower than or equal to 150.44âµM and 4.1% with levels above 150.44âµM (P: 0.0008). Mortality was significantly greater among patients with a decrease of H2S levels from day 1 to day 7 greater than or equal to 36% (p: 0.0005). Serum H2S on day 1 was negatively correlated with IL-6 and CRP and positively correlated with the absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that H2S is a potential marker for severity and final outcome of pneumonia by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Its correlation with IL-6 suggests anti-inflammatory properties.","Renieris, Georgios; Katrini, Konstantina; Damoulari, Christina; Akinosoglou, Karolina; Psarrakis, Christos; Kyriakopoulou, Magdalini; Dimopoulos, George; Lada, Malvina; Koufargyris, Panagiotis; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J",Shock,,53

Dermatologists and immunologists have to choose appropriate treatment strategy taking into consideration the risk of infection and possible exacerbation of the course of the disease in patients with confirmed infection. Management of atopic dermatitis (AD) in moderate to severe cases is based on systemic therapy such as cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate and dupilumab.Areas covered: A literature search in PubMed database was performed until 6 March 2021. In this review, the authors discuss non-biologic and biologic systemic medications for AD and provide an overview of therapeutic recommendations during COVID-19 pandemic.Expert opinion: In case of an active COVID-19 infection, conventional systemic treatment and biological treatment needs to be stopped until clinical recovery. Noninfected patients with systemic treatment of AD should continue their therapy via self-application. The authors can conclude that understanding of dupilumab therapy is better recognized in context AD treatment during COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to cyclosporine, azathioprine and methotrexate.

We found a higher risk associated with blood group B, and a lower risk with blood group AB. No association was observed between blood group and the risk of a severe ICU-requiring infection. We extended the analysis to study the association by antibodies; anti-a (blood groups B and O) and anti-b (blood groups A and O). No association between antibodies and both risk of infection or susceptibility to severe infection was found. The current study, along with the variation in blood group association results, indicates that blood group may not be an ideal biomarker to predict risk of COVID-19 infection.","Almadhi, Marwa Ali; Abdulrahman, Abdulkarim; Alawadhi, Abdulla; Rabaan, Ali A; Atkin, Stephen; AlQahtani, Manaf",Sci Rep,,53

215576,Erratum,2020,"The purpose of this study was to develop a simple electrostatic apparatus to precipitate virus particles spread via droplet transmission, which is especially significant in the context of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The bacteriophage &#966;6 of Pseudomonas syringae was used as a model of the COVID-19 virus because of its similar structure and safety in experiments. The apparatus consisted of a spiked, perforated stainless plate (S-PSP) linked to a direct-current voltage generator to supply negative charge to the spike tips and a vessel with water (G-water) linked to a ground line. The S-PSP and G-water surface were paralleled at a definite interval. Negative charge supplied to the spike tips positively polarised the G-water by electrostatic induction to form an electric field between them in which ionic wind and negative ions were generated. Bacteriophage-containing water was atomised with a nebuliser and introduced into the electric field. The mist particles were ionised by the negative ions and attracted to the opposite pole (G-water). This apparatus demonstrated a prominent ability to capture phage-containing mist particles of the same sizes as respiratory droplets and aerosols regardless of the phage concentration of the mist particles. The trapped phages were successfully sterilised using ozone bubbling. Thus, the present study provides an effective system for eliminating droplet transmission of viral pathogens from public spaces.","Kakutani, Koji; Matsuda, Yoshinori; Nonomura, Teruo; Takikawa, Yoshihiro; Takami, Takeshi; Toyoda, Hideyoshi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,53
217585,Author Correction: Reversing a model of Parkinson's disease with in situ converted nigral neurons,2020,"Online learning is becoming a fundamental modality of learning in medical education, and can be of great help during global crisis like the current COVID-19 pandemic. The MOOC (massive open online course) mode of e-learning is increasing its penetration worldwide, as a valid teaching approach to reach large populations. A major challenge in clinical education is the assessment of medical students and residents in clinical settings, and there is substantial evidence that the current situation requires improvement. The goal of this study was to evaluate the quality dimensions of a MOOC titled ""Learning assessment in clinical settings,"" developed by three Mexican universities in the Coursera platform. A mixed-method study design was used to assess the quality dimensions of the MOOC in two phases: pilot and implementation. The best-rated aspects were learning resources and pedagogical perspective, and those with opportunity for improvement were collaboration and time management. Assessment might be learned through a MOOC format, especially for participants willing to engage with educational technology and self-direction.","Olivares Olivares, Silvia Lizett; Hernández, Ramón Ignacio Esperón; Corolla, Miriam Lizzeth Turrubiates; Alvarez, Juan Pablo Nigenda; Sánchez-Mendiola, Melchor",Med Sci Educ,,53

This paper contributes to the growing literature by considering the dynamics of country-wise growth rates of infection numbers. Low-order serial correlation of growth rates is predominantly negative with cycles of two to four days for most countries. The results of fitted spatial autoregressive models suggest that there is high degree of spillover between countries. Forecast variances of many countries, in particular those with a high absolute number of infections, can to a large extent be explained by structural innovations of other countries. A better understanding of the serial and spatial dynamics of the spread of the pandemic may contribute to an improved containment and risk management.","Hafner, C.

222035,Aboriginal artefacts on the continental shelf reveal ancient drowned cultural landscapes in northwest Australia,2020,"Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a liquid, gel, or foam that contains ethanol or isopropanol used to disinfect hands. Hand hygiene is an important component of the U.S. response to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If soap and water are not readily available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings (1); in health care settings, CDC recommendations specify that alcohol-based hand sanitizer products should contain 60%-95% alcohol (&#8805;60% ethanol or &#8805;70% isopropanol) (2). According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates alcohol-based hand sanitizers as an over-the-counter drug, methanol (methyl alcohol) is not an acceptable ingredient. Cases of ethanol toxicity following ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products have been reported in persons with alcohol use disorder (3,4). On June 30, 2020, CDC received notification from public health partners in Arizona and New Mexico of cases of methanol poisoning associated with ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. The case reports followed an FDA consumer alert issued on June 19, 2020, warning about specific hand sanitizers that contain methanol. Whereas early clinical effects of methanol and ethanol poisoning are similar (e.g., headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and decreased level of consciousness), persons with methanol poisoning might develop severe anion-gap metabolic acidosis, seizures, and blindness. If left untreated methanol poisoning can be fatal (5). Survivors of methanol poisoning might have permanent visual impairment, including complete vision loss; data suggest that vision loss results from the direct toxic effect of formate, a toxic anion metabolite of methanol, on the optic nerve (6). CDC and state partners established a case definition of alcohol-based hand sanitizer-associated methanol poisoning and reviewed 62 poison center call records from May 1 through June 30, 2020, to characterize reported cases. Medical records were reviewed to abstract details missing from poison center call records. During this period, 15 adult patients met the case definition, including persons who were American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN). All had ingested an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. Four patients died and three were discharged with vision impairment. Persons should never ingest alcohol-based hand sanitizer, avoid use of specific imported products found to contain methanol, and continue to monitor FDA guidance (7). Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for methanol poisoning when evaluating adult or pediatric patients with reported swallowing of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer product or with symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings (e.g., elevated anion-gap metabolic acidosis) compatible with methanol poisoning. Treatment of methanol poisoning includes supportive care, correction of acidosis, administration of an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor (e.g., fomepizole), and frequently, hemodialysis.","Yip, Luke; Bixler, Danae; Brooks, Daniel E; Clarke, Kevin R; Datta, S Deblina; Dudley, Steven; Komatsu, Kenneth K; Lind, Jennifer N; Mayette, Annaliese; Melgar, Michael; Pindyck, Talia; Schmit, Kristine M; Seifert, Steven A; Shirazi, Farshad Mazda; Smolinske, Susan C; Warrick, Brandon J; Chang, Arthur",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,53

222562,"Biotransformation of 2,4-dinitrotoluene in a phototrophic co-culture of engineered Synechococcus elongatus and Pseudomonas putida",2020,"Many academics use yearly publication numbers to quantify academic interest for their research topic. While such visualisations are ubiquitous in grant applications, manuscript introductions, and review articles, they fail to account for the rapid growth in scientific publications. As a result, any search term will likely show an increase in supposed""academic interest"". One proposed solution is to normalise yearly publication rates by field size, but this is arduous and difficult. Here, we propose an simpler index that normalises keywords of interest by a ubiquitous and innocuous keyword, such as""banana"". Alternatively, one could opt for field-specific keywords or hierarchical structures (e.g. PubMed's Medical Subject Headings, MeSH) to compute""interest market share"". Using this approach, we uncovered plausible trends in academic interest in examples from the medical literature. In neuroimaging, we found that not the supplementary motor area (as was previously claimed), but the prefrontal cortex is the most interesting part of the brain. In cancer research, we found a contemporary preference for cancers with high prevalence and clinical severity, and notable declines in interest for more treatable or likely benign neoplasms. Finally, we found that interest in respiratory viral infections spiked when strains showed potential for pandemic involvement, with SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic being the most extreme example. In sum, the time is ripe for a quick and easy method to quantify trends in academic interest for anecdotal purposes. We provide such a method, along with software for researchers looking to implement it in their own writing.","Dalmaijer, Edwin S.; Rheede, Joram Van; Sperr, Edwin V.; Tkotz, Juliane",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06418v1.pdf,53
223082,Simulated Annealing with Adaptive Cooling Rates,2020-02-14,"BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) represent a high risk population for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. AIM: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs, and to find out the factors that are associated with this seroprevalence. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were applied for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases including PubMed/MEDLINE and pre-print services (medR&#967;iv and bioR&#967;iv) were searched from inception up to August 24, 2020. FINDINGS: Forty-nine studies, including 127,480 HCWs met the inclusion criteria. The estimated overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs was 8.7% (95% CI: 6.7-10.9%). Seroprevalence was higher in studies that were conducted in North America (12.7%) compared to those in Europe (8.5%), Africa (8.2), and Asia (4%). Meta-regression showed that increased sensitivity of antibodies test was associated with increased seroprevalence. The following factors were associated with seropositivity: male gender, Black, Asian, and Hispanic HCWs, work in a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) unit, patient-related work, frontline health care workers, health care assistants, personal protective equipment shortage, self-reported belief for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous positive polymerase chain reaction test, and household contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs is high. Excellent adherence to infection prevention and control measures, sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment, and early recognition, identification and isolation of HCWs that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 are imperative to decrease the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Galanis, Petros; Vraka, Irene; Fragkou, Despoina; Bilali, Angeliki; Kaitelidou, Daphne",J. hosp. infect,,53

225565,Hip Hop Feminism Starter Kit,2020,"BACKGROUND: Digitalization is a disruptive technology that changes the way we deliver diagnostic procedures and treatments in medicine. Different stakeholders have varying interests in and expectations of the digitalization of modern medicine. Many recent digital advances in the medical field, such as the implementation of electronic health records, telemedical services, and mobile health apps, are increasingly used by medical professionals and patients. During the current pandemic outbreak of a novel coronavirus-caused respiratory disease (COVID-19), many modern information and communication technologies (ICT) have been used to overcome the physical barriers and limitations caused by government-issued curfews and workforce shortages. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in the usage of modern ICT in medicine. At the same time, the eHealth literacy of physicians working with these technologies has probably not improved since our study. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes a representative cohort of German physicians before the COVID-19 pandemic and their eHealth literacy and attitude towards modern ICT. METHODS: A structured, self-developed questionnaire about user behavior and attitudes towards eHealth applications was administered to a representative cohort of 93 German physicians. RESULTS: Of the 93 German physicians who participated in the study, 97% (90/93) use a mobile phone. Medical apps are used by 42% (39/93). Half of the surveyed physicians (47/93, 50%) use their private mobile phones for official purposes on a daily basis. Telemedicine is part of the daily routine for more than one-third (31/93, 33%) of all participants. More than 80% (76/93, 82%) of the trial participants state that their knowledge regarding the legal aspects and data safety of medical apps and cloud computing is insufficient. CONCLUSIONS: Modern ICT is frequently used and mostly welcomed by German physicians. However, there is a tremendous lack of eHealth literacy and knowledge about the safe and secure implementation of these technologies in routine clinical practice.","Kirchberg, Johanna; Fritzmann, Johannes; Weitz, Jürgen; Bork, Ulrich",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,53

227478,Cardiovascular Research at the frontier of biomedical science,2020,"PURPOSE: Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, the use of intensive care unit telemedicine (tele-ICUs) may be one mechanism to provide patient care, particularly in rural parts of the United States. The purpose of this research was to inform hospital decision makers considering tele-ICUs, policy makers weighing immediate and longer-term funding and reimbursement decisions relative to tele-ICU care, and researchers conducting future work evaluating tele-ICUs. METHODS: We compared hospitals that reported providing teleintensive care to hospitals that reported not providing teleintensive care in the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey (AHAAS). Differences between groups were tested using Pearson's chi-square (categorical variables) and t-tests (continuous variables) using 0.05 as the probability of Type 1 error. The study sample included all US short-term, acute care hospitals that responded to the AHAAS in 2018. Our key variable of interest was whether a hospital reported having any tele-ICU capabilities in the 2018 AHAAS. Other factors evaluated were ownership, region, beds, ICU beds, outpatient visits, emergency department visits, full-time employees, and whether a hospital was rural, a critical access hospital, a major teaching hospital, or part of a health system. FINDINGS: Larger, not-for-profit, nonrural, noncritical access, teaching hospitals that were part of a health system, particularly in the Midwest, were more likely to have tele-ICUs. Over one-third of hospital referral regions (HRRs) had zero hospitals with tele-ICUs, 4 had all hospitals with tele-ICU, and the median percent of hospitals with tele-ICU by HRR, weighted by outpatient visits, was 11.3%. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We found wide variation in the prevalence of tele-ICUs across HRRs and states. Future work should continue the evaluation of tele-ICU effectiveness and, if favorable, explore the variation we identified for improved access to teleintensive care.","Williams, Dunc; Lawrence, John; Hong, Young-Rock; Winn, Aaron",J. rural health,,53

METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, cross-sectional study including 659 outpatients with migraine diagnosed by headache specialists. The participants were asked about the impacts of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on headache-related disability, headache days, headache intensity, stress, physical activity, hospital access and their work and home lives. For headache-related disability, the total Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score and part A and B scores were analysed. Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to identify the clinical predictors of changes in the total MIDAS score before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors related to new-onset headache during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Finally, 606 migraine patients (73 M/533 F; age, 45.2 ± 12.0 years) were included in the study, excluding those with incomplete data. Increased stress, substantial concern about COVID-19 and negative impacts of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life were reported in 56.8 %, 55.1 and 45.0 % of the participants, respectively. The total MIDAS and A and B scores did not significantly change after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. New-onset headache, which was observed in 95 patients (15.7 %), was associated with younger age and worsened mood and sleep in the logistic regression analysis. The multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis of changes in the total MIDAS score before and during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic identified worsened sleep, increased acute medication use, increased stress, medication shortages, comorbidities, the absence of an aura and new-onset headache were determinants of an increased total MIDAS score during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicentre study, clinical factors relevant to headache-related disability, such as new-onset headache, stress and sleep disturbances, were identified, highlighting the importance of symptom management in migraine patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Suzuki, Keisuke; Takeshima, Takao; Igarashi, Hisaka; Imai, Noboru; Danno, Daisuke; Yamamoto, Toshimasa; Nagata, Eiichiro; Haruyama, Yasuo; Mitsufuji, Takashi; Suzuki, Shiho; Ito, Yasuo; Shibata, Mamoru; Kowa, Hisanori; Kikui, Shoji; Shiina, Tomohiko; Okamura, Madoka; Tatsumoto, Muneto; Hirata, Koichi",J Headache Pain,,53

Robust proof of placental infection requires demonstration of viral localization within placental tissue. Only two of the few cases of possible vertical transmission have demonstrated placental infection. None have shown placental expression of the ACE2 or TMPRSS2 protein, both required for viral infection. We examined 19 COVID-19 exposed placentas for histopathologic findings, and for expression of ACE2, and TMPRSS2 by immunohistochemistry. Direct placental SARS-CoV-2 expression was studied by two methods-nucleocapsid protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and RNA expression by in situ hybridization. ACE2 membranous expression in the syncytiotrophoblast (ST) of the chorionic villi is predominantly in a polarized pattern with expression highest on the stromal side of the ST. In addition, cytotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast express ACE2. No ACE2 expression was detected in villous stroma, Hofbauer cells, or endothelial cells. TMPRSS2 expression was only present weakly in the villous endothelium and rarely in the ST. In 2 of 19 cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in the placenta focally in the ST and cytotrophoblast. There was no characteristic histopathology present in our cases including the two placental infections. We found that the placenta is capable of being infected but that this event is rare. We propose one explanation could be the polarized expression of ACE2 away from the maternal blood and pronounced paucity of TMPRSS2 expression in trophoblast.","Hecht, Jonathon L; Quade, Bradley; Deshpande, Vikram; Mino-Kenudson, Mari; Ting, David T; Desai, Niyati; Dygulska, Beata; Heyman, Taryn; Salafia, Carolyn; Shen, Dejun; Bates, Sara V; Roberts, Drucilla J",Mod Pathol,,53
228670,Abstract Journal Trainees Association,2021,"CONTEXT.: Pathology practices have begun integrating digital pathology tools into their routine workflow. During 2020 the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged as a pandemic causing a global health crisis that significantly affected the world population in several areas, including medical practice, and pathology was no exception. OBJECTIVE.: To summarize our experience in implementing digital pathology for remote primary diagnosis, education and research during this pandemic. DESIGN.: We surveyed our pathologists (all subspecialized) and trainees to gather information about their use of digital pathology tools before and during the pandemic. Quality assurance and slide distribution data were also examined. RESULTS.: During the pandemic, the widespread usage of digital tools in our institution allowed a smooth transition of most clinical and academic activities into remote with no major disruptions. The number of pathologists using whole slide imaging (WSI) for primary diagnosis increased from 20 (62.5%) to 29 (90.6%) out of a total 32 (100 %) pathologists, excluding renal pathology and hematopathology, during the pandemic. Furthermore, the number of pathologists exclusively using WSI for primary diagnosis also increased from 2 (6.3%) to 5 (15.6%) during the pandemic from the total of 32 (100%) pathologists. From 35 (100%) survey responses from attending pathologists, 21 (65.6%) reported using WSI for remote primary diagnosis following the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services waiver. Of these 21 pathologists, 18 (87%) responded that if allowed, they will continue using WSI for remote primary diagnosis after the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS.: The pandemic served as a catalyst to pathologists adopting a digital workflow into their daily practice and realizing the logistic and technical advantages of such tools.","Lujan, Giovanni M; Savage, Johanna; Shana039,; ah, Arwa; Yearsley, Martha; Thomas, Diana; Allenby, Patricia; Otero, Jose; Limbach, Abberley Lott; Cui, Xiaoyan; Scarl, Rachel; Hardy, Tanner; Sheldon, Jesse; Plaza, Jose; Whitaker, Bonnie; Frankel, Wendy; Parwani, Anil; Li, Zaibo",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

The present study aimed to characterize the clinical features and outcomes of imported COVID-19 patients with high body mass index (BMI) and the independent association of BMI with disease severity. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 455 imported COVID-19 patients were admitted and discharged in Zhejiang province by February 28, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment, and outcome data were collected, analyzed and compared between patients with BMI &#8805; 24and < 24. RESULTS: A total of 268 patients had BMI < 24, and 187 patients had BMI &#8805; 24. Those with high BMI were mostly men, had a smoking history, fever, cough, and sputum than those with BMI < 24. A large number of patients with BMI &#8805; 24 were diagnosed as severe/critical types. Some biochemical indicators were significantly elevated in patients with BMI &#8805; 24. Also, acute liver injury was the most common complication in these patients. The median days from illness onset to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 detection, duration of hospitalization, and days from illness onset to discharge were significantly longer in patients with BMI &#8805; 24 than those with BMI < 24. High BMI, exposure to Wuhan, any coexisting medical condition, high temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were independent risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19. After adjusting for age, sex and above factors, BMI was still independently associated with progression to severe/critical illness (P = 0.0040). Hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), CRP, and serum creatinine (Scr) were independent risk factors associated with high BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Contrasted with the imported COVID-19 patients with BMI < 24, high proportion of COVID-19 patients with BMI &#8805; 24 in our study, especially those with elevated CRP and LDH, developed to severe type, with longer hospitalization duration and anti-virus course. Thus, high BMI is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of imported COVID-19.","Cai, Huan; Yang, Lisha; Lu, Yingfeng; Zhang, Shanyan; Ye, Chanyuan; Zhang, Xiaoli; Yu, Guodong; Gu, Jueqing; Lian, Jiangshan; Hao, Shaorui; Hu, Jianhua; Zhang, Yimin; Jin, Ciliang; Sheng, Jifang; Yang, Yida; Jia, Hongyu",BMC Infect Dis,,53

Given that pregnant women are excluded from these trials, we aimed to investigate their safety when used during pregnancy within a unique population source. METHODS: Using the population-based Quebec Pregnancy Cohort, we identified women who delivered a singleton liveborn (1998-2015). Taking potential confounders into account including indications for use, the risk of prematurity, low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA), and major congenital malformation (MCM) associated with COVID-19 repurposed drug use during pregnancy were quantified using generalized estimation equations. RESULTS: Of the 231,075 eligible pregnancies, 107 were exposed to dexamethasone (0.05%), 31 to interferons (0.01%), 1,398 to heparins (0.60%), 24 to angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) (0.01%), 182 to chloroquine (0.08%), 103 to hydroxychloroquine (0.05%), 6,206 to azithromycin (2.70%), 230 to oseltamivir (0.10%), and 114 to HIV medications (0.05%). Adjusting for potential confounders, we observed an increased risk of prematurity related to dexamethasone (aOR 1.92, 95%CI 1.11-3.33; 15 exposed cases), anti-thrombotics (aOR 1.58, 95%CI 1.31-1.91; 177 exposed cases), and HIV medications (aOR 2.04, 95%CI 1.01-4.11; 20 exposed cases) use. An increased risk for LBW associated with anti-thrombotics (aOR 1.72, 95%CI 1.41-2.11; 152 exposed cases), and HIV medications (aOR 2.48, 95%CI 1.25-4.90; 21 exposed cases) use were also found. Gestational exposure to anti-thrombotics (aOR 1.20, 95%CI 1.00-1.44; 176 exposed cases), and HIV medications (aOR 2.61, 95%CI 1.51-4.51; 30 exposed cases) were associated with SGA.

Online communication between parents, children and early years practitioners/teachers rapidly became a new 'norm' during the first lockdown in the UK. This paper reports on quantitative and qualitative findings from 55 participants compromised of early years practitioners and primary school teachers working with 3 to 8 years old children in the South-East of England. Methods of data collection deployed online surveys and a qualitative focused questionnaire, to capture what measures nurseries and primary schools adopted to ensure children are safeguarded. We argue that pressure on early years practitioners and teachers to monitoring safeguarding children by using various online platforms is physically and emotionally challenging. This paper highlights the difficulties of detecting safeguarding issues amid school closures, which should be avoid during further future closures.","Khan, Tehmina; Mikuska, Éva",Soc Sci Humanit Open,,53

238273,COVID: A New Peer-Reviewed Journal on Coronaviruses and Coronaviruses-Diseases,2021,"BACKGROUND: The immune protective mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be deciphered for the development of an effective intervention approach. METHODS: We examined early responses of IL-37, a powerful anti-inflammatory cytokine, in 254 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients prior to any clinical intervention and determined its correlation with clinical prognosis. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes elevation of plasma IL-37. Higher early IL-37 responses correlated with earlier viral RNA negative conversion, chest CT image improvement and cough relief, consequently resulted in earlier hospital discharge. Further assays showed that higher IL-37 was associated with lower IL-6 and IL-8 and higher IFN-&#945; and facilitated biochemical homeostasis. Low IL-37 responses predicted severe clinical prognosis in combination with IL-8 and CRP. In addition, we observed that IL-37 administration was able to attenuate lung inflammation and alleviate respiratory tissue damage in human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)-transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that IL-37 plays a protective role by antagonizing inflammatory responses while retaining type I IFN, thereby maintaining the functionalities of vital organs. IL-37, IL-8 and CRP might be formulated as a precise prediction model for screening severe clinical cases and have good value in clinical practice.","Li, Ang; Ling, Yun; Song, Zhigang; Cheng, Xiaobo; Ding, Longfei; Jiang, Rendi; Fu, Weihui; Liu, Yan; Hu, Huiliang; Yuan, Songhua; Chen, Jian; Zhu, Cuisong; Fan, Jun; Wang, Jing; Jin, Yanling; Zhang, Miaomiao; Zhu, Lingyan; Sun, Peng; Zhang, Linxia; Qin, Ran; Zhang, Wei; Qiu, Chenli; Shen, Yinzhong; Zhang, Lin; Shi, Zhengli; Zhao, Chen; Zhu, Tongyu; Lu, Hongzhou; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Xu, Jianqing",,,53

This study estimates the association between case counts of COVID-19 infection and social vulnerability in the U.S., identifying counties at increased vulnerability to the pandemic. METHODS: Using Social Vulnerability Index and COVID-19 case count data, an ordinary least squares regression model was fitted to assess the global relationship between COVID-19 case counts and social vulnerability. Local relationships were assessed using a geographically weighted regression model, which is effective in exploring spatial nonstationarity. RESULTS: As of May 12, 2020, a total of 1,320,909 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the U.S. Of the counties included in this study (91.5%, 2,844 of 3,108), the highest case count was recorded in Trousdale, Tennessee (16,525.22 per 100,000) and the lowest in Tehama, California (1.54 per 100,000). At the global level, overall Social Vulnerability Index (eß=1.65, p=0.03) and minority status and language (eß=6.69, p<0.001) were associated with increased COVID-19 case counts. However, on the basis of the local geographically weighted model, the association between social vulnerability and COVID-19 varied among counties. Overall, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Large-scale disasters differentially affect the health of marginalized communities. In this study, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 case counts in the U.S. Addressing the social factors that create poor health is essential to reducing inequities in the health impacts of disasters.","Karaye, Ibraheem M; Horney, Jennifer A",Am J Prev Med,,53

This study aimed to describe patient, family member and potential donor perspectives on the suspension and resumption of kidney transplant programmes due to COVID-19. We conducted seven online focus groups involving 31 adult kidney transplant candidates (n = 22), caregivers (n = 4) and potential donors (n = 5). Transcripts were analysed thematically. We identified five themes: cascading disappointments and devastation (with subthemes of shattering hope, succumbing to defeat, regret and guilt); helplessness and vulnerability (fear of declining health, confronted by the threat of and change in dialysis, disconnected from health care, susceptibility to infective complications); stress from uncertainty (confusion from conflicting information, unable to forward plan), exacerbating burdens (incurring extra financial costs, intensifying caregiver responsibilities), and sustaining health through the delay (protecting eligibility, relying on social support, adapting to emerging modalities of care). During the suspension of kidney transplantation programmes, patients felt medically vulnerable because of declining health, susceptibility to infection and reduced access to care. There is a need to address health vulnerabilities, disappointment, uncertainty and additional burdens arising from the suspension of kidney transplantation programmes.","Guha, Chandana; Tong, Allison; Baumgart, Amanda; Scholes-Robertson, Nicole; Isbel, Nicole; Kanellis, John; Campbell, Scott; Coates, Toby; Chadban, Steven",Transplant. int,,53

Many reports suggested that psychological intervention is playing a positive role in COVID-19 treatment, but there is no high-quality evidence to prove its effects. This paper reports the protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify effectiveness of psychological intervention during the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The following electronic databases will be used by 2 independent reviewers: Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Wan fang Database, ClinicalTrials, WHO Trials, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. The randomised controlled trials of psychological intervention on COVID-19 will be searched in the databases by 2 researchers independently. Clinical recovery time and effective rate will be assessed as the primary outcomes. Changes of patients physical condition (1. Time until COVID-19 RT-PCR negative in upper respiratory tract specimen; 2. Time until cough reported as mild or absent; 3. Time until dyspnea reported as mild or absent; 4. Frequency of requiring supplemental oxygen or non-invasive ventilation; 5. Frequency of requiring respiratory; 6. Incidence of severe cases; 7. Proportion of re-hospitalization or admission to ICU; 8. All-cause mortality; 9. Frequency of seriously adverse events) and changes of psychological condition (such as: SRQ-20, PHQ-9, GAD-7, Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale) will be assessed as the secondary outcomes. For dichotomous outcomes, such as effective rate, data will be expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) will be calculated. Fixed effect model will be used for evaluating efficiency. Considering clinical heterogeneity, random effect model will be used for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Relevant studies will be used to evaluate whether psychological intervention is effective for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study will provide reliable evidence for psychological intervention on COVID-19.

METHODS: In this prospective cohort study in a tertiary care center in Mexico City, we included consecutive patients admitted with severe COVID-19 between March 20th and June 10th and evaluated empirical antimicrobial prescription and the occurrence of HAI. RESULTS: 794 patients with severe COVID-19 were admitted during the study period. Empiric antibiotic treatment was started in 92% of patients (731/794); the most frequent regimes were amoxicillin-clavulanate plus atypical coverage in 341 (46.6%) and ceftriaxone plus atypical coverage in 213 (29.1%). We identified 110 HAI episodes in 74/656 patients (11.3%). Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was the most frequent HAI, in 56/110 (50.9%), followed by bloodstream infections (BSI), in 32/110 (29.1%). The most frequent cause of VAP were Enterobacteriaceae in 48/69 (69.6%), followed by non-fermenter gram-negative bacilli in 18/69 (26.1%). The most frequent cause of BSI was coagulase negative staphylococci, in 14/35 (40.0%), followed by Enterobacter complex in 7/35 (20%). Death occurred in 30/74 (40.5%) patients with one or more HAI episodes and in 193/584 (33.0%) patients without any HAI episode (p < 0.05).

246393,Comparative transcriptomics implicate mitochondrial and neurodevelopmental impairments in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),2020,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging virus responsible for the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic with no known effective prophylaxis. We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine(HCQ) could prevent SARS CoV-2 in healthcare workers(HCW) at high-risk of exposure. MethodThis voluntary observational study for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 was conducted at a tertiary care center, from 12th June to 12th October 2020(total 16 weeks). All consented asymptomatic HCWs of CIMS hospital were administered 400 mg HCQ twice a day on day one followed by 400 mg once weekly to be taken with meals up to 16 weeks. Data collected included OPD registration, risk assessment, medical and family history (related to COVID), physical examination and vitals, pulse oximetry, ECG (pre and post HCQ), drug adherence, side effects, adverse drug reactions. ResultThe study enrolled 927 full-time, hospital-based HCWs ((including doctors, nurses, paramedical, lab technicians, sanitary workers and others), of whom 731(78.85%) initially started HCQ while 196 (21.14%) did not volunteer. The median age and weight of the study population was 27.5 years and 69.5 kg respectively. No major associated co-morbidities were present in these HCWs. There was an increased trend towards non adherence to HCQ with each proceeding week more so after week 11. Of the 731 HCWs taking HCQ a total of 167(22.8%) tested COVID positive at different intervals of time as against 30 HCW (15.3%) out of 196 not taking HCQ. The rate of COVID-19 positive was statistically significantly higher in the HCWs taking HCQ (p=0.0220; 95% CI: 1.14% to 12.94%), as compared to those not on HCQ. Thus HCQ was not prophylactically effective against COVID 19 infection. No participants in this study experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events. No significant difference in the median of ECG changes in QTc between pre and post HCQ administration of 46 HCWs was observed. ConclusionsThis clinical study did not detect a reduction in SARS CoV-2 transmission with prophylactic administration of 400 mg/HCQ in HCWs. All participants who did contract SARSCoV-2 were either asymptomatic or had mild disease courses with full recoveries. All adverse events were self-limiting and no serious cardiovascular events were reported with use of HCQ. In the absence of robust data, it seems premature to recommend HCQ as a prophylactic panacea for COVID-19.","Bhatt, Parloop; Patel, Vishva; Shah, Prachi; Parikh, Keyur",,,53

It was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization shortly thereafter. This pandemic is going to have a lasting impact on the functioning of pathology laboratories due to the frequent handling of potentially infectious samples by the laboratory personnel. To deal with this unprecedented situation, various national and international guidelines have been put forward outlining the precautions to be taken during sample processing from a potentially infectious patient. Purpose: Most of these guidelines are centered around laboratories that are a part of designated COVID 19 hospitals. However, proper protocols need to be in place in all laboratories, irrespective of whether they are a part of COVID 19 hospital or not as this would greatly reduce the risk of exposure of laboratory/hospital personnel. As part of a laboratory associated with a rural cancer hospital which is not a dedicated COVID 19 hospital, we aim to present our institute's experience in handling pathology specimens during the COVID 19 era. Conclusion: We hope this will address the concerns of small to medium sized laboratories and help them build an effective strategy required for protecting the laboratory personnel from risk of exposure and also ensure smooth and optimum functioning of the laboratory services.","Somal, Puneet Kaur; Sancheti, Sankalp; Sali, Akash Pramod; Bansal, Saloni; Kalra, Supreet Kaur; Thakur, Anantika; Gupta, Neha; Kapoor, Rakesh",J Cancer Res Ther,,53

There remains a paucity of such data from lower prevalence countries, including Australia. AIMS: To describe the patterns of unplanned hospital daily admission rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in a major Australian metropolitan hospital, with a focus on acute medical presentations including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke and falls. METHODS: This single-centre retrospective analysis analysed hospital admission episodes between 1 March and 30 April 2020 (COVID-19-era) and compared this to a historical cohort during the same period between 2017 and 2019 (pre-COVID-19). Information collected included total admission rates and patient characteristics for ACS, stroke and falls patients. RESULTS: A total of 12 278 unplanned admissions was identified across the study period. The daily admission rate was lower in the COVID-19-era compared with pre-COVID-19 (46.59 vs 51.56 days, P < 0.001). There was also a reduced average daily admission rate for falls (7.79 vs 9.95 days, P < 0.001); however, similar admission rates for ACS (1.52 vs 1.49 days, P = 0.83) and stroke (1.56 vs 1.76 days, P = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions have been effective in reducing domestic cases of COVID-19 in Australia. At our tertiary metropolitan hospital, we have observed a significant reduction in unplanned hospital admission rates during the COVID-19-era, particularly for falls.

However, it is unknown for other anthropometric indexes in young adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional study examined the relationships in 325 military men and women, aged 20 to 45 years in Taiwan. Anthropometric indexes included BMI, waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). The severity of localized periodontitis was defined as healthy (n = 42), Stage I (initial) (n = 228), and Stage II/III (moderate/severe) (n = 55) according to the 2017 Periodontal Diseases Classification. Smooth curve fitting and multiple logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, betel nut consumption, and smoking were used to determine the threshold effect between various anthropometric and the risk of localized Stage II/III periodontitis. RESULTS: In the spline smoothing plot, the turning points for BMI, WC, and WHtR were 26.1 kg/m2 , 90.0 cm, and 0.50, respectively, and a J-shaped relationship was found for BMI (the likelihood ratio test, P <0.001). In the multiple logistic regressions, BMI &#8805;27.0 kg/m2 , WC &#8805;90.0 cm and WHtR &#8805;0.50 were associated with higher risk of localized Stage II/III periodontitis than their counterparts (24.0 to 26.9 kg/m2 for BMI) (odds ratios [OR] and 95% confidence intervals: 4.16 [1.39 to 12.49], 2.65 [1.01 to 7.11], and 2.95 [1.20 to 7.24], respectively; all P values <0.05).

272401,Manufacturing microneedle array patches for vaccine delivery,2020,"In this paper, a new nature-inspired human-based optimization algorithm is proposed which is called coronavirus herd immunity optimizer (CHIO). The inspiration of CHIO is originated from the herd immunity concept as a way to tackle coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The speed of spreading coronavirus infection depends on how the infected individuals directly contact with other society members. In order to protect other members of society from the disease, social distancing is suggested by health experts. Herd immunity is a state the population reaches when most of the population is immune which results in the prevention of disease transmission. These concepts are modeled in terms of optimization concepts. CHIO mimics the herd immunity strategy as well as the social distancing concepts. Three types of individual cases are utilized for herd immunity: susceptible, infected, and immuned. This is to determine how the newly generated solution updates its genes with social distancing strategies. CHIO is evaluated using 23 well-known benchmark functions. Initially, the sensitivity of CHIO to its parameters is studied. Thereafter, the comparative evaluation against seven state-of-the-art methods is conducted. The comparative analysis verifies that CHIO is able to yield very competitive results compared to those obtained by other well-established methods. For more validations, three real-world engineering optimization problems extracted from IEEE-CEC 2011 are used. Again, CHIO is proved to be efficient. In conclusion, CHIO is a very powerful optimization algorithm that can be used to tackle many optimization problems across a wide variety of optimization domains.","Al-Betar, Mohammed Azmi; Alyasseri, Zaid Abdi Alkareem; Awadallah, Mohammed A; Abu Doush, Iyad",Neural Comput Appl,,53

273545,Dietary specificity and overlap in endorheic river fishes: How do native and nonnative species compare?,2020,"Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness with a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. Biomarkers are urgently needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases. Objective: To investigate whether an association between mortality risk and elevated RDW at hospital admission and during hospitalization exists in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included adults diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital) between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was patient survival during hospitalization. Measures included RDW at admission and during hospitalization, with an elevated RDW defined as greater than 14.5%. Relative risk (RR) of mortality was estimated by dividing the mortality of those with an elevated RDW by the mortality of those without an elevated RDW. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: A total of 1641 patients were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 62[18] years; 886 men [54%]; 740 White individuals [45%] and 497 Hispanic individuals [30%]; 276 nonsurvivors [17%]). Elevated RDW (>14.5%) was associated with an increased mortality risk in patients of all ages. The RR for the entire cohort was 2.73, with a mortality rate of 11% in patients with normal RDW (1173) and 31% in those with an elevated RDW (468). The RR in patients younger than 50 years was 5.25 (normal RDW, 1% [n = 341]; elevated RDW, 8% [n = 65]); 2.90 in the 50- to 59-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 256]; elevated RDW, 24% [n = 63]); 3.96 in the 60- to 69-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 226]; elevated RDW, 30% [104]); 1.45 in the 70- to 79-year age group (normal RDW, 23% [n = 182]; elevated RDW, 33% [n = 113]); and 1.59 in those &#8805;80 years (normal RDW, 29% [n = 168]; elevated RDW, 46% [n = 123]). RDW was associated with mortality risk in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (hazard ratio of 1.09 per 0.5% RDW increase and 2.01 for an RDW >14.5% vs &#8804;14.5%; P < .001). Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%. Conclusions and Relevance: Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network.","Foy, Brody H; Carlson, Jonathan C T; Reinertsen, Erik; Padros I Valls, Raimon; Pallares Lopez, Roger; Palanques-Tost, Eric; Mow, Christopher; Westover, M Brandon; Aguirre, Aaron D; Higgins, John M",JAMA Netw Open,,53

The evidence about risk factors of healthcare workers who infected COVID-19 is limited. This study aims to describe characteristics and influencing factors of the COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers. METHODOLOGY: The study was performed among COVID-19 infected and uninfected healthcare workers in three hospitals in Wuhan. A total of 325 healthcare workers participated; among them 151 COVID-19-infected healthcare workers were included. Characteristics of infected healthcare workers, and influencing factors including exposure histories, the use of protective equipment in different risk conditions and areas, perceptions, emotions, satisfactions and educations were described and analyzed. RESULTS: Healthcare workers got infected clustered mostly in the physical examination center. When performing general operations on confirmed or suspected patients, the use of protective equipment including the effectiveness of masks (p < 0.001), gloves (p < 0.001); and the use of gloves (p < 0.001), suits (p < 0.001), gowns (p < 0.001), shoe covers (p < 0.001), and hats (p < 0.001) were protective factors. The use of protective equipment was a protective factor in most cases. Negative emotions and dissatisfaction to the hospital response were associated with the increased risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The use of protective equipment, emotions and satisfactions to hospital responses are key COVID-19-infected factors. The awareness, the supply and the use of protective equipment, the layout of departments and other environmental and management factors should be strictly equipped. In addition, hospitals should also pay attention to emotions and satisfaction of healthcare workers.","Lai, Xiaoquan; Zhou, Qian; Zhang, Xinping; Tan, Li",J Infect Dev Ctries,,53

The purpose of this study was to evaluate early clinical outcomes and patient preference of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) versus manual TKA (mTKA) in a direct crossover cohort of patients who underwent consecutive TKAs by each technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review and telephone interview was performed on 36 patients who underwent both rTKA and mTKA by a single surgeon between 2012-2018. Perioperative outcomes-complications/reoperations and patient-preferred technique-were collected with mean clinical follow up of 4.8 and 2.0 years for mTKA and rTKA, respectively. RESULTS: mTKA were performed significantly (p<0.01) more quickly than rTKA, including shorter tourniquet time (56 versus 73 minutes) and total operating room time (93 versus 116 minutes). rTKA patients length of stay (LOS) was significantly (p<0.01) decreased (1.8 days) compared to mTKA (2.3 days). For rTKA and mTKA, respectively, there was no difference in final range of motion (119 versus 122 degrees), Visual Analog Scale (1.6 versus 0.9), or Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Jr (85 versus 87). Twenty (56%) reported rTKA as the preferred technique over mTKA. CONCLUSION: In same patient direct comparison, rTKA required longer operative time but improved LOS compared to mTKA. There was no difference in final outcomes with only slightly more patients preferring rTKA.","Pelkowski, Jessica N; Wilke, Benjamin K; Crowe, Matthew M; Sherman, Courtney E; Ortiguera, Cedric J; Ledford, Cameron K",,,53
276567,Prediction of adverse drug reactions using drug convolutional neural networks,2021,"Air-purifying full-face masks, such as military chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear masks, might offer superior protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 compared to disposable polypropylene P2 or N95 masks. In addition, disposable masks are in short supply, while military chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear masks can be disinfected then reused. It is unknown whether such masks might be appropriate for civilians with minimal training in their use. Accordingly, we compared the Australian Defence Force in-service chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear Low Burden Mask (AirBoss Defense, Newmarket, Canada) with polypropylene N95 masks and non-occlusive glasses worn during simulated tasks performed by civilian clinicians in an Australian tertiary referral hospital intensive care unit. After brief training in the use of the Low Burden Mask, participants undertook a simulated cardiac arrest scenario. Previous training with polypropylene N95 masks had been provided. Evaluation of 10 characteristics of each mask type were recorded, and time to mask application was assessed. Thirty-three participants tested the Low Burden Mask, and 28 evaluated polypropylene N95 masks and glasses. The Low Burden Mask was donned more quickly: mean time 7.0 (standard deviation 2.1) versus 18.3 (standard deviation 6.7) seconds; P = 0.0076. The Low Burden Mask was rated significantly higher in eight of the 10 assessed criteria, including ease of donning, comfort (initially and over a prolonged period), fogging, seal, safety while removing, confidence in protection, and overall. Visibility and communication ability were rated equally highly for both systems. We conclude that this air-purifying full-face mask is acceptable to clinicians in a civilian intensive care unit. It enhances staff confidence, reduces waste, and is likely to be a lower logistical burden during a prolonged pandemic. Formal testing of effectiveness is warranted.","Adamson, Steven; Carpenter, Hannah; Pang, George; Pincus, Jason M; Gregory, Bryan E; Reade, Michael C",Anaesth Intensive Care,,53

Furthermore, the medical staff in endemic areas are becoming exhausted and deal with a considerable level of job burnout, which can negatively affect their medical decision making. Also, due to the variable pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, some physicians may misdiagnose patients.

We aimed to develop a new classification and structured reporting system on CT imaging (COVID-19 S) that would facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the most accurate way. METHODS: Our retrospective cohort included 803 patients with a chest CT scan upon suspicion of COVID 19. The patients' history, physical examination, CT findings, RT PCR, and other laboratory test results were reviewed, and a final diagnosis was made as COVID 19 or non-COVID 19. Chest CT scans were classified according to the COVID 19 S CT diagnosis criteria. Cohen's kappa analysis was used. RESULTS: Final clinical diagnosis was COVID-19 in 98 patients (12%). According to the COVID-19 S CT diagnosis criteria, the number of patients in the normal, compatible with COVID 19, indeterminate and alternative diagnosis groups were 581 (72.3%), 97 (12.1%), 16 (2.0%) and 109 (13.6%). When the indeterminate group was combined with the group compatible with COVID 19, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 S were 99.0% and 87.1%, with 85.8% positive predictive value (PPV) and 99.1% negative predictive value (NPV). When the indeterminate group was combined with the alternative diagnosis group, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 S were 93.9% and 96.0%, with 94.8% PPV and 95.2% NPV. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 S CT classification system may meet the needs of radiologists in distinguishing COVID-19 from pneumonia of other etiologies and help optimize patient management and disease control in this pandemic by the use of structured reporting.","Gezer, Naciye Sinem; Ergan, Begüm; Baris, Mustafa Mahmut; Appak, Özgür; Sayiner, Ayça Arzu; Balci, Pinar; Kuruüzüm, Ziya; Çavus, Sema Alp; Kilinç, Oguz",Diagn. interv. radiol,,53

Recognizing viral PTMs is very important for a better understanding of the mechanism of viral infections and finding potential drug targets. However, few studies have investigated the roles of viral PTMs in virus-human interactions using comprehensive viral PTM datasets. To fill this gap, we developed the first comprehensive viral posttranslational modification database (VPTMdb) for collecting systematic information of PTMs in human viruses and infected host cells. The VPTMdb contains 1240 unique viral PTM sites with 8 modification types from 43 viruses (818 experimentally verified PTM sites manually extracted from 150 publications and 422 PTMs extracted from SwissProt) as well as 13 650 infected cells' PTMs extracted from seven global proteomics experiments in six human viruses. The investigation of viral PTM sequences motifs showed that most viral PTMs have the consensus motifs with human proteins in phosphorylation and five cellular kinase families phosphorylate more than 10 viral species. The analysis of protein disordered regions presented that more than 50% glycosylation sites of double-strand DNA viruses are in the disordered regions, whereas single-strand RNA and retroviruses prefer ordered regions. Domain-domain interaction analysis indicating potential roles of viral PTMs play in infections. The findings should make an important contribution to the field of virus-human interaction. Moreover, we created a novel sequence-based classifier named VPTMpre to help users predict viral protein phosphorylation sites.

A straightforward approach to speed up drug development at lower costs is drug repurposing. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting the interface of SARS CoV-2 with the host via repurposing of clinically licensed drugs and evaluated their use in combinatory treatments with virus- and host-directed drugs in vitro. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We tested the antiviral potential of the antifungal itraconazole and the antidepressant fluoxetine on the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in the polarized Calu-3 cell culture model and evaluated the added benefit of a combinatory use of these host-directed drugs with the direct acting antiviral remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. KEY RESULTS: Drug treatments were well-tolerated and potently impaired viral replication. Importantly, both itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles > 90% and displayed synergistic effects, as determined in commonly used reference models for drug interaction. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations are promising starting points for therapeutic options to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe progression of COVID-19.","Schloer, Sebastian; Brunotte, Linda; Mecate-Zambrano, Angeles; Zheng, Shuyu; Tang, Jing; Ludwig, Stephan; Rescher, Ursula",Br J Pharmacol,,53

Older adults are at the highest risk to develop hypoglycaemia. Several studies have established the important positive role of educational interventions on achieving glycaemic control and other clinical outcomes, however, there is still a lack in studies that evaluate the impact of such type of interventions on hypoglycaemia risk in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacist-led patient counselling on reducing hypoglycaemic attacks in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: and analysis: This study is an open-label, parallel controlled randomised trial, which will be conducted in the outpatient clinics at the largest referral hospital in the north of Jordan. Participants who are elderly (age &#8805; 65 years), diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and taking insulin, sulfonylurea, or any three anti-diabetic medications will be randomly assigned to intervention (SUGAR Handshake) and control (usual care) groups. The SUGAR Handshake participants will have an interactive, individualised, medications-focused counselling session reinforced with a pictogram and a phone call at week six of enrolment. The primary outcome measure is the frequency of total hypoglycaemic events within 12 weeks of follow up. Secondary outcomes include the frequency of asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe hypoglycaemic events, hypoglycaemia incidence, and time to the first hypoglycaemic attack. We will also conduct a nested qualitative study for process evaluation.

In today's health care environment, Medicare and Medicaid fraud is not uncommon. The negative impact of fraud is vast because it diverts resources meant to care for patients in need to the benefit of fraudsters. Fraud increases the overall costs for vital health care services and can potentially be harmful to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The objectives of this commentary are to describe the types and trends of Medicare and Medicaid fraud that are committed, and provide recommendations to protect patients and health care practices. Specifically, this article identifies types of Medicare and Medicaid fraud at beneficiary (patient) and provider level, and it can be intentional or unintentional. This article also describes the 3 primary laws that prohibit fraud and gives fraud case examples relevant to each law, including the False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute, and the Stark Law. We also discuss currently trending and emerging areas, including opioid and pharmacogenetic testing; both have experienced heavier and higher-profile instances of fraud in today's health care landscape. Last, the article summarizes detection methods and recommendations for health care providers and patients to protect themselves against fraud. Recommended strategies to combat fraud are discussed at policy, practice, and grassroots levels. Health care practitioners, including pharmacists, can use these strategies to protect themselves and their patients from becoming victims of fraud or unknowingly committing fraud.","Chen, Zhen Xing; Hohmann, Lindsey; Banjara, Bidur; Zhao, Yi; Diggs, Kavon; Westrick, Salisa C",,,53

The cities selected were those with the largest number of confirmed cases considering data of April 13. Variables such as number of cumulative cases, new daily cases and contamination rate were employed for this study. Our results showed that higher mean temperatures and average relative humidity favored the COVID-19 transmission, differently from reports from coldest countries or periods of time under cool temperatures. Thus, considering the results obtained, intersectoral policies and actions are necessary, mainly in cities where the contamination rate is increasing rapidly. Thus, prevention and protection measures should be adopted in these cities aiming to reduce transmission and the possible collapse of the health system.","Auler, A C; Cássaro, F A M; da Silva, V O; Pires, L F",Sci Total Environ,,53

This study aims to identify the suicide-related risk factors and stressors to determine the groups at a greater risk of attempting suicide during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: This retrospective study examined 29 cases of attempted suicide during the 3-month COVID-19 lockdown in KSA. The suicide risk factors were evaluated using the modified sex, age, depression, previous attempt, excess alcohol, rational thinking loss, social support lacking, organized plan, no spouse, sickness (SAD PERSONS) scale along with a comprehensive assessment of the recent stressful life events. Results: The lockdown stressors that may have triggered suicidal behaviours were identified as follows: psychological distress, relationship problems, financial difficulties, and extreme fear of the COVID-19 infection. While all age groups carried the risk of attempting suicide during the lockdown, patients with psychiatric disorders and women accounted for 69% and 65.5% of the cohort, respectively. Factors including hopelessness and depression were highly related to suicide attempts. The statement of future intent to repeat the attempt was made by 72.4% and 65.5%, respectively. Almost two-thirds of the attempts made were serious, and many women felt unsafe in their own homes during the lockdown. Conclusion: Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and women carry high risk of attempting suicide during the COVID-19 lockdown. This study offers insights on the greater outreach efforts that can be carried out for these patients by calling for the prioritization of mental health care, improvement of domestic violence services, and strengthening of suicide prevention strategies.","Almaghrebi, Asma H",,,53
296354,Statins in coronavirus outbreak: It's time for experimental and clinical studies,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic negatively impacted global healthcare. Consequences in Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programmes and mortality of congenital heart patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) is still to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To study the COVID-19 pandemic implications in Brazilian Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programmes. METHODS: We conducted a national online survey covering all states that perform Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery from 10 November to 22 November, 2020, using a Google forms questionnaire. We formulated questions related to impact on surgical volume, case-mix, and mortality. Then we asked about short-term post-operative COVID-19 infection and outcomes. RESULTS: We received responses from 46 centres representing all states where there were a Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programme and all high-volume centres across the country. All but one centre experienced a significant decrease in surgical volume, and 23.9% of the responders revealed less than one-quarter of volume decrement. On the other hand, in over 70% of the centres, there was a significant surgical volume reduction. In addition to this, there was a shift in case-mix in 41 centres (89.1%) towards more complex cases. More than one-third of the responders revealed increased mortality in 2020 compared to previous years, and 43.5% of the programmes (20 centres) had at least one patient contaminated by SARS-Cov-2, accounting for 48 patients. Mortality in post-operative infected patients was 45.8% (22 patients). CONCLUSIONS: In general, Brazilian Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programmes were severely affected by decreased surgical volume, unbalanced case-mix towards more complex cases, and increased mortality. Almost half of the programmes related post-operative COVID-19 contamination with high mortality.","Miana, Leonardo A; Manuel, Valdano; Antoniali, Fernando; Jatene, Marcelo B; Jatene, Fábio Biscegli",Cardiol Young,,53
296786,Epidemiology and me,2020,"BACKGROUND: Populations such as healthcare workers (HCW) that are unable to practice physical distancing are at high risk of acquiring Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). In these cases pharmacological prophylaxis would be a solution to reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) transmission. Hydroxychloroquine has in vitro antiviral properties against SARS CoV-2. We therefore sought to determine the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis for COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We electronically searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane COVID-19 Register of Controlled Trials, Epistemonikos COVID-19, clinicaltrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to September 28th, 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We calculated pooled relative risks (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effect model. We identified four RCTs (n = 4921) that met our eligibility criteria. The use of hydroxychloroquine, compared to placebo, did not reduce the risks of developing COVID-19 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.04, moderate certainty), hospitalization (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.50, moderate certainty), or mortality (RR 3.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 79.74, low certainty), however, hydroxychloroquine use increased the risk of adverse events (RR 2.76, 95% CI 1.38 to 5.55, moderate certainty). CONCLUSION: Although pharmacologic prophylaxis is an attractive preventive strategy against COVID-19, the current body of evidence failed to show clinical benefit for prophylactic hydroxychloroquine and showed a higher risk of adverse events when compared to placebo or no prophylaxis.","Lewis, Kimberley; Chaudhuri, Dipayan; Alshamsi, Fayez; Carayannopoulos, Laiya; Dearness, Karin; Chagla, Zain; Alhazzani, Waleed",PLoS One,,53

298456,2021 Annual Meeting Supplement,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This online cross-sectional study investigated the severity of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms among university students and determined the association between various factors and the levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after the movement control order (MCO) was lifted. METHODS: A total of 316 participants were administered a self-report questionnaire that collected data on sociodemographic attributes, personal characteristics, COVID-19-related stressors, religious coping, and clinical characteristics. In addition, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were administered. RESULTS: Regarding depression, 15.5%, 11.7%, and 9.2% of the participants reported mild, moderate, and severe to extremely severe depression, respectively. For anxiety, 7.0%, 16.5%, and 13.2% of the respondents had mild, moderate, and severe to extremely severe anxiety, respectively. Moreover, 26.3% of participants had mild stress, 9.5% had moderate stress, and 6.6% had severe to extremely severe stress. The multiple linear regression model revealed that frustration because of loss of daily routine and study disruption and having preexisting medical, depressive, and anxiety disorders were associated with elevated depressive symptoms, while a greater degree of family and friends social support was associated with less depressive symptoms after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status. It was also found that frustration because of study disruption and having preexisting medical, depressive, and anxiety disorders were associated with elevated anxiety symptoms, while being enrolled in medicine-based courses and having a greater degree of family support were factors associated with less anxiety symptoms after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status. CONCLUSION: There is a need to conduct a longitudinal study in the future to confirm the causal relationship between the significant predictive factors and depression and anxiety identified in this study, and maintenance of a persistent flow of academic activities and social interaction may be of utmost importance to safeguard the mental wellbeing of university students.","Woon, Luke Sy-Cherng; Leong Bin Abdullah, Mohammad Farris Iman; Sidi, Hatta; Mansor, Nor Shuhada; Nik Jaafar, Nik Ruzyanei",PLoS One,,53
299465,Nonadherence to doctor’s instructions,2020,"Objectives: We previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of SARS-CoV-2 GI infection on clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: For this retrospective cohort study, 104 patients with COVID-19 were classified into a SARS-CoV-2 GI infection group and a non-infection group. The primary endpoint was the time of negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory tract samples. The secondary outcome was the time of hospitalization for COVID-19. Results: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 GI infection had a longer duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory tract samples (median 12.0 days [95% CI: 10.0–13.2] vs. 9.0 days [95% CI: 7.5–10.5];HR 0.575 [95% CI: 0.386–0.857];P = 0.003) and hospitalization (median 28.0 days [95% CI: 23.2–32.8] vs. 15.0 days [95% CI: 13.6–16.4];HR 0.149 [95% CI: 0.087–0.252];P &lt; 0.001) than patients without SARS-CoV-2 GI infection. Subgroup analyses for sex, age, epidemiological history, clinical classification and antiviral treatment showed consistent results. Conclusion: Our study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 GI infection prolongs the duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding and hospitalization in the patients with COVID-19. More attention should be paid to SARS-CoV-2 GI infection of COVID-19 and fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA test should be completed in time.","Xu, Z.; Tang, M.; Chen, P.; Cai, H.; Xiao, F.",Frontiers in Medicine,,53

Surgical patients are vulnerable to the infection during their hospital admission. Some surgical procedures are classified as aerosol generating (AGP). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study of four specialties associates with known AGP's during the 4 months of the first wave of UK COVID-19 epidermic to identify post-surgical cross-infection with SARSCoV-2 within 14 days of a procedure. METHODS: Retrospective observational study in a tertiary healthcare center of four specialties associates with known AGP's during the 4 months of the first wave of UK COVID-19 epidermic to identify post-surgical cross-infection with SARSCoV-2 within 14 days of a procedure. RESULTS: There were 3,410 procedures reported during this period. The overall cross-infection rate from tested patients was 1.3% (4 patients), that is, 0.11% of all operations over 4 months. Ear, nose, and throat carried slightly higher rate of infection (0.4%) than gastroenterology (0.08%). The mortality rate was 0.3% (one gastroenterology patient from 304 positive cases) compared to 0% if surgery performed after recovery from SARSCoV-2 and 37.5% when surgery was conducted during the incubation period of the disease. Routine preoperative rapid screening tests and self-isolation are crucial to avoid the risk of cross-infection. Patients with underlying malignancy or receiving chemotherapy were more prone to pulmonary complications and mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of SARS-COV-2 cross-infection after surgical procedure is very low. Preoperative screening and self-isolation together with personal protective measures should be in place to minimize the cross-infection.

Survey research methodology following the mixed-method approach adopting both qualitative and quantitative methodologies was adopted. Results of the first phase of the study indicated significant psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on respondents during the first three weeks of lockdown, especially the pandemic anxiety and social isolation. Physical health, fitness, self-care, family connect, learning of the new skill sets and self-growth opportunity were found to be some of the functional ways to cope with pandemic in this phase, whereas passive acceptance was expressed as a dysfunctional strategy to cope with pandemic coupled with negative emotions such as fear, anxiety, frustration and irritability for others. However, phase two of the study with 20% of respondents in the sixth week of lockdown revealed the exhaustion of the learning phase, limited efforts for self-growth and increasing anxiety and frustration.

307806,Microbial Strategies for Survival in the Glass Sponge Vazella pourtalesii,2020,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 infection has emerged as a rapidly spreading infection. Today it is relatively easy to isolate Covid-19 symptomatic cases, while remains problematic to control the disease spread by infected but symptom-free individuals. The control of this possible path of contagion requires drastic measures of social distancing, which imply the suspension of most activities and generate economic and social issues. This study is aimed at estimating the percentage of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a geographic area with relatively low incidence of Covid-19. METHODS: Blood serum samples from 388 healthy volunteers were analyzed for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by using an ELISA assay based on recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein. RESULTS: We found that 7 out of 388 healthy volunteers, who declared no symptoms of Covid-19, like fever, cough, fatigue etc., in the preceding 5 months, have bona fide serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, that is 1.8% of the asymptomatic population (95% confidence interval: 0.69-2.91%). CONCLUSIONS: The estimated range of asymptomatic individuals with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG should be between 26,565 and 112, 350. In the same geographic area, there are 4665 symptomatic diagnosed cases.","Caturano, Valeria; Manti, Barbara; Carbone, Fortunata; Lasorsa, Vito Alessandro; Colicchio, Roberta; Capasso, Mario; Leonardi, Antonio; Matarese, Giuseppe; Russo, Tommaso; Salvatore, Paola",BMC Infect Dis,,53

METHODS: Murine activities and appetite, body weight, and ratio of liver weight to its body weight (Hepatic mass index, HMI) were observed. Worm load and liver egg burden were evaluated as the infection intensity. Number and size of liver egg granulomas and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were investigated. We analysed hepatic fibrosis by markers of fibrosis in tissue, detected hepatic Th17 and Treg frequency by flow cytometry, and measured hepatic expressions of RORÎ³t, Foxp3, IL-17A and TGF-ß1 via qPCR. Lipid metabolism was determined by serum levels of cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) as well as hepatic Oil red O staining. RESULTS: In the infected ApoE-/- mice, the increased infection intensity aggravated the hepatic immunopathology (evidenced by increased HMI, elevated egg granulomas and increased ALT levels) and fibrosis (increased hepatic collagen deposition). ApoE deficiency resulted in significantly elevated ratio of hepatic Th17/Treg and higher serum levels of TC and TG, along with higher level of hepatic Oil red O staining. CONCLUSIONS: ApoE deficiency promotes hepatic pathology and fibrosis by exacerbating Th17/Treg imbalance and altering lipid metabolism in murine schistosomiasis japonica.","Guan, Fei; Zhang, Chongyang; Jiang, Chunjie; Jacques, Muziazia Lupemba; Bai, Yang; Lu, Shengjun; Liu, Wenqi; Lei, Jiahui",Parasite Immunol,,53

Una questione da ridiscutere alla luce dell‟epidemia,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Through a systematic review and meta-analysis of research on COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) pandemics, we investigated whether mental disorder prevalence: (a) was elevated among populations impacted by coronavirus pandemics (relative to unselected populations reported in the literature), and (b) varied by disorder (undifferentiated psychiatric morbidity, anxiety, depressive, posttraumatic stress disorders [PTSD]) and impacted population (community, infected/recovered, healthcare provider, quarantined). METHOD: From 68 publications (N = 87,586 participants), 808 estimates were included in a series of multilevel meta-analyses/regressions including random effects to account for estimates nested within studies. RESULTS: Median summary point prevalence estimates varied by disorder and population. Psychiatric morbidity (20-56%), PTSD (10-26%) and depression (9-27%) were most prevalent in most populations. The highest prevalence of each disorder was found among infected/recovered adults (18-56%), followed by healthcare providers (11-28%) and community adults (11-20%). Prevalence estimates were often notably higher than reported for unselected samples. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that overall prevalence estimates moderately varied by pandemic, study location, and mental disorder measure type. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus pandemics are associated with multiple mental disorders in several impacted populations. Needed are investigations of causal links between specific pandemic-related stressors, threats, and traumas and mental disorders.","Boden, Matt; Cohen, Nichole; Froelich, Jessilyn M; Hoggatt, Katherine J; Abdel Magid, Hoda S; Mushiana, Swapandeep S",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,,53

There is currently no proven effective drug treatment or prophylaxis for this coronavirus infection. While developing safe and effective vaccines is one of the key focuses, a number of existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for their potency and efficiency against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in the clinic. Here, we review the significant potential of nitazoxanide (NTZ) as an antiviral agent that can be repurposed as a treatment for COVID-19. Originally, NTZ was developed as an antiparasitic agent especially against Cryptosporidium spp.; it was later shown to possess potent activity against a broad range of both RNA and DNA viruses, including influenza A, hepatitis B and C, and coronaviruses. Recent in vitro assessment of NTZ has confirmed its promising activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 2.12 µM. Here we examine its drug properties, antiviral activity against different viruses, clinical trials outcomes, and mechanisms of antiviral action from the literature in order to highlight the therapeutic potential for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, in preliminary PK/PD analyses using clinical data reported in the literature, comparison of simulated TIZ (active metabolite of NTZ) exposures at two doses with the in vitro potency of NTZ against SARS-CoV-2 gives further support for drug repurposing with potential in combination chemotherapy approaches. The review concludes with details of second generation thiazolides under development that could lead to improved antiviral therapies for future indications.","Stachulski, Andrew V; Taujanskas, Joshua; Pate, Sophie L; Rajoli, Rajith K R; Aljayyoussi, Ghaith; Pennington, Shaun H; Ward, Stephen A; Hong, Weiqian David; Biagini, Giancarlo A; Owen, Andrew; Nixon, Gemma L; Leung, Suet C; O039,; Neill, Paul M",ACS infect. dis,,53

In particular, we examine whether Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU), Geopolitical Risk (GPR), World Trade Uncertainty (WTU), and Equity Market Uncertainty (EMU) have an impact on the dynamics of returns of oil, gas, and coal markets. Results suggest that the average influence of market uncertainty on energy markets is approximately 53%. Second, we find that the EPU contributes the most to the energy markets, followed by the World Trade Uncertainty index. Third, considering the energy markets, we find that the oil markets contribute the most to other markets. Fourth, we find that the EMU receives the most contribution from other markets, followed by the EPU. Finally, we observe that the total connectedness index is relatively high, coinciding with the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Further analysis of the possible effect of the investor sentiment on the dynamic connectedness shows that the consumer sentiment index (CSI) has a negative (positive) effect on the uncertainty (energy) net connectedness. Our findings have important implications for risk management in energy markets and entail some policy implications for regulators.","Assaf, Ata Charif Husni Mokni Khaled",Resources Policy,,53

Here, the aim is to explore graphene oxide (GO), the most studied 2D nanomaterial in biomedical applications, as a nanoscale platform for interaction with SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking analyses of GO sheets on interaction with three different structures: SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (open state - 6VYB or closed state - 6VXX), ACE2 (1R42), and the ACE2-bound spike complex (6M0J) are performed. GO shows high affinity for the surface of all three structures (6M0J, 6VYB and 6VXX). When binding affinities and involved bonding types are compared, GO interacts more strongly with the spike or ACE2, compared to 6M0J. Infection experiments using infectious viral particles from four different clades as classified by Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID), are performed for validation purposes. Thin, biological-grade GO nanoscale (few hundred nanometers in lateral dimension) sheets are able to significantly reduce copies for three different viral clades. This data has demonstrated that GO sheets have the capacity to interact with SARS-CoV-2 surface components and disrupt infectivity even in the presence of any mutations on the viral spike.

There is a great scientific community effort to obtain a therapy capable of reaching the multiple affected organs in order to contribute for tissue repair and regeneration. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as potential candidates concerning the promotion of beneficial actions at different stages of COVID-19. MSCs are promising due to the observed therapeutic effects in respiratory preclinical models, as well as in cardiac, vascular, renal and nervous system models. Their immunomodulatory properties and secretion of paracrine mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and extracellular vesicles allow for long range tissue modulation and, particularly, blood-brain barrier crossing.

Immunohistochemistry revealed intense deposition of &#945;-defensins in lung vasculature and thrombi. IL-6 stimulated the release of &#945;-defensins from neutrophils, thereby accelerating coagulation and inhibiting fibrinolysis in human blood, imitating the coagulation pattern in COVID-19 patients. The procoagulant effect of IL-6 was inhibited by colchicine, which blocks neutrophil degranulation.

333253,A Systematic Comparison of Differential Analysis Methods for CyTOF Data,2021,"COVID-19, predominantly a mild disease, is associated with more severe clinical manifestation upon pulmonary involvement. Virion-laden aerosols and droplets target different anatomical sites for deposition. Compared to droplets, aerosols more readily advance into the peripheral lung. We performed in silico modeling to confirm the secondary pulmonary lobules as the primary site of disease initiation. By taking different anatomical aerosol origins into consideration and reflecting aerosols from exhalation maneuvers breathing and vocalization, the physicochemical properties of generated respiratory aerosol particles were defined upon conversion to droplet nuclei by evaporation at ambient air. To provide detailed, spatially-resolved information on particle deposition in the thoracic region of the lung, a top-down refinement approach was employed. Our study presents evidence for hot spots of aerosol deposition in lung generations beyond the terminal bronchiole, with a maximum in the secondary pulmonary lobules and a high preference to the lower lobes of both lungs. In vivo, initial chest CT anomalies, the ground glass opacities, resulting from partial alveolar filling and interstitial thickening in the secondary pulmonary lobules, are likewise localized in these lung generations, with the highest frequency in both lower lobes and in the early stage of disease. Hence, our results suggest a disease initiation right there upon inhalation of virion-laden respiratory aerosols, linking the aerosol transmission route to pathogenesis associated with higher disease burden and identifying aerosol transmission as a new independent risk factor for developing a pulmonary phase with a severe outcome.","Hofer, Sabine Hofstätter Norbert Duschl Albert Himly Martin",Journal of Personalized Medicine,,53
333911,Spatial gist extraction during human memory consolidation,2021,"COVID-19 has caused a major global pandemic and necessitated unprecedented public health restrictions in almost every country. Understanding risk factors for severe disease in hospitalised patients is critical as the pandemic progresses. This observational cohort study aimed to characterise the independent associations between the clinical outcomes of hospitalised patients and their demographics, comorbidities, blood tests and bedside observations. All patients admitted to Northwick Park Hospital, London, UK between 12 March and 15 April 2020 with COVID-19 were retrospectively identified. The primary outcome was death. Associations were explored using Cox proportional hazards modelling. The study included 981 patients. The mortality rate was 36.0%. Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.53), respiratory disease (aHR 1.37), immunosuppression (aHR 2.23), respiratory rate (aHR 1.28), hypoxia (aHR 1.36), Glasgow Coma Scale <15 (aHR 1.92), urea (aHR 2.67), alkaline phosphatase (aHR 2.53), C-reactive protein (aHR 1.15), lactate (aHR 2.67), platelet count (aHR 0.77) and infiltrates on chest radiograph (aHR 1.89) were all associated with mortality. These important data will aid clinical risk stratification and provide direction for further research.","Goodall, J W; Reed, T A N; Ardissino, M; Bassett, P; Whittington, A M; Cohen, D L; Vaid, N",Epidemiol Infect,,53
334200,Hope and a horizon of solidarity – An interview with Jeffrey C. Alexander,2020,"Large content providers and content distribution network operators usually connect with large Internet service providers (eyeball networks) through dedicated private peering. The capacity of these private network interconnects is provisioned to match the volume of the real content demand by the users. Unfortunately, in case of a surge in traffic demand, for example due to a content trending in a certain country, the capacity of the private interconnect may deplete and the content provider/distributor would have to reroute the excess traffic through transit providers. Although, such overflow events are rare, they have significant negative impacts on content providers, Internet service providers, and end-users. These include unexpected delays and disruptions reducing the user experience quality, as well as direct costs paid by the Internet service provider to the transit providers. If the traffic overflow events could be predicted, the Internet service providers would be able to influence the routes chosen for the excess traffic to reduce the costs and increase user experience quality. In this article we propose a method based on an ensemble of deep learning models to predict overflow events over a short term horizon of 2-6 hours and predict the specific interconnections that will ingress the overflow traffic. The method was evaluated with 2.5 years' traffic measurement data from a large European Internet service provider resulting in a true-positive rate of 0.8 while maintaining a 0.05 false-positive rate. The lockdown imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the overflow prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, starting from the end of April 2020 with the gradual lockdown release, the old models trained before the pandemic perform equally well.","Rapaport, Elad; Poese, Ingmar; Zilberman, Polina; Holschke, Oliver; Puzis, Rami",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01380v1.pdf,53

334953,Offline: The path out of lockdown,2021,"BACKGROUND: Spontaneous pneumothorax is an uncommon complication of COVID-19 viral pneumonia. The exact incidence and risk factors are still unknown. Herein we review the incidence and outcomes of pneumothorax in over 3000 patients admitted to our institution for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of COVID-19 cases admitted to our hospital. Patients who were diagnosed with a spontaneous pneumothorax were identified to calculate the incidence of this event. Their clinical characteristics were thoroughly documented. Data regarding their clinical outcomes were gathered. Each case was presented as a brief synopsis. RESULTS: Three thousand three hundred sixty-eight patients were admitted to our institution between March 1st, 2020 and June 8th, 2020 for suspected COVID 19 pneumonia, 902 patients were nasopharyngeal swab positive. Six cases of COVID-19 patients who developed spontaneous pneumothorax were identified (0.66%). Their baseline imaging showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations, mostly in the posterior and peripheral lung regions. 4/6 cases were associated with mechanical ventilation. All patients required placement of a chest tube. In all cases, mortality (66.6%) was not directly related to the pneumothorax. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous pneumothorax is a rare complication of COVID-19 viral pneumonia and may occur in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Clinicians should be vigilant about the diagnosis and treatment of this complication.","Zantah, Massa; Dominguez Castillo, Eduardo; Townsend, Ryan; Dikengil, Fusun; Criner, Gerard J",Respir Res,,53

This study aims to determine the effectiveness of a system that combined telehealth applications with local psychosocial support teams, allowing services from video calls to emergency interventions. Materials and Methods: The system combines the telehealth applications with the services from local psychosocial intervention teams. In addition to system records covering sociodemographic variables and initial complaints, a telephone survey questioning the effectiveness and satisfaction of the system was used as the main outcome. Results: In total, 347 individuals used the system with mothers constituting the majority of applicants (88.7%, n = 332). The overall satisfaction of the system was 8.8/10. In terms of effectiveness, 63.3% (n = 237) of caregivers reported an improvement in the reason of application. Counselors decided on a need for follow-up visits for 36.6% (n = 137) of applications. A referral to a psychiatrist was asked for 40 patients (10.6%). Discussion: To our best knowledge, this is the first study presenting a model for managing MBs of CMSNs during the COVID-19 outbreak. In general, therefore, it seems that there is a need for unique systems to handle behavioral problems of CMSNs. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that it is possible to establish an integrative multistep multidisciplinary telehealth-based approach in a short while.","Dursun, Onur Burak; Turan, Bahadir; Gulsen, Murat; Karayagmurlu, Ali; Tugce Mustan, Aybuke; Kutlu, Ayse; Rodopman Arman, Ayse; Gokcen, Cem; Dogru, Hicran; Esin, Ibrahim Selcuk; Kaya, Ilyas; Coskun, Murat; Soylu, Nusret; Erbilgin, Seda; Tanir, Yasar",Telemed. j. e. health,,53

336757,Ultraviolet Light Fights New Virus,2020,"Although targeting health behaviour change through social media campaigns has gained traction in recent years, few studies have focused on breastfeeding social media campaigns. Within the context of rising social media utilization and recent declines in exclusive breastfeeding practices in Ghana, we implemented Breastfeed4Ghana, a Facebook- and Twitter-based breastfeeding social media campaign. This study determined feasibility of implementing Breastfeed4Ghana and evaluated its impact on breastfeeding knowledge in Ghana. Key performance indicators of the campaign were monitored on social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter. An online cross-sectional survey conducted across three time points (n = 451) assessed breastfeeding knowledge, campaign exposure, and understanding and acceptability of Breastfeed4Ghana among Ghanaian adults. Modified Poisson models were used to assess the relationship between campaign exposure and breastfeeding knowledge, adjusting for survey time point, sex, and parenthood status. The campaign acquired 4,832 followers. Based on follower demographics collected from Facebook and Twitter analytics, the target population was successfully reached. Campaign exposure among survey participants was 42.3% and 48.7% at midline and endline, respectively. Campaign acceptability was high (>90%), and >44% of those exposed to the campaign also shared the campaign with others. However, 61.0% of those exposed did not know or could not remember the purpose of the campaign. Campaign exposure was not associated with higher breastfeeding knowledge (APR [95% confidence interval] = 0.96 [0.73, 1.26]). Breastfeed4Ghana was highly feasible. However, campaign understanding yielded mixed findings and may explain the limited impact on breastfeeding knowledge.","Harding, Kassandra; Aryeetey, Richmond; Carroll, Grace; Lasisi, Opeyemi; Pérez-Escamilla, Rafael; Young, Marissa",Matern Child Nutr,,53
337099,A Brain Capital Grand Strategy: toward economic reimagination,2020,"A reliable model of galaxy bias is necessary for interpreting data from future dense galaxy surveys. Conventional linear and quadratic bias models are unphysical, often predicting negative galaxy densities (Î´ g < -1) in voids, which potentially contain half of a survey's available cosmological information. Here we present a physically motivated alternative by assuming two energetically distinct subhalo states. Our approximations - namely, local galaxy formation, rough equivalence of galaxy-hosting subhaloes, and universal energetic favourability for the galaxy-hosting state - result in a bias model with only two free parameters; mathematically, the model (in the correct variables) yields a Fermi-Dirac distribution or (equivalently) an interactionless Ising model with an external field. The model yields sensible (and physical) predictions for both high- and low-density regions. We test the model using a catalogue of Millennium Simulation galaxies in cubical survey pixels with side lengths from 2 h -1-31 h -1 Mpc, at redshifts from 0 to 2. We find the two-state model markedly superior to linear and quadratic bias models on scales smaller than 10 h -1 Mpc, while those conventional models fare better on scales larger than 30 h -1 Mpc. Though the largest scale of applicability is likely to depend on the galaxy catalogue employed, the two-state model should be superior on any scale with a non-negligible fraction of cells devoid of galaxies.","Repp, Andrew; Szapudi, István",Mon Not R Astron Soc,,53
337123,The Interaction Between Credit Constraints and Uncertainty Shocks,2020-04-30,"In the past several months, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated infection (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) developed rapidly and has turned into a global pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks respiratory systems, manifestations of multiple organs have been observed. A great concern was raised about whether COVID-19 may affect male reproductive functions. In this study, we collected semen specimens from 12 male COVID-19 patients for virus detection and semen characteristics analysis. No SARS-CoV-2 was found in semen specimens. Eight out of 12 patients had normal semen quality. We also compared the sex-related hormone levels between 119 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 273 age-matched control men. A higher serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and a lower ratio of testosterone (T) to LH were observed in the COVID-19 group. Multiple regression analysis indicated that serum T: LH ratio was negatively associated with white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels in COVID-19 patients. It's the first report about semen assessment and sex-hormone evaluation in reproductive-aged male COVID-19 patients. Although further study is needed to clarify the reasons and underlying mechanisms, our study presents an abnormal sex hormone secretion among COVID-19 patients, suggesting that attention should be paid to reproductive function evaluation in the follow-up.","Ma, Ling; Xie, Wen; Li, Danyang; Shi, Lei; Ye, Guangming; Mao, Yanhong; Xiong, Yao; Sun, Hui; Zheng, Fang; Chen, Zhimin; Qin, Jyuling; Lyu, Jing; Zhang, Yuanzhen; Zhang, Ming",J. med. virol,,53
337484,Making love in the time of corona - considering relationships in lockdown,2020,"Individuals can use diverse behavioral strategies to navigate their environment including hippocampal-dependent place strategies reliant upon cognitive maps and striatal-dependent response strategies reliant upon egocentric body turns. The existence of multiple memory systems appears to facilitate successful navigation across a wide range of environmental and physiological conditions. The mechanisms by which these systems interact to ultimately generate a unitary behavioral response, however, remain unclear. We trained 20 male, Sprague-Dawley rats on a dual-solution T-maze while simultaneously recording local field potentials that were targeted to the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Eight rats spontaneously exhibited a place strategy while the remaining 12 rats exhibited a response strategy. Interindividual differences in behavioral strategy were associated with distinct patterns of LFP activity between the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Specifically, striatal-hippocampal theta activity was in-phase in response rats and out-of-phase in place rats and response rats exhibited elevated striatal-hippocampal coherence across a wide range of frequency bands. These contrasting striatal-hippocampal activity regimes were (a) present during both maze-learning and a 30 min premaze habituation period and (b) could be used to train support vector machines to reliably predict behavioral strategy. Distinct patterns of neuronal activity across multiple memory systems, therefore, appear to bias behavioral strategy selection and thereby contribute to interindividual differences in behavior.","Goldenberg, Joshua E; Lentzou, Stergiani; Ackert-Smith, Lyn; Knowlton, Harrison; Dash, Michael B",Hippocampus,,53
337485,Making love in the time of corona - considering relationships in lockdown,2020,"BACKGROUND: Visitors to hospitalized patients during an epidemic might themselves be carriers and are therefore likely to spread the disease in wards. Although measures were taken to restrict hospital visits, traditional paper-based registration is insufficient to screen and monitor the numbers of visitors to a large hospital. METHODS: Throughout March 2020, during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, a computer system was deployed in the 2800-bed Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan) to register, screen, and monitor inpatient visitors. This system comprised three parts: online registration form, entrance check-in interface, and registration database. The early utilization of this newly deployed system was then analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 22,336 visits were recorded between March 11, 2020, and March 31, 2020, with 1064 a day on average. Out of these visits, 18.1% (n = 4049) had made online reservations within 48 hours. On the other hand, of all 4941 online reservations, 18.1% (n = 892) were no-shows. In the last 12 days of the study period, eight prospective visitors were identified as ineligible by the computer system, and so their visits were denied. CONCLUSION: Using a computer system, the hospital was able to enforce restrictions on hospital visits. Although the online registration system had not been fully used yet in the early phase of adoption, its superiority from the standpoint of disease control should enable hospital managers to consider abolishing on-site visitor registration.","Hsu, Chia-An; Yuan, Eunice J; Fen, Jun-Jeng; Lee, Chung-Yuan; Ming, Jin-Lain; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Lee, Wui-Chiang; Chen, Shih-Ann",J Chin Med Assoc,,53
338548,Detecting early or late changes in linear models with heteroscedastic errors,2020,"Given the high risk of healthcare worker (HCW) infection with COVID-19 during aerosol-generating medical procedures, the use of a box barrier during intubation for protection of HCWs has been examined. Previous simulation work has demonstrated its efficacy in protecting HCWs from cough-expelled droplets. Our objective was to assess its ability to protect HCWs against aerosols generated during aerosol-generating medical procedures. We used a battery-powered vapouriser to assess movement of vapour with: (1) no barrier; (2) a box barrier; and (3) a box barrier and a plastic sheet covering the box and patient's body. We visualised the trajectory of vapour and saw that the vapour remained within the barrier space when the box barrier and plastic sheet were used. This is in contrast to the box barrier alone, where vapour diffused towards the feet of the patient and throughout the room, and to no barrier where the vapour immediately diffused to the laryngoscopist. This demonstrates that the box with the plastic sheet has the potential to limit the spread of aerosols towards the laryngoscopist, and thus may play a role in protecting HCWs during aerosol-generating medical procedures. This is of particular importance in the care of patients with suspected COVID-19.","Jazuli, Farah; Bilic, Monika; Hanel, Erich; Ha, Michael; Hassall, Kelly; Trotter, Brendon Gordon",Emerg Med J,,53

Healthcare workers are at high risk, and unfortunately, more than 3,000 healthcare workers in China have been infected. Anesthesiologists are among healthcare workers who are at an even higher risk of becoming infected because of their close contact with infected patients and high potential of exposure to respiratory droplets or aerosol from their patients' airways. In order to provide healthcare workers with updated recommendations on the management of patients in the perioperative setting as well as for emergency airway management outside of the operating room, the two largest anesthesia societies, the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology (CSA) and the Chinese Association of Anesthesiologists (CAA) have formed a task force to produce the recommendations. The task force hopes to help healthcare workers, particularly anesthesiologists, optimize the care of their patients and protect patients, healthcare workers, and the public from becoming infected. The recommendations were created mainly based on the practice and experience of anesthesiologists who provide care to patients in China.

Biochemical studies revealed that the active form of the drug targets the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and causes delayed chain-termination. Delayed chain-termination is incomplete, but the continuation of RNA synthesis enables a partial escape from viral proofreading. Remdesivir becomes embedded in the copy of the RNA genome that later serves as a template. Incorporation of an incoming nucleotide triphosphate is now inhibited by the modified template. Knowledge on the mechanism of action matters. Enzymatic inhibition links to antiviral effects in cell cultures, animal models and viral load reduction in patients, which provides the logical chain that is expected for a direct acting antiviral. Hence, remdesivir also serves as a benchmark in current drug development efforts that will hopefully lead to orally available treatments to the benefit of a broader population.","Götte, Matthias",Curr Opin Virol,,53

How do online circadian rhythms react to such a disruption? Data: We base our research on the analysis and comparison of two independent databases about the French cyberspace: a fine-grained temporal record of YouTube videos and a large collection of Tweets on {Covid-19}. Findings: In both datasets we observe a reshaping of the circadian rhythms with a substantial increase of night activity during the lockdown.

The COVID-19 pandemic and restrictive measures enforced in residential settings have resulted in changes in daily routine and modified the ways families can interact with and provide support to residents. Yet, the impact of these changes has not been empirically explored. AIM: Explore how family caregivers have interacted with and supported their relatives with DD residing in supported accommodation during the pandemic. METHODS: Changes in frequencies of communication modes and types of informal support were measured through a cross-sectional and anonymous online survey which completed by 108 family caregivers of adults with DD. RESULTS: Most family caregivers adopted remote communication technologies; however, these were not perceived to be effective in filling the gap created by reduced face-to-face contact. While families were able to provide emotional support and advocacy using digital technologies, they were limited in their ability to provide significant social support. CONCLUSIONS: Findings may help key stakeholders develop and implement novel strategies and policies to accommodate the changing circumstances and to ensure continuity of family engagement and informal support in the context of COVID-19.","Araten-Bergman, Tal; Shpigelman, Carmit-Noa",Res Dev Disabil,,53

347112,The Role of MicroRNA in the Airway Surface Liquid Homeostasis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and antigen tests are important diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2. Sensitivity of antigen tests has been shown to be lower than that of rRT-PCR; however, data to evaluate epidemiologic characteristics that affect test performance are limited. METHODS: Paired mid-turbinate nasal swabs were collected from university students and staff and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using both Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) and rRT-PCR assay. Specimens positive by either rRT-PCR or antigen FIA were placed in viral culture and tested for subgenomic RNA (sgRNA). Logistic regression models were used to evaluate characteristics associated with antigen results, rRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, sgRNA, and viral culture. RESULTS: Antigen FIA sensitivity was 78.9% and 43.8% among symptomatic and asymptomatic participants respectively. Among rRT-PCR positive participants, negative antigen results were more likely among asymptomatic participants (OR 4.6, CI:1.3-15.4) and less likely among participants reporting nasal congestion (OR 0.1, CI:0.03-0.8). rRT-PCR-positive specimens with higher Ct values (OR 0.5, CI:0.4-0.8) were less likely, and specimens positive for sgRNA (OR 10.2, CI:1.6-65.0) more likely, to yield positive virus isolation. Antigen testing was >90% positive in specimens with Ct values <29. Positive predictive value of antigen test for positive viral culture (57.7%) was similar to that of rRT-PCR (59.3%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 antigen test advantages include low cost, wide availability and rapid turnaround time, making them important screening tests. The performance of antigen tests may vary with patient characteristics, so performance characteristics should be accounted for when designing testing strategies and interpreting results.","Ford, Laura; Lee, Christine; Pray, Ian W; Cole, Devlin; Bigouette, John Paul; Abedi, Glen R; Bushman, Dena; Delahoy, Miranda J; Currie, Dustin W; Cherney, Blake; Kirby, Marie; Fajardo, Geroncio; Caudill, Motria; Langolf, Kimberly; Kahrs, Juliana; Zochert, Tara; Kelly, Patrick; Pitts, Collin; Lim, Ailam; Aulik, Nicole; Tamin, Azaibi; Harcourt, Jennifer L; Queen, Krista; Zhang, Jing; Whitaker, Brett; Browne, Hannah; Medrzycki, Magdalena; Shewmaker, Patricia; Bonenfant, Gaston; Zhou, Bin; Folster, Jennifer; Bankamp, Bettina; Bowen, Michael D; Thornburg, Natalie J; Goffard, Kimberly; Limbago, Brandi; Bateman, Allen; Tate, Jacqueline E; Gieryn, Douglas; Kirking, Hannah L; Westergaard, Ryan; Killerby, Marie",Clin. infect. dis,,53
347113,A network paradigm for very high capacity mobile and fixed telecommunications ecosystem sustainable evolution,2020-06-02,"Due to its impact, COVID-19 has been stressing the academy to search for curing, mitigating, or controlling it. It is believed that under-reporting is a relevant factor in determining the actual mortality rate and, if not considered, can cause significant misinformation. Therefore, this work aims to estimate the under-reporting of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Brazilian states using data from the InfoGripe. InfoGripe targets notifications of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The methodology is based on the combination of data analytics (event detection methods) and time series modeling (inertia and novelty concepts) over hospitalized SARI cases. The estimate of real cases of the disease, called novelty, is calculated by comparing the difference in SARI cases in 2020 (after COVID-19) with the total expected cases in recent years (2016-2019). The expected cases are derived from a seasonal exponential moving average. The results show that under-reporting rates vary significantly between states and that there are no general patterns for states in the same region in Brazil. The states of Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso have the highest rates of under-reporting of cases. The rate of under-reporting of deaths is high in the Rio Grande do Sul and the Minas Gerais. This work can be highlighted for the combination of data analytics and time series modeling. Our calculation of under-reporting rates based on SARI is conservative and better characterized by deaths than for cases.","Paixão, Balthazar; Baroni, Lais; Pedroso, Marcel; Salles, Rebecca; Escobar, Luciana; de Sousa, Carlos; de Freitas Saldanha, Raphael; Soares, Jorge; Coutinho, Rafaelli; Porto, Fabio; Ogasawara, Eduardo",New Gener Comput,,53

Drawing on social representations theory and positioning theory, we explore social representations and identities related to COVID-19 in mass media using a visual rhetoric analysis. More specifically, we focus on how newspaper photographs construct subjects' positions for different age groups. The data consisted of 4,506 photographs of people published in the two largest Finnish newspapers between 1 January and 31 August 2020. The study identified the following subject positions for the different age groups: (a) children as controlled pupils and joyful players; (b) youth as future-oriented graduates and reckless partygoers; (c) adults as authoritative experts, adaptive professionals, responsible caretakers and active recreationists and (d) elderly people as isolated loners. In addition to echoing the positions of villains, heroes and victims identified in previous studies, the photographs seemed to construct an intergroup divide between adults and the other age groups. Methodologically, this study elaborates the usefulness of the analysis of visual rhetoric in social representations research. Theoretically, we seek to advance the understanding of the role of media, particularly images, in the social construction of knowledge.","Martikainen, Jari; Sakki, Inari",,,53

In Japan, cancer screenings were halted and the numbers of endoscopies and surgeries were restricted in some hospitals based on the state of emergency declared. Herein, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the characteristics of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in facilities that are on the frontline of both COVID-19 and cancer treatments. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed the cases of all of the CRC patients (n = 123) who underwent surgery at our regional cancer treatment center and tertiary emergency hospital in Japan during a 120-day period ranging from before to after the state of emergency declaration. CRC patients during the corresponding period in the previous year were also examined. Results: Although the number of CRC patients did not show a significant change related to the pandemic, the incidence of obstructive CRCs significantly increased after the pandemic's start. The numbers of outpatients and colonoscopies both decreased, which could have resulted in the decrease of CRC patients detected by cancer screening during the pandemic. The numbers of symptomatic CRC patients and emergency admissions both increased significantly during the pandemic. Conclusion: Our findings indicate the possibility that the discovery of CRCs in patients could be delayed due to the halt in screenings caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the increase of obstructive CRCs. These results highlight the importance of cancer screening and suggest that the screening system for cancers should be reorganized before future pandemics.","Mizuno, Rei; Ganeko, Riki; Takeuchi, Go; Mimura, Kazuya; Nakahara, Hideto; Hashimoto, Kyoichi; Hinami, Junsuke; Shimomatsuya, Takumi; Kubota, Yoshihiro",Ann Med Surg (Lond),,53

METHODS: Conventional culture, molecular detections for atypical aetiologies, QiaStat-Dx® respiratory panel V2 detecting 21 respiratory pathogens and ribosomal DNA genes 16S/18S amplicon-based microbiome analyses were performed on respiratory samples from 34 COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. RESULTS: Potential pathogens were detected in seven patients (21%) by culturing, in four patients (12%) by microbiome analysis, and in one patient (3%) by respiratory panel. Among 20 patients receiving antibiotics prior to ICU admission, fungi (3 Candida albicans, 1 C. tropicalis, 1 C. dubliniensis) were cultured in 5 (15 %) endotracheal aspirates. Among 14 patients who were antibiotic-naive at ICU admission, two patients (6 %) had bacterial respiratory pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae) cultured in their endotracheal aspirates. Microbiome analysis recognised four potential respiratory pathogens (3 Haemophilus influenza, 1 Fusobacterium necrophorum) isolated in samples from four other patients (12%). QiaStat-Dx® respiratory panel V2 detected adenovirus in one patient (3%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of pulmonary microbial co-infections is modest among COVID-19 patients upon admission to ICU. Microbiome analysis complements conventional microbial diagnostics in characterization of respiratory co-infections.","Thomsen, Kim; Pedersen, Henrik Planck; Iversen, Susanne; Wiese, Lothar; Fuursted, Kurt; Nielsen, Henrik Vedel; Christensen, Jens Jørgen Elmer; Nielsen, Xiaohui Chen",APMIS acta pathol. microbiol. immunol. scand,,53

355332,Who to Accelerate Research and Innovation for New Coronavirus,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health emergency posing unprecedented challenges for health authorities. Social media may serve as an effective platform to disseminate health-related information. This study aimed to assess the extent of social media use, its impact on preventive behavior, and negative health effects such as cyberchondria and information overload. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted between June 10, 2020 and August 9, 2020 among people visiting the outpatient department of the authors' institution, and participants were also recruited during field visits for an awareness drive. Questions were developed on preventive behavior, and the Short Cyberchondria Scale and instruments dealing with information overload and perceived vulnerability were used. RESULTS: The study recruited 767 participants with a mean age of about 45 years. Most of the participants (&gt;90%) engaged in preventive behaviors, which were influenced by the extent of information received through social media platforms (ß=3.297; p&lt;0.001) and awareness of infection when a family member tested positive (ß=29.082; p&lt;0.001) or a neighbor tested positive (ß=27.964; p&lt;0.001). The majority (63.0%) of individuals often searched for COVID-19 related news on social media platforms. The mean±standard deviation scores for cyberchondria and information overload were 9.09±4.05 and 8.69±2.56, respectively. Significant and moderately strong correlations were found between cyberchondria, information overload, and perceived vulnerability to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the use of social media as an information- seeking platform altered preventive behavior. However, excessive and misleading information resulted in cyberchondria and information overload.","Bala, Renu; Srivastava, Amit; Ningthoujam, Gouri Devi; Potsangbam, Thadoi; Oinam, Amita; Anal, Ch Lily",J Prev Med Public Health,,53

356706,Mixing properties of Skellam-GARCH processes,2020-05-25,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19. DESIGN: Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research. SETTING: International studies on incubation period of COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: Searches were carried out in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and CIs of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. After initial eligibility screening, 24 studies were selected for initial review, nine of these were shortlisted for meta-analysis. Final estimates are from meta-analysis of eight studies. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Parameters of a lognormal distribution of incubation periods. RESULTS: The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95% CIs) of 1.63 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively. The corresponding mean (95% CIs) was 5.8 (95% CI 5.0 to 6.7) days. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates (95% CIs) resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95% CI 9.7 to 14.2) days. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available. Accordingly, we present an R Shiny app that facilitates updating these estimates as new data become available.","McAloon, Conor; Collins, Áine; Hunt, Kevin; Barber, Ann; Byrne, Andrew W; Butler, Francis; Casey, Miriam; Griffin, John; Lane, Elizabeth; McEvoy, David; Wall, Patrick; Green, Martin; O039,; Grady, Luke; More, Simon J",BMJ Open,,53
357062,Seeing through multimode fibers with real-valued intensity transmission matrices,2020,"With increasing number of COVID-19 cases globally, all the countries are ramping up the testing numbers. While the RT-PCR kits are available in sufficient quantity in several countries, others are facing challenges with limited availability of testing kits and processing centers in remote areas. This has motivated researchers to find alternate methods of testing which are reliable, easily accessible and faster. Chest X-Ray is one of the modalities that is gaining acceptance as a screening modality. Towards this direction, the paper has two primary contributions. Firstly, we present the COVID-19 Multi-Task Network which is an automated end-to-end network for COVID-19 screening. The proposed network not only predicts whether the CXR has COVID-19 features present or not, it also performs semantic segmentation of the regions of interest to make the model explainable. Secondly, with the help of medical professionals, we manually annotate the lung regions of 9000 frontal chest radiographs taken from ChestXray-14, CheXpert and a consolidated COVID-19 dataset. Further, 200 chest radiographs pertaining to COVID-19 patients are also annotated for semantic segmentation.

However, comorbidities and the incidence of cytokine storm (CS)-associated pathological complexities in some COVID-19 patients may limit the clinical use of these drugs. Additionally, CS-targeting mAbs have the potential to cause adverse events that restrict their applicability in patients with comorbidities. Novel mAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2 require pharmacological and toxicological characterization before a marketable product becomes available.

The aim of the current study was to explore health professionals' perspectives on the factors impacting ARRT utilisation in the care of acutely unwell residential aged care facility residents. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two Geriatricians, two ARRT Clinical Nurse Consultants, an ED-based Clinical Nurse Specialist, and an Extended Care Paramedic. Interview questions elicited views on key factors regarding care decisions and care transitions for acutely unwell residential aged care facility residents. Thematic analysis was undertaken to identify themes and sub-themes from interviews. RESULTS: Analysis of interviews identified five overarching themes affecting ARRT utilisation in the care of acutely unwell residents: (1) resident care needs; (2) family factors; (3) enabling factors; (4) barriers; and (5) adaptability and responsiveness to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Various factors impact on hospital avoidance program utilisation in the care of acutely unwell older aged care facility residents.

359458,Potential Neutralizing Antibodies Discovered for Novel Corona Virus Using Machine Learning,2020-03-18,"A graph is word-representable if it can be represented in a certain way using alternation of letters in words. Word-representable graphs generalise several important and well-studied classes of graphs, and they can be characterised by semi-transitive orientations. Recognising word-representability is an NP-complete problem, and the bottleneck of the theory of word-representable graphs is how to convince someone, e.g.\ a referee, that a graph is non-word-representable keeping in mind that references to (publicly available) software are not always welcome? (Word-representability can be justified by providing a semi-transitive orientation as a certificate that can be checked in polynomial time.) In the literature, a variety of (usually ad hoc) proofs of non-word-representability for particular graphs, or families of graphs, appear, but for a randomly selected graph, one should expect looking at $O(2^{\#\mbox{edges}})$ orientations and justifying that none of them is semi-transitive. Even if computer would print out all these orientations and would point out what is wrong with each of the orientations, such a proof would be essentially non-checkable by a human. In this paper, we develop methods for an automatic search of human-verifiable proofs of graph non-word-representability. As a proof-of-concept, we provide ``short'' proofs of non-word-representability, generated automatically by our publicly available user-friendly software, of the Shrikhande graph on 16 vertices and 48 edges (9 ``lines'' of proof) and the Clebsch graph on 16 vertices and 40 edges (33 ``lines'' of proof). As a bi-product of our studies, we correct two mistakes published multiple times (two graphs out of the 25 non-word-representable graphs on 7 vertices were actually word-representable, while two non-word-representable graphs on 7 vertices were missing).","Kitaev, Sergey; Sun, Haoran",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05405v1.pdf,53
360124,"Argentina: Coronavirus and soy, corn, and wheat exports",2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led highly developed healthcare systems to the brink of collapse due to the large numbers of patients being admitted into hospitals. One of the potential prognostic indicators in patients with COVID-19 is frailty. The degree of frailty could be used to assist both the triage into intensive care, and decisions regarding treatment limitations. Our study sought to determine the interaction of frailty and age in elderly COVID-19 ICU patients. METHODS: A prospective multicentre study of COVID-19 patients &#8805; 70 years admitted to intensive care in 138 ICUs from 28 countries was conducted. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. Frailty was assessed using the clinical frailty scale. Additionally, comorbidities, management strategies and treatment limitations were recorded. RESULTS: The study included 1346 patients (28% female) with a median age of 75 years (IQR 72-78, range 70-96), 16.3% were older than 80 years, and 21% of the patients were frail. The overall survival at 30 days was 59% (95% CI 56-62), with 66% (63-69) in fit, 53% (47-61) in vulnerable and 41% (35-47) in frail patients (p < 0.001). In frail patients, there was no difference in 30-day survival between different age categories. Frailty was linked to an increased use of treatment limitations and less use of mechanical ventilation. In a model controlling for age, disease severity, sex, treatment limitations and comorbidities, frailty was independently associated with lower survival. CONCLUSION: Frailty provides relevant prognostic information in elderly COVID-19 patients in addition to age and comorbidities.

363122,News and Notes,2020,"The adaptive immune system, regulated by CD4 T cells, is essential for control of many viral infections. Endemic coronavirus infections generally occur as short-term upper respiratory tract infections which in many cases appear to be cleared before adaptive immunity is fully involved, since adaptive immunity takes approximately 1.5-2 weeks to ramp up the response to a primary infection, or approximately 1 week for a recurrent infection. However, the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection will be critical to full recovery with minimal long-lasting effects, and to either prevention of recurrence of infection or at least reduced severity of symptoms. The detailed kinetics of this infection versus the dynamics of the immune response, including in vaccinated individuals, will largely determine these outcomes.","Zaunders, J.; Phetsouphanh, C.",Microbiology Australia,,53
363228,Robin Shattock: novel vaccine developer,2021,"Randomized vaccine trials are used to assess vaccine efficacy and to characterize the durability of vaccine induced protection. There is a broad consensus that placebo volunteers in COVID-19 vaccine trials should be offered a vaccine once efficacy has been established. This will likely lead to most placebo volunteers crossing over to the vaccine arm, thus complicating the assessment of long term durability. We show how to analyze durability following placebo crossover and demonstrate that the vaccine efficacy profile that would be observed in a placebo controlled trial is recoverable in a trial with placebo crossover. This result holds no matter when the crossover occurs and with no assumptions about the form of the efficacy profile. We only require that the vaccine efficacy profile applies to the newly vaccinated irrespective of the timing of vaccination. We develop different methods to estimate efficacy within the context of a proportional hazards regression model and explore the implications of placebo crossover for estimation of vaccine efficacy under different efficacy dynamics and study designs via simulation. We apply our methods to simulated COVID-19 vaccine trials with durable and waning vaccine efficacy and a total follow-up of 2 years.","Fintzi, Jonathan; Follmann, Dean",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01295v1.pdf,53

RNA viruses can encode microRNAs (miRNAs) capable of modulating host gene expression, and with that notion, we aimed to predict viral miRNA like sequences of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, analyze sequence reciprocity and investigate SARS-CoV-2 encoded potential miRNA-human genes interaction using bioinformatics tools. In this study, we retrieved 206 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, executed phylogenetic analysis, and the selected reference genome (MT434792.1) exhibited about 99% similarities among the retrieved genomes. We predicted 402, 137, and 85 putative miRNAs of MERS-CoV (NC_019843.3), SARS-CoV (NC_004718.3), and SARS-CoV-2 (MT434792.1) genome, respectively. Sequence similarity was analyzed among 624 miRNAs which revealed that the predicted miRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 share a cluster with the clad of miRNAs from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Only SARS-CoV-2 derived 85 miRNAs were encountered for target prediction and 29 viral miRNAs seemed to target 119 human genes. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis suggested the involvement of respective genes in various pathways and biological processes. Finally, we focused on eight putative miRNAs influencing 14 genes that are involved in the adaptive hypoxic response, neuroinvasion and hormonal regulation, and tumorigenic progression in patients with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNAs may cause misexpression of some critical regulators and facilitate viral neuroinvasion, altered hormonal axis, and tumorigenic events in the human host. However, these propositions need validation from future studies.","Roy, Sawrab; Sharma, Binayok; Mazid, Md Ishtiaque; Akhand, Rubaiat Nazneen; Das, Moumita; Marufatuzzahan, Marufatuzzahan; Chowdhury, Tanjia Afrin; Azim, Kazi Faizul; Hasan, Mahmudul",Comput Biol Med,,53

366191,"Reply to Bogartz, Shinskey, and Schilling; Schilling; and Cashon and Cohen",2000,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown a decrease of admissions to accident and emergency (A&E) departments after the local outbreaks of COVID-19. However, differential trends of admission counts, for example according to diagnosis, are less well understood. This information is crucial to inform targeted intervention. Therefore, we aimed to compare admission counts in German A&E departments before and after 12th march in 2020 with 2019 according to demographic factors and diagnosis groups. METHODS: Routine data of all admissions between 02.12.2019-30.06.2020 and 01.12.2018-30.06.2019 was available from six hospitals in five cities from north-western, eastern, south-eastern, and south-western Germany. We defined 10 diagnosis groups using ICD-10 codes: mental disorders due to use of alcohol (MDA), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, back pain, fractures of the forearm, and fractures of the femur. We calculated rate ratios comparing different periods in 12.03.2020-30.06.2020 with 12.03.2019-30.06.2019. RESULTS: Forty-one thousand three hundred fifty-three cases were admitted between 12.03.2020-30.06.2020 and 51,030 cases between 12.03.2019-30.06.2019. Admission counts prior to 12.03. were equal in 2020 and 2019. In the period after 12.03., the decrease of admissions in 2020 compared to 2019 was largest between 26.03. and 08.04. (- 30%, 95% CI - 33% to - 27%). When analysing the entire period 12.03.-30.06., the decrease of admissions was heterogeneous among hospitals, and larger among people aged 0-17 years compared to older age groups. In the first 8 weeks after 12.03., admission counts of all diagnoses except femur fractures and pneumonia declined. Admissions with pneumonia increased in this early period. Between 07.05. and 30.6.2020, we noted that admissions with AMI (+ 13%, 95% CI - 3% to + 32%) and cholelithiasis or cholecystitis (+ 20%, 95% CI + 1% to + 44%) were higher than in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest differential trends of admission counts according to age, location, and diagnosis. An initial decrease of admissions with MDA, AMI, stroke or TIA, heart failure, COPD, cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, and back pain imply delays of emergency care in Germany. Finally, our study suggests a delayed increase of admissions with AMI and cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.","Jaehn, Philipp; Holmberg, Christine; Uhlenbrock, Greta; Pohl, Andreas; Finkenzeller, Thomas; Pawlik, Michael T; Quack, Ivo; Ernstberger, Antonio; Rockmann, Felix; Schreyer, Andreas G",BMC Emerg Med,,53
367171,"Inactivation of coronaviruses in food industry: the use of inorganic and organic disinfectants, ozone, and UV radiation",2020,"BACKGROUND: In a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. Machine learning (ML) models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one ML algorithm and limited performance evaluation to ""area under the curve"" (AUC). To obtain best results possible, it may be important to try multiple algorithms using machine learning (ML) to optimize performance. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning (ML) algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted the chance of patient survival from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we investigated which variables (i.e. vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc.) were most influential in generating an accurate model. METHODS: The data was retrospectively collected at our institution on all patients testing positive for COVID-19 between 3/1/2020-7/3/2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time: RT-PCR positivity. Patients were followed up for 30 days or death. This data was used for autoML to build 20 ML models with various algorithms. The main performance of ML models was measured by area under the precision recall curve (AUCPR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and partial dependence plot (PDP). Finally, dimensionality reduction was conducted to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML was retrained using only these 10 variables and its output models was evaluated against the model that used 48 variables. RESULTS: Input from 4313 patients was used. The best model that autoML generated using 48 variables was the stacked ensemble models (AUCPR = 0.807). The two best independent models were the Gradient Boost Models (GBM) and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) models with AUCPR of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. Deep learning models were significantly inferior with AUCPR = 0.73. The ten most influential variables in generating high performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, troponin, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. When the autoML was retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model again performed the best with AUCPR of 0.791. CONCLUSIONS: By using autoML, we have developed high-performing models that predict survival from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method to generate ML based clinical decision supporting tools.","Ikemura, Kenji; Bellin, Eran; Yagi, Yukako; Billett, Henny; Saada, Mahmoud; Simone, Katelyn; Stahl, Lindsay; Szymanski, James; Goldstein, D Y; Reyes Gil, Morayma",J. med. internet res,,53

367298,Gossip about Coronavirus: Infection status and norm adherence shape social responses: GPIR,2021,"BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer in Chile reports 500 new cases each year of which 85% are treated in the public health system. Governmental programs ensure access to diagnosis, treatment, follow up and palliative care, whereas Fundación Nuestros Hijos (FNH) provides supportive care for non-covered medical and psychosocial needs. Common financial difficulties in families of children and adolescents with cancer increased considerably when a wave of social unrest arose in October 2019 and the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 hit the country, leaving families of children with cancer facing greater challenges. AIMS: We report here the support activities and interventions carried out by FNH to help the families during the crisis of these months. METHODS: A socioeconomic survey was conducted among FNH's beneficiary families to know their needs. During these months of acute crisis for many families, support activities and interventions were developed and varied types of aid were allocated to help the families. RESULTS: The main results of the survey in which 525 (70%) of FNH's beneficiary families participated showed that 75% of them had only one breadwinner, and 52% had one unemployed family member. Almost 90% of job loss happened during the months of social unrest and pandemic. Four main interventions: (a) safe transportation, (b) food, (c) heating, (d) internet connectivity, were organized to support important needs of the families and prevent children to miss treatment appointments. Additionally, some families who did not access governmental emergency aid were guided in the process. CONCLUSIONS: The aid provided helped the families to relieve some of their needs, facilitated the continuation of treatment during the pandemic, and made the caregivers feel supported and listened.","Zuleta, Verónica; Berliner, Josefina; Rossell, Nuria; Zubieta, Marcela",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),,53

This virus spread globally within few weeks of first identification and nearly 5.52 million confirmed cases with more than 3,47,000 deaths reported as of May 25, 2020. Till date, there are no specific anti-viral drugs, therapies or vaccines to contain and prevent this infectious pathogen outbreak. The global spread of this virus to over 210 countries resulted in both human and economic losses, highlighting the need for an immediate imperative research exploration on prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Current knowledge and understanding of the pathogenesis of similar coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV might be helpful for the rapid development of treatment strategies to prevent the further spread of this virus. In this review, we recapitulate the topical understanding on the structure, pathogenesis and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 that has emerged as a major health concern worldwide.","Malla, Ashwini; Shanmugaraj, Balamurugan; Ramalingam, Sathishkumar",J.

369999,Airborne Precautions,2020,"It has been known, for decades, that the use of injectable medicines in European hospitals has been associated with frequent medication errors, some of which cause preventable severe harms and deaths. There have been national and European inquiries and reports concerning improving patient safety by recommending greater use of pharmacy aseptic preparation services and provision of ready-to administer injectables, which have not been widely implemented.In England experience of treating patients with COVID-19 infections has brought into focus other benefits of significantly extending pharmacy aseptic preparation services. These benefits include saving nursing time, having systems in place which have resilience and capacity, reducing variation in practice, improving clinical staff and patient experience, and enabling more injectable medicines to be administered to patients at home. It has also been recognised that more action is required to standardise policies and procedures for injectable medicines and mplement the use of smart infusion devices with dose error reduction software, to help minimise drug administration errors.Hospital pharmacists have a key role in developing these services to bring European hospitals more in line with those provided by hospital pharmacies in North America.

Se han publicado investigaciones e informes nacionales y europeos sobre la mejora de la seguridad del paciente que recomiendan una mayor utilización de las unidades de preparación aséptica de los servicios de farmacia y la provisión de los medicamentos inyectables listos para su administración, recomendaciones que apenas se han implementado.En Inglaterra, la experiencia de tratar a los pacientes con infección por COVID-19 ha puesto de manifiesto otros beneficios que conlleva la ampliación de las unidades de preparación aséptica de los servicios de farmacia. Estos beneficios incluyen ahorrar tiempo de enfermería, disponer de sistemas con mayor resiliencia y capacidad, reducir la variabilidad en la práctica, mejorar la satisfacción del personal clínico y del paciente, y facilitar la administración de más medicamentos inyectables a los pacientes en sus domicilios. También se ha reconocido que se precisan actuaciones dirigidas a estandarizar las directrices y procedimientos de utilización de los medicamentos inyectables e implementar el uso de dispositivos de infusión inteligentes con software de reducción de errores de dosis, con el fin de minimizar los errores en la administración de estos medicamentos. Los farmacéuticos de hospital tienen un papel clave en el desarrollo de stas actividades para que los servicios que prestan las farmacias hospitalarias europeas estén más en consonancia con los que se proporcionan en Norteamérica.","Cousins, D.

372236,Methodological innovations drive conceptual innovations forward in chromatin biology,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which began in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is rapidly spreading worldwide with over 1.9 million cases as of mid-April 2020. Infoveillance approaches using social media can help characterize disease distribution and public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors critical to the early stages of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct a quantitative and qualitative assessment of Chinese social media posts originating in Wuhan City on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Chinese-language messages from Wuhan were collected for 39 days between December 23, 2019, and January 30, 2020, on Weibo. For quantitative analysis, the total daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan were obtained from the Chinese National Health Commission, and a linear regression model was used to determine if Weibo COVID-19 posts were predictive of the number of cases reported. Qualitative content analysis and an inductive manual coding approach were used to identify parent classifications of news and user-generated COVID-19 topics. RESULTS: A total of 115,299 Weibo posts were collected during the study time frame consisting of an average of 2956 posts per day (minimum 0, maximum 13,587). Quantitative analysis found a positive correlation between the number of Weibo posts and the number of reported cases from Wuhan, with approximately 10 more COVID-19 cases per 40 social media posts (P<.001). This effect size was also larger than what was observed for the rest of China excluding Hubei Province (where Wuhan is the capital city) and held when comparing the number of Weibo posts to the incidence proportion of cases in Hubei Province. Qualitative analysis of 11,893 posts during the first 21 days of the study period with COVID-19-related posts uncovered four parent classifications including Weibo discussions about the causative agent of the disease, changing epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, public reaction to outbreak control and response measures, and other topics. Generally, these themes also exhibited public uncertainty and changing knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19, including posts exhibiting both protective and higher-risk behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide initial insight into the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of Chinese social media data at the initial epicenter in Wuhan City. Future studies should continue to explore the utility of social media data to predict COVID-19 disease severity, measure public reaction and behavior, and evaluate effectiveness of outbreak communication.","Li, Jiawei; Xu, Qing; Cuomo, Raphael; Purushothaman, Vidya; Mackey, Tim",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,53

Ocular effects may occur because of the ACE-2 receptor in the retina. BACKGROUND: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the retinal layers and optic disc parameters in previously confirmed COVID-19 patients using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). METHODS: This study included 60 eyes of 60 subjects; 35 of them were in the COVID-19 group and the remaining 25 were in the control group. Patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 that had a negative result after treatment were included in the study. Macular and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements, each retinal layer thickness of all participants were done 14-30 days after COVID-19 symptom onset, following the negative result of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test using SD-OCT. RESULTS: The mean value of central macular thickness was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than the control group (p = 0.02). The mean values of the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer thickness in the COVID-19 group were signiï¬cantly thinner than control group (p = 0.04 and p = 0.04, respectively). Even though mean RNFL thickness measurements in all sections in the COVID-19 group was thinner than controls, there were no significant differences between groups (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: In the early recovery phase, changes in the macula, ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer could be seen. These patients should be followed up closely for the recognition of new pathologies that could be seen in the late recovery phase.","Oren, Burak; Aksoy Aydemir, Gozde; Aydemir, Emre; Atesoglu, Halil Ibrahim; Goker, Yasin Sakir; Kiziltoprak, Hasan; Ozcelik, Kazim Caglar",Clin Exp Optom,,53
375615,Effect of straw-derived dissolved organic matter on the adsorption of sulfamethoxazole to purple paddy soils,2020,"BACKGROUND: Relational and emotional problems, dysregulation, self-harming or substance abuse often characterize personality disorders (PD). In Norway, COVID-19 restrictions led to an abrupt shutdown of services from 12 March 2020 also including specialized PD treatments. AIMS: The objective of this study was to investigate social and mental distress among patients with PDs during the first COVID-19 wave. DESIGN: A survey was distributed after the first COVID-19 wave (June-October 2020) among 1120 patients from 12 PD treatment units. RESULTS: The response rate was 12% (N = 133). The survey reflected impairment of occupational activity (53% <50% activity last 6 months), life quality (EQ-5D-VAS: 56, SD 19), and personality functioning (LPFS-BF &#8805;12: 81%, 35% avoidant PD, 44% borderline PD) and high levels of depression and anxiety (PHQ-9 &#8805; 10: 84%, GAD-7 &#8805; 10: 68%), 49% with health-related anxiety. Problem increase was reported for anxiety (28%), depression (24%), aggression (23%), substance use (14%), and 70% of parents had more child-care difficulties. Self-destructive behaviors (26%) did not increase. The majority (78%) reported increased or unchanged social isolation and loneliness. Occupational activity declined with negative effects on part-time jobs/rehabilitation. Therapist contact was mainly telephone-based (63% &#8805; weekly contact). More severe personality problems, current depressive symptoms, and self-harming before 12 March were associated with more frequent consultations. CONCLUSION: The survey confirms severe, enhanced levels of mental distress among patients receiving telephone-based consultations as the main alternative to specialized PD treatment during the COVID-19 shutdown. The most vulnerable patients received more frequent consultations and self-destructive actions did not increase.","Hartveit Kvarstein, Elfrida; Zahl, Kjell-Einar; Stänicke, Line Indrevoll; Pettersen, Mona Skjeklesæther; Baltzersen, Åse-Line; Johansen, Merete Selsbak; Eikenæs, Ingeborg Ulltveit-Moe; Hummelen, Benjamin; Wilberg, Theresa; Ajo Arnevik, Espen; Pedersen, Geir",Nord J Psychiatry,,53
376002,CHI’s 18th annual discovery on target,2021,"There has been growing interest on forecasting mortality. In this article, we propose a novel dynamic Bayesian approach for modeling and forecasting the age-at-death distribution, focusing on a three-components mixture of a Dirac mass, a Gaussian distribution and a Skew-Normal distribution. According to the specified model, the age-at-death distribution is characterized via seven parameters corresponding to the main aspects of infant, adult and old-age mortality. The proposed approach focuses on coherent modeling of multiple countries, and following a Bayesian approach to inference we allow to borrow information across populations and to shrink parameters towards a common mean level, implicitly penalizing diverging scenarios. Dynamic modeling across years is induced trough an hierarchical dynamic prior distribution that allows to characterize the temporal evolution of each mortality component and to forecast the age-at-death distribution. Empirical results on multiple countries indicate that the proposed approach outperforms popular methods for forecasting mortality, providing interpretable insights on the evolution of mortality.","Aliverti, Emanuele; Mazzuco, Stefano; Scarpa, Bruno",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01599v1.pdf,53

Clinical signs of the cat prompted humanitarian euthanasia and a detailed postmortem investigation to assess whether a COVID-19-like disease was causing the condition. Necropsy results showed the animal suffered from feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe pulmonary edema and thrombosis. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was only detected in nasal swab, nasal turbinates, and mesenteric lymph node, but no evidence of histopathological lesions compatible with a viral infection were detected. The cat seroconverted against SARS-CoV-2, further evidencing a productive infection in this animal. We conclude that the animal had a subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infection concomitant to an unrelated cardiomyopathy that led to euthanasia.","Segalés, Joaquim; Puig, Mariona; Rodon, Jordi; Avila-Nieto, Carlos; Carrillo, Jorge; Cantero, Guillermo; Terrón, Maria Teresa; Cruz, Sílvia; Parera, Mariona; Noguera-Julián, Marc; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria; Guallar, Víctor; Vidal, Enric; Valencia, Alfonso; Blanco, Ignacio; Blanco, Julià; Clotet, Bonaventura; Vergara-Alert, Júlia",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,53

376958,Prophylactic host behaviour discourages pathogen exploitation,2020,"While many approaches have been proposed for discovering abrupt changes in piecewise constant signals, few methods are available to capture these changes in piecewise polynomial signals. In this paper, we propose a change point detection method, PRUTF, based on trend filtering. By providing a comprehensive dual solution path for trend filtering, PRUTF allows us to discover change points of the underlying signal for either a given value of the regularization parameter or a specific number of steps of the algorithm. We demonstrate that the dual solution path constitutes a Gaussian bridge process that enables us to derive an exact and efficient stopping rule for terminating the search algorithm. We also prove that the estimates produced by this algorithm are asymptotically consistent in pattern recovery. This result holds even in the case of staircases (consecutive change points of the same sign) in the signal. Finally, we investigate the performance of our proposed method for various signals and then compare its performance against some state-of-the-art methods in the context of change point detection. We apply our method to three real-world datasets including the UK House Price Index (HPI), the GISS surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP) and the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.","Mehrizi, Reza V.; Chenouri, Shojaeddin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08573v2.pdf,53

We first discuss NK cells in the context of acute viral infections, with flavivirus and influenza virus infections as examples. Questions related to activation of NK cells, homing to infected tissues and the role of tissue-resident NK cells in acute viral infections are also addressed. Next, we discuss NK cells in the context of chronic viral infections with hepatitis C virus and HIV-1. Also covered is the role of adaptive-like NK cell expansions as well as the appearance of CD56- NK cells in the course of chronic infection. Specific emphasis is then placed in viral infections in patients with primary immunodeficiencies affecting NK cells.

Therefore, contemporary research is required to determine the current pandemic's psychological impact on older populations. Soon after the COVID-19 outbreak, several narrative reviews and guidelines were released to support older adult's psychological wellbeing. However, a lack of data from original studies was reported until May 2020. AIM: To identify studies published from May 2020 until January 2021 that quantitatively assessed the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults using validated psychometric tools. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search of original research articles was conducted using specific terms. The screening procedure was conducted stepwise. RESULTS: Among the 18 included studies, cross-sectional online surveys indicated that older adults were less psychologically distressed than younger ones. A longitudinal study revealed that COVID-19 did not have a major impact on loneliness and satisfaction with life. On the contrary, studies comparing pre- with peri-pandemic data revealed that older adults experienced more severe depressive/anxiety/stress symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. Several studies reported though only subclinical symptoms, as well as low loneliness levels during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Research studies suggested that older age may buffer against the COVID-19-related impact on mental health. Despite evidence against generalised perceptions of vulnerability, older adults' ability to adapt to adversity may be uneven, depending on cultural, social, economic and other individual factors. Taken together, the impact, moreover the long-term impact of COVID-19, is expected to vary across countries and older subpopulations, and remains to be evaluated by prospective, longitudinal studies.","Parlapani, Eleni; Holeva, Vasiliki; Nikopoulou, Vasiliki Aliki; Kaprinis, Stergios; Nouskas, Ioannis; Diakogiannis, Ioannis",Aging clin. exp. res,,53

380940,Behavior Genetics Association 50th Annual Meeting Abstracts,2020,"BACKGROUND: Spain has been one of the countries most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the first confirmed case was reported on January 31, 2020, there have been over 405,000 cases and 28,000 deaths in Spain. The economic and social impact is without precedent. Thus, it is important to quickly assess the situation and perception of the population. Large-scale online surveys have been shown to be an effective tool for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: We aim to assess the situation and perception of the Spanish population in four key areas related to the COVID-19 pandemic: social contact behavior during confinement, personal economic impact, labor situation, and health status. METHODS: We obtained a large sample using an online survey with 24 questions related to COVID-19 in the week of March 28-April 2, 2020, during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 in Spain. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit 156,614 participants via social media posts that targeted the general adult population (age >18 years). Given such a large sample, the 95% CI was ±0.843 for all reported proportions. RESULTS: Regarding social behavior during confinement, participants mainly left their homes to satisfy basic needs. We found several statistically significant differences in social behavior across genders and age groups. The population's willingness to comply with the confinement measures is evident. From the survey answers, we identified a significant adverse economic impact of the pandemic on those working in small businesses and a negative correlation between economic damage and willingness to stay in confinement. The survey revealed that close contacts play an important role in the transmission of the disease, and 28% of the participants lacked the necessary resources to properly isolate themselves. We also identified a significant lack of testing, with only 1% of the population tested and 6% of respondents unable to be tested despite their doctor's recommendation. We developed a generalized linear model to identify the variables that were correlated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Using this model, we estimated an average of 5% for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the Spanish population during the time of the study. A seroprevalence study carried out later by the Spanish Ministry of Health reported a similar level of disease prevalence (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Large-scale online population surveys, distributed via social media and online messaging platforms, can be an effective, cheap, and fast tool to assess the impact and prevalence of an infectious disease in the context of a pandemic, particularly when there is a scarcity of official data and limited testing capacity.","Oliver, Nuria; Barber, Xavier; Roomp, Kirsten; Roomp, Kristof",J Med Internet Res,,53

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of WeChat-based telehealth services on the preoperative follow-up of infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 190 infants with CHD who underwent remote follow-up via WeChat from December 2019 to May 2020 in Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. In addition, the psychological benefits of WeChat on the parents of these infants were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 190 infants were involved in this study, including 72 cases of ventricular septal defects, 42 cases of patent ductus arteriosus, 55 cases of atrial septal defects, 3 cases of tetralogy of Fallot, 2 cases of endocardial cushion defects, 12 cases of pulmonary stenosis, 2 cases of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection and 2 cases of aortic arch constriction. During the follow-up period, 48 infants who received surgical indications were hospitalized in time for surgical treatment. It was recommended that 10 infants with respiratory tract infections be treated in local hospitals through the WeChat platform. We provided feeding guidance to 28 infants with dysplasia through the WeChat platform. The psychological evaluation results of parents showed that the median score and range of Self-Rating Depression Scale scores were 42 and 32-58, respectively. Nine parents (4.7%) were clinically depressed, while the majority had mild depression. The median score and range of Self-Rating Anxiety Scale scores were 44 and 31-59, respectively. Twenty parents (10.5%) had clinical anxiety, while the rest had mild anxiety. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, follow-up management and health services for infants with CHD prior to surgery through the WeChat platform were useful in identifying the state of an infant's condition as well as in identifying and relieving care pressure, anxiety and depression in the parents.","Zhang, Qi-Liang; Xie, Wen-Peng; Lei, Yu-Qing; Cao, Hua; Chen, Qiang",Int. j. qual. health care,,53
381512,27 Translational insights into the pathogenesis transforming SLE treatment,2021,"Ameliorated therapy based on the tumor microenvironment is becoming increasingly popular, yet only a few methods have achieved wide recognition. Herein, targeting multifunctional hydrophilic nanomicelles, AgBiS2@DSPE-PEG2000-FA (ABS-FA), were obtained and employed for tumor treatment. In a cascade amplification mode, ABS-FA exhibited favorable properties of actively enhancing computed tomography/infrared (CT/IR) imaging and gently relieving ambient oxygen concentration by cooperative photothermal and sonodynamic therapy. Compared with traditional Bi2S3 nanoparticles, the CT imaging capability of the probe was augmented (43.21%), and the photothermal conversion efficiency was increased (33.1%). Furthermore, remarkable ultrasonic dynamic features of ABS-FA were observed, with increased generation of reactive oxygen species (24.3%) being obtained compared to Ce6, a commonly used sonosensitizer. Furthermore, ABS-FA exhibited obvious inhibitory effects on HeLa cell migration at 6 µg/mL, which to some extent, demonstrated its suppressive effect on tumor growth. A lower dose, laser and ultrasonic power, and shorter processing time endowed ABS-FA with excellent photothermal and sonodynamic effects. By mild cascade mode, the hypoxic condition of the tumor site was largely improved, and a suitable oxygen-rich environment was provided, thereby endowing ABS-FA with a superior synergistically enhanced treatment effect compared with the single-mode approach, which ultimately realized the purpose of ""one injection, multiple treatment"". Moreover, our data showed that ABS-FA was given with a biological safety profile while harnessing in vivo. Taken together, as a synergistically enhanced medical diagnosis and treatment method, the one-for-all nanoplatform will pave a new avenue for further clinical applications.","Cheng, Kai; Zhang, Ruo-Yun; Yang, Xiao-Quan; Zhang, Xiao-Shuai; Zhang, Fang; An, Jie; Wang, Zhuo-Ya; Dong, Ying; Liu, Bo; Zhao, Yuan-Di; Liu, Tian-Cai",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,53
381694,A digital biomarker of diabetes from smartphone-based vascular signals,2020,"After the incidental observation of an almost complete resolution of maculopapular eruption in a patient having simultaneously secondary syphilis and trichomonas vaginalis infection, we extended the treatment with tinidazole (500 mg 4 times daily for 7 days) to 10 other early syphilis patients before the start of the conventional penicillin treatment. All patients showed marked improvement of their lesions in a few days. After the introduction of the conventional penicillin regimen, the lesions further improved and VDRL titers declined at least 4-fold within 6 months in all patients. Tinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole derivative as well as metronidazole but with a longer plasma half-life. It is activated intracellularly by bacterial/parasitic enzymes to a redox cytotoxic intermediate that damages large protein molecules and inhibits repair and transcription of DNA affecting also the cell wall. With this action, tinidazole might also have a synergic action with penicillin and doxycycline, facilitating the entry of such drugs. It is possible that tinidazole has the same bactericidal action on spirochetes other than Borrelia, such as Treponema pallidum, explaining its rapid therapeutic action on the lesions of early syphilis. Whether this action could be confirmed by studies on larger series of patients, tinidazole might be considered in case of allergy to penicillin or other antibiotics usually prescribed in syphilis.","Drago, Francesco; Ciccarese, Giulia; Rebora, Alfredo; Parodi, Aurora",J. clin. pharmacol,,53

This paper is focused solely on reporting the interview findings from participating mothers regarding the challenges of caring for children with leukaemia in the context of the COVID-19. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study took place in a Jordanian hospital where a descriptive qualitative design approach was applied on one oncology floor and an oncology clinic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with mothers of children aged 1-12 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Inductive thematic analysis approach was undertaken. Written consent was obtained from all participants. RESULTS: Fifteen interviews were conducted with fifteen mothers. Four major themes reflect the different challenges parents and children face during the COVID-19 pandemic: children refusing to wear masks, social isolation, family relationship and financial concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study present important data for health care professionals to help them understand the challenges faced by parents and children with leukaemia, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests activating emotional support teams in hospitals. These teams can actively help mothers express their concerns and worries which might otherwise foster self-blame, guilt and isolation.","Atout, Maha; Tarawneh, Fatimah S; Al-Kharabsheh, Amani",J. pediatr. nurs,,53

382011,Coronavirus and anesthesia/ Coronavirus y anestesia,2020,"AIM: Children generally have a milder CoVID-19 disease course and better prognosis than adults. Many countries have closed schools as part of measures to limit transmission and this has had a considerable impact on children world-wide. This includes New Zealand (NZ), where rates of CoVID-19 have been very low. The aims of this study were to investigate parents' and caregivers' knowledge of CoVID-19 in children, to understand their levels of concern and to identify their most trusted sources of information. METHODS: Participants were recruited via NZ parenting support and interest groups on Facebook.com. Knowledge was assessed by way of a self-administered questionnaire during the 10 days prior to NZ schools reopening on 18 May 2020. RESULTS: Of the 1191 study participants, 721 (60%) expressed some level of worry (14.5% very or extremely worried) that their child would catch CoVID-19 at school. A high proportion (79%, 941) thought it likely or very likely that their child would catch CoVID-19 at school if there were to be widespread community transmission. Fear scores for CoVID-19 were generally high, and 828 (80%) of participants said they would vaccinate their child if a newly developed vaccine were available. CONCLUSIONS: Parents and caregivers were generally fearful of their children acquiring CoVID-19 at school. This was despite messaging from multiple trusted sources that transmission in schools is unlikely, and the number of NZ CoVID-19 cases being extremely low. These findings have implications for policy development and public health messaging both in NZ and in countries with ongoing community transmission of CoVID-19.","Jeffs, Emma; Lucas, Nathanael; Walls, Tony",J. paediatr. child health,,53

We seek to examine the impact of clinical variables such as Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) on mortality and need for intubation, as well as demographic variables such as age, sex and race on persons with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Analyses were conducted on 4413 patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and COVID-19. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan- Meier curves and the log-rank test to compare subgroup analyses. RESULTS: In this multi-variate analyses, male gender, older age and hyperglycemia at admission were associated with increased mortality and intubation, but this was not seen for race, ethnicity, insurance type or HbA1c. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, having comorbid conditions such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease and coronary artery disease were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic levels at admission have a greater impact on health outcomes than HbA1c. Older men and those with comorbid disease are also at greater risk for mortality. Further longitudinal studies need to be done to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on type 2 diabetes.","Myers, Alyson K; Kim, Tara S; Zhu, Xu; Liu, Yan; Qiu, Michael; Pekmezaris, Renee",J. diabetes (Online),,53

386381,Expressive violence and the slow genocide of the Banyamulenge of South Kivu,2021,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous Î³-herpesvirus with latent and lytic cycles. EBV replicates in the stratified epithelium but the nasopharynx is also composed of pseudostratified epithelium with distinct cell types. Latent infection is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we show with nasopharyngeal conditionally reprogrammed cells cultured at the air-liquid interface that pseudostratified epithelial cells are susceptible to EBV infection. Donors varied in susceptibility to de novo EBV infection, but susceptible cultures also displayed differences with respect to pathogenesis. The cultures from one donor yielded lytic infection but cells from two other donors were positive for EBV-encoded EBERs and negative for other lytic infection markers. All cultures stained positive for the pseudostratified markers CK7, MUC5AC, &#945;-tubulin in cilia, and the EBV epithelial cell receptor Ephrin receptor A2. To define EBV transcriptional programs by cell type and to elucidate latent/lytic infection-differential changes, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on one EBV-infected culture that resulted in alignment with many EBV transcripts. EBV transcripts represented a small portion of the total transcriptome (~0.17%). All cell types in the pseudostratified epithelium had detectable EBV transcripts with suprabasal cells showing the highest number of reads aligning to many EBV genes. Several restriction factors (IRF1, MX1, STAT1, C18orf25) known to limit lytic infection were expressed at lower levels in the lytic subcluster. A third of the differentially-expressed genes in NPC tumors compared to an uninfected pseudostratified ALI culture overlapped with the differentially-expressed genes in the latent subcluster. A third of these commonly perturbed genes were specific to EBV infection and changed in the same direction. Collectively, these findings suggest that the pseudostratified epithelium could harbor EBV infection and that the pseudostratified infection model mirrors many of the transcriptional changes imposed by EBV infection in NPC.","Ziegler, Phillip; Tian, Yarong; Bai, Yulong; Abrahamsson, Sanna; Bäckerholm, Alan; Reznik, Alex S; Green, Anthony; Moore, John A; Lee, Stella E; Myerburg, Michael M; Park, Hyun Jung; Tang, Ka-Wei; Shair, Kathy Ho Yen",PLoS Pathog,,53
386382,Expressive violence and the slow genocide of the Banyamulenge of South Kivu,2021,"BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening hematologic disorder resulting from an ineffective and pathologic activation of the immune response system that may mimic common emergency department presentations, including sepsis, acute liver failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and flu-like illnesses such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: This narrative review provides a summary of the disease and recommendations for the recognition and diagnostic evaluation of HLH with a focus on the emergency clinician. DISCUSSION: Though the condition is rare, mortality rates are high, ranging from 20% to 80% and increasing with delays in treatment. Importantly, HLH has been recognized as a severe variation of the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. Common features include a history of infection or malignancy, fever, splenomegaly or hepatomegaly, hyperferritinemia, cytopenias, coagulopathies, abnormal liver enzymes, and hypertriglyceridemia. Using specific features of the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and tools such as the HScore, HLH-2004/2009, and hyperferritinemia thresholds, the emergency clinician can risk-stratify patients and admit for definitive testing. Once diagnosed, disease specific treatment can be initiated. CONCLUSION: This review describes the relevant pathophysiology, common presentation findings, and a framework for risk stratification in the emergency department.","Morrissette, Katelin; Bridwell, Rachel; Lentz, Skyler; Brem, Elizabeth; Gutierrez, Karla Olmedo; Singh, Manpreet; Koyfman, Alex; Long, Brit",J Emerg Med,,53

Methods: This study utilized the experiment-control method. Data were collected using a patient and disease information form and the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) Test. An experimental group of patients sniffed Turkish coffee, and the coffee's effect on the patients' sense of smell was examined. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 25 (IBM). Results: Of the patients in the experimental group, 25% had moderate hyposmia, 58.3% had severe hyposmia, and 16.7% had anosmia prior to sniffing Turkish coffee. After sniffing the Turkish coffee, 13.3% of these patients regained their ability to smell normally, while 18.3% had mild hyposmia, 45% had moderate hyposmia, 6.7% had severe hyposmia, and 16.7% had anosmia. There was no difference in the control group between first and second measurement. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients who sniffed Turkish coffee intermittently regained some of their sense of smell for one hour. Turkish coffee is cheap, fragrant, widely available, and easy to access.

393426,A Formal Analysis of the MimbleWimble Cryptocurrency Protocol,2021-04-02,"Robots assist in many areas that are considered unsafe for humans to operate. For instance, in handling pandemic diseases such as the recent Covid-19 outbreak and other outbreaks like Ebola, robots can assist in reaching areas dangerous for humans and do simple tasks such as pick up the correct medicine (among a set of bottles prescribed) and deliver to patients. In such cases, it might not be good to rely on the fully autonomous operation of robots. Since many mobile robots are fully functional with low-level tasks such as grabbing and moving, we consider the mixed-initiative control where the user can guide the robot remotely to finish such tasks. For this mixed-initiative control, the user controlling the robot needs to visualize a 3D scene as seen by the robot and guide it. Mixed reality can virtualize reality and immerse users in the 3D scene that is reconstructed from the real-world environment. This technique provides the user more freedom such as choosing viewpoints at view time. In recent years, benefiting from the high-quality data from Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and RGBD cameras, mixed reality is widely used to build networked platforms to improve the performance of robot teleoperations and robot-human collaboration, and enhanced feedback for mixed-initiative control. In this paper, we proposed a novel haptic-enabled mixed reality system, that provides haptic interfaces to interact with the virtualized environments and give remote guidance for mobile robots towards high-level tasks. The experimental results show the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed haptic enabled mixed reality system.","Tian, Yuan; Li, Lianjun; Fumagalli, Andrea; Tadesse, Yonas; Prabhakaran, Balakrishnan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03521v2.pdf,53

It can treat dysentery, relieve heat, remove dampness, and regulate the intestines and stomach. The objective of this study is to explore the material basis and mechanism of Liupao tea intervention in COVID-19 and to provide a new prevention and treatment programme for COVID-19. We used high performance liquid chromatography to analyze the extract of Liupao tea and establish its fingerprint. The main index components of the fingerprint were determined using SARS-COV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro ), and an in vitro drug screening model based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to evaluate its inhibitory activity in vitro. The fingerprint results showed that the alcohol extract of Liupao tea contained gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), caffeine, epicatechin gallate, rutin, and ellagic acid. The molecular docking binding energies of the six index components of SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro were all less than -5.0 kJ/mol and showed strong binding affinity. The results of in vitro activity showed that the IC50 of EGCG was 8.84 µmol/L, which could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro to a certain extent.

399278,Preparing for the 2020-2021 Influenza Season,2020,"ISSUED ADDRESSED: COVID-19 has highlighted the disruptive, cross-sectorial effects a sudden-onset pandemic has on a globally interconnected world. The control of community transmission requires the identification and isolation of hotspots, commonly achieved through blanket measures or through ring-fencing. A simpler and more readily policeable, and geographically more flexible system is needed that allows both law enforcement and the public to detect people moving outside the ringfenced areas. METHODS: A narrative examination of the border closure between New South Wales and Victoria in June to September 2020. RESULTS: Enforcement of people's movement in and out of ring-fenced areas relies on voluntary, ethical compliance coupled with legal prosecution of violators. Despite extensive community health promotion for COVID-safe behaviour, the events of 2020 showed multiple, flagrant violations which were caught during random spot checks, as well as at the Murray River, a hard border set up along readily controllable and patrollable features (bridges). CONCLUSIONS: Given that most medium and long-distance movement in Australia is vehicular-based, this paper advocates for the introduction of European-style local government area based car registration which makes 'out of bounds' vehicle traffic readily recognisable by their number plates. SO WHAT?: Public health promotion, coupled with convenient and ubiquitous observation and enforcement tool, is likely to moderate community behaviour and ensure increased compliance with the directives of health authorities and associated promotion of COVID-safe behaviour.","Spennemann, Dirk H R",Health promotion journal of Australia :official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,,53
399374,Part 1: Digital Twins: Answering The Hard Questions,2020,"We propose the concept that administration of an unrelated live attenuated vaccine, such as MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), could serve as a preventive measure against the worst sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is mounting evidence that live attenuated vaccines provide nonspecific protection against lethal infections unrelated to the target pathogen of the vaccine by inducing ""trained"" nonspecific innate immune cells for improved host responses against subsequent infections. Mortality in COVID-19 cases is strongly associated with progressive lung inflammation and eventual sepsis. Vaccination with MMR in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to COVID-19. Following the lead of other countries conducting clinical trials with the live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG) vaccine under a similar concept, a clinical trial with MMR in high-risk populations may provide a ""low-risk-high-reward"" preventive measure in saving lives during this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.","Fidel, Paul L; Noverr, Mairi C",mBio (Online),,53

Moreover, the various exercises that involve directing mindfulness to the body need to be considered in conjunction in order to arrive at a balanced understanding of their overarching purpose. Out of the different possible modalities of cultivating mindfulness in this way, the discourses present awareness directed to one's own bodily postures as a practice already undertaken by the Buddha-to-be when he was still in quest of awakening. In this particular setting, such mindfulness of postures served as a way of facing fear. The potential of this exercise to provide a grounding in embodied mindfulness, being fully in the here and now, is of particular relevance to the challenges posed by the current pandemic.","Analayo, Bhikkhu",Mindfulness (N Y),,53
399544,Strategies for Vaccination: Conventional Vaccine Approaches Versus New-Generation Strategies in Combination with Adjuvants,2021,"COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are increased via unknown mechanisms in patients with diabetes and kidney disease. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into host cells. Because ACE2 is a susceptibility factor for infection, we investigated how diabetic kidney disease and medications alter ACE2 receptor expression in kidneys. Single cell RNA profiling of kidney biopsies from healthy living donors and patients with diabetic kidney disease revealed ACE2 expression primarily in proximal tubular epithelial cells. This cell-specific localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization. ACE2 expression levels were unaltered by exposures to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease. Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public -omics datasets identified molecular network modules induced in ACE2-expressing proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic kidney disease (searchable at hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney) that were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing. The diabetic kidney disease ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cell module overlapped with expression patterns seen in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Similar cellular programs were seen in ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cells obtained from urine samples of 13 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated proximal tubular epithelial cell expression program that may interact with the SARS-CoV-2 infection processes. Thus SARS-CoV-2 receptor networks can seed further research into risk stratification and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19-related kidney damage.","Menon, Rajasree; Otto, Edgar A; Sealfon, Rachel; Nair, Viji; Wong, Aaron K; Theesfeld, Chandra L; Chen, Xi; Wang, Yuan; Boppana, Avinash S; Luo, Jinghui; Yang, Yingbao; Kasson, Peter M; Schaub, Jennifer A; Berthier, Celine C; Eddy, Sean; Lienczewski, Chrysta C; Godfrey, Bradley; Dagenais, Susan L; Sohaney, Ryann; Hartman, John; Fermin, Damian; Subramanian, Lalita; Looker, Helen C; Harder, Jennifer L; Mariani, Laura H; Hodgin, Jeffrey B; Sexton, Jonathan Z; Wobus, Christiane E; Naik, Abhijit S; Nelson, Robert G; Troyanskaya, Olga G; Kretzler, Matthias",Kidney Int,,53

Considerable differences in disease severity and the mortality rate have been observed in different parts of the world. The present study investigated the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: We established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Iran. Epidemiological, imaging, laboratory, and clinical characteristics and outcomes were recorded from medical documents. The chi-square test, t-test, and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. A p<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Results: In total, 364 cases (207 males and 157 females) were analyzed. The most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea. Multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities with peripheral distribution were the predominant imaging finding. The mean age of patients was 54.28±18.81 years. The mean age of patients who died was 71.50±14.60 years. The mortality rate was 17.6%. The total proportion of patients with a comorbidity was 47.5%, and 84.4% of patients who died had a comorbidity. Sex, history of diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia were not significantly associated with mortality (p>0.05). However, mortality showed significant relationships with body mass index; age; history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), pulmonary disease, and cancer; and abnormal high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings (p<0.05 for all). Cancer had the highest odds ratio. Conclusion: Comorbidities (especially cancer, CKD, and CVA), severe obesity, old age, and abnormal HRCT findings affected the health outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Azarkar, Zohreh; Salehiniya, Hamid; Kazemi, Toba; Abbaszadeh, Hamid",,,53

However, it is not clear why any relief from the requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) should be necessary. The purpose of this paper is to highlight weaknesses in how the IASB and FASB developed their leases Standards, and why those Standards are not robust enough to cope with a shock to the economic system. Design/methodology/approach: The COVID-19 relief suspends some features of the leasing requirements rather than changing them. What if other economic or regulatory events cause the same circumstances to arise? Findings: Have COVID-19 exposed weaknesses in the leasing standards that should have been avoided when they were developed or is COVID-19 the problem?

Owing to its immune-modulatory effects, it had been in use for graft vs host diseases and organ transplant rejection for many years, but in dermatology, it was first approved for use in 1997 in the treatment of psoriasis. Other off-label indications for skin diseases include atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, lichen planus, pyoderma gangrenosum, alopecia areata, granuloma annulare, and several others. A thorough search of Medline-PubMed database, Google Scholar, and Uptodate was performed for evidence-based and peer-reviewed information. We have summarized the use of cyclosporine in dermatological diseases with respect to its, dosage, safety considerations, and monitoring guidelines. Furthermore, brief overview of its pharmacology, drug interactions, use in pregnancy, and lactation has been discussed. Despite of its common adverse effects like nephrotoxicity and hypertension, cyclosporine offers good safety profile when used in skin diseases. Decision to start cyclosporine therapy is individualized and it should be based on analysis of risk vs benefit. Nevertheless, CYA is preferred over other immunosuppressants in dermatology because of early therapeutic response and less myelosupression. This article offers concise but detailed summary of this beneficial immune-suppressive agent in skin diseases.","Amber, Tazein; Tabassum, Saadia",Dermatol Ther,,53

RECENT FINDINGS: One in five adolescents is diagnosed with prediabetes. Recent studies have elucidated the impact of early exposures such as maternal diabetes, but also hyperglycemia below the threshold of gestational diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and paternal obesity on the future metabolic health of the offspring. Mechanisms affecting the developmental programing of offspring toward type 2 diabetes include epigenetic modifications, alterations in stem cell differentiation, metabolome and microbiome variation, immune dysregulation, and neonatal nutrition. The risk of type 2 diabetes in offspring is increased not only by diabetes exposure in utero but also by exposure to a heterogeneous milieu of factors that accompany maternal obesity that provoke a vicious cycle of metabolic disease. The key period for intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes is within the first 1000 days of life.","Rughani, Ankur; Friedman, Jacob E; Tryggestad, Jeanie B",Curr Diab Rep,,53

The concerned model is composed of two compartments, namely, healthy and infected. Under the new nonsingular derivative, we, first of all, establish some sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solution to the model under consideration. Because of the dynamics of the phenomenon when described by a mathematical model, its existence must be guaranteed. Therefore, via using the classical fixed point theory, we establish the required results. Also, we present the results of stability of Ulam's type by using the tools of nonlinear analysis. For the semianalytical results, we extend the usual Laplace transform coupled with Adomian decomposition method to obtain the approximate solutions for the corresponding compartments of the considered model.

425470,A Word from OLAW,2021,"During the first week of March,2020 the surge of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases reached all over the globe with more than 100,000 cases. Healthcare national and international authorities have already initiated awareness and lockdown activities. A poor understanding of the disease among medical imaging professionals (MIPs) may result in rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and understanding of MIPs about COVID-19. A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among MIPs about COVID- 19 during the fourth week of March 2020. An online sample of MIPs was successfully recruited via the authors' networks in India using data collection tool - write google forms. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge and understanding questionnaire consisted questions regarding the clinical characteristics and transmission routes of COVID-19. Assessment on practices towards COVID-19 included questions on techniques while imaging against COVID-19 suspected patients. Of 700 participants, a total of 550 MIPs completed the survey (response rate: 78.57%); 56.7% were males, 85.4.1% were aged 17-26 years, and most were undergraduates (77.6%) and postgraduates (17.1%). Regarding COVID-19, most of the participants answered correctly (95.5%) on symptoms, (84.4%) time interval for visible symptoms, (98.0%) transmission and (44%) airborne transmission respectively. A significant proportion of MIPs (36.4%) had poor knowledge about wearing multiple masks as an effective measure against coronavirus infection. Most of the respondents (48.5%) incorrectly considered X-ray as the reliable method of diagnosis for suspected COVID-19 patients. 44.6% of the respondents lacked knowledge about the steps involved in hand washing technique which is one of the most important safety practice methods in medical imaging to prevent spread of infection. Factors such as age and occupation were associated with inadequate knowledge and poor perception of COVID-19. As the current global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is crucial and critical to improve the knowledge and understanding of MIPs. Educational videos and live webinars are urgently needed to reach MIPs and further detailed studies are the need of the hour.","Kotian, Rahul P; Faujdar, Disha; Kotian, Sneha P; D039,; souza, Brayal",Health Technol (Berl),,53

Little is known about how they perceive this isolation and its subsequent impact on their relationships with peers, both during and after isolation for treatment. This study describes the experience of hospital isolation from the perspectives of children and adolescents with a malignant brain tumor. The use and impact of information and communication technologies (ICT) as a possible bridge for contact is also explored. Following a qualitative approach utilizing interpretive phenomenological analysis, in-depth interviews were conducted with eight youth participants who had undergone treatment for medulloblastoma. Data analysis generated three main themes: (1) transforming children and relationships, (2) hospitalization in a digital world, and (3) ICTs as a promising bridge back to school. Study findings provide insight into the experience of hospital isolation for children and adolescents, while highlighting the positive social as well as academic outcomes of frequent, open ended ICT use throughout hospital isolation. This is timely, given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting isolation. Considerations for hospital social workers to promote relationships and connection, while facilitating a smooth transition as these children return to school are included.","Sawyer, Jami-Leigh; Mishna, Faye; Bouffet, Eric; Saini, Michael; Zlotnik-Shaul, Randi",Child Adolesc Social Work J,,53

However, people spend 80%-90% of their time indoors, and the cumulative effects of exposure to high or low temperature on the risk of cardiovascular diseases had not been considered. This study investigated the cumulative effects of high or low indoor temperature exposure on the risk of cardiovascular diseases. We estimated indoor temperatures by using a prediction model of indoor temperature from a previous study and further calculated the cumulative degree hours at different indoor temperature ranges. Samples of emergency department visits due to cardiovascular diseases were collected from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) from 2000 to 2014 in Taiwan. We used a distributed lag nonlinear model to analyze the data. Our data demonstrated a significant risk of emergency department visits due to cardiovascular diseases at 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 °C when cooling cumulative degree hours exceeded 62, 43, 16, 1, and 1 during the hot season (May to October), respectively, and at 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 °C when heating cumulative degree hours exceeded 1, 1, 1, 11, and 33 during the cold season (November to April), respectively.

Discrepancies in different tiers of the governance system resulted in producing health-related stigmas and discriminatory behaviors toward particular sections of the population like the migrant people. It suffices the need for recasting in the concept of governance concerning pandemic.

436799,CACPR 2021 Annual Meeting Abstracts,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), most frequently presents with respiratory symptoms, such as fever, dyspnea, shortness of breath, cough, or myalgias. There is now a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that severe SARS-CoV-2 infections can develop clinically significant coagulopathy, inflammation, and cardiomyopathy, which have been implicated in COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). CASE REPORT: We report an uncommon presentation of a 32-year-old man who sustained a large vessel cerebellar stroke associated with a severe COVID-19 infection. He presented with a headache, worse than his usual migraine, dizziness, rotary nystagmus, and dysmetria on examination, but had no respiratory symptoms initially. He was not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy or endovascular therapy and was managed with clopidogrel, aspirin, and atorvastatin.

Two sides of the same coin,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna) was approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration on 4 August 2020 for the treatment of biallelic mutations in the RPE65 gene, a rare cause of congenital and adult-onset retinal dystrophy (predominantly Leber congenital amaurosis). Previous studies have shown that individuals who might participate in gene therapy trials overestimate clinical effect and underestimate risks. However, little is known about the perspectives of patients who may be offered approved gene therapy treatment for ocular conditions (as distinct from participating in clinical trials of gene therapy). The main objective of this study is to develop a tool to assess knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of approved and future genetic therapies among potential recipients of ocular gene therapy. In addition, we aim to assess the quality of life, attitudes towards clinical trials and vision-related quality of life among this cohort. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A new 'Attitudes to Gene Therapy for the Eye' tool will be developed following consultation with people with inherited retinal disease (IRD) and content matter experts. Australians with IRD or their guardians will be asked to complete an internet-based survey comprising existing quality of life and visual function instruments and items for the newly proposed tool. We expect to recruit 500 survey participants from patient support groups, the practices of Australian ophthalmologists who are specialists in IRD and Australian ophthalmic research institutions. Launch is anticipated early 2021. Responses will be analysed using item response theory methodology. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received ethics approval from the University of Melbourne (#2057534). The results of the study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will be presented at relevant conferences. Organisations involved in recruitment, and the Patient Engagement Advisory committee will assist the research team with dissemination of the study outcomes.","Mack, Heather G; Chen, Fred K; Grigg, John; Jamieson, Robyn; De Roach, John; O039,; Hare, Fleur; Britten-Jones, Alexis Ceecee; McGuinness, Myra; Tindill, Nicole; Ayton, Lauren",BMJ Open,,53

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the practices, finances, and social aspects of Brazilian vascular surgeons' lives. METHODS: This is a descriptive analysis of the responses from Brazilian vascular surgeons to the cross-sectional anonymous Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Task Force Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey for Vascular Surgeons disseminated 14-24 April 2020. Survey dissemination in Brazil occurred mainly via the Brazilian Society of Angiology and Vascular Surgery (SBACV) and social media. The survey evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgeons' lives by assessing COVID-19-related stressors, anxiety using theGeneral Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 scale, and coping strategies using the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE) inventory. RESULTS: A total of 452 responses were recorded from Brazil, with 335 (74%) respondents completing the entire survey. The majority of respondents were males (N = 301, 67%) and practiced in an urban hospitals. The majority of respondents considered themselves at high risk to be infected with COVID-19 (N = 251, 55.8%), and just over half the respondents noted that they had adequate PPE at their primary hospital (N = 171, 54%). One hundred and nine (35%) surgeons confirmed that their hospitals followed professional surgical society guidelines for prioritizing surgeries during the pandemic. At the time of the survey, only 33 (10%) surgeons stated they have pre-operative testing of patients for COVID-19 available at their hospital. Academic vascular surgeons reported being redeployed more often to help with other non-vascular duties compared to community-based or solo practitioners (43% vs. 30% vs. 21% respectively, P = .01). Severe anxiety due to pandemic-related financial concerns was similar in those surgeons practicing solo compared to those in community- or academic-based/group practice (46% vs. 38% vs. 22%; P = .54). The respondents reported their anxiety levels as mild based on the stressors investigated instead of moderate-severe (54% vs. 46%; P = .04). Social media was utilized heavily during the pandemic, with video gatherings being the most commonly used tool (76%). Self-distraction (60%) and situational acceptance (81%) were the most frequently reported coping mechanisms used among Brazilian vascular surgeons. CONCLUSION: The COVID pandemic has greatly affected healthcare providers around the world. At the time of this survey, Brazilian vascular surgeons are reporting low anxiety levels during this time and are using mostly active coping mechanisms.","Malgor, Rafael D; Sobreira, Marcone Lima; Mouawad, Nicolas J; Johnson, Adam P; Wohlauer, Max V; Coogan, Sheila M; Cuff, Robert F; Coleman, Dawn M; Sheahan, Malachi G; Woo, Karen; Shalhub, Sherene",Vascular,,53
443799,Mapping the Terrain of Moral Suffering,2021,"Social networking platforms provide a conduit to disseminate our ideas, views and thoughts and proliferate information. This has led to the amalgamation of English with natively spoken languages. Prevalence of Hindi-English code-mixed data (Hinglish) is on the rise with most of the urban population all over the world. Hate speech detection algorithms deployed by most social networking platforms are unable to filter out offensive and abusive content posted in these code-mixed languages. Thus, the worldwide hate speech detection rate of around 44% drops even more considering the content in Indian colloquial languages and slangs. In this paper, we propose a methodology for efficient detection of unstructured code-mix Hinglish language. Fine-tuning based approaches for Hindi-English code-mixed language are employed by utilizing contextual based embeddings such as ELMo (Embeddings for Language Models), FLAIR, and transformer-based BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Our proposed approach is compared against the pre-existing methods and results are compared for various datasets. Our model outperforms the other methods and frameworks.","Srivastava, Ananya; Hasan, Mohammed; Yagnik, Bhargav; Walambe, Rahee; Kotecha, Ketan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04913v1.pdf,53

This study was aimed at isolating and characterizing the pathogenic and pandemic V. parahaemolyticus from oysters (n = 90) in coastal parts of West Bengal, India; their antibiotic resistance and potential for involvement in the food chain. During bacteriological culture, typical V. parahaemolyticus colony was recovered in 88.9% samples followed by presumptive identification in 71 (78.9%) samples by characteristic biochemical (K/A) test. All the presumptive isolates (n = 71) were confirmed by species specific Vp-toxR PCR assay. Of these, 10 (14.08%) were tdh+ and none for the trh. Further, 5 (50%) of these tdh+ isolates were found to carry the pandemic potential gene in PGS-PCR assay; however, none in GS-PCR. Majority (80%) of these pathogenic (tdh+) isolates belonged to pandemic serovars (OUT: KUT; OUT: K24; O1: KUT; O1:K25; O10: KUT) and only 20% to non-pandemic serovars (OUT: K15; O9:K17). All the isolates (100%) exhibited resistance to cefpodoxime followed by ampicillin and cefotaxime (90%), ceftizoxime (60%), tetracycline (50%), ceftriaxone (40%), ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid (10% each). Overall, the study findings suggested that 11.1% (10/90) of commonly marketed oysters in this area were harbouring pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus. Moreover, 5.5% (5/90) of the oyster population were harbouring pandemic strains of this pathogen. Besides, the pathogenic isolates from oysters were exhibiting a considerable genetic relatedness (53 to 70%) to human clinical isolates in PFGE analysis that relates to a substantial public health risk. Further, their multidrug resistance added gravity to the antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a globally growing public health threat and this is a critical area of concern especially during the treatment of foodborne gastroenteritis.","Parthasarathy, S; Das, Suresh Chandra; Kumar, Ashok; Chowdhury, Goutam; Miyoshi, Shin-Ichi; Dutta, Shanta; Mukhopadhyay, Asish Kumar",World J Microbiol Biotechnol,,53

448927,Simulation study on indoor air distribution and indoor humidity distribution of three ventilation patterns using computational fluid dynamics,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Religion and spirituality constitute aspects of diversity that physicians must respect to provide patient-centered care. By seeing patients as individuals and integrating their religious and spiritual needs into their medical care, providers can deliver personalized health care. Their needs become even more critical for the frontline providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most patients want their physicians to address their religious and spiritual needs when it comes to their health (eg, during isolation precautions). Despite increases in educational curricula about this integration, most physicians still do not provide this aspect of patient-centered care. METHODS: In this observational study, we examined how medical students responded to a patient experiencing a religious and spiritual issue by having standardized patients (SPs) rate the students' level of engagement with them. We also asked students to reflect on their own spirituality, in terms of their current and ideal levels of spirituality, the difference of which indicates spiritual dissonance. Medical students (n=232) completed the Spiritual Health and Life-Outcome Measure (SHALOM) questionnaire, and their SPs completed the Princess Margaret Hospital Satisfaction With Doctor Questionnaire (PSQ-MD). RESULTS: Results indicated a significant, positive correlation between disengagement (from PSQ-MD) and transcendent spirituality dissonance (from SHALOM). CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of disconnection from a patient case with a religious and spiritual issue (portrayed by an SP) were associated with higher levels of incongruity in medical students' responses as to their ideal relationship with the transcendent (eg, God, Allah, peace).","Schmidt, Cindy; Nauta, Loes; Dang, Andrew",Fam Med,,53

Furthermore, we study a usage stop effect induced by a false positive quarantine. Our results reveal that policy makers should adjust digital contact tracing apps to the behavioral characteristics of a society. Based on this, the proximity detection range should at least cover the range of a disease spread, and be much wider in certain cases.

450960,Targeting Energy Expenditure—Drugs for Obesity Treatment,2021,"Neisseria meningitidis, carried in the human nasopharynx asymptomatically by ~10% of the population, remains a leading cause of meningitis and rapidly fatal sepsis, usually in otherwise healthy individuals. The epidemiology of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) varies substantially by geography and over time and is now influenced by meningococcal vaccines and in 2020-2021 by COVID-19 pandemic containment measures. While 12 capsular groups, defined by capsular polysaccharide structures, can be expressed by N. meningitidis, groups A, B, and C historically caused most IMD. However, the use of mono-, bi-, and quadrivalent-polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines, the introduction of protein-based vaccines for group B, natural disease fluctuations, new drugs (e.g., eculizumab) that increase meningococcal susceptibility, changing transmission dynamics and meningococcal evolution are impacting the incidence of the capsular groups causing IMD. While the ability to spread and cause illness vary considerably, capsular groups W, X, and Y now cause significant IMD. In addition, group E and nongroupable meningococci have appeared as a cause of invasive disease, and a nongroupable N. meningitidis pathotype of the hypervirulent clonal complex 11 is causing sexually transmitted urethritis cases and outbreaks. Carriage and IMD of the previously ""minor"" N. meningitidis are reviewed and the need for polyvalent meningococcal vaccines emphasized.","Tzeng, Yih-Ling; Stephens, David S",,,53

METHODS: A total of 583 nurses and 2423 physicians were recruited from across mainland China. An online survey was conducted from March 27 to April 26, 2020 (during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic) using the Chinese version of the MISS-HP. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed to determine scale structure. RESULTS: Cronbach's &#945; of the scale for both samples was acceptable (0.71 for nurses and 0.70 for physicians), as was test-retest reliability (ICCs for the individual items ranged from 0.41 to 0.74, with 0.77 for the overall scale in physicians). EFA suggested three factors, and the CFA indicated good fit to the data. Convergent validity was demonstrated with the 4-item Expressions of Moral Injury Scale (r = 0.45 for physicians, r = 0.43 for nurses). Discriminant validity was demonstrated by correlations with burnout and well-being (r = 0.34-0.47), and concurrent validity was suggested by correlations with depression and anxiety symptoms (r = 0.37-0.45). Known groups validity was indicated by a higher score in those exposed to workplace violence (B = 4.16, 95%CI: 3.21-5.10, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The MISS-HP demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity in a large sample of physicians and nurses in mainland China, supporting its use as a screening measure for moral injury symptoms among increasingly stressed health professionals in this country during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhizhong, Wang; Koenig, Harold G; Yan, Tong; Jing, Wen; Mu, Sui; Hongyu, Liu; Guangtian, Liu",BMC Psychiatry,,53

This SAIR model fully considers the infectious characteristics of asymptomatic cases and the transformation characteristics between the four kinds case. According to the data released by the National Health Commission of P.R.C, the model parameters are calculated, and the transmission process of the COVID-19 is simulated dynamically. It is found that the SAIR model data are in good agreement with the actual data, and the time characteristics of the infection rate are particularly accurate, proving the accuracy and effectiveness of the model. Then, on the basis of the differences between the model data and the real data, the standard deviation of the error is calculated. From the standard deviation, the functional intervals of the confirmed infection rate and the asymptomatic infection rate, the interval of the total number of cases in the model, and the interval of the number of asymptomatic cases in the society are also calculated. The number of asymptomatic cases in society is of important and realistic significance for the assessment of risk and subsequent control measures. Then, according to the dynamic simulation data of the model with changed value of parameters, the remarkable effects of strict quarantines are discussed. Finally, the possible direction of further study is given.","Ying, Liu Xiaoqing Tang","Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals: X",,53

METHODS: All members of Hungarian Society of Gastroenterology were invited between 7 and 17 April 2020 to participate in this cross-section survey study and to complete an online, anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: Total of 120 endoscopists from 83 institutes were enrolled of which 35.83% worked in regions with high cumulative incidence of COVID-19. Only 33.33% of them had undergone training about infection prevention in their workplace. 95.83% of endoscopists regularly used risk stratification of patients for infection prior endoscopy. While indications of examinations in low risk patients varied widely, in high-risk or positive patients endoscopy was limited to gastrointestinal bleeding (95.00%), removal of foreign body from esophagus (87.50%), management of obstructive jaundice (72.50%) and biliary pancreatitis (67.50%). Appropriate amount of personal protective equipment was available in 60.85% of endoscopy units. In high-risk or positive patients, surgical mask, filtering facepiece mask, protective eyewear and two pairs of gloves were applied in 30.83%, 76.67%, 90.00% and 87.50% of cases, respectively. Personal protective equipment fully complied with European guideline only in 67.50% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Survey found large variability in indications of endoscopy and relative weak compliance to national and international practical recommendations in terms of protective equipment.

463230,Emerging Animal Coronaviruses: First SARS and Now MERS,2020,"Transport makes an impact across SDGs, encompassing climate change, health, inequality and sustainability. It is also an area in which individuals are able to make decisions which have potential to collectively contribute to significant and wide-ranging benefits. Governments and authorities need citizens to make changes towards adopting sustainable transport behaviours and behaviour change interventions are being used as tools to foster changes in travel choices, towards more sustainable modes. Blockchain technology has the potential to bring new levels of scale to transport behaviour change interventions, but a rigorous approach to token design is required. This paper uses a survey of research projects and use cases to analyse current applications of blockchain technology in transport behaviour change interventions, and identifies barriers and limitations to achieving targeted change at scale. The paper draws upon these findings to outline a research agenda that brings a focus on correlating specific Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) to token design, and defines processes for standardising token designs in behaviour change tools. The paper further outlines architecture and operational considerations for blockchain-based platforms in behaviour change interventions, such that design choices do not compromise opportunities or wider environmental goals.","Barclay, Iain; Cooper, Michael; Preece, Alun; Rana, Omer; Taylor, Ian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01852v1.pdf,53
465108,From the Editor - in - Chief: Papers from the Society of Black Academic Surgeons,2021,"One of the challenges when using lithium metal as the anode in rechargeable lithium batteries is the formation and growth of lithium dendrites. The recent observation by He et al. (Nat. Nanotechnol., 2019, 14, 1042-1047) and Zhang et al. (Nat. Nanotechnol., 2020, 15, 94-98) confirm the presence of the root-growth mode for the growth of lithium dendrites (whiskers, spheres and hillocks). In this work, we introduced a non-Newtonian flow model to describe the flow of lithium in lithium metal and incorporate the contributions of viscous dissipation, surface energy, kinetic energy and strain energy in the analysis of the stress relaxation and the growth of a Li-sphere and a Li-whisker. Nonlinear second-order differential equations are derived for the growth of the Li-sphere and the Li-whisker. Closed-form solutions for the temporal evolution of the Li-sphere and the Li-whisker are obtained under the conditions such that the contributions of the surface energy, kinetic energy and strain energy stored in the cantilever beam to the stress relaxation in the lithium metal are negligible. Using the Lippmann relation in specific surface energy, we demonstrated that increasing the electric potential reduces the resistance to the flow of lithium into the Li-sphere and the Li-whisker. The results reveal the need to suppress the cycling-induced strain energy (misfit strain and biaxial modulus) in order to mitigate the growth of Li dendrites (whiskers, spheres and hillocks).","Yang, Fuqian",,,53

Viral infections in pregnant women may have a much more severe course, and result in an increase in the rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and premature birth-which may cause long-term consequences in the offspring. In this review, we focus on the mother-fetal-placenta interface and its role in the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including expression of viral receptors and proteases, placental pathology, and the presence of the virus in neonatal tissues and fluids. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the anti-viral activity of lactoferrin during viral infection in pregnant women, analyzes its role in the pathogenicity of pandemic virus particles, and describes the potential evidence for placental blocking/limiting of the transmission of the virus.","Bukowska-Osko, Iwona; Popiel, Marta; Kowalczyk, Pawel",Int. j. mol. sci.

Metabolism can modulate the immune responses against infectious diseases, yet our understanding remains limited on how host metabolism correlates with inflammatory responses and affects cytokine release in COVID-19 patients. Here we perform both metabolomics and cytokine/chemokine profiling on serum samples from healthy controls, mild and severe COVID-19 patients, and delineate their global metabolic and immune response landscape. Correlation analyses show tight associations between metabolites and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as IL-6, M-CSF, IL-1&#945;, IL-1ß, and imply a potential regulatory crosstalk between arginine, tryptophan, purine metabolism and hyperinflammation. Importantly, we also demonstrate that targeting metabolism markedly modulates the proinflammatory cytokines release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques ex vivo, hinting that exploiting metabolic alterations may be a potential strategy for treating fatal CRS in COVID-19.","Xiao, Nan; Nie, Meng; Pang, Huanhuan; Wang, Bohong; Hu, Jieli; Meng, Xiangjun; Li, Ke; Ran, Xiaorong; Long, Quanxin; Deng, Haijun; Chen, Na; Li, Shao; Tang, Ni; Huang, Ailong; Hu, Zeping",Nat Commun,,53
467853,For CS,2020,"Ramucirumab is approved both as monotherapy and in combination with Paclitaxel for advanced gastric cancer in patients with disease progression after chemotherapy. In tumor cells, the VEGFA-VEGFR2 binding activates autocrine survival and migration signaling in angiogenesis independent manner. The present in vitro study investigated the effects of single and combined treatments with Ramucirumab and Paclitaxel on cell growth and migration highlighting the mechanisms underlying the interaction between the two drugs in gastric cancer cells. Cell growth and motility were investigated in human gastric cancer cell lines characterized by different tumorigenicity. The inhibitory effect on cell growth exerted by both drugs was potentiated by their combination and was synergistic. Ramucirumab was able to enhance the inhibitory effect exerted by Paclitaxel on cell cycle progression. A synergistic action was also observed in the expression of proteins crucial for cell motility, microtubule organization and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, synergistic inhibition of VEGFR2 expression was obtained by the drug combination. These findings highlighted the importance of the combined treatment to strongly inhibit all the main molecules of both PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK pathways thus preventing possible reactivations due to cross-talk phenomena. The combined treatment with Ramucirumab seems to be a promising option to overcome the Paclitaxel resistance.","Refolo, Maria Grazia; Lotesoriere, Claudio; Lolli, Ivan Roberto; Messa, Caterina; D039,; Alessandro, Rosalba",Sci Rep,,53
468035,Nanocellulose functionalized with cinnamon essential oil: A potential application in active biodegradable packaging for strawberry,2021,"RATIONALE: Early empirical antimicrobial treatment is frequently prescribed to critically ill patients with COVID-19, based on Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the prevalence of early bacterial identification in intubated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, as compared to influenza pneumonia, and to characterize its microbiology and impact on outcomes. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective European cohort performed in 36 ICUs. All adult patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation >48h were eligible if they had SARS-CoV-2 or influenza pneumonia at ICU admission. Bacterial identification was defined by a positive bacterial culture, within 48h after intubation, in endotracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, blood cultures, or a positive pneumococcal or legionella urinary antigen test. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 1,050 patients were included (568 in SARS-CoV-2 and 482 in influenza groups). The prevalence of bacterial identification was significantly lower in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia as compared to patients with influenza pneumonia (9.7 vs 33.6%, unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.21 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.30), adjusted OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.33), p<0.0001). Gram-positive cocci were responsible for 58% and 72% of co-infection in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza pneumonia, respectively. Bacterial identification was associated with increased adjusted hazard ratio for 28-day mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (1.57 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.44), p=0.043). However, no significant difference was found in heterogeneity of outcomes related to bacterial identification between the two study groups, suggesting that the impact of co-infection on mortality was not different between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial identification within 48h after intubation is significantly less frequent in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia as compared to patients with influenza pneumonia.

Niclosamide, a poorly water-soluble drug, is an interesting drug candidate because it was approved over 60 years ago for use as an anthelmintic medication, but recent studies demonstrated its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral with pharmacological effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. TFF was used to develop a niclosamide inhalation powder composition that exhibited acceptable aerosol performance with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 86.0% and a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.11 µm and 2.84, respectively. This formulation not only proved to be safe after an acute three-day, multi-dose tolerability and exposure study in rats as evidenced by histopathology analysis, and also was able to achieve lung concentrations above the required IC90 levels for at least 24 h after a single administration in a Syrian hamster model. To conclude, we successfully developed a niclosamide dry powder inhalation that overcomes niclosamide's limitation of poor oral bioavailability by targeting the drug directly to the primary site of infection, the lungs.","Jara, Miguel O; Warnken, Zachary N; Sahakijpijarn, Sawittree; Moon, Chaeho; Maier, Esther Y; Christensen, Dale J; Koleng, John J; Peters, Jay I; Hackman Maier, Sarah D; Williams Iii, Robert O",Int J Pharm,,53

We surveyed community service sector workers from across Australia in three snapshots during April-May 2020 and found that perceptions of acute needs and organisational pressure points shifted even through this short period. While the sector faced significant challenges, it responded to the initial phase of the pandemic with flexibility, a strongly client-centred approach and a re-emphasis on collaboration between services. The community service sector's demonstrated capacity for agility and rapid adaptation suggests it is well placed to provide critical supports to those affected by crisis situations and everyday disadvantage.

Virus-cell fusion is mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with their organ expression pattern determining viral tropism. Clinical presentation suggests rapid viral dissemination to the central nervous system leading frequently to severe symptoms including viral meningitis. Here, we provide a comprehensive expression landscape of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins across human postmortem nasal and olfactory tissue. Sagittal sections through the human nose complemented with immunolabelling of respective cell types represent different anatomically defined regions including olfactory epithelium, respiratory epithelium of the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses along with the hardly accessible human olfactory bulb. ACE2 can be detected in the olfactory epithelium as well as in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal septum, the nasal conchae, and the paranasal sinuses. ACE2 is located in the sustentacular cells and in the glandular cells in the olfactory epithelium as well as in the basal cells, glandular cells, and epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. Intriguingly, ACE2 is not expressed in mature or immature olfactory receptor neurons and basal cells in the olfactory epithelium. Similarly, ACE2 is not localized in the olfactory receptor neurons albeit the olfactory bulb is positive. Vice versa, TMPRSS2 can also be detected in the sustentacular cells and the glandular cells of the olfactory epithelium. Our findings provide the basic anatomical evidence for the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human nose, olfactory epithelium, and olfactory bulb. Thus, they are substantial for future studies that aim to elucidate the symptom of SARS-CoV2 induced anosmia via the olfactory pathway.","Klingenstein, Moritz; Klingenstein, Stefanie; Neckel, Peter H; Mack, Andreas F; Wagner, Andreas P; Kleger, Alexander; Liebau, Stefan; Milazzo, Alfio",Cells Tissues Organs,,53

Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the end of December 2019 in China, it has become extremely important to have well-established and validated diagnostic and serological assays for this new emerging virus. Here, we present a micro-neutralization assay with the use of SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus with two different methods of read-out. We evaluated the performance of this assay using human serum samples taken from an Italian seroepidemiological study being performed at the University of Siena, along with the human monoclonal antibody CR3022 and some iper-immune animal serum samples against Influenza and Adenovirus strains. The same panel of human samples have been previously tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a pre-screening. Positive, borderline, and negative ELISA samples were evaluated in neutralization assay using two different methods of read-out: subjective (by means of an inverted optical microscope) and objective (by means of a spectrophotometer). Our findings suggest that at least 50% of positive ELISA samples are positive in neutralization as well, and that method is able to quantify different antibody concentrations in a specific manner. Taken together, our results confirm that the colorimetric cytopathic effect-based microneutralization assay could be used as a valid clinical test method for epidemiological and vaccine studies.","Manenti, Alessandro; Maggetti, Marta; Casa, Elisa; Martinuzzi, Donata; Torelli, Alessandro; Trombetta, Claudia M; Marchi, Serena; Montomoli, Emanuele",J. med. virol,,53

Since 2014, novel genetic variants of NoV have been continuously identified and have caused a sharp increase in the number of AGE outbreaks. The specific geographical distribution and expanding genetic diversity of NoV has posed a challenge to conventional surveillance. Here, we describe the long-term dynamic correlation between NoV distribution in sewage and in the local population through the molecular surveillance of NoV in Guangdong, 2013-2018. The relative viral loads of the GI and GII genotypes in sewage were calculated through RT-PCR. A high-throughput sequencing method and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering pipeline were developed to illustrate the abundances of different genotypes and genetic variants in sewage. Our results showed that the NoV viral loads and the emergence of new variants in sewage were closely associated with NoV outbreak risks in the population. Compared with the outbreaks surveillance, the dominance of the newly emerged variants, GII.P17-GII.17 and GII.P16-GII.2, could be detected one or two months ahead in sewage of a hub city. In addition, the dynamics of pre-epidemic variants, which were rarely detected in clinics, could be captured through sewage surveillance, thus improving our understanding of the origin and evolution of these novel epidemic variants. Our data highlight that sewage surveillance could provide nearly real-time and high-throughput data on NoV circulation in the community.

Unfortunately, coordinated government responses to address child protection since the start of the pandemic have been limited in Canada. As an exploratory study to examine the potential academic evidence base and location of expertise that could have been used to inform COVID-19 pandemic response, we undertook a review of child maltreatment research across three prominent Canadian professional journals in social work, medicine and public health. Methods: We conducted a pre-pandemic, thirteen-year (2006-2019) archival analysis of all articles published in the Canadian Social Work Review (CSWR), the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) and the Canadian Journal of Public Health (CJPH) and identified the research articles that related directly to child maltreatment, child protection or the child welfare system in Canada. Results: Of 11,824 articles published across the three journals, 20 research papers relating to child maltreatment, child protection or the child welfare system were identified (CJPH = 7; CMAJ = 3; CSWR = 10). There was no obvious pattern in article topics by discipline. Discussion: Taking these three prominent professional journals as a portal into research in these disciplines, we highlight the potential low volume of academic child maltreatment research despite the importance of the topic and irrespective of discipline. We believe that urgent transdisciplinary collaboration and overall awareness raising for child protection is called for at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as beyond in Canada.","Davison, Colleen M; Thanabalasingam, Susan J; Purkey, Eva M; Bayoumi, Imaan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,53

In our study conducted among residents of multiple cities in Poland (N = 627), we found that while active place attachment (i.e. conscious identification with a place) predicted more favourable attitudes towards enabling technologies, traditional (natural and unintentional) place attachment was positively associated with acceptance of surveillance technologies regarding everyday monitoring and anti-Covid-19 measures. We also found that the relationship between place attachment and acceptance of future technologies is partially mediated by the use of existing smart city technologies.

Univariate analysis was first performed (q-value reported after false discovery rate (FDR) correction) to determine the most predictive features among all imaging and clinical data. Prognostic modeling of survival was performed using radiomic features and clinical data, separately or in combination. Maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) and XGBoost were used for feature selection and classification. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were used to assess the prognostic performance of the models on the test datasets. RESULTS: For clinical data, cancer comorbidity (q-value < 0.01), consciousness level (q-value < 0.05) and radiological score involved zone (q-value < 0.02) were found to have high correlated features with outcome. Oxygen saturation (AUC = 0.73, q-value < 0.01) and Blood Urea Nitrogen (AUC = 0.72, q-value = 0.72) were identified as high clinical features. For lung radiomic features, SAHGLE (AUC = 0.70) and HGLZE (AUC = 0.67) from GLSZM were identified as most prognostic features. Amongst lesion radiomic features, RLNU from GLRLM (AUC = 0.73), HGLZE from GLSZM (AUC = 0.73) had the highest performance. In multivariate analysis, combining lung, lesion and clinical features was determined to provide the most accurate prognostic model (AUC = 0.95 ± 0.029 (95%CI: 0.95-0.96), accuracy = 0.88 ± 0.046 (95% CI: 0.88-0.89), sensitivity = 0.88 ± 0.066 (95% CI = 0.87-0.9) and specificity = 0.89 ± 0.07 (95% CI = 0.87-0.9)). CONCLUSION: Combination of radiomic features and clinical data can effectively predict outcome in COVID-19 patients. The developed model has significant potential for improved management of COVID-19 patients.","Shiri, Isaac; Sorouri, Majid; Geramifar, Parham; Nazari, Mostafa; Abdollahi, Mohammad; Salimi, Yazdan; Khosravi, Bardia; Askari, Dariush; Aghaghazvini, Leila; Hajianfar, Ghasem; Kasaeian, Amir; Abdollahi, Hamid; Arabi, Hossein; Rahmim, Arman; Radmard, Amir Reza; Zaidi, Habib",Comput Biol Med,,53

481578,Optimization of multi-V filter design for airliner environmental control system using an empirical model,2021,"Importance: The impact of COVID-19 in the US has been far-reaching and devastating, especially in Black populations. Vaccination is a critical part of controlling community spread, but vaccine acceptance has varied, with some research reporting that Black individuals in the US are less willing to be vaccinated than other racial/ethnic groups. Medical mistrust informed by experiences of racism may be associated with this lower willingness. Objective: To examine the association between race/ethnicity and rejection of COVID-19 vaccine trial participation and vaccine uptake and to investigate whether racial/ethnic group-based medical mistrust is a potential mediator of this association. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional survey study was conducted from June to December 2020 using a convenience sample of 1835 adults aged 18 years or older residing in Michigan. Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and hospital-academic networks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Separate items assessed whether respondents, if asked, would agree to participate in a research study to test a COVID-19 vaccine or to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants also completed the suspicion subscale of the Group-Based Medical Mistrust Scale. Results: Of the 1835 participants, 1455 (79%) were women, 361 (20%) men, and 19 (1%) other gender. The mean (SD) age was 49.4 (17.9) years, and 394 participants (21%) identified as Black individuals. Overall, 1376 participants (75%) reported low willingness to participate in vaccine trials, and 945 (52%) reported low willingness to be vaccinated. Black participants reported the highest medical mistrust scores (mean [SD], 2.35 [0.96]) compared with other racial/ethnic groups (mean [SD] for the total sample, 1.83 [0.91]). Analysis of path models revealed significantly greater vaccine trial and vaccine uptake rejection among Black participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], 0.51 [0.08]; vaccine uptake: B [SE], 0.51 [0.08]; both P < .001) compared with the overall mean rejection. The association was partially mediated by medical mistrust among Black participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], 0.04 [0.01]; P = .003; vaccine uptake: B [SE], 0.07 [0.02]; P < .001) and White participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], -0.06 [0.02]; P = .001; vaccine uptake: B [SE], -0.10 [0.02]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, racial/ethnic group-based medical mistrust partially mediated the association between individuals identifying as Black and low rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine trial participation and actual vaccination. The findings suggest that partnerships between health care and other sectors to build trust and promote vaccination may benefit from socially and culturally responsive strategies that acknowledge and address racial/ethnic health care disparities and historical and contemporary experiences of racism.","Thompson, Hayley S; Manning, Mark; Mitchell, Jamie; Kim, Seongho; Harper, Felicity W K; Cresswell, Sheena; Johns, Kristopher; Pal, Shoma; Dowe, Brittany; Tariq, Madiha; Sayed, Nadia; Saigh, Lisa M; Rutledge, Lisa; Lipscomb, Curtis; Lilly, Jametta Y; Gustine, Heidi; Sanders, Annie; Landry, Megan; Marks, Bertram",JAMA Netw Open,,53

483241,Measurements of exhaled airflow velocity through human coughs using particle image velocimetry,2021,"Objective: In the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to public mental health stress, anxiety, panic, and behavioural disorders. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether meaning in life and optimism-pessimism mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms and whether the mediating effect of meaning in life on depressive symptoms was moderated by optimism. Method: The sample of the study included 475 undergraduate students attending a public university in an urban city of Turkey. They were 69.2% female, ranged in age between 18 and 34 years (M = 20.63, SD = 1.99). Results: Results from the study showed that meaning in life and optimism–pessimism mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms. Optimism and pessimism additionally mediated the relationship between meaning in life and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, optimism moderated the mediating effect of meaning in life in the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: These results indicate that the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms can be better understood by meaning in life and optimism. Optimism might play a protective factor to mitigate the impact of stress on individuals' psychological health and is an important aspect of implementing meaning – centred intervention services. KEY POINTS What is already known about this topic: Meaningful living and optimism are important psychological constructs for psychological health, not only at an empirical level but also at a theoretical level. A high level of optimism improves youth well-being and mental health Stress has adverse impacts on individuals' well-being and is a risk factor for developing psychological problems What this topic adds: The present study highlights the importance of school meaning-based preventions and interventions targeting to promote mental health during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Optimism is an important mechanism that may help to explain the effect of coronavirus stress on psychological health of individuals. The study outcomes suggest there is a need to design a more comprehensive prevention and intervention approach for improving people's psychological health in the context of the pandemic.

La estimación se realizó bajo tres escenarios con datos oficiales del Ministerio de Salud: escenario 1 solo con datos oficiales; escenario 2 se añade el criterio de recuperados propuesto por organizaciones internacionales de salud y escenario 3 se incorpora el criterio de recuperados propuesto por organizaciones internacionales de salud, sin considerar fallecidos en el total de recuperados. Existen diferencias considerables entre el escenario 1 en comparación al 2 y 3 en número de fallecidos, enfermos activos y duración de la enfermedad. El escenario 3, considerado el más adverso, estima un total de 11 000 personas contagiadas, 1151 fallecidos y que el máximo de la enfermedad ocurriría durante los primeros días de mayo.

489484,Diversity of rhizobial and non-rhizobial bacteria nodulating wild ancestors of grain legume crop plants,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the quality of surgical education experiences sudden major restrictions. Students' presence in the operating theater and on wards is reduced to a bare minimum and face-to-face teaching is diminished. Aim of this study was therefore to evaluate alternative but feasible educational concepts, such as an online-only-platform for undergraduates. OBJECTIVE: A new online platform for undergraduate surgical education was implemented. A virtual curriculum for online-only education was designed. METHODS: A video-based online platform was designed. Following this, a cohort of medical students participating in a (voluntary) surgical course was randomized into a test and control group. Prior to conducting a written exam, students in the test group prepared using the video platform. Students in the control group prepared with standard surgical text books. Results of the exam were used to compare educational means. RESULTS: Students in the test group preparing through the video-based online platform reached significantly higher scores in the written exams (p = 0.0001) than students of the control group. A trend towards reduced preparation time that did not reach statistical significance was detectable in the test group (p = 0.090). Scores of ""perceived workload"" and ""desire to become a surgeon"" offered no differences between the groups. (p = 0.474 and 1.000). CONCLUSIONS: An online-only, virtual curriculum proved feasible for surgical education in undergraduates. While blended learning concepts were applied in both groups, only the test group had access to case-based videos of surgical procedures and scored significantly better in the written exams. Thus, video-based virtual education offers a realistic alternative to face-to-face teaching or conventional text books in times of restricted access to the operating theatre.","Schmitz, Sophia M; Schipper, Sandra; Lemos, Martin; Alizai, Patrick H; Kokott, Elda; Brozat, Jonathan F; Neumann, Ulf P; Ulmer, Tom F",BMC Surg,,53

490009,"The $(2,5)$ minimal model on genus two surfaces",2018-01-25,"To control the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, state and local governments in the United States have implemented several mitigation efforts that resulted in lower emissions of traffic-related air pollutants. This study examined the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on air pollution levels and the subsequent reductions in mortality for urban areas in 10 US states and the District of Columbia. We calculated changes in levels of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter no larger than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) during mitigation period versus the baseline period (pre-mitigation measure) using the difference-in-difference approach and the estimated avoided total and cause-specific mortality attributable to these changes in PM2.5 by state and district. We found that PM2.5 concentration during the mitigation period decreased for most states (except for 3 states) and the capital. Decreases of average PM2.5 concentration ranged from 0.25 µg/m3 (4.3%) in Maryland to 4.20 µg/m3 (45.1%) in California. On average, PM2.5 levels across 7 states and the capital reduced by 12.8%. We estimated that PM2.5 reduction during the mitigation period lowered air pollution-related total and cause-specific deaths. An estimated 483 (95% CI: 307, 665) PM2.5-related deaths was avoided in the urban areas of California. Our findings have implications for the effects of mitigation efforts and provide insight into the mortality reductions can be achieved from reduced air pollution levels.","Son, Ji-Young; Fong, Kelvin C; Heo, Seulkee; Kim, Honghyok; Lim, Chris C; Bell, Michelle L",Sci Total Environ,,53

Still, there is no specific drug to prevent or treat this novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease. Thus, the screening for a potential remedy presents a global challenge for scientists. Up to date over a hundred crystallographic structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro have been deposited to Protein Data Bank. With many known proteins, the demand for a reliable target has become higher than ever, so as the choice of an efficient computational methods. Therefore, in this study comparative methods have been used for receptor-based virtual screening, targeting 9 selected structures of viral Mpro. Reliability analyses followed by re-docking of the specific co-crystallized ligand provided the best reproductivity for structures with PDB ID 6LU7, 6Y2G and 6Y2F. The influence of crystallographic water on an outcome of a virtual screening against selected targets was also investigated. Once the most reliable targets were selected, the library of easy purchasable natural compounds were retrieved from the MolPort database (10,305 compounds) and docked against the selected Mpro proteins. To ensure the efficiency of the selected compounds, binding energies for top-15 hit ligands were calculated using Molecular Mechanics as well as their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties were predicted. Based on predicted binding energies and toxicities, top-5 compounds were selected and subjected to Molecular Dynamics simulation and found to be stable in complex to act as possible inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2.

While the lockdown strategy is an essential step to curb the exponential rise of COVID-19 cases, it can have a significative impact on mental health on the population involved, that is still not well known and must be explored. The objective of the present research is to investigate the Quality of Life (QoL) and Symptoms of PTSD (PTSS) encountered during the quarantine period (April 2020) due to the spread of COVID-19 in Italy. Participants (N = 1839; 1430 females and 409 males), who were volunteers and anonymous, adults (18-73 years), were drawn from a convenience sample of the general population and asked to fill out an online questionnaire, after giving an informed written consent. The General Health Questionnaire (GH12), used to assess health related QoL, identified 24.5% of respondents as problematic, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), used to assess PTSS, identified the 23.5% with clinical scores. Results showed that married people/cohabitants, non-workers, and those with a lower level of education perceived a better QoL and less PTSS. The most frequent emotions felt during the first month of quarantine and referred to by participants were sadness (72%), boredom (54.5%), impotence (52%), and anxiety (50%).

This retrospective cohort study included COVID-19 patients with oxygen saturation (SatO2 ) in room air <92% admitted between March 3 and April 30, 2020. Following the interim protocol, patients could receive dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, and were classified according to oxygen requirements. The primary endpoint was admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox hazards analyses were used. Of the 115 patients included, 38 received corticosteroids. Among requiring high-flow, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) > 0.40, the hazard ratio (HR) for death or ICU admission, between the corticosteroids and non-corticosteroids group, was 0.07 (95% CI 0.01-0.4), p = .002, and for patients requiring low-flow oxygen, the HR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.13-3.8), p = .68.

A significant reduction in mortality and ICU admission frequency was observed among patients requiring high-flow oxygen or NIV, but not among those requiring low-flow oxygen. Better targeting of COVID-19 patients is needed for the beneficial use of corticosteroids.","Tortajada, Cecilia; Colomer, Enrique; Andreu-Ballester, Juan C; Esparcia, Ana; Oltra, Carmina; Flores, Juan",J. med. virol,,53

However, there have been no screening tools developed to identify individuals who may be suffering from dysfunctional grief during the pandemic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the properties of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS), which is a brief mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death. This 5-item scale, which was based on 831 adults who lost someone to COVID-19, demonstrated solid reliability (&#945;s = 0.86), factorial validity (PCA and CFA support), and construct validity with strong correlations with suicidal ideation and substance use coping. The PGS measures COVID-19 grief equivalently across demographic groups, and discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional grief using an optimized cut score of &#8805; 7 (87% sensitivity and 71% specificity). An alarming 66% of the sample scored in the clinical range. The PGS also demonstrates incremental validity by explaining 18% additional variance in functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss beyond measures of depression and generalized anxiety. These results support the PGS as an efficient and valid screening tool for clinical research and practice during a pandemic.","Lee, Sherman A; Neimeyer, Robert A",Death Stud,,53

The study ventures to understand the relevance of this modality in a government setup. The objective is to understand the feasibility, clinical profile and addressability of patients using teleconsultation in ophthalmology at a tertiary care government medical university during the COVID-19 Lockdown in India. Methods: An online survey targeting faculty members and resident doctors in a tertiary eye center in a government medical university in north India was conducted. Various aspects of teleconsultation were analyzed including the number and preferential mode of consultations, commonest complaints and diagnoses made. Frequency and factors mandating physical examination of patients was also analyzed. Results: The questionnaire was sent to 40 ophthalmologists of whom 38 responded. A total of 4880 teleconsultations were given. The commonest mode of communication was by WhatsApp messages (65.6%) and E-mail was the least preferred medium. More than 80% consultations were from previously seen patients. Red eye was the commonest presenting complaint (22.8%), followed by watering (18.7%) and foreign body sensation (14.5%). Computer vision syndrome was the commonest diagnosis (25.9%) followed by conjunctivitis (17.7%) and refractive error (17.7%). About 40% required physical examination, mostly due to uncertain diagnosis (22%) or inadequate response to prescribed treatment (19%). Conclusion: Teleconsultation was feasible in a government medical university for providing ophthalmic services during lockdown. WhatsApp was the preferred communication modality, computer vision syndrome was the most frequent tentative diagnosis and approximately 60% did not require in-person physical examination.","Pandey, Nitika; Srivastava, Rajat M; Kumar, Gaurav; Katiyar, Vishal; Agrawal, Siddharth",Indian J Ophthalmol,,53

The pathological substrate for these findings remains unknown. Here we show that the lungs of patients with COVID-19 contain infected pneumocytes with abnormal morphology and frequent multinucleation. The generation of these syncytia results from activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the cell plasma membrane level. On the basis of these observations, we performed two high-content microscopy-based screenings with more than 3,000 approved drugs to search for inhibitors of spike-driven syncytia. We converged on the identification of 83 drugs that inhibited spike-mediated cell fusion, several of which belonged to defined pharmacological classes. We focused our attention on effective drugs that also protected against virus replication and associated cytopathicity. One of the most effective molecules was the antihelminthic drug niclosamide, which markedly blunted calcium oscillations and membrane conductance in spike-expressing cells by suppressing the activity of TMEM16F (also known as anoctamin 6), a calcium-activated ion channel and scramblase that is responsible for exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for COVID-19 disease pathogenesis and support the repurposing of niclosamide for therapy.","Braga, Luca; Ali, Hashim; Secco, Ilaria; Chiavacci, Elena; Neves, Guilherme; Goldhill, Daniel; Penn, Rebecca; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M; Ortega-Prieto, Ana M; Bussani, Rossana; Cannatà, Antonio; Rizzari, Giorgia; Collesi, Chiara; Schneider, Edoardo; Arosio, Daniele; Shah, Ajay M; Barclay, Wendy S; Malim, Michael H; Burrone, Juan; Giacca, Mauro",Nature (Lond.),,53

Health inequities in South Bronx predisposed this community to a large number of infectious cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of exposure to the infection. This study aims to assess seroprevalence and the associated characteristics of consenting HCWs from an NYC public hospital. METHODS: This cross-sectional study includes serum samples for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; PCR and completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. Participants' risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in the hospital and in the community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas was also considered an additional risk. The Odds Ratio with bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated with seroprevalence. RESULTS: A total of 500 HCW were tested, 137 (27%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Symptomatic participants had a 75% rate of seroconversion compared to those without symptoms. Subjects with anosmia and ageusia had increased odds of seroconversion in comparison to those without these symptoms. Community exposure was 34% among those who had positive antibodies. CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence among HCWs was high compared to the community at the epicenter of the pandemic. Further studies to evaluate sustained adaptive immunity in this high-risk group will guide our response to a future surge.","Venugopal, Usha; Jilani, Nargis; Rabah, Sami; Shariff, Masood A; Jawed, Muzamil; Mendez Batres, Astrid; Abubacker, Muhamed; Menon, Sharika; Pillai, Anjana; Shabarek, Nehad; Kasubhai, Moiz; Dimitrov, Vihren; Menon, Vidya",Int J Infect Dis,,53

Countries are battling to slow the spread of this virus by testing and treating patients, along with other measures such as prohibiting large gatherings, maintaining social distance, and frequent, thorough hand washing, as no vaccines or medicines are available that could effectively treat infected people for different types of SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, the testing procedure to detect this virus is lengthy. This study proposes a surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor for fast detection of SARS-CoV-2. The sensor employs a multilayered configuration consisting of TiO2-Ag-MoSe2 graphene with a BK7 prism. Antigen-antibody interaction was considered the principle for this virus detection. Immobilized CR3022 antibody molecules for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S-glycoprotein) are used for this sensor. It was found that the proposed sensor’s sensitivity (194°/RIU), quality factor (54.0390 RIU−1), and detection accuracy (0.2702) outperformed those of other single and multilayered structures.

Evidence indicates that donning face masks reduces the risk of viral transmissions and is now the norm in medical facilities. We propose attaching an acoustic-sensing device onto face masks to assist medical facilities in monitoring patients' respiration remotely. Usability and functionality studies of the modified face mask were evaluated on 16 healthy participants, who were blindfolded throughout the data collection. Around half of the participants noticed the difference between the modified and unmodified masks but they also reported there was no discomfort in using the modified mask. Respiratory rates of the participants were evaluated for one minute and the mean error of respiratory rate was found to be 2.0 +/- 1.3 breath per minute. As all participants were healthy, the wheeze detection algorithm was assessed by playing 176 wheezes and 176 normal breaths through a foam mannequin. The recordings were played at three different times to account for varying environmental noise. The overall accuracy of the wheeze detection algorithm was 91.9%.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: We conducted a telephone survey and interview of a random sample of patients who received different modalities of care (in-person, telephone, videocall, or visits deferred) during Michigan's shelter-in-place order beginning March 23rd, 2020. The survey assessed patient safety, patient satisfaction with care, perceptions of telehealth-based eye care, and worry about eyesight. Data was analyzed via frequency measures (e.g., means and standard deviations), Chi-square tests, ANOVA, and paired t-tests. Interviews were analyzed using Grounded Theory. RESULTS: 3274 patients were called and 1720 (53%) agreed to participate. In-person participants were significantly older than telephone (p=0.002) and videocall visit (p=0.001) participants. Significantly more white participants had in-person visits than minority participants (p=0.002). In-person visit participants worried about their eyesight more (2.7, SD=1.2) than those who had telephone (2.5, SD 1.3), videocall (2.4, SD=1.1), or deferred visits (2.4, SD=1.2) (p=0.004). Of all telephone or videocall visits, 1.5% (n=26) resulted in an in-person visit within 1 day, 2.9% (n=48) within 2-7 days, and 2.4% (n=40) within 8-14 days after the virtual visit demonstrating appropriate triage to telemedicine-based care. Patients frequently cited a desire for augmenting the telephone or videocall visits with objective test data. CONCLUSIONS: When appropriately triaged, tele-ophthalmology appears to be a safe way to reduce the volume of in-person visits to promote social distancing in the clinic. A hybrid model of eye care combining ancillary testing with a video or phone visit represents a promising model of care.","Newman-Casey, Paula Anne; De Lott, Lindsey; Cho, Juno; Ballouz, Dena; Azzouz, Lyna; Saleh, Sahal; Woodward, Maria A",Am. j. ophthalmol,,53

These feline cases originated from separate households and were epidemiologically linked to suspected or confirmed human COVID-19 cases in their respective households. Notification of presumptive positive animal test results triggered a One Health* investigation by state and federal partners, who determined that no further transmission events to other animals or persons had occurred. Both cats fully recovered. Although there is currently no evidence that animals play a substantial role in spreading COVID-19, CDC advises persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to restrict contact with animals during their illness and to monitor any animals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and separate them from other persons and animals at home (1).","Newman, Alexandra; Smith, David; Ghai, Ria R; Wallace, Ryan M; Torchetti, Mia Kim; Loiacono, Christina; Murrell, Laura S; Carpenter, Ann; Moroff, Scott; Rooney, Jane A; Barton Behravesh, Casey",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,53

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty four infertile women with stage III or IV endometriosis were randomly divided to two groups. The control group received the routine treatment and the treatment group, beside the routine protocol, received 50000 IU vitamin D weekly for 12-14 weeks. Blood and endometrial tissue were collected from both groups before and after the intervention. Protein and Gene expression levels of ß-catenin were assessed by Western blotting and Real-Time PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to before intervention, the expression of active form of ß-catenin reduced significantly within treatment group (p = .000), in addition, the difference between control and treatment groups (p = .012) was significant after intervention, too. Also, the ratio of active/total form of ß-catenin protein expression was significantly decreased within the treatment group at the end of intervention period (p = .000). CONCLUSIONS: It seems vitamin D can change the activity of ß-catenin protein in the endometrial cells of endometriosis patients. Further studies on the therapeutic potential of vitamin D in modifying the ß-catenin activity in endometriosis patients are warranted. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: IRCT2015081823678N1.

507545,"Multi-omic directed discovery of cellulosomes, polysaccharide utilization loci, and lignocellulases from an enriched rumen anaerobic consortium",2020,"Wastewater surveillance has been widely implemented for monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 during the global COVID-19 pandemic, and near-to-source monitoring is of particular interest for outbreak management in discrete populations. However, variation in population size poses a challenge to the triggering of public health interventions using wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. This is especially important for near-to-source sites that are subject to significant daily variability in upstream populations. Focusing on a university campus in England, this study investigates methods to account for variation in upstream populations at a site with highly transient footfall and provides a better understanding of the impact of variable populations on the SARS-CoV-2 trends provided by wastewater-based epidemiology. The potential for complementary data to help direct response activities within the near-to-source population is also explored, and potential concerns arising due to the presence of heavily diluted samples during wet weather are addressed. Using wastewater biomarkers, it is demonstrated that population normalisation can reveal significant differences between days where SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are very similar. Confidence in the trends identified is strongest when samples are collected during dry weather periods; however, wet weather samples can still provide valuable information. It is also shown that building-level occupancy estimates based on complementary data aid identification of potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 and can enable targeted actions to be taken to identify and manage potential sources of pathogen transmission in localised communities.","Sweetapple, Chris; Melville-Shreeve, Peter; Chen, Albert; Grimsley, Jasmine M.

However, the participation of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in different exocytosis stages has not been defined. Here we demonstrate that PTP-MEG2 controls multiple steps of catecholamine secretion. Biochemical and crystallographic analyses reveal key residues that govern the interaction between PTP-MEG2 and its substrate, a peptide containing the phosphorylated NSF-pY83 site, specify PTP-MEG2 substrate selectivity, and modulate the fusion of catecholamine-containing vesicles. Unexpectedly, delineation of PTP-MEG2 mutants along with the NSF binding interface reveals that PTP-MEG2 controls the fusion pore opening through NSF independent mechanisms. Utilizing bioinformatics search and biochemical and electrochemical screening approaches, we uncover that PTP-MEG2 regulates the opening and extension of the fusion pore by dephosphorylating the DYNAMIN2-pY125 and MUNC18-1-pY145 sites. Further structural and biochemical analyses confirmed the interaction of PTP-MEG2 with MUNC18-1-pY145 or DYNAMIN2-pY125 through a distinct structural basis compared with that of the NSF-pY83 site. Our studies thus provide mechanistic insights in complex exocytosis processes.","Xu, Yun-Fei; Chen, Xu; Yang, Zhao; Xiao, Peng; Liu, Chun-Hua; Li, Kang-Shuai; Yang, Xiao-Zhen; Wang, Yi-Jing; Zhu, Zhong-Liang; Xu, Zhi-Gang; Zhang, Sheng; Wang, Chuan; Song, You-Chen; Zhao, Wei-Dong; Wang, Chang-He; Ji, Zhi-Liang; Zhang, Zhong-Yin; Cui, Min; Sun, Jin-Peng; Yu, Xiao",EMBO Rep,,53

In this study, we compared outcomes of SOT recipients and non-SOT patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a propensity score matched analysis based on age, race, ethnicity, BMI, diabetes, and hypertension. After propensity matching, 117 SOT recipients and 350 non-SOT patients were evaluated. The median age of SOT recipients was 61 years, with a median time from transplant of 5.68 years. The most common transplanted organs were kidney (48%), followed by lung (21%), heart (19%), and liver (10%). Overall, SOT recipients were more likely to receive COVID-19 specific therapies and to require ICU admission. However, mortality (23.08% in SOT recipients vs. 23.14% in controls, P = .21) and highest level of supplemental oxygen (P = .32) required during hospitalization did not significantly differ between groups. In this propensity matched cohort study, SOT recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 had similar overall outcomes as non-SOT recipients, suggesting that chronic immunosuppression may not be an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in COVID-19.","Pereira, Marcus R; Arcasoy, Selim; Farr, Maryjane A; Mohan, Sumit; Emond, Jean C; Tsapepas, Demetra S; Shi, Qiuhu; Purpura, Lawrence; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin; Zucker, Jason; Verna, Elizabeth C",Transpl Infect Dis,,53

We focus on 3 historical vectors, all rooted in specific technologies, that have profound implications at the levels of our social imaginary and prereflective ways of being: architecture, social media, and medicine. Architecture has progressively eliminated ""porosity"" between spaces by establishing clear borders between public and private spaces (also within the private ones), thereby contributing to our drive for social distancing. Social media have provided apparatuses that replace intercorporeal encounters with disembodied, virtual interactions mediated by images. Visual experiences that are more embodied, participatory, and ""immersed"" are replaced by passive forms of ""seeing"": the other becomes an image for me, and I for the other. The object of medicine has also recently dematerialized with the advent of the new ""optical"" and ""digital"" machines of modern medicine, which can operate remotely thanks to an increasingly powerful interface reliant on computational power and the resources of artificial intelligence, thereby dispensing with body-to-body interactions. We offer these reflections as routes to a better understanding of changes that have occurred and are occurring on the planes of both culture and individual psychological existence.","Stanghellini, Giovanni; Sass, Louis",Psychopathology,,53

Methods: Cross-sectional online surveys were posted on seven professional Listservs from May 2020 to June 2020. Data were summarized descriptively and with semantic content analyses. Results: N = 207 surveys were completed by pediatric palliative program representatives from 80 cities, inclusive of physicians, nurses, child life, social workers, chaplains, and psychologists. Teams consulted on <20% of potential or presumed COVID-19 cases in their centers. Sixty percent of personnel were deemed ""essential"" during the pandemic. One-third of personnel remained in their usual work locale, with some shifting to support adult palliative services and others working remotely. Over 60% reported a sense of team ""distance"" compared with ""close"" team cohesion, associated with physical location of team members (p < 0.01) and frequency of team counseling, education, or support meetings (p < 0.02). All programs adopted a form of telehealth for patient care, although 41% did not receive telehealth training and 73% perceived unequal care quality with virtual care. Absence of pediatric patients' family members due to visitation policies, missing human presence and physical touch, concern for personal and colleague health, and fear of financial sustainability for programs were notable stressors. Conclusions: While the number of children diagnosed with COVID-19 receiving hands-on care from pediatric palliative care teams was reportedly low, the coronavirus pandemic vastly impacted pediatric palliative care team structure, daily services, and communication models warranting attentiveness to lessons learned and future direction.","Weaver, Meaghann S; Rosenberg, Abby R; Fry, Abigail; Shostrom, Valerie; Wiener, Lori",J. palliat. med,,53

The virtual imaging trial is a unique framework that can greatly facilitate the assessment and optimization of imaging methods by emulating the imaging experiment using representative computational models of patients and validated imaging simulators. The purpose of this study was to show how virtual imaging trials can be adapted for imaging studies of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), enabling effective assessment and optimization of CT and radiography acquisitions and analysis tools for reliable imaging and management of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We developed the first computational models of patients with COVID-19 and as a proof of principle showed how they can be combined with imaging simulators for COVID-19 imaging studies. For the body habitus of the models, we used the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) model that was developed at Duke University. The morphologic features of COVID-19 abnormalities were segmented from 20 CT images of patients who had been confirmed to have COVID-19 and incorporated into XCAT models. Within a given disease area, the texture and material of the lung parenchyma in the XCAT were modified to match the properties observed in the clinical images. To show the utility, three developed COVID-19 computational phantoms were virtually imaged using a scanner-specific CT and radiography simulator. RESULTS. Subjectively, the simulated abnormalities were realistic in terms of shape and texture. Results showed that the contrast-to-noise ratios in the abnormal regions were 1.6, 3.0, and 3.6 for 5-, 25-, and 50-mAs images, respectively. CONCLUSION. The developed toolsets in this study provide the foundation for use of virtual imaging trials in effective assessment and optimization of CT and radiography acquisitions and analysis tools to help manage the COVID-19 pandemic.","Abadi, Ehsan; Paul Segars, W; Chalian, Hamid; Samei, Ehsan",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,53

To this end, the study employs an asymmetric Fourier causality test for the period of January 15, 2020 to May 4, 2020. The outcomes indicate that positive shocks in COVID-19 deaths cause negative shocks in PM2.5 emissions for New York, San Diego, and San Jose. Moreover, in terms of cases, positive shocks in COVID-19 cause negative shocks in PM2.5 emissions for Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Antonio, and San Jose. Overall, the findings of the study highlight that the pandemic reduces environmental pressure in the largest cities of the USA. This implies that one of the rare positive effects of the virus is to reduce air pollution. Therefore, for a better environment, US citizens should review the impact of current production and consumption activities on anthropogenic environmental problems.","Pata, Ugur Korkut",Air Qual Atmos Health,,53

We employed a case study design, taking a case study of adolescents currently under the care of Uganda Youth Development Link (UYDEL). The data analyzed were collected from 219 female and male adolescents (13–19 years) recruited through UYDEL in Kampala, Uganda. A Poisson regression model with robust variance was used to assess the risk factors associated with suicidality. The prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 4 weeks and attempt within the past 6 months among adolescents was 30.6% (95% CI: 24.8, 38.0%) and 24.2% (95% CI: 18.7, 30.4%), respectively. The most stressful precursors of suicidal ideation or attempt included financial difficulties (59.5%), family breakdown or conflicts (37.4%), and trauma (23.1%). Suicidal ideation in the past 1 week preceding the survey was as high as 13.3% (95% CI: 9.0, 18.6%), of which 75.0% (95% CI: 55.1%, 89.3%) had a suicide plan. Prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 4 weeks was significantly higher among respondents with moderate psychological distress [Prevalence Ratio (PRR) = 2.74; 95% CI: 0.96, 7.84] and severe psychological distress (PRR = 4.75; 95% CI: 1.72, 13.08) but lower among adolescents who knew where to obtain professional psychological care (PRR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.87). Similarly, suicidal attempt was significantly higher among respondents with moderate psychological distress (PRR = 4.72; 95% CI: 1.01, 12.03) and severe psychological distress (PRR = 11.8; 95% CI: 4.66, 32.37), and who abuse drugs or substances (PRR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.13, 4.01). Therefore, suicidal ideation is a major public health issue among adolescents living in poor urban settlements in Kampala, Uganda. Psychological distress due to financial difficulties, unemployment, and family breakdown are major facilitators of suicidality among adolescents in urban poor settlements in Kampala. Interventions aimed at preventing suicide among vulnerable adolescents in urban settlements in Kampala, Uganda should incorporate this unique risk factor profile.","Bukuluki, Paul; Wandiembe, Symon; Kisaakye, Peter; Besigwa, Samuel; Kasirye, Rogers",Front Sociol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368292/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.646854,53

We had the opportunity to study the placental pathology of five full-term births to COVID-19 patients. All five exhibited histology indicative of fetal vascular malperfusion characterized by focal avascular villi and thrombi in larger fetal vessels. Vascular complement deposition in the placentas was not abnormal, and staining for viral RNA and viral spike protein was negative. While all cases resulted in healthy, term deliveries, these findings indicate the systemic nature of COVID-19 infection. The finding of vascular thrombosis without complement deposition may reflect the systemic nature of COVID-19's procoagulant effects unrelated to systemic complement activation.","Mulvey, J.

Although the initial step of CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus was determined to involve an A226V amino acid substitution in the E1 envelope glycoprotein that first arose in 2005, little attention has been paid to subsequent CHIKV evolution after this adaptive mutation was convergently selected in several geographic locations. To determine whether selection of second-step adaptive mutations in CHIKV or other arthropod-borne viruses occurs in nature, we tested the effect of an additional envelope glycoprotein amino acid change identified in Kerala, India in 2009. This substitution, E2-L210Q, caused a significant increase in the ability of CHIKV to develop a disseminated infection in A. albopictus, but had no effect on CHIKV fitness in the alternative mosquito vector, A. aegypti, or in vertebrate cell lines. Using infectious viruses or virus-like replicon particles expressing the E2-210Q and E2-210L residues, we determined that E2-L210Q acts primarily at the level of infection of A. albopictus midgut epithelial cells. In addition, we observed that the initial adaptive substitution, E1-A226V, had a significantly stronger effect on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus than E2-L210Q, thus explaining the observed time differences required for selective sweeps of these mutations in nature. These results indicate that the continuous CHIKV circulation in an A. albopictus-human cycle since 2005 has resulted in the selection of an additional, second-step mutation that may facilitate even more efficient virus circulation and persistence in endemic areas, further increasing the risk of more severe and expanded CHIK epidemics.","Tsetsarkin, Konstantin A.; Weaver, Scott C.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22174678/,53

More than 60% of human pathogens are zoonotic in origin. This includes a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, parasites, and other pathogens. Factors such as climate change, urbanization, animal migration and trade, travel and tourism, vector biology, anthropogenic factors, and natural factors have greatly influenced the emergence, re-emergence, distribution, and patterns of zoonoses. As time goes on, there are more emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases. In this review, we reviewed the etiology of major zoonotic diseases, their impact on human health, and control measures for better management. We also highlighted COVID-19, a newly emerging zoonotic disease of likely bat origin that has affected millions of humans along with devastating global consequences.

593384,33(rd)European Congress of Pathology – Abstracts,2021-08-27,"Introduction: This study evaluates the extent of patient care and revenue losses within Pediatric Ophthalmology (PO) practices as they rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. Methods: Two surveys of active AAPOS members were performed in 2020 at the pandemic peak “lockdown” phase 1 and again in the early recovery phase comparing practice data to the prior year. The authors extrapolated from AAO/ AAPOS 2018 Academetrics to identify specific clinical and financial outcomes. Results: Median surgical volume in April was 26% of normal, improving to 66% by mid-July, consequently, 76,892 surgeries were not performed. As of July, clinic examinations decreased by 27%, accounting for 461 lost examinations perprovider or 484,065 examinations not performed. Medicaid patients were disproportionately affected with 242,033 clinic examinations not performed. Clinical revenue decreased 77% in April and 55% in July. University/hospital and private practice/employed POs whose salary was consistent with the prior year were 69% and 9% respectively in July. As of July, the average doctor lost $85,358 in salary revenue translating into cumulative loss of $233,606,100 for PO physicians. Assuming PO practices continue functioning at current levels, 73% of capacity, through next April, over 1,480,670 examinations and 113,360 surgeries will not have occurred over a 1-year period since the initial survey. Conclusion/Relevance: While there has been healthy economic rebound for many, this historic event continues to jeopardize access to care for patients and threaten the economic viability of many PO practices. Societal and financial costs of morbidity due to past and future missed/delayed examinations cannot be measured at this time.","Robbins, Shira L.; Siegel, Brent A.; Siegel, Lance M.; Packwood, Eric A.",Journal of American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaapos.2021.08.170; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1091853121003864; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1091853121003864,53

Strategies to circumvent the pre-existing neutralizing antibodies which dampen the immunogenicity of Ad-based vaccines are also discussed.","Zhang, Chao; Zhou, Dongming",Hum Vaccin Immunother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27105067/,53
594343,Who should be prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination?,2020-11-03,"This chapter describes the optimal approach to antibiotic treatment of exacerbations recognizing these limitations. Such an approach relies upon an accurate diagnosis of an exacerbation, including judicious application of diagnostic tests. Determining the severity of an exacerbation follows this. If antibiotics are indicated, then a risk stratification approach is described to choose an appropriate antibiotic. An increase in airway inflammation from the baseline level in a patient appears central to the pathogenesis of most acute exacerbations. Airway inflammation measured in induced or expectorated sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial biopsy has revealed that increased inflammation accompanies exacerbations and resolves with treatment. Potential pathogens in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations include typical respiratory bacterial pathogens, respiratory viruses, and atypical bacteria. The current model of bacterial exacerbation pathogenesis involves both host and pathogen factors. Acquisition of strains of bacterial pathogens that are new to the host from the environment is the primary event that puts the patient with COPD at risk for an exacerbation. The traditional aims of treatment of an exacerbation are improvement in clinical status and the prevention of complications. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of COPD exacerbations has been a matter of controversy. Even more contentious has been the issue whether antibiotic choice is relevant to clinical outcome of exacerbations. Recommendations for antibiotic use among published guidelines are inconsistent.","Sethi, Sanjay",Asthma and COPD,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123740014000535; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123740014000535,53
594922,Interpreting vaccine efficacy trial results for infection and transmission,2021-02-28,"Background As vaccination campaigns are deployed worldwide, addressing vaccine hesitancy is of critical importance to ensure sufficient immunization coverage. We analyzed COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 15 samples covering ten low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, and South America, and two higher income countries (Russia and the United States). Methods Standardized survey responses were collected from 45,928 individuals between June 2020 and January 2021. We estimate vaccine acceptance with robust standard errors clustered at the study level. We analyze stated reasons for vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, and the most trusted sources for advice on vaccination, and we disaggregate acceptance rates by gender, age, and education level. Findings We document willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine across LMIC samples, ranging from 67% (Burkina Faso) to 97% (Nepal). Willingness was considerably higher in LMICs (80%) than in the United States (65%) and Russia (30%). Vaccine acceptance was primarily explained by an interest in personal protection against the disease (91%). Concern about side effects (40%) was the most common reason for reluctance. Health workers were considered the most trusted sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Interpretation Given high levels of stated willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine across LMIC samples, our study suggests that prioritizing efficient and equitable vaccine distribution to LMICs will yield high returns in promoting immunization on a global scale. Messaging and other community-level interventions in these contexts should be designed to help translate intentions into uptake, and emphasize safety and efficacy. Trusted health workers are ideally positioned to deliver these messages.","Solis Arce, J. S.; Warren, S. S.; Meriggi, N. F.; Scacco, A.; McMurry, N.; Voors, M.; Syunyaev, G.; Malik, A.

Abundant scientific evidence the wild animals are believed to be the primary hosts of the virus. Majority of such cases are considered to be human-to-human transmission, while a few are due to wild animals-to-human transmission and substantial burdens on healthcare system following this spread. To understand the dynamical behavior such diseases, we fitted a susceptible-infectious-quarantined model for human cases with constant proportions. We proposed a model that provide better constraints on understanding the climaxes of such unseen disastrous spread, relevant consequences, and suggesting future imperative strategies need to be adopted. The main features of the work include the positivity, boundedness, existence and uniqueness of solution of the model. The conditions were derived under which the COVID-19 may extinct or persist in the population. Sensitivity and estimation of those important parameters have been carried out that plays key role in the transmission mechanism. To optimize the spread of such disease, we present a control problem for further analysis using two control measures. The necessary conditions have been derived using the Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Parameter values have been estimated from the real data and experimental numerical simulations are presented for comparison as well as verification of theoretical results.

In contrast to the lockdown approach that has been applied in many European countries, the Swedish strategy has been based to a substantial extent on individuals taking responsibility under non-binding recommendations. This contribution explores the Swedish strategy from a constitutional and administrative law perspective, highlighting the tension between the formalist system for delegating norms under the Swedish Constitution and the pragmatic use of non-binding rules such as the “General Recommendations” adopted by the Public Health Agency. The article concludes that the official use of soft law instruments is confusing from a legal perspective, because non-binding rules do not offer the traditional formal mechanisms for legal protection, the publication of norms or accountability. The legal-realist approach of the Supreme Administrative Court’s case law, however, has the potential of balancing some of the unfortunate effects arising from the Swedish combination of formalism and pragmatism.","WENANDER, Henrik",European journal of risk regulation : EJRR,https://doi.org/10.1017/err.2021.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191958/,53

Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) capsid protein has recently been shown to be phosphorylated at four residues. Here those studies are extended to determine the kinase responsible for phosphorylation and the importance of capsid phosphorylation during the viral life cycle. Phosphorylation site prediction software suggests that Protein Kinase C (PKC) is responsible for phosphorylation of VEEV capsid. VEEV capsid co-immunoprecipitated with PKCδ, but not other PKC isoforms and siRNA knockdown of PKCδ caused a decrease in viral replication. Furthermore, knockdown of PKCδ by siRNA decreased capsid phosphorylation. A virus with capsid phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine (VEEV CPD) displayed a lower genomic copy to pfu ratio than the parental virus; suggesting more efficient viral assembly and more infectious particles being released. RNA:capsid binding was significantly increased in the mutant virus, confirming these results. Finally, VEEV CPD is attenuated in a mouse model of infection, with mice showing increased survival and decreased clinical signs as compared to mice infected with the parental virus. Collectively our data support a model in which PKCδ mediated capsid phosphorylation regulates viral RNA binding and assembly, significantly impacting viral pathogenesis.","Carey, Brian D.; Akhrymuk, Ivan; Dahal, Bibha; Pinkham, Chelsea L.; Bracci, Nicole; Finstuen-Magro, Sarah; Lin, Shih-Chao; Lehman, Caitlin W.; Sokoloski, Kevin J.; Kehn-Hall, Kylene",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150585/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008282,53

We recruited 1047 participants by using a Facebook advertisement. Participants’ motivations to get vaccinated and to adopt preventive behaviors against COVID-19, PMT constructs of threat appraisal (perceived severity and perceived vulnerability), and PMT constructs of coping appraisal (self-efficacy, response efficacy, response cost, knowledge, and previous vaccination for seasonal influenza) were determined. We analyzed participants’ motivations to get vaccinated and to adopt preventive behaviors against COVID-19 by using latent profile analysis. The present study identified three latent classes, including the participants with high motivation for vaccination and preventive behaviors (the class of Both High), those with low motivation for vaccination and preventive behaviors (the class of Both Low), and those with high motivation for vaccination but low motivation for preventive behaviors (the class of High Vaccination but Low Preventive Behaviors). Compared with the participants in the class of Both High, participants in the class of Both Low had lower levels of perceived vulnerability, perceived severity, self-efficacy to have vaccination, response efficacy of vaccination, knowledge about vaccination, and previous vaccination for seasonal influenza; participants in the class of High Vaccination but Low Preventive Behaviors had lower levels of perceived vulnerability and perceived severity but higher levels of response cost of vaccination. We concluded that varieties of motivations, threat, and coping appraisals should be considered in intervention programs aiming to increase motivation to adopt recommended protective behaviors against COVID-19.","Chen, Yi-Lung; Lin, Yen-Ju; Chang, Yu-Ping; Chou, Wen-Jiun; Yen, Cheng-Fang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280979/,53
597805,Tartary Buckwheat in Human Nutrition,2021-04-05,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been an ongoing global pandemic for over a year. Recently, an emergent SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.1.7) with an unusually large number of mutations had become highly contagious and wide-spreading in United Kingdom. From genome analysis, the N501Y mutation within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein might have enhanced the viral protein’s binding with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The latter is the prelude for the virus’ entry into host cells. So far, the molecular mechanism of this enhanced binding is still elusive, which prevents us from assessing its effects on existing therapeutic antibodies. Using all atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that Y501 in mutated RBD can be well coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, increasing the overall binding affinity between RBD and hACE2 by about 0.81 kcal/mol. We further explored how the N501Y mutation might affect the binding between a neutralizing antibody (CB6) and RBD. We expect that our work can help researchers design proper measures responding to this urgent virus mutation, such as adding a modified/new neutralizing antibody specifically targeting at this variant in the therapeutic antibody cocktail.","Luan, Binquan; Wang, Haoran; Huynh, Tien",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.425316,53

We collected daily NTL products for four weeks (one month) before and after the date of lockdown in each city, which were then summarized as weekly and monthly averaged NTL images after pre-processing (cloud removing, outlier detection, etc.). Results show that NTL overall decreased after the lockdown of cities, but with regional disparities and varying spatial patterns. Asian cities experienced the most obvious reduction of NTL. Particularly, the monthly averaged NTL in Mumbai, India, decreased by nearly 20% compared to one month before. However, there were no significant decline in NTL in European cities.

599300,"Parasites, Pests, and Pets in a Global World: New Perspectives and Challenges",2009-12-12,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has a devastating impact on the economies and health care system of sub-Saharan Africa. Healthcare workers (HWs), the main actors of the health system, are at higher-risk because of their occupation. Serology-based estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HWs represent a measure of HWs’ exposure to the virus and a guide to the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. This information is currently lacking in Ethiopia and other African countries. This study aimed to develop an in-house antibody testing assay, assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among Ethiopian high-risk frontline HWs. METHODS: A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was conducted among HWs in five public hospitals located in different geographic regions of Ethiopia. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using questionnaire-based interviews. From consenting HWs, blood samples were collected between December 2020 and February 2021, the period between the two peaks of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. The collected sera were tested using an in-house immunoglobin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies on sera collected from HWs. RESULTS: Of 1,997 HWs who provided a blood sample, demographic and clinical data, 50.5% were female, 74.0% had no symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and 29.0% had history of contact with suspected or confirmed patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall seroprevalence was 39.6%. The lowest (24.5%) and the highest (48.0%) seroprevalence rates were found in Hiwot Fana Specialized Hospital in Harar and ALERT Hospital in Addis Ababa, respectively. Of the 821 seropositive HWs, 224(27.3%) had history of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. A history of close contact with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases was strongly associated with seropositivity (Adjusted odds Ratio (AOR) =1.4, 95% CI 1.1–1.8; p=0.015). CONCLUSION: High SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels were observed in the five Ethiopian hospitals. These findings highlight the significant burden of asymptomatic infection in Ethiopia, and may reflect the scale of transmission in the general population.","Gelanew, Tesfaye; Seyoum, Berhanu; Mulu, Andargachew; Mihret, Adane; Abebe, Markos; Wassie, Liya; Gelaw, Baye; Sorsa, Abebe; Merid, Yared; Muchie, Yilkal; Teklemariam, Zelalem; Tesfaye, Bezalem; Osman, Mahlet; Jebessa, Gutema; Atinafu, Abay; Hailu, Tsegaye; Habte, Antenehe.; Kenea, Dagaga; Gadissa, Anteneh; Admasu, Desalegn; Tesfaye, Emmet; Bates, Timothy A.; Bulcha, Jote; Tschopp, Rea; Tsehay, Dareskedar; Mullholand, Kim; Howe, Rawleigh; Genetu, Abebe; Tafesse, Fikadu G.; Abdissa, Alemseged",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-676935/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34312618/,53

The questionnaire results show that Spanish Universities refused body donations and stopped all dissection research and teaching. The Covid‐19 expected influence on Anatomy teaching was referred to the increase of teaching workforce and resources required to apply the new safety measures to future practical activities, as well as to prepare and adapt teaching material for online‐only programs. The application of reinforced safety measures was expected to be perceived by the respondent’s students as a gain in teaching quality, while the transformation of the anatomy courses in online‐only programs will be perceived as a quality decrease. The respondent’s concerns about future institutional implications of the pandemic were related to increased costs of the adaptation of the facilities and the reinforced preventive measures, as well as the eventual decrease in donations. The complete lockdown applied on dissection rooms is not justified by scientific evidence and represents a break of the confidence deposed in the institutions by the donors.

Vast translational experience and hindsight have been gathered, specifically for cutaneous healing promotion of donor-site grafts and second-degree pediatric burns. PBBs constitute combined Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products, containing viable cultured allogeneic fetal dermal progenitor fibroblasts. Such constructs may partly favor repair and regeneration of functional cutaneous tissues by releasing cytokines and growth factors, potentially negating the need for subsequent skin grafting, while reducing the formation of hypertrophic scar tissues. This retrospective case-control study (2010–2018) of pediatric second-degree burn patients comprehensively compared two initial wound treatment options (i.e., PBBs versus Aquacel(®) Ag, applied during ten to twelve days post-trauma). Results confirmed clinical safety of PBBs with regard to morbidity, mortality, and overall complications. No difference was detected between groups for length of hospitalization or initial relative burn surface decreasing rates. Nevertheless, a trend was observed in younger patients treated with PBBs, requiring fewer corrective interventions or subsequent skin grafting. Importantly, significant improvements were observed in the PBB group regarding hypertrophic scarring (i.e., reduced number of scar complications and related corrective interventions).

STSLS is often accompanied by excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, which is the main cause of death. This calls for development of new strategies to avert the damage caused by STSLS. In this study, we found for the first time that Baicalein, combined with ampicillin, effectively improved severe S. suis infection. Further experiments demonstrated that baicalein significantly inhibited the hemolytic activity of SLY by directly binding to SLY and destroying its secondary structure. Cell-based assays revealed that Baicalein did not exert toxic effects and conferred protection in S. suis-infected cells. Interestingly, compared with ampicillin alone, Baicalein combined with ampicillin resulted in a higher survival rate in mice severely infected with S. suis. At the same time, we found that baicalein can be combined with meropenem against MRSA.

The complete sequence of ORF1b (6873 nucleotides) was determined. Like the coronaviruses, BEV was shown to express its ORF1b by ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the genomic RNA. The predicted tertiary RNA structure (a pseudoknot) in the toro- and coronaviral frameshift-directing region is similar. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the predicted BEV ORF1b translation product revealed homology with the ORF1b product of coronaviruses. Four conserved domains were identified: the putative polymerase domain, an area containing conserved cysteine and histidine residues, a putative helicase motif, and a domain which seems to be unique for toro- and coronaviruses. The data on the 3' part of the polymerase gene of BEV supplement previously observed similarities between toro- and coronaviruses at the level of genome organization and expression. The two virus families are more closely related to each other than to other families of positive-stranded RNA viruses.","Snijder, E J; den Boon, J A; Bredenbeek, P J; Horzinek, M C; Rijnbrand, R; Spaan, W J",Nucleic acids research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2388833/,53

Earlier detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, in China in December 2019, the deadly virus engulfed China and some neighboring countries, which claimed thousands of lives in February 2020. The proposed hybrid methodology involves the application of discreet wavelet decomposition to the dataset of deaths due to COVID-19, which splits the input data into component series and then applying an appropriate econometric model to each of the component series for making predictions of death cases in future. ARIMA models are well known econometric forecasting models capable of generating accurate forecasts when applied on wavelet decomposed time series. The input dataset consists of daily death cases from most affected five countries by COVID-19, which is given to the hybrid model for validation and to make one month ahead prediction of death cases. These predictions are compared with that obtained from an ARIMA model to estimate the performance of prediction. The predictions indicate a sharp rise in death cases despite various precautionary measures taken by governments of these countries.","Singh, Sarbjit; Parmar, Kulwinder Singh; Kumar, Jatinder; Makkhan, Sidhu Jitendra Singh",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109866; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920302666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395038/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920302666?v=s5,53
604980,Biomolecular Modeling and Simulation: A Prospering Multidisciplinary Field,2021,"Over 36 million people worldwide are infected with HIV. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven to be highly effective to prevent HIV-1 transmission, clinical progression and death. Despite this success, the number of HIV-1 infected individuals continues increasing and ART should be taken for life. Therefore, there are two main priorities: the development of preventive vaccines to protect from HIV acquisition and achieve an efficient control of HIV infection in the absence of ART (functional cure). In this sense, in the last few years, there has been a broad interest in new and innovative approaches such as mRNA-based vaccines. RNA-based immunogens represent a promising alternative to conventional vaccines because of their high potency, capacity for rapid development and potential for low-cost manufacture and safe administration. Some mRNA-based vaccines platforms against infectious diseases have demonstrated encouraging results in animal models and humans. However, their application is still limited because the instability and inefficient in vivo delivery of mRNA. Immunogens, design, immunogenicity, chemical modifications on the molecule or the vaccine delivery methods are all crucial interventions for improvement. In this review we, will present the current knowledge and challenges in this research field. mRNA vaccines hold great promises as part of a combined strategy, for achieving HIV functional cure.","Esteban, Ignasi; Pastor-Quiñones, Carmen; Usero, Lorena; Plana, Montserrat; García, Felipe; Leal, Lorna",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803790/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13030501,53

Using a qualitative, inductive approach based on grounded theory, we conducted in-depth interviews with fifteen professional couples in Israel about their experiences with working from home and the division of labor and space between spouses. Our analysis revealed three key issues related to these experiences: the division of physical workspace between the spouses, the division of work time (compared to home time), and bodily-spatial aspects of the infiltration of workspace into home through the Zoom camera. The patterns described here suggest that the gendered power relations between spouses working from home are reproduced through an unequal negotiation of space and time in the home, so that in practice, men’s work was prioritized in spatio-temporal terms, whereas women’s workspace and time was more fragmented and dispersed throughout the home and day. These findings illuminate women’s right to workspace in the home as an issue of gender equality that has been amplified by the current global pandemic, and how gendered divisions of space and time serve to reproduce the gender order.","Waismel-Manor, Ronit; Wasserman, Varda; Shamir-Balderman, Orit",Sex Roles,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-021-01246-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629688/,53
606095,A compartmental model for the analysis of SARS transmission patterns and outbreak control measures in China,2005-03-15,"Seasonal cycles of AHF are causally attributed to the seasonal pattern of respiratory tract infections. However, this assumption has never been formally validated. We aimed to determine whether the increase in winter admissions for acute heart failure (AHF) can be explained by seasonal infectious diseases. We studied 12,147 patients admitted for AHF over a period of 11 years (2005–2015). Detailed virology and bacteriology data were collected on each patient. Meteorological information including daily temperature and relative humidity was obtained for the same period. The peak-to-low ratio, indicating the intensity of seasonality, was calculated using negative binomial regression-derived incidence rate ratios (IRR). AHF admissions occurred with a striking annual periodicity, peaking in winter (December-February) and were lowest in summer (June–August), with a seasonal amplitude (January vs. August) of 2.00 ([95% CI 1.79–2.24]. Occurrence of confirmed influenza infections was low (1.59%). Clinical diagnoses of respiratory infections, confirmed influenza infections, and influenza-like infections also followed a strong seasonal pattern (P < 0.0001; Peak/low ratio 2.42 [95% CI 1.394–3.03]). However, after exclusion of all respiratory infections, the seasonal variation in AHF remained robust (Peak/low ratio January vs. August, 1.81 [95% CI 1.60–2.05]; P < 0.0001). There was a strong inverse association between AHF admissions and average monthly temperature (IRR 0.95 per 1℃ increase; 95% CI 0.94 to 0.96). In conclusion, these is a dominant seasonal modulation of AHF admissions which is only partly explained by the incidence of winter respiratory infections. Environmental factors modify the susceptibility of heart failure patients to decompensation.","Aronson, Doron",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90790-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34050240/,53
606371,Platelets amplify endotheliopathy in COVID-19,2021-09-08,"Memory B-cells (MBCs) are potential antibody secreting immune cells that differentiate and mature following host exposure to a pathogen. Following differentiation, MBCs remain in peripheral circulation after recovery and are poised to secrete antigen-specific antibodies if and when they are re-exposed to their cognate antigen. Consequently, MBCs form the founder population and provide one of the first lines of pathogen-specific defense against reinfection. The role MBCs play is complicated for viruses that are heterologous, such as dengue virus (DENV), which exist as antigenically different serotypes. On second infection with a different serotype, MBCs from initial dengue infection rapidly proliferate and secrete antibodies: many of these MBC derived antibodies will be cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing, while some antibodies may recognize epitopes conserved across serotypes and have the capacity to broadly neutralize 2 or more serotypes. It is also possible that a new population of MBCs and antibodies specific for the second virus serotype need to arise for long-term broader immunity to develop. Methods to interrogate and track memory B cell responses are important for evaluating both natural immunity and vaccine response. However, the low abundance of MBCs for any specific pathogen makes it challenging to interrogate frequency, specificity, and breadth for the pathogen of interest. This review discusses current approaches that have been used to interrogate the memory B cell immune response against viral pathogens in general and DENV specifically. Including strengths, limitations, and future directions. Single-cell approaches could help uncover the DENV specific MBC antibody repertoire, and improved methods for isolating DENV specific monoclonal antibodies from human peripheral blood cells would allow for a functional analysis of the anti-DENV repertoire.","Lyski, Zoe L.; Messer, William B.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244836/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01276,53

The role of thiamine in critically ill septic patient has been addressed in multiple studies; however, it’s role in COVID-19 patients is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of thiamine as an adjunctive therapy on mortality in COVID-19 critically ill patients. METHODS: This is a two-center, non-interventional, retrospective cohort study for critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID19. All patients aged 18 years or older admitted to ICUs between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, with positive PCR COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. We investigated thiamine use as an adjunctive therapy on the clinical outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients after propensity score matching. RESULTS: A total of 738 critically ill patients with COVID-19 who had been admitted to ICUs were included in the study. Among 166 patients matched using the propensity score method, 83 had received thiamine as adjunctive therapy. There was significant association between thiamine use with in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.19–0.78; P value = 0.008) as well as the 30-day mortality (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.18–0.78; P value = 0.009). Moreover, patients who received thiamine as an adjunctive therapy were less likely to have thrombosis during ICU stay [OR (95% CI) 0.19 (0.04–0.88), P value = 0.03]. CONCLUSION: Thiamine use as adjunctive therapy may have potential survival benefits in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additionally, it was associated with a lower incidence of thrombosis. Further interventional studies are required to confirm these findings.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional online survey of all FPMRS program directors in the United States conducted from April 29, 2020, to May 30, 2020. At the time of this study, there were 73 program directors and 69 obstetrics and gynecology and urology–accredited FPMRS programs nationwide. The primary outcome was to subjectively assess the effectiveness of virtual interviews as compared with in-person interviews for evaluating applicants. RESULTS: Fifty seven (82.6%) of the program directors completed the survey. A total of 80.7% (46/57) of the respondents had participated in interviews for the active match cycle. Of the programs that participated in the interview process, almost all conducted interviews using virtual platforms (97.8%, 45/46). Program directors who conducted interviews virtually found them effective in evaluating applicants (88.9%, 40/45) and were satisfied with the virtual interview process (86.7%, 39/45). A total of 31.1% of respondents (14/45) preferred a virtual platform to an in-person setting for future interviews, and 60% (27/45) reported that they will likely perform future interviews virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pandemic resulted in a sudden reformatting of FPMRS fellowship interviews, most program directors nationally were satisfied with the process and found virtual interviews effective for assessing applicants. More than 50% of FPMRS program directors are likely to consider the virtual format for future interviews.","Menhaji, Kimia; Gaigbe-Togbe, Bertille HA.; Hardart, Anne; Bui, Anthony H.; Andiman, Sarah E.; Ascher-Walsh, Charles J.; Dabney, Lisa; Do Tran, Ann",Female Pelvic Med Reconstr Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33086259/; https://doi.org/10.1097/spv.0000000000000982,53

In this work, we used a coarse-grained model to calculate the binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV to their human receptor ACE2. The investigation of the free energy contribution of the interacting residues indicates that the residues located outside the receptor binding domain are the source of the stronger binding of the novel virus. Thus, the current results suggest that the essential evolution of SARS-CoV-2 happens remotely from the binding domain at the spike protein trimeric body. Such evolution may facilitate the conformational change and the infection process that occurs after the virus is bound to ACE2. By studying the binding pattern between SARS-CoV antibody m396 and SARS-CoV-2, it is found that the remote energetic contribution is missing, which might explain the absence of cross-reactivity of such antibodies.","Bai, Chen; Warshel, Arieh",J Phys Chem B,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32551652/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c04317,53

The local Renin Angiotensin System plays an important role in lung injury and inflammation. Particularly, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) has been identified as a protective lung enzyme against the insult. ACE-2 converts pro-apoptotic Angiotensin II to anti-apoptotic Angiotensin 1–7. However, the effect of meconium on ACE-2 has never been studied before. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of meconium on ACE-2, and whether inhibition of proteolytic enzymes present in the meconium reverses its effects on ACE-2. METHODS: Alveolar epithelial A549 cells were exposed to F-12 medium, 2.5% meconium, meconium + a protease inhibitor cocktail (PIc) and PIc alone for 16 h. At the end of incubation, apoptosis was measured with a nuclear fragmentation assay and cell lysates were collected for ACE-2 immunoblotting and enzyme activity. RESULTS: Meconium caused a fourfold increase in apoptotic nuclei (p < 0.001). The pro-apoptotic effect of meconium can be reversed by PIc. Meconium reduced ACE-2 enzyme activity by cleaving ACE-2 into a fragment detected at ~ 37 kDa by immunoblot. PIc prevented the degradation of ACE-2 and restored 50% of ACE-2 activity (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that meconium causes degradation of lung protective ACE-2 by proteolytic enzymes present in meconium, since the effects of meconium can be reversed by PIc.","Gandhi, Chintan K.; Holmes, Romel; Gewolb, Ira H.; Uhal, Bruce D.",Lung,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30759273/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00408-019-00201-y,53

This study proposes a design of ventilation system to control air flow rate for containing airborne contaminant and preventing its spread to the adjacent rooms when the door to the isolation room is opened and closed. This paper employs computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a more effective approach to examine the concentration maps of airborne contaminants and the airflow patterns of room air and discuss the influence of temperature differences between two rooms on airborne dispersion.

We aimed to summarize the existing literature on COVID-19 infection during pregnancy to evaluate which mode of delivery is better for preventing possible vertical transmission from a pregnant mother confirmed with COVID-19 to a neonate. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM) from 31 December 2019 to 18 June 2020. We applied no language restrictions. We screened abstracts for relevance, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in duplicate. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. The primary outcome was severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test positivity in neonates born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19 following different delivery modes. Secondary outcomes were neonatal deaths and maternal deaths. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020194049. Results: Sixty-eight observational studies meeting inclusion criteria were included in the current study, with no randomized controlled trials. In total, information on the mode of delivery, detailed neonatal outcomes, and SARS-CoV-2 status were available for 1,019 pregnant women and 1,035 neonates. Six hundred and eighteen (59.71%) neonates were born through cesarean section and 417(40.29%) through vaginal delivery. Probable congenital SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in 34/1,035 (3.29%) neonates. Of babies born vaginally, 9/417 (2.16%) were tested positive compared with 25/618 (4.05%) born by cesarean. Of babies born vaginally, 0/417 (0.00%) neonatal deaths were reported compared with 6/618 (0.97%) born by cesarean. Of women who delivered vaginally, 1/416 (0.24%) maternal deaths were reported compared with 11/603 (1.82%) delivered by cesarean. Two women died before delivery. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses showed similar findings. Conclusions: The rate of neonatal COVID-19 infection, neonatal deaths, and maternal deaths are no greater when the mother gave birth through vaginal delivery. Based on the evidence available, there is no sufficient evidence supporting that the cesarean section is better than vaginal delivery in preventing possible vertical transmission from a pregnant mother confirmed with COVID-19 to a neonate. The mode of birth should be individualized and based on disease severity and obstetric indications.

There are some pieces of evidence that SARS-CoV-2 genome could be re-detectable in recovered patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic review in the PubMed/Medline database to address the risk of SARS-CoV-2 recurrence. The last update was for 20 November 2020. Among the 1178 initially found articles, 66 met the inclusion criteria and were considered. FINDINGS: In total, 1128 patients with at least one-time recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 were included. Recurrence rate has been reported between 2.3% and 21.4% in cohort studies, within a mean of 20 (ranged 1–98) days after discharge; younger patients are being affected more. Following the second course of disease, the disease severity decreased or remained unchanged in 97.3% while it increased in 2.6%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM were positive in 11–95% and 58.8–100%, respectively. Based on the literature, three possibilities include reactivation of previous disease, reinfection with the same virus, and false negative, which have been discussed in details. CONCLUSION: There is a relatively notable risk of disease recurrence in previously recovered patients, even those who are immunised against the virus.

Exploiting the staggered timing of COVID-19 outbreaks in extended event-study models, we find that the policies heavily reduced mobility and contagion. In comparison to a no-social-distancing benchmark, within three weeks, the policies avoided 84% of the potential COVID-19 cases (point estimate: 499.3K) and 66% of the potential fatalities (5.4K).

Little is known about the expectations of patients and their caregivers about physician care during the hospital to SNF transition. Our objectives were to (1) describe the experiences and expectations of patients and their caregivers with SNF physicians in SNFs, and (2) identify patterns that differed between patients with vs. without cognitive impairment. METHODS: This qualitative study used grounded theory approach to analyze data collected from semi-structured interviews at five SNFs in January–August 2018. Patients admitted for short-term SNF care 5–10 days prior were eligible to participate. Thematic analysis was performed to detect recurrent themes with a focus on modifiable aspects of physician care. Analysis was stratified by patient cognitive impairment (measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment at the time of the interview). RESULTS: Fifty patients and six caregivers were interviewed. Major themes were: (1) patients had poor awareness of the physician in charge of their care; (2) they were dissatisfied with the frequency of interaction with the physician; and (3) participants valued the perception of receiving individualized care from the physician. Less cognitively impaired patients were more concerned about limited interactions with the physicians and were more likely to report attempts to seek out the physician. CONCLUSION: Patient and caregiver expectations of SNF physicians were not well aligned with their experiences. SNFs aiming to improve satisfaction with care may focus efforts in this area, such as facilitating frequent communication between physicians, patients and caregivers.

In contrast, epidemic models often consider a single strain and perennial immunity. To bridge this gap, we present a new epidemic model that simultaneously considers multiple viral strains and reinfection due to waning immunity. The model is general, applies to any viral disease and includes an optimal control formulation to seek a trade-off between the societal and economic costs of mitigation. We validate the model, with and without mitigation, in the light of the COVID-19 epidemic in England and in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. The model can derive optimal mitigation strategies for any number of viral strains, whilst also evaluating the effect of distinct mitigation costs on the infection levels. The results show that relaxations in the mitigation measures cause a rapid increase in the number of cases, and therefore demand more restrictive measures in the future.","Arruda, Edilson F.; Das, Shyam S.; Dias, Claudia M.; Pastore, Dayse H.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257512; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08137v1.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529745/,53

The 3C-like protease (3CLpro), a highly conserved protease indispensable for replication of coronaviruses, is a promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. To advance the speed of drug discovery and development, we investigated the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by natural products derived from Chinese traditional medicines. Baicalin and baicalein were identified as the first non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography is distinctly different from those of known inhibitors. Baicalein is perfectly ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a “shield” in front of the catalytic dyad to prevent the peptide substrate approaching the active site. The simple chemical structure, unique mode of action, and potent antiviral activities in vitro, coupled with the favorable safety data from clinical trials, emphasize that baicalein provides a great opportunity for the development of critically needed anti-coronaviral drugs.","Su, Haixia; Yao, Sheng; Zhao, Wenfeng; Li, Minjun; Liu, Jia; Shang, WeiJuan; Xie, Hang; Ke, Changqiang; Gao, Meina; Yu, Kunqian; Liu, Hong; Shen, Jingshan; Tang, Wei; Zhang, Leike; Zuo, Jianping; Jiang, Hualiang; Bai, Fang; Wu, Yan; Ye, Yang; Xu, Yechun",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.038687,53

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the preferred choice, however, laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) has emerged as a tumor cytoreduction technique. The present meta-analysis compared current SRS therapy with LITT in brain tumors. METHODS: A search was performed in Lilacs, PubMed, and Cochrane database. Patient’s demographics, tumor location, therapy used, Karnofsky performance status score before treatment, and patient’s outcome (median overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events) data were extracted from studies. The risk of bias was assessed by Cochrane collaboration tool. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included in this meta-analysis. LITT and SRS MOS in brain metastasis patients were 12.8 months’ versus 9.8 months (ranges 9.3–16.3 and 8.3–9.8; P = 0.02), respectively. In a combined comparison of adverse effects among LITT versus SRS in brain metastasis, we found 15% reduction in absolute risk difference (−0.16; 95% confidence interval P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: We could not state that LITT treatment is an optimal alternative therapy for difficult-to-access brain tumors due to the lack of systematic data that were reported in our pooled studies. However, our results identified a positive effect in lowering the absolute risk of adverse events compared with SRS therapy. Therefore, randomized trials are encouraged to ascertain LITT role, as upfront or postoperative/post-SRS therapy for brain tumor treatment.","de Franca, Sabrina Araujo; Tavares, Wagner Malago; Salinet, Angela Salomao Macedo; Teixeira, Manoel Jacobsen; Paiva, Wellingson Silva",Surg Neurol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194293/; https://doi.org/10.25259/sni_152_2020,53

Adipokines play important roles in the maintenance of energy homeostasis, appetite, glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, angiogenesis, immunity and inflammation. Enormous number of studies from all over the world proved that adipocytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of diseases affecting nearly all body systems, which raises the question whether we can always blame adipocytokines as the triggering factor of every disease that may hit the body. OBJECTIVE: Our review targeted the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems including diabetes mellitus, kidney diseases, gynecological diseases, rheumatologic disorders, cancers, Alzheimer’s, depression, muscle disorders, liver diseases, cardiovascular and lung diseases. METHODOLOGY: We cited more than 33 recent literature reviews that discussed the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems. CONCLUSION: More evidence is being discovered to date about the role played by adipocytokines in more diseases and extra research is needed to explore hidden roles played by adipokine imbalance on disease pathogenesis.","Maximus, Pierre S.; Al Achkar, Zeina; Hamid, Pousette F.; Hasnain, Syeda S.; Peralta, Cesar A.",Cytokine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466620301605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32559663/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155144; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466620301605,53

However, no proven effective therapies currently exist, and different clinical phenotypes complicate the situation. In clinical practice, many severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients developed gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, including vomiting, diarrhoea, or abdominal pain, even in the absence of cough and dyspnea. Understanding the mechanism of GI disturbances is warranted for exploring better clinical care for COVID-19 patients. With evidence collected from clinical studies on COVID-19 and basic research on a rare genetic disease (i.e., Hartnup disorder), we put forward a novel hypothesis to elaborate an effective nutritional therapy. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, binding to intestinal angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, negatively regulates the absorption of neutral amino acids, and this could explain not only the GI, but also systemic disturbances in COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: We describe the demographic characteristics of patients who died of COVID-19, observation of frequent rapid response team/cardiac arrest (RRT/CA) calls for non–intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and factors that contributed to RRT/CA calls. METHODS: A team of registered nurses reviewed the medical records of inpatients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction before or on admission and who died between March 13 (first Northwell Health inpatient expiration) and April 30, 2020, at 15 Northwell Health hospitals. The findings for these patients were abstracted into a database and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Of 2634 patients who died of COVID-19, 1478 (56.1%) had oxygen saturation levels ≥90% on presentation and required no respiratory support. At least one RRT/CA was called on 1112/2634 patients (42.2%) at a non-ICU level of care. Before the RRT/CA call, the most recent oxygen saturation levels for 852/1112 (76.6%) of these non-ICU patients were at least 90%. At the time the RRT/CA was called, 479/1112 patients (43.1%) had an oxygen saturation of <80%. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents one of the largest reviewed cohorts of mortality that also captures data in nonstructured fields. Approximately 50% of deaths occurred at a non-ICU level of care despite admission to the appropriate care setting with normal staffing. The data imply a sudden, unexpected deterioration in respiratory status requiring RRT/CA in a large number of non-ICU patients. Patients admitted at a non-ICU level of care suffered rapid clinical deterioration, often with a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation. These patients could benefit from additional monitoring (eg, continuous central oxygenation saturation), although this approach warrants further study.","Jarrett, Mark; Schultz, Susanne; Lyall, Julie; Wang, Jason; Stier, Lori; De Geronimo, Marcella; Nelson, Karen",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930099/; https://doi.org/10.2196/23565,53

We aimed to compare the age and weekly distribution of the five human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 that circulated in southeastern France. METHODS: We analyzed all available diagnoses of respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2 performed between 09/2013 and 05/2020 at University Hospital Institute Méditerranée Infection in Marseille, Southeastern France. RESULTS: For SARS-CoV-2, positive children <15 years of age represented 3.4% (228/6,735) of all positive cases, which is significantly less than for endemic coronaviruses (46.1%; 533/1,156; p < 0.001). Among 10,026 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses in 2020, children <15 years represented a significantly lower proportion of all positive cases for SARS-CoV-2 than for endemic coronaviruses [2.2% (24/1,067) vs 33.5% (149/445), respectively; p < 0.001]. Epidemic curves for endemic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in 91,722 patients showed comparable bell-shaped distributions with a slight time lag. In contrast, age distribution of endemic coronaviruses and 14 other respiratory viruses differed very significantly compared to that of SARS-CoV2, which was the only virus to spare children. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we observed for SARS-CoV-2 a temporal distribution resembling that of endemic coronaviruses and an age distribution that spares the youngest subjects who are those the most exposed to endemic coronaviruses.","Colson, Philippe; Esteves-Vieira, Vera; Giraud-Gatineau, Audrey; Zandotti, Christine; Filosa, Véronique; Chaudet, Hervé; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Raoult, Didier",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220321330; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.09.1417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32976991/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220321330?v=s5,53

The primary outcome was the composite of death or hospitalization related to Covid-19 infection. Secondary endpoints included Covid-19 related death, Covid-19 related hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, allcause mortality, cardiovascular (CV) mortality and healthcare compliance. Results Out of 891 patients included, twenty CAD patients (2.2%) had RT-PCR confirmed Covid-19 infection. Confirmed or suspect cases were evidenced in 48 patients (5.4%). Covid-19 patients showed lower left ventricular ejection fraction, were more frequently obese, less likely to smoke or follow lipid lowering therapy. The composite of death or hospitalization related to Covid-19 was 90%. Mortality rate was 30% among confirmed Covid-19 patients. Drugs’ discontinuation rate was low (1.1%) during the confinement. Reticence to consult a healthcare professional occurred in 6.4%. Postponement or cancellation of non-essential medical visits occurred in 15,7% (Table 1). Conclusions Coronary patients from a large French cluster of COVID-19 showed a high risk of Covid-19 infection and worse in-hospital outcomes.","Carmona, A.; Marchandot, B.; Matsushita, K.; Curtiaud, A.; Elidrissi, A.; Trimaille, A.; Kibler, M.; Cardi, T.; Heger, J.O.E.; Hess, S.; Reydel, A.; Fafi-Kremer, S.; Schini-Kerth, V.; Jesel, L.; Ohlmann, P.; Morel, O.",Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases Supplements,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878648020302081; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878648020302081,53

High-throughput next-generation sequencing has been used in characterizing the virome of different bat species. The cave nectar bat, Eonycteris spelaea, has a broad geographical range across Southeast Asia, India and southern China, however, little is known about their involvement in virus transmission. Here we investigate the diversity and abundance of viral communities from a colony of Eonycteris spelaea residing in Singapore. Our results detected 47 and 22 different virus families from bat fecal and urine samples, respectively. Among these, we identify a large number of virus families including Adenoviridae, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Polyomaviridae. In most cases, viral sequences from Eonycteris spelaea are genetically related to a group of bat viruses from other bat genera (e.g., Eidolon, Miniopterus, Rhinolophus and Rousettus). The results of this study improve our knowledge of the host range, spread and evolution of several important viral pathogens. More significantly, our findings provide a baseline to study the temporal patterns of virus shedding and how they correlate with bat phenological trends.","Mendenhall, Ian H; Wen, Dolyce Low Hong; Jayakumar, Jayanthi; Gunalan, Vithiagaran; Wang, Linfa; Mauer-Stroh, Sebastian; Su, Yvonne C.F.; Smith, Gavin J.D.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871070/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11030250,53

629396,Chapter 29 Role of Immune and Autoimmune Dysfunction in Schizophrenia,2016-12-31,"COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, which has infected over thirty eight million individuals worldwide. Emerging evidence indicates that COVID-19 patients are at a high risk of developing coagulopathy and thrombosis, conditions that elevate levels of D-dimer. It is believed that homocysteine, an amino acid that plays a crucial role in coagulation, may also contribute to these conditions. At present, multiple genes are implicated in the development of these disorders. For example, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FGG, FGA, and F5 mediate increases in D-dimer and SNPs in ABO, CBS, CPS1 and MTHFR mediate differences in homocysteine levels, and SNPs in TDAG8 associate with Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia. In this study, we aimed to uncover the genetic basis of the above conditions by examining genome-wide associations and tissue-specific gene expression to build a molecular network. Based on gene ontology, we annotated various SNPs with five ancestral terms: pulmonary embolism, venous thromboembolism, vascular diseases, cerebrovascular disorders, and stroke. The gene-gene interaction network revealed three clusters that each contained hallmark genes for D-dimer/fibrinogen levels, homocysteine levels, and arterial/venous thromboembolism with F2 and F5 acting as connecting nodes. We propose that genotyping COVID-19 patients for SNPs examined in this study will help identify those at greatest risk of complications linked to thrombosis.","Abu-Farha, Mohamed; Al-Sabah, Salman; Hammad, Maha M.; Hebbar, Prashantha; Channanath, Arshad Mohamed; John, Sumi Elsa; Taher, Ibrahim; Almaeen, Abdulrahman; Ghazy, Amany; Mohammad, Anwar; Abubaker, Jehad; Arefanian, Hossein; Al-Mulla, Fahd; Thanaraj, Thangavel Alphonse",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.587451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362545/,53

Objectives: The effect of Tocilizumab treatment on the composite outcome of ventilator free days, among critically ill SARS CoV 2 patients. Method: Retrospective observational propensity score matching study, comparing mechanically ventilated patients upon ICU admission who received Tocilizumab to a control group. Utilizing competing risk analysis method, and reporting subdistributional hazard ratio of a composite outcome of ventilator free days at day 28. Results: 29 patients in the intervention group were compared to 29 patients in the control group. Matched groups were similar at base line. The primary outcome of ventilator free days was higher in the intervention group (SHR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2 to 6.3; p = 0.02), crude ICU mortality rate was not different between Tocilizumab and control groups (37.9% versus 62% respectively, p = 0.1), actual ventilator free days were significantly longer in Tocilizumab group (mean difference 4.7 days, 95% CI 1.1 to 8.3; p = 0.02). Sensitivity analysis by Cox regression showed a significantly lower hazard ratio of death in Tocilizumab group (HR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.97; p = 0.04). While there was no difference in grown positive cultures among groups (55.2% in Tocilizumab group versus 34.5% in the control, 95% CI of difference: -7.11% to 54.4%; p = 0.1). Conclusion: Tocilizumab may improve the composite outcome of ventilator free days at day 28 among mechanically ventilated SARS-CoV-2 patients, it is associated with significantly longer actual ventilator free days, and insignificantly lower mortality and superinfection.","Mady, A.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Department of Defense (DoD) Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Pain Management Collaboratory (PMC) supports 11 large-scale, multisite, embedded pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) in military and veteran health systems. The PMC rapidly developed and enacted a plan to address key issues in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PMC tracked and collaborated in developing plans for addressing COVID-19 impacts across multiple domains and characterized the impact of COVID-19 on PCT operations, including delays in recruitment and revisions of study protocols. A harmonized participant questionnaire will facilitate later meta-analyses and cross-study comparisons of the impact of COVID-19 across all 11 PCTs. The pandemic has affected intervention delivery, outcomes, regulatory and ethics issues, participant recruitment, and study design. The PMC took concrete steps to ensure scientific rigor while encouraging flexibility in the PCTs, while paying close attention to minimizing the burden on research participants, investigators, and clinical care teams. Sudden changes in the delivery of pain management interventions will probably alter treatment effects measured via PMC PCTs. Through the use of harmonized instruments and surveys, we are capturing these changes and plan to monitor the impact on research practices, as well as on health outcomes.

634403,Beat the stress: breeding for climate resilience in maize for the tropical rainfed environments,2021-02-16,"Abstract Disease, whether it occurs in cats, cattle, caribou, or other species, is the manifestation of insult to the structural or functional integrity of the living being. Infection may occur with or without evidence of disease. Disease may represent only the “tip of the iceberg” of infection. Prevalence of disease is the proportion of a defined population that meets specific criteria at a point in time, and incidence refers to the proportion of a defined population in which the onset occurs during a specifiable interval. Risk is an instantaneous rate of incidence. Prevalence, incidence, and risk in infectious diseases are quantitative inferences derived from assessment of implications — caveats derived from variables that often are elusive, such as antibiotic resistance to plasmid mediated determinants transferable between species of enteric bacteria, or such as increases in population density among insect vectors influenced by climatic conditions favorable to the insects. Carefully orchestrated manipulation of the etiologic agent or the host response is made possible by ever-expanding understanding of the molecular biology of pathogenicity on the one hand and cellular and humoral immunity on the other. Such understanding often leads to new caveats or destroys old ones based on incomplete information. This paper deals with a selected limited number of infectious diseases of dairy cattle. Knowledge developed around the cited parameters in 13 infectious diseases during the past quarter century is brought into focus. Ten geographically dispersed specialists in infectious diseases of cattle were asked to identify priorities among the array of transmissible diseases important to North America.

And as for tech stocks, are they even less volatile than the market overall? In this paper, we provide evidence in favor of a “quietness” in the stock markets, interrupted by COVID-19, by analyzing dispersion, skewness and kurtosis characteristics of the empirical distribution of nine returns series that include individual FATANG stocks (FAANG: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google; plus Tesla) and US indices (S&P 500, DJIA and NASDAQ). In comparison with the years before, the daily average return after COVID-19 was 6.48, 2.58 and 2.34 times higher for Tesla, Apple and NASDAQ, respectively. In terms of volatility, the increase was more pronounced in the three stock indices when compared to the individual FATANG stocks. This paper also puts forward a new methodology based on semi-variance and semi-kurtosis. While the value of the ratio between semi-kurtosis and kurtosis is always higher than 70% for the three US stock indices, in the case of stocks the opposite is true, which highlights the importance of large positive returns when compared to negative ones. Structural breaks and conditional heteroskedasticity are also analyzed by considering the traditional symmetrical and asymmetrical GARCH models. We show that in the most recent past, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the FATANG tech stocks are characterized mostly by conditional homoskedasticity, while the returns of US stock indices are characterized mainly by conditional heteroskedasticity.","Curto, José Dias",Nonlinear Dyn,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11071-021-06535-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075278/,53

In a pandemic, providers may need such support but with the high risk of exposure, such a program is offered only virtually. The research is scant for traditional post‐disaster support and non‐existent for virtual; therefore, by using related research this discussion considers the likelihood of providers accessing and benefiting from this program. The virtual platform is heralded as the responsible way to provide support in a pandemic but this standard may be ineffective and is inherently inequitable. As a global event, pandemics require containment strategies applicable on an international level; therefore, psychosocial support should also be developed with an international audience in mind. Online psychosocial support falls short of being such a strategy as it incorrectly assumes global internet access. Many low‐income areas such as Sub‐Saharan Africa will need support strategies which compliment local frontline staff and fit with community‐driven initiatives, whereas wealthier countries may use a combination of onsite and online support.

We concluded that the epidemic is containable with traditional nonpharmacological interventions, mainly through social distancing and finding and isolating suspected patients and close contacts. Nonpharmacological interventions are the only effective measures currently accessible and have suppressed some 90% of the infections in China. Close contacts are the major mechanism of transmission, which makes it possible to control this epidemic through nonpharmacological methods. Nucleic-acid testing alone may miss some 50% of infected patients, and other methods such as chest computerized tomography (CT) or serology should be considered to supplement molecular testing.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidents of negative bias and microaggressions against Asian Americans have also increased. COVID-19 is directly linked to China, not just in terms of the origins of the disease, but also in the coverage of it.

639270,Highlights from this issue,2020-06-06,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is spreading globally at an unprecedented rate. To protect the world against this devastating catastrophe, vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been produced following consistent clinical trials. However, the durability of a protective immune response due to vaccination has not been confirmed. Moreover, COVID-19 vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is not 100% guaranteed, as new variants arise due to mutations. Consequently, health officials are pleading with the public to take extra precautions against the virus and continue wearing masks, wash hands, and observe physical distancing even after vaccination. The current research collected data from 4,540 participants (1,825 vaccinated and 2,715 not vaccinated) in China to analyze this phenomenon empirically. The propensity score matching (PSM) model is employed to analyze the impact of vaccination against COVID-19 on participants' attitudes toward protective countermeasures. The findings showed that gender, age, education level, occupation risk, individual health risk perception, public health risk perception, social responsibility, peer effect, and government supervision are the main drivers for participants to be vaccinated with COVID-19's vaccines. The results further show that vaccination lessened participants' frequency of hand washing by 1.75 times and their compliance frequency intensity of observing physical distancing by 1.24 times. However, the rate of mask-wearing did not reduce significantly, implying that China's main countermeasure of effective mask-wearing effectively controls COVID-19. Moreover, the findings indicate that a reduction in the frequency of hand washing and observing physical distance could cause a resurgence of COVID-19. In conclusion, factors leading to the eradication of SARS-CoV-2 from the world are complex to be achieved, so the exploration of COVID-19 vaccination and people's attitude toward protective countermeasures may provide insights for policymakers to encourage vaccinated people to follow protective health measures and help in completely defeating the COVID-19 from the globe.","Si, Ruishi; Yao, Yumeng; Zhang, Xueqian; Lu, Qian; Aziz, Noshaba",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.702699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368065/,53

However, the factors leading to lung pathology are not well understood. Using mice infected with SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)-CoV, we show that robust virus replication accompanied by delayed type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling orchestrates inflammatory responses and lung immunopathology with diminished survival. IFN-I remains detectable until after virus titers peak but early IFN-I administration ameliorates immunopathology. This delayed IFN-I signaling promotes the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages (IMMs), resulting in elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels, vascular leakage and impaired virus-specific T cell responses. Genetic ablation of the IFN-αβ receptor (IFNAR) or IMM depletion protects mice from lethal infection, without affecting viral load. These results demonstrate that IFN-I and IMM promote lethal SARS-CoV infection and identify IFN-I and IMMs as potential therapeutic targets in patients infected with pathogenic coronavirus and perhaps other respiratory viruses.","Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Fehr, Anthony R; Vijay, Rahul; Mack, Matthias; Zhao, Jincun; Meyerholz, David K; Perlman, Stanley",Cell Host & Microbe,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2016.01.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26867177/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312816300063; http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312816300063/pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312816300063,53

As the SARS-CoV2 pandemic unfolded, many professional subspecialty organizations released practice guidelines in order to minimize transmission of COVID-19 and protect vulnerable populations. The impact of modifications to traditional gynecologic cancer treatment is not known. Here, we describe the impact of the SARS-COV2 pandemic on chemotherapy practices for gynecologic cancer during the pandemic surge. Methods: We identified patients age 18 or older at Montefiore Medical Center who had a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of gynecologic cancer and received care between March 16, 2020 and June 7, 2020; these dates reflect a series of executive orders issued by the Governor of New York allowing the State Commissioner of Health to cancel elective procedures at hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. Clinical data were abstracted from patients’ charts. Patients with incomplete treatment records were excluded. Results: A total of 146 women who were included to whom 169 cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapy were delivered during the study period and 68 women (46.6%) received at least one cycle of chemotherapy. Nine patients screened positive for symptoms of COVID or active infection during the study period. Among patients receiving chemotherapy, 52.9% (n=36) had modifications to traditional cancer treatment as a result of state and institutional regulations. Dose reduction was the leading pandemic-related treatment modification and occurred in 69.4% of patients (n=25). Other treatment modifications included prophylactic use of pegfilgrastim (n=1), and treatment deferral or delay (n=7). Women receiving a platinum-based doublet (n=36) during the study period were more likely to sustain dose reduction in chemotherapy (25%) compared to patients undergoing other regimens (0%). A total of 111 women received at least one dose of disease-modifying therapy during the cohort period including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, anti-angiogenesis agents, hormonal therapy, PARP inhibitors, or investigational agents. Treatments were most often discontinued due to completion of adjuvant therapy (n=5), progression of disease (n=4), or toxicity (n=5). Notably 5 patients chose to defer therapy in the setting of the pandemic surge. Only one patient was identified as receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy specifically due to COVID pandemic-related restrictions. Conclusions: The SARS-COV2 pandemic has led to modification of current standard chemotherapy delivery for gynecologic malignancies with the shared goal of protecting the most vulnerable populations from COVID infection. The impact of these modifications on cancer specific outcomes is not yet known. Future investigation will focus on identifying whether treatment modification to circumvent iatrogenic immunosuppression compromises oncologic outcomes.","Gabor, Lisa; Gowthaman, Divya; Gressel, Gregory; Kuo, Dennis Yi-Shin; Nevadunsky, Nicole; Bansal, Nisha",Gynecologic Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0090-8258(21)01217-8; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090825821012178; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090825821012178,53

The aim of our study was to explore this relationship with dexamethasone therapy. METHODS: We prospectively studied two cohorts of hospitalized Covid‐19 patients between March and April and between September and December 2020 (n = 192). Patients were tested for serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25‐OH‐D) levels during admission. The first cohort not treated with dexamethasone (n = 107) was divided into vitamin D deficient (25‐OH‐D ≤ 30 nmol/L) (n = 47) and replete subgroups (25‐OH‐D > 30 nmol/L) (n = 60). The second cohort treated with dexamethasone (n = 85) was similarly divided into deficient (25‐OH‐D ≤ 30 nmol/L) (n = 27) and replete subgroups (25‐OH‐D > 30 nmol/L) (n = 58). Primary outcome was in‐hospital mortality and secondary outcomes were elevation in markers of cytokine storm and ventilatory requirement. RESULTS: No mortality difference was identified between cohorts and subgroups. The “no dexamethasone” cohort 25‐OH‐D deplete subgroup recorded significantly higher peak d‐Dimer levels (1874 vs. 1233 µgFEU/L) (p = 0.0309), CRP (177 vs. 107.5) (p = 0.0055), and ventilatory support requirement (25.5% vs. 6.67%) (p = 0.007) compared to the replete subgroup. Among the 25‐OH‐D deplete subgroup higher peak neutrophil counts, peak CRP, peak LDH, peak ferritin, and lower trough lymphocyte counts were observed, without statistical significance. In the “dexamethasone” cohort, there was no apparent association between 25‐OH‐D deficiency and markers of cytokine storm or ventilatory requirement. Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with elevated markers of cytokine storm and higher ventilatory requirements in hospitalized Covid‐19 patients. Dexamethasone treatment appears to mitigate adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency.","Wenban, Charlotte; Heer, Randeep S.; Baktash, Vadir; Kandiah, Pirabakaran; Katsanouli, Theodora; Pandey, Asmita; Goindoo, Ryan; Ajaz, Afiyah; Van den Abbeele, Koenraad; Mandal, Amit K.

This study was conducted to assess patterns and severity of COVID-19 pulmonary disease based on radiological imaging. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in a large tertiary care public sector teaching hospital of Karachi, Pakistan from June 2020 till August 2020. All confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients referred for chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated along with RT-PCR results. Suspected patients were followed for RT-PCR. Radiological features and severity of imaging studies were determined. RESULTS: Of 533 patients in whom X-rays were performed, majority had severe/critical findings, i.e., 304 (57.03%). Of 97 patients in whom CT scan was performed, mild/moderate findings were observed in 63 (64.94%) patients. Of 472 patients with abnormal X-rays, majority presented with alveolar pattern 459 (97.2%), bilateral lung involvement 453 (89.6%), and consolidation 356 (75.4%). Moreover, lobar predominance showed lower zone preponderance in 446 (94.5%) patients. Of 88 patients with abnormal CT findings, ground-glass opacity (GGO) 87 (98.9%) and crazy paving 69 (78.4%) were the most common findings. An insignificantly higher association of PCR positive cases was observed with severe/critical X-rays (p-value 0.076) and CT scan findings (p-value 0.431).

The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological and emotional well-being of healthcare workers (HCWs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an online, cross-sectional, multinational survey, assessing anxiety [using Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Scale: GAD-2 and GAD-7], depression (using Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), and insomnia (using Insomnia Severity Index Scale), among HCWs across India, the Middle East, and North America. We used univariate and bivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for psychological distress. RESULTS: The prevalence of clinically significant anxiety, depression, and insomnia was 41.4%, 48.0%, and 31.3%, respectively. On bivariate logistic regression, lack of social or emotional support to HCWs was independently associated with anxiety [odds ratio (OR), 3.81 (2.84–3.90)], depression [OR, 6.29 (4.50–8.79)], and insomnia [OR, 3.79 (2.81–5.110]. Female gender and self-COVID-19 were independent risk factors for anxiety [OR, 3.71 (1.53–9.03) and 1.71 (1.23–2.38)] and depression [OR, 1.72 (1.27–2.31) and 1.62 (1.14–2.30)], respectively. Frontliners were independently associated with insomnia [OR, 1.68 (1.23–2.29)]. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among HCWs. Female gender, frontliners, self-COVID-19, and absence of social or emotional support are the independent risk factors for psychological distress.

650875,Digital pathology in academia: Implementation and impact,2021,"PURPOSE: Approximately two thirds of the tonnage of antibiotics sold in the United States are intended for use in food production, and global use is projected to increase. This review summarizes the rationale for antibiotic use in animal agriculture, therapeutic classes used, risks from antibiotic-resistant organisms, and limits of existing regulation. In addition, opportunities for improved surveillance, stewardship, and advocacy will be highlighted. METHODS: A transdisciplinary narrative review of drivers of antibiotics in food production was conducted, including concepts from population health, infectious diseases, veterinary medicine, and consumer advocacy. FINDINGS: Globally, antibiotics of many important classes in human medicine are given to animals for the treatment of a diagnosed illness, disease control and prevention, and growth promotion. Extensive antibiotic use on farms drives the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms in food-producing animals, which can be transmitted to people and the environment. Antibiotic stewardship in food production has been associated with decreased rates of resistance in both animals and humans, without reducing farm productivity. Multiple European nations have successfully implemented stewardship strategies, including banning uses for disease prevention, benchmarking antibiotic utilization, and setting national reduction targets. In the United States, medically important antibiotics are no longer permitted for growth promotion; however, antibiotics may be prescribed for other indications with limited veterinary oversight and requirements for reporting. Marked reductions in use have been achieved in the poultry industry, although use in the pork and beef industries remain high. IMPLICATIONS: Despite some progress, significant challenges in surveillance and regulatory oversight remain to prevent the overuse of antibiotics in food production. Consumers remain a potent force via market pressure on grocery stores, restaurants, suppliers, and farmers. Improved, verified labelling is important for informing consumer choices. Numerous public health agencies, consumer groups, and professional societies have called for judicious antibiotic use, but increased direct advocacy from health care professionals is needed.","Patel, Sameer J.; Wellington, Matthew; Shah, Rohan M.; Ferreira, Matthew J.",Clin Ther,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149291820303386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32819723/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.07.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291820303386,53

However, there is a lack of first-hand data on i) comparative efficacy of various treatment processes for SARS-CoV-2 RNA removal; and ii) temporal variations in the removal efficacy of a given treatment process in the backdrop of active COVID-19 cases. This work provides a comparative account of the removal efficacy of conventional activated sludge (CAS) and root zone treatments (RZT) based on weekly wastewater surveillance data, consisting of forty-four samples, during a two-month period. The average genome concentration was higher in the inlets of CAS-based wastewater treatment plant in the Sargasan ward (1.25 x 103 copies/ L), than that of RZT plant (7.07 x 102 copies/ L) in an academic institution campus of Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. ORF 1ab and S genes appeared to be more sensitive to treatment i.e., significantly reduced (p <0.05) than N genes (p>0.05). CAS treatment exhibited better RNA removal efficacy (p=0.014) than RZT (p=0.032). Multivariate analyses suggested that the effective genome concentration should be calculated based on the presence/absence of multiple genes. The present study stresses that treated effluents are not always free from SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the removal efficacy of a given WWTPs is prone to exhibit temporal variability owing to variations in active COVID-19 cases in the vicinity and genetic material accumulation over the time. Disinfection seems less effective than the adsorption and coagulation processes for SARS-CoV-2 removal. Results stress the need for further research on mechanistic insight on SARS-CoV-2 removal through various treatment processes taking solid-liquid partitioning into account.","Kumar, M.; Joshi, M.; Kuroda, K.; Bhattacharya, P.; Barcello, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.09.21256898v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.09.21256898,53

655455,The WHO we want,2020-06-05,"The threat of the COVID-19 pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus has grown since its start late last year. A customary response to a surge of a communicable disease is to separate healthcare systems into cohorts, such that patients with other conditions can be treated safely without risk of infection. A challenge with COVID-19 is the existence of currently asymptomatic infections, which without aggressive testing and isolation might enter the non-COVID-19 cohort either through unknowingly infected patients or health care workers. Using stochastic simulations we study the impacts of testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. In the base case without testing or PPE, healthcare is rapidly overwhelmed, and becomes a net contributor to the force of infection. We find that effective use of PPE by both HCW and patients can prevent this situation, while testing alone is less effective. We also find that even imperfectly effective use of PPE can provide substantial protection and decrease the force of infection.

To further explore the relationship between obesity and critical illness in COVID‐19, the association of BMI with baseline demographic and intensive care unit (ICU) parameters, laboratory values, and outcomes in a critically ill patient cohort was examined. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the first 277 consecutive patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital ICUs with laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 were examined. BMI class, initial ICU laboratory values, physiologic characteristics including gas exchange and ventilatory mechanics, and ICU interventions as clinically available were measured. Mortality, length of ICU admission, and duration of mechanical ventilation were also measured. RESULTS: There was no difference found in respiratory system compliance or oxygenation between patients with and without obesity. Patients without obesity had higher initial ferritin and D‐dimer levels than patients with obesity. Standard acute respiratory distress syndrome management, including prone ventilation, was equally distributed between BMI groups. There was no difference found in outcomes between BMI groups, including 30‐ and 60‐day mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation.

METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study conducted at the Prince Mohammed International Airport in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia between August and September 2014. Data were collected by semi-structured questionnaires during personal interviews. Non-random purposive sampling was conducted to target workers at higher risk of acquiring infection from travellers. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-six participants were recruited of whom 92.5% were males. The study participants were workers in 8 different sectors. Twenty-six percent of the participants were health workers. Non-health workers were more likely to be concerned on acquiring infection while working at the airport compared with health workers (p=0.023). The most commonly feared disease was Ebola viral disease (EBV) among 30% of health workers, and 47% of non-health workers. Approximately 47% of non-health workers reported no knowledge of the procedures implemented during public health emergencies. The proportion of participants who received public health related training among non-health workers was significantly lower compared with health workers (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION: More emphasis should be given to educating airport workers on the potential health threats at the airport.

Educational videos of LSGs are available from online sources with YouTube® being the most popular online video repository. However, due to the unrestricted and uncontrolled nature of YouTube®, anyone can upload videos without peer review or standardization. The LAP-VEGaS guidelines were formed to guide the production of high-quality surgical videos. The aim of this study is to use the LAP-VEGaS guidelines to determine if videos of LSGs available on Youtube® are of an acceptable standard for surgical educational purposes. METHODS: A YouTube® search was performed using the term laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Appropriate videos were analysed by two individuals using the sixteen LAP-VEGaS guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 575 videos were found, of which 202 videos were included and analysed using the LAP-VEGaS guidelines. The median video guideline score was 6/16 with 89% of videos meeting less than half of all guidelines. There was no correlation between the LAP-VEGaS score and view count. CONCLUSIONS: There is an abundance of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy educational videos available on YouTube®; however, when analysed using the LAP-VEGaS guidelines, the majority do not meet acceptable educational standards for surgical training purposes.","Chapman, David; Weaver, Abigail; Sheikh, Laila; MacCormick, Andrew D.; Poole, Garth",Obes Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-04876-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734567/,53

PDCoV has been successfully isolated using various medium additives including trypsin, and although we know it is important for viral replication, the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here, we systematically investigated the role of trypsin in PDCoV replication including cell entry, cell-to-cell membrane fusion and virus release. Using pseudovirus entry assays, we demonstrated that PDCoV entry is not trypsin dependent. Furthermore, unlike porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), in which trypsin is important for the release of virus from infected cells, PDCoV release was not affected by trypsin. We also demonstrated that trypsin promotes PDCoV replication by enhancing cell-to-cell membrane fusion. Most importantly, our study illustrates two distinct spreading patterns from infected cells to uninfected cells during PDCoV transmission, and the role of trypsin in PDCoV replication in cells with different virus spreading types. Overall, these results clarify that trypsin promotes PDCoV replication by mediating cell-to-cell fusion transmission but is not crucial for viral entry. This knowledge can potentially contribute to improvement of virus production efficiency in culture, not only for vaccine preparation but also to develop antiviral treatments.","Yang, Yue-Lin; Meng, Fandan; Qin, Pan; Herrler, Georg; Huang, Yao-Wei; Tang, Yan-Dong",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32090689/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1730245,53

However, the situation is more complex for nations where malaria is endemic, as they now have the additional burden of COVID-19. In such nations, the healthcare systems are either in the preparatory or containment phase of the current pandemic. This enforced, sudden, and sharp public health refocus is likely to result in the disruption of annual malaria control activities such as distribution of insecticide-impregnated bed nets, indoor residual spraying of insecticide, maintenance of malaria surveillance, and mass provision of antimalarial drugs. Nonetheless, we feel that the best facets of COVID-19 public health management can become new guiding principles in malaria-endemic countries to improve malaria control and hasten malaria elimination. Redirection against malaria of the best public health initiatives used in COVID-19 containment could fast-track the global goal of a malaria-free world.

Improving awareness about NTDs is a powerful affordable long-term intervention for infection control. In literature, there is a limited number of studies in the developing countries assessing the awareness of healthcare providers regarding these diseases. The present study aimed at assessing the awareness of a sample of Cairo University medical and nursing students regarding NTDs. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 184 medical and nursing students in Cairo University. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire in English language with an estimated completion time of 15 minutes was used for evaluation. It included question categories which cover the knowledge about NTDs and control measures as well as the willingness to participate in NTDs control activities. Content analysis was performed on the materials and specifications of the epidemiology course given to medical and nursing students. Out of the study participants, 26% knew the meaning of NTDs. The main source of their knowledge was social media followed by the epidemiology course. A percentage of 33% of the students agreed that NTDs are of public health importance in Egypt. Thirty four percent of the participants expressed their willingness to participate in control activities for NTDs. Comparing medical and nursing students, a higher percentage of the nursing students stated that NTDs are causing a public health problem in Egypt with a statistically significant difference (P value < 0.001), while a statistically significant higher percentage of medical students believed that the awareness level regarding NTDs in Egypt is low (P value = 0.002). Cairo University medical and nursing students in this study showed a gap in the level of knowledge regarding NTDs and their control activities which represents a great threat to the control of these diseases.","Elfar, Eman; Asem, Noha; Yousof, Hanaa",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206641/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008826,53

An Analysis of FDA Drug Approvals from the Perspective of Molecules,2021-01-25,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection leads to NF-κB activation and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, though the underlying mechanism for this activation is not fully understood. Our results reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 protein contributes to the viral activation of NF-κB signaling. Nsp14 caused the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Nsp14 induced the upregulation of IL-6 and IL-8, which also occurred in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. IL-8 upregulation was further confirmed in lung tissue samples from COVID-19 patients. A previous proteomic screen identified the putative interaction of Nsp14 with host Inosine-5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) protein, which is known to regulate NF-κB signaling. We confirmed the Nsp14-IMPDH2 protein interaction and found that IMPDH2 knockdown or chemical inhibition using ribavirin (RIB) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) abolishes Nsp14-mediated NF-κB activation and cytokine induction. Furthermore, IMDPH2 inhibitors (RIB, MPA) efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that IMDPH2, and possibly NF-κB signaling, is beneficial to viral replication. Overall, our results identify a novel role of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 in causing the activation of NF-κB.","Li, Taiwei; Kenney, Adam D.; Liu, Helu; Fiches, Guillaume N.; Zhou, Dawei; Biswas, Ayan; Que, Jianwen; Santoso, Netty; Yount, Jacob S.; Zhu, Jian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.26.445787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075374/,53

However, how socioenvironmental factors affect mental health (stress and anxiety) during COVID-19 in developing countries is poorly understood, and so far, too few scholarly works have been accomplished focusing these countries. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the role of socioenvironmental factors on mental health of people during COVID-19 in the costal urban areas of Bangladesh, where we contemplate Composite COVID Stress Index (CCSI) and COVID Anxiety Scale (CAS) for analyzing mental health. Applying a cross-sectional web-based survey, 115 respondents were considered for this study. As analytical tools- Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Weighted Least Square (WLS) were applied, along with descriptive statistics. The results advocate that agitation, scarcity, trauma, and infodemic altogether affect the degree of stress during COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, a number of socioenvironmental factors namely agitation, scarcity, infodemic, age, literacy level, living condition (in terms of settlement type), source of drinking water, security status (in terms of criminal activity), and number of ailments significantly affect the degree of coronavirus triggered anxiety during the pandemic for the respondents.

PURPOSE: To describe the time course and severity of the CXR findings of COVID-19 and correlate these with real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of COVID-19 patients with RT-PCR confirmation and CXRs admitted across 4 hospitals evaluated between January and March 2020. Baseline and serial CXRs (total 255 CXRs) were reviewed along with RT-PCRs. Correlation with concurrent CTs (total 28 CTs) was made when available. Two radiologists scored each CXR in consensus for: consolidation, ground glass opacity (GGO), location and pleural fluid. A severity index was determined for each lung. The lung scores were summed to produce the final severity score. RESULTS: There were 64 patients (26 men, mean age 56±19 years). Of these, 58, 44 and 38 patients had positive initial RT-PCR (91%, [CI: 81-96%]), abnormal baseline CXR (69%, [CI: 56-80%]) and positive initial RT-PCR with abnormal baseline CXR (59 [CI:46-71%]) respectively. Six patients (9%) showed CXR abnormalities before eventually testing positive on RT-PCR. Sensitivity of initial RT-PCR (91% [95% CI: 83-97%]) was higher than baseline CXR (69% [95% CI: 56-80%]) (p = 0.009). Radiographic (mean 6 ± 5 days) and virologic recovery (mean 8 ± 6 days) were not significantly different (p= 0.33). Consolidation was the most common finding (30/64, 47%), followed by GGO (21/64, 33%). CXR abnormalities had a peripheral (26/64, 41%) and lower zone distribution (32/64, 50%) with bilateral involvement (32/64, 50%). Pleural effusion was uncommon (2/64, 3%). The severity of CXR findings peaked at 10-12 days from the date of symptom onset.

RESULTS: 538 COVID-19 patients were finally included in this study, of whom 492 were nondiabetes and 46 were diabetes. The median age was 47 years (IQR 35.0-56.0). And the elderly patients with diabetes were more likely to have dry cough, and the alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, Ca, and mean hemoglobin recovery rate were higher than the other groups. Furthermore, we also found the liver and kidney function of male patients was worse than that of female patients, while female cases should be paid more attention to the occurrence of bleeding and electrolyte disorders. Moreover, advance age, blood glucose, gender, prothrombin time, and total cholesterol could be considered as risk factors for COVID-19 patients with diabetes through the multivariable logistic regression model in our study. CONCLUSION: The potential risk factors found in our study showed a major piece of the complex puzzle linking diabetes and COVID-19 infection.

Where we are faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity of a rapid diagnosis has felt more than ever. In the current interdisciplinary study, we have proposed, developed, and characterized a state-of-the-art liquid cooling design to accelerate the PCR procedure. A numerical simulation approach is utilized to evaluate 15 different cross-sections of the microchannel heat sink and select the best shape to achieve this goal. Also, crucial heat sink parameters are characterized, e.g., heat transfer coefficient, pressure drop, performance evaluation criteria, and fluid flow. The achieved result showed that the circular cross-section is the most efficient shape for the microchannel heat sink, which has a maximum heat transfer enhancement of 25% compared to the square shape at the Reynolds number of 1150. In the next phase of the study, the circular cross-section microchannel is located below the PCR device to evaluate the cooling rate of the PCR. Also, the results demonstrate that it takes 16.5 s to cool saliva samples in the PCR well, which saves up to 157.5 s for the whole amplification procedure compared to the conventional air fans. Another advantage of using the microchannel heat sink is that it takes up a little space compared to other common cooling methods.","Alihosseini, Yousef; Azaddel, Mohammad Reza; Moslemi, Sahel; Mohammadi, Mehdi; Pormohammad, Ali; Targhi, Mohammad Zabetian; Heyhat, Mohammad Mahdi",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95446-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373493/,53

We employed cDNA microarray analysis to characterize the cellular transcriptional responses of homologous human genes at 12 h post-infection. Seventy mRNA transcripts belonging to various functional classes exhibited significant alterations in gene expression. There was considerable induction of heat shock proteins that are crucial to the immune response mechanism. Modified levels of several transcripts involved in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes exemplified the balance between opposing forces during SARS pathogenesis. Other genes displaying altered transcription included those associated with host translation, cellular metabolism, cell cycle, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, protein trafficking, protein modulators, and cytoskeletal proteins. Alterations in the levels of several novel transcripts encoding hypothetical proteins and expressed sequence tags were also identified. In addition, transcription of apoptosis-related genes DENN and hIAP1 was upregulated in contrast to FAIM. Elevated Mx1 expression signified a strong host response to mediate antiviral resistance. Also expressed in infected cells was the C-terminal alternative splice variant of the p53 tumor suppressor gene encoding a modified truncated protein that can influence the activity of wild-type p53.

The envelope glycoproteins of HCV are heavily glycosylated with a high proportion of high-mannose glycans (HMGs), which serve as a shield against neutralizing antibodies and assist in the interaction with cell-entry receptors. However, there is no approved therapeutic targeting this potentially druggable biomarker. Methods The anti-HCV activity of AvFc was evaluated through the use of in vitro neutralization assays as well as an in vivo challenge in the PXB chimeric human liver mouse model. Drug toxicity was assessed by histopathology, serum ALT, and mouse body weights. Results AvFc was capable of neutralizing cell culture-derived HCV in a genotype-independent manner, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. Systemic administration of AvFc in a histidine-based buffer was well tolerated; after 11 doses every other day at 25 mg/kg there were no significant changes in body or liver weights or in blood human albumin or serum ALT activity. Gross necropsy and liver pathology confirmed the lack of toxicity. This regimen successfully prevented genotype 1a HCV infection in all animals, while an AvFc mutant lacking HMG binding activity failed. Conclusion These results suggest that targeting envelope HMGs is a promising therapeutic approach against HCV infection, and AvFc may provide a safe and efficacious means to prevent recurrent infection upon liver transplantation in HCV-related end-stage liver disease patients.","Dent, Matthew; Hamorsky, Krystal; Vausselin, Thibaut; Dubuisson, Jean; Miyata, Yoshinari; Morikawa, Yoshio; Matoba, Nobuyuki",Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmgh.2020.08.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352345X20301338; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352345X20301338?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32861832/,53

Progress in CRISPR–Cas technology has also advanced molecular detection of diverse targets, ranging from nucleic acids to proteins. Incorporating CRISPR–Cas systems with various nucleic acid amplification strategies enables the generation of amplified detection signals, enrichment of low-abundance molecular targets, improvements in analytical specificity and sensitivity, and development of point-of-care (POC) diagnostic techniques. These systems take advantage of various Cas proteins for their particular features, including RNA-guided endonuclease activity, sequence-specific recognition, multiple turnover trans-cleavage activity of Cas12 and Cas13, and unwinding and nicking ability of Cas9. Integrating a CRISPR–Cas system after nucleic acid amplification improves detection specificity due to RNA-guided recognition of specific sequences of amplicons. Incorporating CRISPR–Cas before nucleic acid amplification enables enrichment of rare and low-abundance nucleic acid targets and depletion of unwanted abundant nucleic acids. Unwinding of dsDNA to ssDNA using CRISPR–Cas9 at a moderate temperature facilitates techniques for achieving isothermal exponential amplification of nucleic acids. A combination of CRISPR–Cas systems with functional nucleic acids (FNAs) and molecular translators enables the detection of non-nucleic acid targets, such as proteins, metal ions, and small molecules. Successful integrations of CRISPR technology with nucleic acid amplification techniques result in highly sensitive and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 pandemic.","Feng, Wei; Newbigging, Ashley M.; Tao, Jeffrey; Cao, Yiren; Peng, Hanyong; Le, Connie; Wu, Jinjun; Pang, Bo; Li, Juan; Tyrrell, D.

662768,Pneumonia,2019-11-29,"BACKGROUND: The lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic created major obstacles for individuals with disabilities to obtain support in their daily living. OBJECTIVES: This study was to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of US individuals with mobility and/or self-care disabilities during the pandemic. METHODS: From a nationally representative longitudinal survey (n = 6403) administered during the pandemic, individuals were classified at baseline as having no mobility/self-care disability (ADL = 0, n = 4975), mobility or self-care disability (ADL = 1, n = 1061), and both mobility and self-care disabilities (ADL = 2, n = 367). Weighted mean of baseline mental distress scores (PHQ4), psychological risk factors (loneliness, stress, perceived COVID risk), resilience, and coping were compared among these groups. Random effects models were employed to assess the effects of disability and disability-moderated effects of risk factors on mental distress. RESULTS: At baseline, mental distress increased with greater ADL disabilities (Mean [95%CI] = 1.88 [1.77, 1.98], 2.54 [2.29, 2.79], and 3.55 [3.01, 4.08] for ADL = 0, 1, and 2, respectively, p < .0001). Stress, loneliness, and perceived risk increased with ADL disabilities, but resilience and social coping decreased with it (p's < 0.0001). Greater ADL disabilities, higher psychological risks, alcohol coping, use of cannabis and other recreational drugs were associated with greater mental distress. Greater ADL disabilities augmented the detrimental effects of risk factors on mental health, but resilience protected mental health both independently and through a buffering effect on its risk factors across all groups. CONCLUSION: Individuals with mobility and/or self-care disability tend to have poorer mental health and are differentially more affected by its risk factors. Mental health professionals should address these modifiable factors in interventions.","Ling, Na; Lixia, Yang",Disabil Health J,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936657421001898?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1936657421001898; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34649808/,53

Regional and speciality specific data is important to guide this decision-making process. This study aimed to review 30-day mortality for all patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery during the peak of the pandemic within our region. METHODS: This multicentre study reviewed data on all patients undergoing trauma and orthopaedic surgery in a region from 18 March 2020 to 27 April 2020. Information was collated from regional databases. Patients were COVID-19-positive if they had positive laboratory testing and/or imaging consistent with the infection. 30-day mortality was assessed for all patients. Secondly, 30-day mortality in fracture neck of femur patients was compared to the same time period in 2019. RESULTS: Overall, 496 operations were carried out in 484 patients. The overall 30-day mortality was 1.9%. Seven out of nine deceased patients underwent surgery for a fractured neck of femur. In all, 27 patients contracted COVID-19 in the peri-operative period; of these, four patients died within 30 days (14.8%). In addition, 21 of the 27 patients in this group had a fractured neck of femur, 22 were over the age of 70 years (81.5%). Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade > 3 and/or age > 75 years were at significantly higher risk of death if they contracted COVID-19 within the study period. CONCLUSION: Overall 30-day postoperative mortality in trauma and orthopaedic surgery patients remains low at 1.9%. There was no 30-day mortality in patients ASA 1 or 2. Patients with significant comorbidities, increasing age, and ASA 3 or above remain at the highest risk. For patients with COVID-19 infection, postoperative 30-day mortality was 14.8%. The reintroduction of elective services should consider individual patient risk profile (including for ASA grade). Effective postoperative strategies should also be employed to try and reduce postoperative exposure to the virus.

Further monitoring of the disease prognosis and effective control of the ""relapse"" of the epidemic become the next focus of work. To analyse the clinical prognosis of discharged COVID‐19 patients by monitoring their SAR‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid status, which may provide evidence to establish discharge standards and follow‐up management for COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: We included 13 discharged COVID‐19 patients who were quarantined for 4‐week at home. The patient's daily clinical signs were recorded and sputum and faecal specimens were regularly sent for the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid. RESULTS: The time between initial symptoms and meeting discharge criteria was 18 – 44 days with an average of 25 ± 6 days. The faecal samples of two patients still tested positive after meeting discharge criteria and the sputum samples of four patients returned positive 5 – 14 days after discharge. The rate of a recurring positive test result in samples from the respiratory system was 31%(4/13). CONCLUSION: Under the present discharge criteria, the high presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid in faecal and respiratory samples of discharged COVID‐19 patients indicate potential infectivity. Therefore, we suggest that faecal virus nucleic acid should be tested as a routine monitoring index for COVID‐19 and a negative result be added to the criteria. Simultaneously, we should strengthen the regular follow‐up of discharged patients with continuous monitoring of the recurrence of viral nucleic acid. This article is protected by copyright.

The purpose of this study was to determine risk factors for mortality and the impact of anti-inflammatory therapies on survival. AIM: To determine the impact of various therapies on outcomes in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients with a focus on anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating agents. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 261 patients admitted or transferred to the intensive care unit in two community hospitals between March 12, 2020 and June 17, 2020. Totally 167 patients received glucocorticoid (GC) therapy. Seventy-three patients received GC alone, 94 received GC and tocilizumab, 28 received tocilizumab monotherapy, and 66 received no anti-inflammatory therapy. RESULTS: Patient survival was associated with GC use, either alone or with tocilizumab, and decreased vasopressor requirements. Delayed administration of GC was found to decrease the survival benefit of GC therapy. No difference in survival was found with varying anticoagulant doses, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab monotherapy; prone ventilation, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or intravenous ascorbic acid use. CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrated the survival benefit associated with anti-inflammatory therapy of GC, with or without tocilizumab, with the combination providing the most benefit.

666192,Revisiting nature: a review of iridoids as a potential antileishmanial class,2021-03-16,"Natural human exhalation flows such as coughing, sneezing and breathing can be considered as ‘jet-like’ airflows in the sense that they are produced from a single source in a single exhalation effort, with a relatively symmetrical, conical geometry. Although coughing and sneezing have garnered much attention as potential, explosive sources of infectious aerosols, these are relatively rare events during daily life, whereas breathing is necessary for life and is performed continuously. Real-time shadowgraph imaging was used to visualise and capture high-speed images of healthy volunteers sneezing and breathing (through the nose – nasally, and through the mouth - orally). Six volunteers, who were able to respond to the pepper sneeze stimulus, were recruited for the sneezing experiments (2 women: 27.5±6.36 years; 4 men: 29.25±10.53 years). The maximum visible distance over which the sneeze plumes (or puffs) travelled was 0.6 m, the maximum sneeze velocity derived from these measured distances was 4.5 m/s. The maximum 2-dimensional (2-D) area of dissemination of these sneezes was 0.2 m(2). The corresponding derived parameter, the maximum 2-D area expansion rate of these sneezes was 2 m(2)/s. For nasal breathing, the maximum propagation distance and derived velocity were 0.6 m and 1.4 m/s, respectively. The maximum 2-D area of dissemination and derived expansion rate were 0.11 m(2) and 0.16 m(2)/s, respectively. Similarly, for mouth breathing, the maximum propagation distance and derived velocity were 0.8 m and 1.3 m/s, respectively. The maximum 2-D area of dissemination and derived expansion rate were 0.18 m(2) and 0.17 m(2)/s, respectively. Surprisingly, a comparison of the maximum exit velocities of sneezing reported here with those obtained from coughing (published previously) demonstrated that they are relatively similar, and not extremely high. This is in contrast with some earlier estimates of sneeze velocities, and some reasons for this difference are discussed.","Tang, Julian W.; Nicolle, Andre D.; Klettner, Christian A.; Pantelic, Jovan; Wang, Liangde; Suhaimi, Amin Bin; Tan, Ashlynn Y.

The risk factors and mechanisms associated with PA are poorly understood. Although neurovascular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection have been documented, its association with PA has not yet been determined. METHODS: From a prospectively collected database of patients treated at a tertiary care center for pituitary adenoma, we conducted a retrospective medical record review of PA cases during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 to December 2020. We also conducted a literature review to identify other reported cases. RESULTS: We identified 3 consecutive cases of PA and concomitant COVID-19 infection. The most common symptoms at presentation were headache and vision changes. The included patients were successfully treated with surgical decompression and medical management of the associated endocrinopathy, ultimately experiencing improvement in their visual symptoms at the latest follow-up examination. COVID-19 infection in the perioperative period was corroborated by polymerase chain reaction test results in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: With the addition of our series to the literature, 10 cases of PA in the setting of COVID-19 infection have been confirmed. The present series was limited in its ability to draw conclusions about the relationship between these 2 entities. However, COVID-19 infection might represent a risk factor for the development of PA.

However, its efficacy has been validated in renal, hematological, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Understanding the history of RTX in SLE would be instructive in the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) saga in COVID-19. Three steps would be necessary and sufficient before definitively closing the debate: 1) determine the effective and safe dose of HCQ, as well as the minimum duration of treatment in COVID-19; 2) define the profile of patients in whom HCQ would be more likely to be effective (especially in asymptomatic patients and/or at the onset of the first signs of the disease) and 3) conduct one or more multicentre RCT to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19 in SSA.","Lekpa, Fernando Kemta; Ngahane, Bertrand Hugo Mbatchou; Njonnou, Sylvain Raoul Simeni; Fouda, Hermine; Halle, Marie Patrice; Njankouo, Yacouba Mapoure; Dzudie, Anastase; Choukem, Simeon Pierre; Luma, Henry Namme",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2021.38.372.29087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367451/,53

Increasing numbers of studies are examining the occupational risk to healthcare workers due to proximity to patients. Selecting the appropriate air sampling method is a critical factor in assuring the analytical performance characteristics of a clinical study. The objective of this study was to compare the physical collection efficiency and virus collection efficiency of a 5 mL compact SKC BioSampler(®), a gelatin filter, and a glass fiber filter, in a laboratory setting. The gelatin filter and the glass fiber filter were housed in a home-made filter holder. Submersion (with vortexing and subsequent centrifugation) was used for the gelatin and glass fiber filters. Swabbing method was also tested to retrieve the viruses from the glass fiber filter. Experiments were conducted using the H1N1 influenza A virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (IAV-PR8), and viral recovery was determined using culture and commercial real-time-PCR (BioFire and Xpert). An atomizer was used to aerosolize a solution of influenza virus in PBS for measurement, and two Scanning Mobility Particle Sizers were used to determine particle size distributions. The SKC BioSampler demonstrated a U-shaped physical collection efficiency, lowest for particles around 30–50 nm, and highest at 10 nm and 300–350 nm within the size range examined. The physical collection efficiency of the gelatin filter was strongly influenced by air flow and time: a stable collection across all particle sizes was only observed at 2 L/min for the 9 min sampling time, otherwise, degradation of the filter was observed. The glass fiber filter demonstrated the highest physical collection efficiency (100% for all sizes) of all tested samplers, however, its overall virus recovery efficiency fared the worst (too low to quantify). The highest viral collection efficiencies for the SKC BioSampler and gelatin filter were 5% and 1.5%, respectively. Overall, the SKC BioSampler outperformed the filters. It is important to consider the total concentration of viruses entering the sampler when interpreting the results.","Li, Jiayu; Leavey, Anna; Wang, Yang; O’Neil, Caroline; Wallace, Meghan A.; Burnham, Carey-Ann D.; Boon, Adrianus CM; Babcock, Hilary; Biswas, Pratim",J Aerosol Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850217301398; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2017.08.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287370/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850217301398,53

Herein, we report the clinical outcomes in a large cohort of 251 patients with COVID-19 in the setting of known IPF. Outcomes were compared with a propensity matched cohort of patients with COVID-19 without IPF. METHODS: Analysis of a federated multicentre research network TriNetX was performed including patients more than 16 years of age diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes in patients diagnosed as positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection with concurrent IPF were compared with a propensity matched cohort of patients without IPF. RESULTS: A total of 311 060 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection on the research network were identified, 251 patients (0.08%) carried a diagnosis of IPF. Mean age of patients with IPF was 68.30±12.20 years, with male predominance (n=143, 56.97%). Comorbidities including chronic lower respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease were more common in patients with IPF when compared with the non-IPF cohort. After propensity matching, higher rates of composite primary outcome (death or mechanical ventilation) at 30 and 60 days, as well as need for hospitalisation, critical care, and acute kidney injury were observed in the IPF cohort. CONCLUSION: Poor outcomes of COVID-19 disease were observed in patients with IPF after robust matching of confounders.

A large proportion of older adults in Mexico have high prevalence of multimorbidity and live in poverty with limited access to health care services. These statistics are even higher among adults living in rural areas, which suggests that older adults in rural communities may be more susceptible to COVID-19. The objectives of the article were to compare clinical and demographic characteristics for people diagnosed with COVID-19 by age group, and to describe cases and mortality in rural and urban communities. METHODS: We linked publicly available from the Mexican Ministry of Health and the Census. Municipalities were classified based on population as rural (<2500), semi-rural (≥ 2,500 and <15,000), semi-urban (≥15,000 and <100,000) and urban (≥100,000). Zero-inflated negative binomial models were performed to calculate the total number of COVID-19 cases, and deaths per 1,000,000 persons using the population of each municipality as a denominator. RESULTS: Older adults were more likely to be hospitalized and reported severe cases, with higher mortality rates. In addition, rural municipalities reported a higher number of COVID-19 cases and mortality related to COVID-19 per million than urban municipalities. The adjusted absolute difference in COVID-19 cases was 912.7 per million (95% Confidence Interval (CI),79.0 – 1746.4) and mortality related to COVID-19 was 390.6 per million (95% CI, 204.5 – 576.7).

The aim of this study is to investigate the epidemiology of malaria along the border, will identify challenges in the progress from control to elimination. METHODS: National reported malaria cases from China and Myanmar, along with the data of 18 Chinese border counties and 23 townships in Myanmar were obtained from a web-based diseases information reporting system in China and the national malaria control program of Myanmar, respectively. Epidemiological data was analyzed, including the number of reported cases, annual parasite index and proportion of vivax infection. Spatial mapping of the annual parasite index (API) at county or township level in 2014 and 2018 was performed by ArcGIS. The relationship of malaria endemicity on both sides of the border was evaluated by regression analysis. RESULTS: The number of reported malaria cases and API declined in the border counties or townships. In 2014, 392 malaria cases were reported from 18 Chinese border counties, including 8.4% indigenous cases and 91.6% imported cases, while the highest API (0.11) was occurred in Yingjiang County. There have been no indigenous cases reported since 2017, but 164 imported cases were reported in 2018 and 97.6% were imported from Myanmar. The average API in 2014 in 23 Myanmar townships was significantly greater than that of 18 Chinese counties (P < 0.01). However, the API decreased significantly in Myanmar side from 2014 to 2018 (P < 0.01). The number of townships with an API between 0 and 1 increased to 15 in 2018, compared to only five in 2014, while still four townships had API > 10. Plasmodium vivax was the predominant species along the border. The number of reported malaria cases and the proportion of vivax infection in the 18 Chinese counties were strongly correlated with those of the 23 Myanmar townships (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Malaria elimination is approaching along the China-Myanmar border. However, in order to achieve the malaria elimination in this region and prevent the re-establishment of malaria in China after elimination, continued political, financial and scientific commitment is required.","Huang, Fang; Zhang, Li; Xue, Jing-Bo; Zhou, Hong-Ning; Thi, Aung; Zhang, Jun; Zhou, Shui-Sen; Xia, Zhi-Gui; Zhou, Xiao-Nong",Infect Dis Poverty,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00777-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33213516/,53

Materials and Methods: We conducted an anonymous online survey from 11–15 December 2020 among HCPs by emails delivered from the local medical and nursing stuff associations. Results: The 71.1% of 656 HCPs intended to accept vaccination, 5.9% did not and 23% were still undecided. The acceptance rate was higher in physicians (76.5%) and significantly lower in nurses (48.3%). Most of the responders who intended to accept vaccination were males (p = 0.01), physicians (p = 0.001), older (p = 0.02), married (p = 0.054) with children (p = 0.001), and had treated patients with COVID-19 (p < 0.001). In the multivariate logistic regression, the predictors of HCPs willingness to get vaccinated were parenthood (OR = 4.19, p = 0.003), being a physician (OR = 2.79, p = 0.04), and treating confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients (OR = 2.87, p = 0.036). Conclusions: Low vaccination acceptance rate was found especially in nurses, and as this may have a negative impact in the vaccination compliance of the general public, interventional educational programs to enhance vaccination are crucial.","Pataka, Athanasia; Kotoulas, Seraphim; Stefanidou, Emilia; Grigoriou, Ioanna; Tzinas, Asterios; Tsiouprou, Ioanna; Zarogoulidis, Paul; Courcoutsakis, Nikolaos; Argyropoulou, Paraskevi",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204614/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57060611,53

We describe three cases series of incidents where an unclear contamination of the drug solution or syringe caused the injection process to stop and continue with a new preparation. During a period of 12 months with 30,502 intravitreal injections at a tertiary center, wherein 7,076 were of the drug Aflibercept drawn up from a glass vial, three cases of the critical incident reporting system relating to intravitreal injections were identified: (1) After a typical contact with the filter cannula, the glass of an Aflibercept vial was no longer intact. (2) In the course of another injection, there was a clear deposition of debris on the outer edge of the syringe when removing the attached filter cannula. (3) After inserting the syringe into the rubber top of the vial, a whitish particle of unclear origin was identified within the drug solution. Later, this contamination/particle was identified as part of the greyish rubber that was punched out with the cannula, according to the analyses of the material sent in and the manufacturer's investigations. Thus, even in busy clinics, visual inspection of the injection solution and materials used for impurities, preferably before and after pulling them out of a vial, must be an essential part of the injection process. Even when using ready-to-use prefilled syringes (PFS), vigilance must be kept high, knowing the risk of potential contamination.","Pohl, Lisa; Strudel, Lisa; Dimopoulos, Spyridon; Ziemssen, Focke",Case Rep Ophthalmol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34055435/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8824585,53

672258,Personalized vaccinology: A review,2018-08-28,"The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the world has resulted in stressful healthcare burdens and global health crises. Developing an effective measure to protect people from infection is an urgent need. The blockage of interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and S protein is considered an essential target for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) drugs. A full-length ACE2 protein could be a potential drug to block early entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. In this study, a therapeutic strategy was developed by using extracellular vesicles (EVs) with decoy receptor ACE2 for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. The EVs embedded with engineered ACE2 (EVs-ACE2) were prepared; the EVs-ACE2 were derived from an engineered cell line with stable ACE2 expression. The potential effect of the EVs-ACE2 on anti-SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo neutralization experiments using the pseudovirus with the S protein (S-pseudovirus). EVs-ACE2 can inhibit the infection of S-pseudovirus in various cells, and importantly, the mice treated with intranasal administration of EVs-ACE2 can suppress the entry of S-pseudovirus into the mucosal epithelium. Therefore, the intranasal EVs-ACE2 could be a preventive medicine to protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This EVs-based strategy offers a potential route to COVID-19 drug development.","Wu, Canhao; Xu, Qin; Wang, Huiyuan; Tu, Bin; Zeng, Jiaxin; Zhao, Pengfei; Shi, Mingjie; Qiu, Hong; Huang, Yongzhuo",Acta Pharm Sin B,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2021.09.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383521003464?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211383521003464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522576/,53

Outbreak strategies often involve combinations of NPIs that may change according to disease prevalence and population response. Little is known with regard to how costly each NPI is to implement. This information is essential to inform policy decisions for outbreak response. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap in existing literature, we conducted a systematic review on outbreak costings and simulation studies related to a number of NPI strategies, including isolating infected individuals, contact tracing and quarantine, and school closures. METHODS: Our search covered the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, studies published between 1990 and 24 March 2020 were included. We included studies containing cost data for our NPIs of interest in pandemic, epidemic, and outbreak response scenarios. RESULTS: We identified 61 relevant studies. There was substantial heterogeneity in the cost components recorded for NPIs in outbreak costing studies. The direct costs of NPIs for which costing studies existed also ranged widely: isolating infected individuals per case: US$141.18 to US$1042.68 (2020 values), tracing and quarantine of contacts per contact: US$40.73 to US$93.59, social distancing: US$33.76 to US$167.92, personal protection and hygiene: US$0.15 to US$895.60. CONCLUSION: While there are gaps and heterogeneity in available cost data, the findings of this review and the collated cost database serve as an important resource for evidence-based decision-making for estimating costs pertaining to NPI implementation in future outbreak response policies.

METHODS: We performed a qualitative case study to describe participant perceptions of the communication of bed allocation decisions in an 18-bed university affiliated, medical-surgical critical care unit at Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre. Interviewed participants were 3 critical care physicians, 4 clinical fellows in critical care, 4 resource nurses, 4 ""end-users"" (physicians who commonly referred patients to the unit), and 3 members of the administrative staff. Median bed occupancy during the study period (Jan-April 2003) was 18/18; daily admissions and discharges (median) were 3. We evaluated our description using the ethical framework ""accountability for reasonableness"" (A4R) to identify opportunities for improvement. RESULTS: The critical care physician, resource nurse, critical care fellow and end-users (trauma team leader, surgeons, neurosurgeons, anesthesiologists) functioned independently in unofficial ""parallel tracks"" of bed allocation decision-making; this conflicted with the official designation of the critical care physician as the sole authority. Communication between key decision-makers was indirect and could exclude those affected by the decisions; notably, family members. Participants perceived a lack of publicity for bed allocation rationales. CONCLUSION: The publicity condition should be improved for critical care bed allocation decisions. Decision-making in the ""parallel tracks"" we describe might be unavoidable within usual constraints of time, urgency and demand. Formal guidelines for direct communication between key participants in such circumstances would help to improve the fairness of these decisions.","Cooper, Andrew B; Joglekar, Amit S; Gibson, Jennifer; Swota, Alissa H; Martin, Douglas K",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16259634/,53

674551,"Population genetics, community of parasites, and resistance to rodenticides in an urban brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) population",2017-09-08,"BACKGROUND: The control of tuberculosis (TB) in India is complicated by the presence of a large, disorganised private sector where most patients first seek care. Following pilots in Mumbai and Patna (two major cities in India), an initiative known as the ‘Public–Private Interface Agency’ (PPIA) is now being expanded across the country. We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of scaling up PPIA operations, in line with India’s National Strategic Plan for TB control. METHODS: Focusing on Mumbai and Patna, we collected cost data from implementing organisations in both cities and combined this data with models of TB transmission dynamics. Estimating the cost per disability adjusted life years (DALY) averted between 2014 (the start of PPIA scale-up) and 2025, we assessed cost-effectiveness using two willingness-to-pay approaches: a WHO-CHOICE threshold based on per-capita economic productivity, and a more stringent threshold incorporating opportunity costs in the health system. FINDINGS: A PPIA scaled up to ultimately reach 50% of privately treated TB patients in Mumbai and Patna would cost, respectively, US$228 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 159 to 320) per DALY averted and US$564 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 409 to 775) per DALY averted. In Mumbai, the PPIA would be cost-effective relative to all thresholds considered. In Patna, if focusing on adherence support, rather than on improved diagnosis, the PPIA would be cost-effective relative to all thresholds considered. These differences between sites arise from variations in the burden of drug resistance: among the services of a PPIA, improved diagnosis (including rapid tests with genotypic drug sensitivity testing) has greatest value in settings such as Mumbai, with a high burden of drug-resistant TB. CONCLUSIONS: To accelerate decline in TB incidence, it is critical first to engage effectively with the private sector in India. Mechanisms such as the PPIA offer cost-effective ways of doing so, particularly when tailored to local settings.","Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; Nandi, Arindam; Vijayan, Shibu; Jha, Nita; Nair, Sreenivas A; Kumta, Sameer; Dewan, Puneet; Rade, Kiran; Vadera, Bhavin; Rao, Raghuram; Sachdeva, Kuldeep S",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34610905/,53

Therefore, this study aims to create a forecast analysis regarding the occasions of COVID-19 and B.1.1.7 cases based on data from the 1st January to 18th March 2021, and also analyze the association between meteorological factors with B.1.1.7 incidences in three different provinces of Indonesia such as the west java, south sumatra and east kalimantan. METHODS: We used the Autoregressive Moving Average Models (ARIMA) to forecast the number of cases in the upcoming 14 days and the Spearman correlation analysis to analyze the relationship between B.1.1.7 cases and meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, sunshine, and wind speed. RESULTS: The results of the study showed the fitted ARIMA models forecasted there was an increase in the daily cases in three provinces.

Recent years have seen the emergence of new program models that aim to improve access and uptake, including telerehabilitation and low-cost, home-based models. This workshop was convened to achieve consensus on the essential components of pulmonary rehabilitation and to identify requirements for successful implementation of emerging program models. A Delphi process involving experts from across the world identified 13 essential components of pulmonary rehabilitation that must be delivered in any program model, encompassing patient assessment, program content, method of delivery, and quality assurance, as well as 27 desirable components. Only those models of pulmonary rehabilitation that have been tested in clinical trials are currently considered as ready for implementation. The characteristics of patients most likely to succeed in each program model are not yet known, and research is needed in this area. Health professionals should use clinical judgment to determine those patients who are best served by a center-based, multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. A comprehensive patient assessment is critical for personalization of pulmonary rehabilitation and for effectively addressing individual patient goals. Robust quality-assurance processes are important to ensure that any pulmonary rehabilitation service delivers optimal outcomes for patients and health services. Workforce capacity-building and training should consider the skills necessary for emerging models, many of which are delivered remotely. The success of all pulmonary rehabilitation models will be judged on whether the essential components are delivered and on whether the expected patient outcomes, including improved exercise capacity, reduced dyspnea, enhanced health-related quality of life, and reduced hospital admissions, are achieved.","Holland, Anne E.; Cox, Narelle S.; Houchen-Wolloff, Linzy; Rochester, Carolyn L.; Garvey, Chris; ZuWallack, Richard; Nici, Linda; Limberg, Trina; Lareau, Suzanne C.; Yawn, Barbara P.; Galwicki, Mary; Troosters, Thierry; Steiner, Michael; Casaburi, Richard; Clini, Enrico; Goldstein, Roger S.",Ann Am Thorac Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33929307/; https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.202102-146st,53

Variance in protein sequence might lead to a change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 20 nonsynonymous mutations in the SARS‐CoV‐2 genome in which incidence rates were all ≥ 1% as of September 1st, 2020, and then modeled and analyzed the mutant protein structures. The results showed that four types of mutations caused dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD ≥ 5.0 Å), which were Q57H and G251V in open‐reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L, and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations also affected the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking mutant complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a–S and Orf3a–Orf8 protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 mutations could change viral protein structure, binding affinity, and hot spots of the interface, thereby might have impacts on SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID‐19.","Wu, Siqi; Tian, Chang; Liu, Panpan; Guo, Dongjie; Zheng, Wei; Huang, Xiaoqiang; Zhang, Yang; Liu, Lijun",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33090512/,53

This recommendation involves not only healthcare workers but other category of workers and the general population as well, in public places, especially where social distancing is difficult to maintain. The use of facemasks should not cause physical impairment to individuals, especially for people suffering from lung and heart diseases. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of RPDs on the respiratory function in healthy and asthmatic subjects, in order to identify the fitness for use mainly, but not only for, occupational purposes during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Ten individuals were included, three of which affected by asthma and three current smokers. A Respiratory Functional Test (RFT) was performed at three times: at the beginning of the work shift 1) without wearing and 2) wearing surgical masks, and 3) after 4 hours of usual working activities wearing the masks. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) samples were also tested before the first test and the third test. RESULTS: Observed RFTs and ABG parameters did not suffer significant variations, but for Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (P=0.002). Data on asthmatic subjects and smokers were comparable to healthy subjects. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that wearing a surgical mask does not produce significant respiratory impairment in healthy subjects nor in subjects with asthma. Four hours of continuing mask-wearing do not cause a reduction in breathing parameters. Fitness for use in subjects with more severe conditions has to be evaluated individually. Our adapted technique for RFTs could be adopted for the individual RPDs fitness evaluation.","Ciocan, Catalina; Clari, Marco; Fabbro, Donatella; De Piano, Maria Luigia; Garzaro, Giacomo; Godono, Alessandro; Gullino, Attilia; Romano, Canzio",Med Lav,https://doi.org/10.23749/mdl.v111i5.9766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33124606/,53

METHODS: Visual analogue scale for quality of life (VAS‐QoL), VAS for symptom scores (VAS‐symptom), medication scores (MSs), and total symptom scores (TSS‐6) were recorded during the pandemic in 327 adult allergic rhinitis and/or asthmatic patients receiving maintenance SCIT, and these scores were compared with the pre‐pandemic data. Patients were grouped according to SCIT administration intervals; no delay (Group 1), <2 months (Group 2), and ≥2‐month intervals (Group 3). RESULTS: A total of 104 (31.8%) patients (Group 3) were considered as nonadherent which was mostly related to receiving SCIT with HDMs and using public transportation for reaching the hospital. Median MS, VAS‐symptom, and TSS‐6 scores of Group 3 patients during the pandemic were higher than the pre‐pandemic scores (p = 0.005, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively), whereas median VAS‐QoL scores of Group 3 during the pandemic were lower than the pre‐pandemic scores (p < 0.001). Median TSS‐6 and VAS‐symptom scores were the highest in Group 3 compared with other groups (p < 0.001 for each comparison). Median VAS‐QoL scores were the lowest in Group 3 compared with Group 1 and Group 2 (p < 0.001, p = 0.043, respectively). CONCLUSION: When precautions in allergy clinics are carefully applied, adherence to SCIT can be high during a pandemic. Patients must be encouraged to regularly adhere to SCIT injections since delays in SCIT administration can deteriorate clinical symptoms.","Yeğit, Osman Ozan; Demir, Semra; Ünal, Derya; Olgaç, Müge; Terzioğlu, Kadriye; Eyice Karabacak, Deniz; Tüzer, Can; Ayhan, Vehbi; Çolakoğlu, Bahattin; Büyüköztürk, Suna; Gelincik, Aslı",Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904166/; https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14876,53

This study aimed to explore midwifery and nursing interventions to limit the transmission of COVID-19 among women in their third trimester of pregnancy, to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection and promote safety of care for women and their infants. METHOD: We completed a retrospective review of medical records from 35 women in their third trimester of pregnancy with SARS-CoV-2, admitted to one hospital in Wuhan, China in January and February 2020. We investigated the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 infection in pregnancy, and the individualized midwifery and nursing care offered, including environmental protection, prevention of nosocomial infection, maternal observations, monitoring of signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and psychological care. RESULT: Thirty-one women had a caesarean section, and four had vaginal births. Retrospective analysis of midwifery and nursing strategies implemented to care for these women showed no maternal complications or nosocomial infections. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The care strategies we implemented could prevent complications and nosocomial infection in the third trimester of pregnancy, thus ensuring the safety of women and their infants. Further research needs to determine treatment priorities for women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy and the postnatal period.","Liu, Juan; Cao, Yuming; Xu, Cheng; Zhou, Chunhua; Wei, Wei; Yuan, Jing; Wang, Lei; Kang, Liqun; Qu, Xinlan",Midwifery,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0266613820302485; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2020.102876; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266613820302485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33220602/,53

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether allergic diseases are a risk factor for hospitalization in COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a study including 107 pediatric patients after COVID-19 recovery. ISAAC Phase 3 questionnaires were distributed together with a detailed history of environmental factors and an allergic evaluation including skin prick tests, specific IgE tests, and spirometry. We investigated the prevalence of allergic diseases and evaluated the factors associated with hospitalization in COVID-19. RESULTS: Sixty-one (57%) patients were hospitalized and 46 (43%) patients were followed closely in the outpatient clinic. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR ), recurrent wheezing, atopic dermatitis (AD), and asthma was 10.3%, 5.5%, 4.7%, and 3.7%, respectively, within the whole study population. While having asthma ± AR, AD, and passive tobacco exposure were not found to be related to hospitalization due to COVID-19, having a pet at home was found to be decreased risk of hospitalization (OR: 0.191, 95% CI: 0.047-0.779, p = 0.021). Spirometry tests revealed a higher FEV1/FVC ratio and a PEF reversibility in hospitalized patients compared to nonhospitalized ones (p = 0.023 and p = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Asthma and allergic diseases do not appear to be risk factors for hospitalization due to COVID-19 in children, and having a pet at home can be a protective effect.

Early COVID-19 detection among healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial for protecting patients and the healthcare workforce. Because of limited testing capacity, symptom-based screening may prioritize testing and increase diagnostic accuracy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a retrospective study of HCWs undergoing both COVID-19 telephonic symptom screening and nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 assays during the period, March 9—April 15, 2020. HCWs with negative assays but progressive symptoms were re-tested for SARS-CoV-2. Among 592 HCWs tested, 83 (14%) had an initial positive SARS-CoV-2 assay. Fifty-nine of 61 HCWs (97%) who were asymptomatic or reported only sore throat/nasal congestion had negative SARS-CoV-2 assays (P = 0.006). HCWs reporting three or more symptoms had an increased multivariate-adjusted odds of having positive assays, 1.95 (95% CI: 1.10–3.64), which increased to 2.61 (95% CI: 1.50–4.45) for six or more symptoms. The multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive assay were also increased for HCWs reporting fever and a measured temperature ≥ 37.5°C (3.49 (95% CI: 1.95–6.21)), and those with myalgias (1.83 (95% CI: 1.04–3.23)). Anosmia/ageusia (i.e. loss of smell/loss of taste) was reported less frequently (16%) than other symptoms by HCWs with positive assays, but was associated with more than a seven-fold multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive test: OR = 7.21 (95% CI: 2.95–17.67). Of 509 HCWs with initial negative SARS-CoV-2 assays, nine had symptom progression and positive re-tests, yielding an estimated negative predictive value of 98.2% (95% CI: 96.8–99.0%) for the exclusion of clinically relevant COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom and temperature reports are useful screening tools for predicting SARS-CoV-2 assay results in HCWs. Anosmia/ageusia, fever, and myalgia were the strongest independent predictors of positive assays. The absence of symptoms or symptoms limited to nasal congestion/sore throat were associated with negative assays.","Lan, Fan-Yun; Filler, Robert; Mathew, Soni; Buley, Jane; Iliaki, Eirini; Bruno-Murtha, Lou Ann; Osgood, Rebecca; Christophi, Costas A.; Fernandez-Montero, Alejandro; Kales, Stefanos N.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32589687/,53
680207,Retrograde Instrumentation of Surgically Resected Roots Using Controlled Memory Files: A Human Cadaver Study,2020-06-15,"Background: Allocation of adequate healthcare facilities is one of the most important factors that public health policymakers consider when preparing for infectious disease outbreaks. Negative pressure isolation rooms (NPIRs) are one of the critical resources for control of infectious respiratory diseases, such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. However, there is insufficient attention to efficient allocation of NPIR-equipped hospitals. Methods: We aim to explore any insufficiency and spatial disparity of NPIRs in South Korea in response to infectious disease outbreaks based on a simple analytic approach. We examined the history of installing NPIRs in South Korea between the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov) in 2015 to evaluate the allocation process and spatial distribution of NPIRs across the country. Then, for two types of infectious diseases (a highly contagious disease like COVID-19 vs. a hospital-based transmission like MERS-Cov), we estimated the level of disparity between NPIR capacity and demand at the sub-regional level in South Korea by applying the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method. Results: Geospatial information system (GIS) mapping reveals a substantial shortage and misallocation of NPIRs, indicating that the Korean government should consider a simple but evidence-based spatial method to identify the areas that need NPIRs most and allocate funds wisely. The 2SFCA method suggests that, despite the recent addition of NPIRs across the country, there should still be more NPIRs regardless of the spread pattern of the disease. It also illustrates high levels of regional disparity in allocation of those facilities in preparation for an infectious disease, due to the lack of evidence-based approach. Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of evidence-based decision-making processes in allocating public health facilities, as misallocation of facilities could impede the responsiveness of the public health system during an epidemic. This study provides some evidence to be used to allocate the resources for NPIRs, the urgency of which is heightened in the face of rapidly evolving threats from the novel COVID-19 outbreak.","Kim, Hyoungah; Kim, Dohyeong; Paul, Christopher; Lee, Chang Kil",Int J Health Policy Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32654437/; https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.118,53

Women have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, as the brunt of homelife has fallen on them, and the psychosocial impact will inevitably have a physical impact. The pandemic has revealed the gender inequality that exists from the socioeconomic perspective, but soon we will see the impact from the medical perspective. Predictably, we know that the impact of stress and lack of self-care that women have had to endure heightens heart disease, already the number one killer of all women. Heart disease is 80% preventable based on the major risk factors: high cholesterol, high blood pressure, elevated sugar, obesity, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and poor diet. But the psychological risk factors drive up biomarkers and the root causes of manifesting disease. Historically, women have been less diagnosed and treated, and less likely to receive lifesaving care in a timely fashion. The pandemic is sure to amplify these issues.

Elle doit s’adapter aux ressources anesthésiques et capacité d’hospitalisation des patients. Elle doit assurer la sécurité et la protection des patients non suspects d’être atteints par le SARS-CoV-2 ainsi que du personnel quant à la transmission du COVID-19. Messages principaux: Les actes diagnostiques et thérapeutiques d’oncologie constituent une priorité en période de pandémie à COVID-19. L’état général du patient, ses comorbidités, les risques de contracter une forme grave de COVID-19, devront être pris en compte pour un éventuel report d’intervention ou un transfert du patient vers une structure moins sollicitée par les patients malades du COVID-19. Toutes les étapes du parcours oncologique en radiologie interventionnelle (réunion de concertation pluridisciplinaire, consultation pré et post-thérapeutique, imagerie pré et post-thérapeutique et intervention de RI) doivent être organisées dans le respect des mesures barrières (règles d’hygiène et de distanciation sociale) pour assurer la protection des patients et du personnel d’une contamination au SARS-CoV-2. Le dépistage des patients COVID-suspects doit être effectué scrupuleusement avant chaque étape du parcours de soin. Les téléconsultations doivent être favorisées, en dehors des consultations couplées à une échographie de faisabilité. Si un bilan scanographique est nécessaire avant une prise en charge, une exploration thoracique peut permettre de découvrir fortuitement des lésions suspectes de COVID-19.

Abstract Introduction: Interventional oncology should remain a priority among interventional radiology procedures during the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic. It should be adapted to anesthetic resources and hospital beds capacity. Oncology patients not affected by COVID-19 should be treated in a safe environment to reduce the risk of exposure. Take-home points: Diagnostic and interventional radiology in oncology should remain a priority consideration during the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic. Health status, comorbidities and risk of being severely affected by COVID-19 should be taken into consideration for post postponement of elective procedures or patient referral to a hospital not specialized in the fight against COVID-19. The different steps of the oncology clinical pathway including pluridisciplinary tumor board, pre and post-interventional office visits, pre and post-procedural imaging and interventional radiology procedures should be reorganized in order to provide appropriate services (hygiene practices and physical barriers) to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to patients et healthcare personnel. Phone calls to patients planned to be admitted the following days should be organized to ensure these patients do not present any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Telemedicine or phone calls should replace office visits unless an ultrasound examination is scheduled for the pre-intervention evaluation. If CT examination is necessary for the oncological evaluation, pulmonary lesions compatible with COVID-19 may be accidentally diagnosed. Careful attention should be paid to the indications and types of drugs used for general anesthesia in patients with COVID-19 because of medication shortage and to prevent cross-contamination of patients and medical staff. Locoregional anesthesia should be favored. Minimally-invasive interventional oncology procedures should be favored as an alternative to surgery to spare medical resources and medications in accordance with the recommendations of national oncological societies. Institutional healthcare policies and protocols must be organized with identification of dedicated COVID-19 transportation and care sections. Conclusion: Oncological procedures should be prioritized during the COVID-19 pandemic. Protective measures must be in place throughout the hospital and the radiology department to reduce the risks of exposure of the patients and the staff. Interventional radiology procedures offered as alternative treatments to surgery may optimize medical resources, anesthetic drugs and critical care unit beds.","Fohlen, A; Sautière, JB; Gakuba, C; Pelage, JP",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2543343120300798; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2543343120300798?v=s5,53

The economic south is carrying a higher burden than those in the economic north. This raises questions about whether social preventions and biomedical preventions for infectious disease are given equal consideration, and about social institutions and structures that frame the debate about infectious disease. This article examines how institutionalized ways of talking about infectious disease reinforces, creates, and sustains health inequalities. METHODS: Critical discourse analysis was considered to be epistemologically and ontologically consistent with the aims and context of this study. RESULTS: The study examined three types of infectious disease: • Emerging infectious diseases/pathogens • Neglected tropical diseases • Vector-borne infections. Examination revealed that poverty is the most common determinant of all three. CONCLUSIONS: A sustainable reduction in infectious disease in the southern countries is most likely to be achieved through tackling socioeconomic determinants. There is a need for a change in the discourse on infectious disease, and adopt a discourse that promotes self-determination, rather than one that reinforces the hero-victim scenario and power inequalities.","Mabhala, Mzwandile A.; Yohannes, Asmait; Massey, Alan; Reid, John A.",Int J Prev Med,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijpvm.ijpvm_431_17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363024/,53

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences among residents drawn from three largest teaching hospitals affiliated. The Maslach Burnout Inventory and Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure (PHEEM) questionnaire were used to collect data through web-based, as well as paper-and pencil questionnaires. The data was analyzed using SPSS. RESULTS: A total of 221 residents completed the survey, with a response rate of 82%. Burnout was reported by 67.4% of medical residents. The total PHEEM score had a negative correlation with emotional exhaustion (r = - 0.57, P < 0.001), depersonalization (r = - 0.40, P < 0.001), and a positive one with personal accomplishment (r = 0.42, P < 0.001). Perception of social support significantly predicted burnout subscales (P < 0.05). PHEEM subscales also explained a small proportion of variance in emotional exhaustion (R = 0.55, R(2) = 0.308, P < .001). Clinical learning environment independent of personal characteristics was associated with residents' burnout according to multivariate regression analysis [OR = 0.567 (0.170–0.883), P = 0.012]. CONCLUSION: Clinical learning environment independent of personal characteristics was associated with residents' burnout in Iran. We suggest some initiatives to be introduced ranging from improving the clinical environments, reduce workloads and provide social support to all residents as well as encouraging them to involve in other extracurricular activities like music and physical exercise.","Maghbouli, Nastaran; Fatehi, Farzad; Mafinejad, Mahboobeh Khabaz; Pourhassan, Saeed; Sohrabpour, Amir Ali; Ali, Jemal Haidar",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189297/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07238,53

A retrospective analysis was conducted from December 2020 to March 2021 using TriNetX, a national federated, real time database of 69 million records. The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination among patients with inflammatory skin diseases including psoriasis (Pso), atopic dermatitis (AD), and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) was calculated. A 1:1 matched propensity score analysis was then conducted, adjusting for comorbidities and demographics, to generate adjusted risk ratios (aRR) with 95% CI. The outcome was any adverse event of special interest (AESI), as defined by the CDC and FDA, that occurred at any point after vaccination. In a sample of 301,878 patients who were vaccinated,1.5% had Pso, 1.4% had AD, and 0.3% had HS. After matching, cases had no significant differences compared to controls for any AESIs after either the first dose (Pso: 1.1[0.5-2.3], AD: 1.4[0.7-2.8], HS:1.0[0.4-2.4]) or second dose of vaccine (Pso: 1.4[0.7-2.7], AD: 1.0[0.6-1.7], HS: 1.0[0.4-2.4]). Matched subgroup analysis among the two major COVID-19 vaccine brands also revealed no differences in AESIs among Pso, AD, and HS patients. While preliminary, the current data reveals that patients with chronic inflammatory skin diseases are not at higher risk of any AESIs after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.

The potential inclusion of a PCV vaccination program for rural areas is essential.","Al-Lahham, Adnan; Khanfar, Nashat; Albataina, Noor; Al Shwayat, Rana; Altwal, Rawsan; Abulfeilat, Talal; Alawneh, Ghaith; Khurd, Mohammad; Alqadi Altamimi, Abdelsalam",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358205/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070789,53
686980,Nano Research for COVID-19,2020-03-31,"The discussion of H5N1 influenza virus gain-of-function research has focused chiefly on its risk-to-benefit ratio. Another key component of risk is the level of containment employed. Work is more expensive and less efficient when pursued at biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) than at BSL-3 or at BSL-3 as modified for work with agricultural pathogens (BSL-3-Ag). However, here too a risk-to-benefit ratio analysis is applicable. BSL-4 procedures mandate daily inspection of facilities and equipment, monitoring of personnel for signs and symptoms of disease, and logs of dates and times that personnel, equipment, supplies, and samples enter and exit containment. These measures are not required at BSL-3 or BSL-3-Ag. Given the implications of inadvertent or deliberate release of high-threat pathogens with pandemic potential, it is imperative that the World Health Organization establish strict criteria for biocontainment that can be fairly applied in the developing world, as well as in more economically developed countries.","Lipkin, W.

Key features of the hypothesis are that 1) the substrates of CD38 (e.g., NAD(+) and NADP(+)) are depleted by viral-induced metabolic changes; 2) the products of the enzymatic activity of CD38 [e.g., cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (ADPR)/ADPR/nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate] and related enzymes [e.g., poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, Sirtuins, and ADP-ribosyl hydrolase] are involved in the anti‐viral and proinflammatory response that favors the onset of lung immunopathology (e.g., cytokine storm and organ fibrosis); and 3) the pathological changes induced by this kinetic mechanism may be reduced by distinct modulators of the CD38/NAD(+) axis (e.g., CD38 blockers, NAD(+) suppliers, among others). This view is supported by arrays of associative basic and applied research data that are herein discussed and integrated with conclusions reported by others in the field of inflammatory, immune, tumor, and viral diseases.","Horenstein, Alberto L.; Faini, Angelo C.; Malavasi, Fabio",Physiol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787351/; https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00046.2020,53

This assumption is an underlying principle of using raters for creativity tasks, as in the Consensual Assessment Technique. While several prior studies have examined expert-novice differences in ratings, none have examined whether experts’ ability to identify the quality of a creative product is being driven more by their ability to identify high quality work, low quality work, or both. To address this question, a sample of 142 participants completed individual difference measures and rated the quality of several sets of creative captions. Unbeknownst to the participants, the captions had been identified a prior by expert raters as being of particularly high or low quality. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that after controlling for participants’ background and personality, those who scored significantly higher on any of three external measures of creativity also rated low-quality captions significantly lower than their peers; however, they did not rate the high-quality captions significantly higher. These findings support research in other domains suggesting that ratings of quality may be driven more by the lower end of the quality spectrum than the high end.","Stemler, Steven E.; Kaufman, James C.",Think Skills Creat,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2020.100727; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871187120302017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187120302017?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952738/,53

Current literature on the abundance and distribution of ACE2 protein in the human respiratory tract is controversial. We examined the effect of age and lung injury on ACE2 protein expression in rodent and non-human primate (NHP) models. We also examined ACE2 expression in human tissues with and without coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). ACE2 expression was detected at very low levels in preterm, but was absent in full-term and adult NHP lung homogenates. This pattern of ACE2 expression contrasted with that of transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), which was significantly increased in full-term newborn and adult NHP lungs compared to preterm NHP lungs. ACE2 expression was not detected in NHP lungs with cigarette smoke-induced airway disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Murine lungs lacked basal ACE2 immunoreactivity, but responded to hyperoxia, bacterial infection, and allergen exposure with new ACE2 expression in bronchial epithelial cells. In human specimens, robust ACE2 immunoreactivity was detected in ciliated epithelial cells in paranasal sinus specimens, while ACE2 expression was detected only in rare type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in control lungs. In autopsy specimens from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, ACE2 was detected in rare ciliated epithelial and endothelial cells in the trachea, but not in the lung. There was robust expression of ACE2 expression in F344/N rat nasal mucosa and lung specimens, which authentically recapitulated the ACE2 expression pattern in human paranasal sinus specimens. Thus, ACE2 protein expression demonstrates a significant gradient between upper and lower respiratory tract in humans and is scarce in the lung. This pattern of ACE2 expression supports the notion of sinonasal epithelium being the main entry site for SARS-CoV-2 but raises further questions on the pathogenesis and cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Soni, Sourabh; Jiang, Yujie; Tesfaigzi, Yohannes; Hornick, Jason L.; Çataltepe, Sule",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33626084/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247510,53

Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-funded health centers* expanded telehealth† services during the COVID-19 pandemic (1). The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services eliminated geographic restrictions and enhanced reimbursement so that telehealth services-enabled health centers could expand telehealth services and continue providing care during the pandemic (2,3). CDC and HRSA analyzed data from 245 health centers that completed a voluntary weekly HRSA Health Center COVID-19 Survey§ for 20 consecutive weeks to describe trends in telehealth use. During the weeks ending June 26-November 6, 2020, the overall percentage of weekly health care visits conducted via telehealth (telehealth visits) decreased by 25%, from 35.8% during the week ending June 26 to 26.9% for the week ending November 6, averaging 30.2% over the study period. Weekly telehealth visits declined when COVID-19 cases were decreasing and plateaued as cases were increasing. Health centers in the South and in rural areas consistently reported the lowest average percentage of weekly telehealth visits over the 20 weeks, compared with health centers in other regions and urban areas. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, maintaining and expanding telehealth services will be critical to ensuring access to care while limiting exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Demeke, Hanna B.; Merali, Sharifa; Marks, Suzanne; Pao, Leah Zilversmit; Romero, Lisa; Sandhu, Paramjit; Clark, Hollie; Clara, Alexey; McDow, Kendra B.; Tindall, Erica; Campbell, Stephanie; Bolton, Joshua; Le, Xuan; Skapik, Julia L.; Nwaise, Isaac; Rose, Michelle A.; Strona, Frank V.; Nelson, Christina; Siza, Charlene",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7007a3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600385/,53
688491,Natuurlijk naar buiten!,2021-07-12,"Background: Hypertension is among the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, which are considered high mortality risk medical conditions. To date, several studies have reported positive effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) interventions on physical and psychological well-being in other medical conditions, but no meta-analysis on MBSR programs for hypertension has been conducted. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of MBSR programs for hypertension. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of MBSR on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), anxiety, depression, and perceived stress in people with hypertension or pre-hypertension was conducted. The PubMed/MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched in November 2020 to identify relevant studies. Results: Six studies were included. The comparison of MBSR versus control conditions on diastolic BP was associated with a statistically significant mean effect size favoring MBSR over control conditions (MD = −2.029; 95% confidence interval (CI): −3.676 to −0.383, p = 0.016, k = 6; 22 effect sizes overall), without evidence of heterogeneity (I(2) = 0.000%). The comparison of MBSR versus control conditions on systolic BP was associated with a mean effect size which was statistically significant only at a marginal level (MD = −3.894; 95% CI: −7.736–0.053, p = 0.047, k = 6; 22 effect sizes overall), without evidence of high heterogeneity (I(2) = 20.772%). The higher the proportion of participants on antihypertensive medications was, the larger the effects of MBSR were on systolic BP (B = −0.750, z = −2.73, p = 0.003). Conclusions: MBSR seems to be a promising intervention, particularly effective on the reduction of diastolic BP. More well-conducted trials are required.","Conversano, Ciro; Orrù, Graziella; Pozza, Andrea; Miccoli, Mario; Ciacchini, Rebecca; Marchi, Laura; Gemignani, Angelo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799828/,53

This project assessed the impact of two major global / national phenomena, specifically the impact of a) COVID-19 and b) local / community / national actions around racism and policing on child and youth burn survivors and their families. METHODS: Our burn camp program moved to a virtual format for 2020. Campers (ages 8 – 18) and their caregivers / parents completed questionnaires about their year, rating and specifying the personal impacts of these phenomena. They rated how their year has been overall and selected “what has helped you get through tough times”. 47 campers and 47 caregivers / parents participated. Results: Impact of COVID-19 The majority of youth rated the impact of COVID-19 as “somewhat” to “highly” (78%), while the majority of caregivers rated “somewhat” (64%). Campers and caregivers identified the following impacts most often and to similar degrees: Online school/virtual learning, Friends/Social, Sports/Activities, Quarantine, Isolation, Worries, Quality time with family. Caregivers also highlighted: Getting creative at home and Uncertainties. Impact of local / community / national actions around racism and policing on you and your family The majority of campers and caregivers rated the impact as “Somewhat”, “Very Little” or “Not Impacted” (86%), although participants rating higher impact also provided moving personal experiences. What has helped you get through tough times this year Over 85% of campers and caregivers / parents rated their year overall as “OK” or “Pretty Good”. Campers and caregivers endorsed Family, Friends, Faith, and What I learned recovering from my burn injury as factors helping them get through tough times. CONCLUSIONS: Children, youth, and families who have experienced a burn injury report both negative and positive impacts from the global and national phenomena of COVID-19 and local / community / national actions around racism and policing. Not all youth and families are equally impacted. Family and friends were the greatest sources of support during tough times. One burn survivor family indicated that what they learned recovering from burn injury has helped them through this challenging year – “I have learned to just adapt and change because anything can happen at any point.” Most burn survivors and their families indicate the year has been “OK” or “pretty good”. Connection through burn camp provided the opportunity to share the impacts, but also the strengths and resiliencies in our burn community.","Jackson, Brad; Mikolaj, Kerry; Boulter, Trudy; Mayer, Nichole F",J Burn Care Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/jbcr/irab032.269,53

Thousands of school buildings across the country were closed in the spring of 2020 through the end of the school year to slow the spread of the global pandemic. Plans to reopen schools in many states remain uncertain as the virus continues to spread across communities. Current and future challenges are complex, with significant impacts on the global economy, health care system, and overall well‐being. When schools reopen, students will present with a wide variety of academic and social‐emotional needs, and schools will need to mindfully adjust systems and practices to meet the needs of their unique student population.
