148,HMGB1: Endogenous Danger Signaling,2008-04-11,"While foreign pathogens and their products have long been known to activate the innate immune system, the recent recognition of a group of endogenous molecules that serve a similar function has provided a framework for understanding the overlap between the inflammatory responses activated by pathogens and injury. These endogenous molecules, termed alarmins, are normal cell constituents that can be released into the extracellular milieu during states of cellular stress or damage and subsequently activate the immune system. One nuclear protein, High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), has received particular attention as fulfilling the functions of an alarmin by being involved in both infectious and non-infectious inflammatory conditions. Once released, HMGB1 signals through various receptors to activate immune cells involved in the immune process. Although initial studies demonstrated HMGB1 as a late mediator of sepsis, recent findings indicate HMGB1 to have an important role in models of non-infectious inflammation, such as autoimmunity, cancer, trauma, and ischemia reperfusion injury. Furthermore, in contrast to its pro-inflammatory functions, there is evidence that HMGB1 also has restorative effects leading to tissue repair and regeneration. The complex functions of HMGB1 as an archetypical alarmin are outlined here to review our current understanding of a molecule that holds the potential for treatment in many important human conditions.","Klune, John R; Dhupar, Rajeev; Cardinal, Jon; Billiar, Timothy R; Tsung, Allan",Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2323334/,91
284,The Model Repository of the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study,2008-07-10,"The model repository (MREP) is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed under the auspices of models of infectious disease agent study (MIDAS). The purpose of the MREP is to organize and catalog the models, results, and suggestions for using the MIDAS and to store them in a way to allow users to run models from an access-controlled disease MREP. The MREP contains source and object code of disease models developed by infectious disease modelers and tested in a production environment. Different versions of models used to describe various aspects of the same disease are housed in the repository. Models are linked to their developers and different versions of the codes are tied to Subversion, a version control tool. An additional element of the MREP will be to house, manage, and control access to a disease model results warehouse, which consists of output generated by the models contained in the MREP. The result tables and files are linked to the version of the model and the input parameters that collectively generated the results. The result tables are warehoused in a relational database that permits them to be easily identified, categorized, and downloaded.","Cooley, Phillip C.; Roberts, D.; Bakalov, V.

418,HIV Antigen Incorporation within Adenovirus Hexon Hypervariable 2 for a Novel HIV Vaccine Approach,2010-07-27,"Adenoviral (Ad) vectors have been used for a variety of vaccine applications including cancer and infectious diseases. Traditionally, Ad-based vaccines are designed to express antigens through transgene expression of a given antigen. However, in some cases these conventional Ad-based vaccines have had sub-optimal clinical results. These sub-optimal results are attributed in part to pre-existing Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) immunity. In order to circumvent the need for antigen expression via transgene incorporation, the “antigen capsid-incorporation” strategy has been developed and used for Ad-based vaccine development in the context of a few diseases. This strategy embodies the incorporation of antigenic peptides within the capsid structure of viral vectors. The major capsid protein hexon has been utilized for these capsid incorporation strategies due to hexon's natural role in the generation of anti-Ad immune response and its numerical representation within the Ad virion. Using this strategy, we have developed the means to incorporate heterologous peptide epitopes specifically within the major surface-exposed domains of the Ad capsid protein hexon. Our study herein focuses on generation of multivalent vaccine vectors presenting HIV antigens within the Ad capsid protein hexon, as well as expressing an HIV antigen as a transgene. These novel vectors utilize HVR2 as an incorporation site for a twenty-four amino acid region of the HIV membrane proximal ectodomain region (MPER), derived from HIV glycoprotein gp41 (gp41). Our study herein illustrates that our multivalent anti-HIV vectors elicit a cellular anti-HIV response. Furthermore, vaccinations with these vectors, which present HIV antigens at HVR2, elicit a HIV epitope-specific humoral immune response.","Matthews, Qiana L.; Fatima, Aiman; Tang, Yizhe; Perry, Brian A.; Tsuruta, Yuko; Komarova, Svetlana; Timares, Laura; Zhao, Chunxia; Makarova, Natalia; Borovjagin, Anton V.; Stewart, Phoebe L.; Wu, Hongju; Blackwell, Jerry L.; Curiel, David T.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910733/,91
520,"New Insights of an Old Defense System: Structure, Function, and Clinical Relevance of the Complement System",2010-10-29,"The complement system was discovered a century ago as a potent defense cascade of innate immunity. After its first description, continuous experimental and clinical research was performed, and three canonical pathways of activation were established. Upon activation by traumatic or surgical tissue damage, complement reveals beneficial functions of pathogen and danger defense by sensing and clearing injured cells. However, the latest research efforts have provided a more distinct insight into the complement system and its clinical subsequences. Complement has been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory processes such as sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction, ischemia/reperfusion, cardiovascular diseases and many others. The three well-known activation pathways of the complement system have been challenged by newer findings that demonstrate direct production of central complement effectors (for example, C5a) by serine proteases of the coagulation cascade. In particular, thrombin is capable of producing C5a, which not only plays a decisive role on pathogens and infected/damaged tissues, but also acts systemically. In the case of uncontrolled complement activation, “friendly fire” is generated, resulting in the destruction of healthy host tissue. Therefore, the traditional research that focuses on a mainly positive-acting cascade has now shifted to the negative effects and how tissue damage originated by the activation of the complement can be contained. In a translational approach including structure-function relations of this ancient defense system, this review provides new insights of complement-mediated clinical relevant diseases and the development of complement modulation strategies and current research aspects.","Ehrnthaller, Christian; Ignatius, Anita; Gebhard, Florian; Huber-Lang, Markus",Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060978/,91
564,"Spliced Leader RNAs, Mitochondrial Gene Frameshifts and Multi-Protein Phylogeny Expand Support for the Genus Perkinsus as a Unique Group of Alveolates",2011-05-24,"The genus Perkinsus occupies a precarious phylogenetic position. To gain a better understanding of the relationship between perkinsids, dinoflagellates and other alveolates, we analyzed the nuclear-encoded spliced-leader (SL) RNA and mitochondrial genes, intron prevalence, and multi-protein phylogenies. In contrast to the canonical 22-nt SL found in dinoflagellates (DinoSL), P. marinus has a shorter (21-nt) and a longer (22-nt) SL with slightly different sequences than DinoSL. The major SL RNA transcripts range in size between 80–83 nt in P. marinus, and ∼83 nt in P. chesapeaki, significantly larger than the typical ≤56-nt dinoflagellate SL RNA. In most of the phylogenetic trees based on 41 predicted protein sequences, P. marinus branched at the base of the dinoflagellate clade that included the ancient taxa Oxyrrhis and Amoebophrya, sister to the clade of apicomplexans, and in some cases clustered with apicomplexans as a sister to the dinoflagellate clade. Of 104 Perkinsus spp. genes examined 69.2% had introns, a higher intron prevalence than in dinoflagellates. Examination of Perkinsus spp. mitochondrial cytochrome B and cytochrome C oxidase subunit I genes and their cDNAs revealed no mRNA editing, but these transcripts can only be translated when frameshifts are introduced at every AGG and CCC codon as if AGGY codes for glycine and CCCCU for proline. These results, along with the presence of the numerous uncharacterized ‘marine alveolate group I' and Perkinsus-like lineages separating perkinsids from core dinoflagellates, expand support for the affiliation of the genus Perkinsus with an independent lineage (Perkinsozoa) positioned between the phyla of Apicomplexa and Dinoflagellata.","Zhang, Huan; Campbell, David A.; Sturm, Nancy R.; Dungan, Christopher F.; Lin, Senjie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3101222/,91
843,Evaluation of atherosclerotic lesions using dextran- and mannan–dextran-coated USPIO: MRI analysis and pathological findings,2012-05-03,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect atherosclerotic lesions containing accumulations of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxides (USPIO). Positing that improved USPIO with a higher affinity for atherosclerotic plaques would yield better plaque images, we performed MRI and histologic studies to compare the uptake of dextran- and mannan–dextran-coated USPIO (D-USPIO and DM-USPIO, respectively) by the atherosclerotic walls of rabbits. We intravenously injected atherosclerotic rabbits with DM-USPIO (n = 5) or D-USPIO (n = 5). Two rabbits were the controls. The doses delivered were 0.08 (dose 1) (n = 1), 0.4 (dose 2) (n = 1), or 0.8 (dose 3) (n = 3) mmol iron/Kg. The dose 3 rabbits underwent in vivo contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) before and 5 days after USPIO administration. Afterwards, all animals were euthanized, the aortae were removed and subjected to in vitro MRI study. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the aortic wall in the same region of interest (ROI) was calculated in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Histological assessment through measurement of iron-positive regions in Prussian blue-stained specimens showed that iron-positive regions were significantly larger in rabbits injected with DM- rather than D-USPIO (P < 0.05) for all doses. In vivo MRA showed that the SNR-reducing effect of DM- was greater than that of D-USPIO (P < 0.05). With in vitro MRI scans, SNR was significantly lower in rabbits treated with dose 2 of DM-USPIO compared with D-USPIO treatment (P < 0.05), and it tended to be lower at dose 3 (P < 0.1). In conclusion, we suggest that DM-USPIO is superior to D-USPIO for the study of atherosclerotic lesions in rabbits.","Tsuchiya, Keiko; Nitta, Norihisa; Sonoda, Akinaga; Nitta-Seko, Ayumi; Ohta, Shinichi; Takahashi, Masashi; Murata, Kiyoshi; Mukaisho, Kenichi; Shiomi, Masashi; Tabata, Yasuhiko; Nohara, Satoshi",Int J Nanomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356181/,91
1171,Novel compounds for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: emerging therapeutic agents,2011-03-10,"The identification of dystrophin and the causative role of mutations in this gene in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (D/BMD) was expected to lead to timely development of effective therapies. Despite over 20 years of research, corticosteroids remain the only available pharmacological treatment for DMD, although significant benefits and extended life have resulted from advances in the clinical care and management of DMD individuals. Effective treatment of DMD will require dystrophin restitution in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles and nonmuscle tissues; however, modulation of muscle loss and regeneration has the potential to play an important role in altering the natural history of DMD, particularly in combination with other treatments. Emerging biological, molecular, and small molecule therapeutics are showing promise in ameliorating this devastating disease, and it is anticipated that regulatory environments will need to display some flexibility in order to accommodate the new treatment paradigms.","Wilton, Steve D; Fletcher, Sue",Appl Clin Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3681176/,91
1234,iGPCR-Drug: A Web Server for Predicting Interaction between GPCRs and Drugs in Cellular Networking,2013-08-27,"Involved in many diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative, inflammatory and respiratory disorders, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are among the most frequent targets of therapeutic drugs. It is time-consuming and expensive to determine whether a drug and a GPCR are to interact with each other in a cellular network purely by means of experimental techniques. Although some computational methods were developed in this regard based on the knowledge of the 3D (dimensional) structure of protein, unfortunately their usage is quite limited because the 3D structures for most GPCRs are still unknown. To overcome the situation, a sequence-based classifier, called “iGPCR-drug”, was developed to predict the interactions between GPCRs and drugs in cellular networking. In the predictor, the drug compound is formulated by a 2D (dimensional) fingerprint via a 256D vector, GPCR by the PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition) generated with the grey model theory, and the prediction engine is operated by the fuzzy K-nearest neighbour algorithm. Moreover, a user-friendly web-server for iGPCR-drug was established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iGPCR-Drug/. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results without the need to follow the complicated math equations presented in this paper just for its integrity. The overall success rate achieved by iGPCR-drug via the jackknife test was 85.5%, which is remarkably higher than the rate by the existing peer method developed in 2010 although no web server was ever established for it. It is anticipated that iGPCR-Drug may become a useful high throughput tool for both basic research and drug development, and that the approach presented here can also be extended to study other drug – target interaction networks.","Xiao, Xuan; Min, Jian-Liang; Wang, Pu; Chou, Kuo-Chen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3754978/,91
1391,Transcriptome Analysis of the Initial Stage of Acute WSSV Infection Caused by Temperature Change,2014-03-04,"White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the most devastating virosis threatening the shrimp culture industry worldwide. Variations of environmental factors in shrimp culture ponds usually lead to the outbreak of white spot syndrome (WSS). In order to know the molecular mechanisms of WSS outbreak induced by temperature variation and the biological changes of the host at the initial stage of WSSV acute infection, RNA-Seq technology was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in shrimp with a certain amount of WSSV cultured at 18°C and shrimp whose culture temperature were raised to 25°C. To analyze whether the expression changes of the DEGs were due to temperature rising or WSSV proliferation, the expression of selected DEGs was analyzed by real-time PCR with another shrimp group, namely Group T, as control. Group T didn’t suffer WSSV infection but was subjected to temperature rising in parallel. At the initial stage of WSSV acute infection, DEGs related to energy production were up-regulated, whereas most DEGs related to cell cycle and positive regulation of cell death and were down-regulated. Triose phosphate isomerase, enolase and alcohol dehydrogenase involved in glycosis were up-regulated, while pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase with NAD as the coenzyme involved in TCA pathway were down-regulated. Also genes involved in host DNA replication, including DNA primase, DNA topoisomerase and DNA polymerase showed down-regulated expression. Several interesting genes including crustin genes, acting binding or inhibiting protein genes, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 9 (ADAM9) gene and a GRP 78 gene were also analyzed. Understanding the interactions between hosts and WSSV at the initial stage of acute infection will not only help to get a deep insight into the pathogenesis of WSSV but also provide clues for therapies.","Sun, Yumiao; Li, Fuhua; Sun, Zheng; Zhang, Xiaojun; Li, Shihao; Zhang, Chengsong; Xiang, Jianhai",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3942461/,91
1995,Transcriptomic Changes Due to Cytoplasmic TDP-43 Expression Reveal Dysregulation of Histone Transcripts and Nuclear Chromatin,2015-10-28,"TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is normally a nuclear RNA-binding protein that exhibits a range of functions including regulation of alternative splicing, RNA trafficking, and RNA stability. However, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), TDP-43 is abnormally phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved, and is mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it forms distinctive aggregates. We previously developed a mouse model expressing human TDP-43 with a mutation in its nuclear localization signal (ΔNLS-hTDP-43) so that the protein preferentially localizes to the cytoplasm. These mice did not exhibit a significant number of cytoplasmic aggregates, but did display dramatic changes in gene expression as measured by microarray, suggesting that cytoplasmic TDP-43 may be associated with a toxic gain-of-function. Here, we analyze new RNA-sequencing data from the ΔNLS-hTDP-43 mouse model, together with published RNA-sequencing data obtained previously from TDP-43 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) knockdown mice to investigate further the dysregulation of gene expression in the ΔNLS model. This analysis reveals that the transcriptomic effects of the overexpression of the ΔNLS-hTDP-43 transgene are likely due to a gain of cytoplasmic function. Moreover, cytoplasmic TDP-43 expression alters transcripts that regulate chromatin assembly, the nucleolus, lysosomal function, and histone 3’ untranslated region (UTR) processing. These transcriptomic alterations correlate with observed histologic abnormalities in heterochromatin structure and nuclear size in transgenic mouse and human brains.","Amlie-Wolf, Alexandre; Ryvkin, Paul; Tong, Rui; Dragomir, Isabelle; Suh, EunRan; Xu, Yan; Van Deerlin, Vivianna M.; Gregory, Brian D.; Kwong, Linda K.; Trojanowski, John Q.; Lee, Virginia M.-Y.; Wang, Li-San; Lee, Edward B.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624943/,91
2101,Viable Influenza A Virus in Airborne Particles from Human Coughs,2014-12-18,"Patients with influenza release aerosol particles containing the virus into their environment. However, the importance of airborne transmission in the spread of influenza is unclear, in part because of a lack of information about the infectivity of the airborne virus. The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of viable influenza A virus that was expelled by patients in aerosol particles while coughing. Sixty-four symptomatic adult volunteer outpatients were asked to cough 6 times into a cough aerosol collection system. Seventeen of these participants tested positive for influenza A virus by viral plaque assay (VPA) with confirmation by viral replication assay (VRA). Viable influenza A virus was detected in the cough aerosol particles from 7 of these 17 test subjects (41%). Viable influenza A virus was found in the smallest particle size fraction (0.3 μm to 8 μm), with a mean of 142 plaque-forming units (SD 215) expelled during the 6 coughs in particles of this size. These results suggest that a significant proportion of patients with influenza A release small airborne particles containing viable virus into the environment. Although the amounts of influenza A detected in cough aerosol particles during our experiments were relatively low, larger quantities could be expelled by influenza patients during a pandemic when illnesses would be more severe. Our findings support the idea that airborne infectious particles could play an important role in the spread of influenza.","Lindsley, William G.; Noti, John D.; Blachere, Francoise M.; Thewlis, Robert E.; Martin, Stephen B.; Othumpangat, Sreekumar; Noorbakhsh, Bahar; Goldsmith, William T.; Vishnu, Abhishek; Palmer, Jan E.; Clark, Karen E.; Beezhold, Donald H.",J Occup Environ Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4734406/,91
2132,Effects of memory on the shapes of simple outbreak trees,2016-02-18,"Genomic tools, including phylogenetic trees derived from sequence data, are increasingly used to understand outbreaks of infectious diseases. One challenge is to link phylogenetic trees to patterns of transmission. Particularly in bacteria that cause chronic infections, this inference is affected by variable infectious periods and infectivity over time. It is known that non-exponential infectious periods can have substantial effects on pathogens’ transmission dynamics. Here we ask how this non-Markovian nature of an outbreak process affects the branching trees describing that process, with particular focus on tree shapes. We simulate Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes and compare different patterns of infectivity over time. We find that memory (non-Markovian-ness) in the process can have a pronounced effect on the shapes of the outbreak’s branching pattern. However, memory also has a pronounced effect on the sizes of the trees, even when the duration of the simulation is fixed. When the sizes of the trees are constrained to a constant value, memory in our processes has little direct effect on tree shapes, but can bias inference of the birth rate from trees. We compare simulated branching trees to phylogenetic trees from an outbreak of tuberculosis in Canada, and discuss the relevance of memory to this dataset.","Plazzotta, Giacomo; Kwan, Christopher; Boyd, Michael; Colijn, Caroline",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4758066/,91
2147,CpG Improves Influenza Vaccine Efficacy in Young Adult but Not Aged Mice,2016-03-02,"Several studies have shown a reduced efficacy of influenza vaccines in the elderly compared to young adults. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a commercially available inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone(®)) in young adult and aged mice. C57/BL6 mice were administered a single or double immunization of Fluzone(®) with or without CpG and challenged intranasally with H1N1 A/California/09 virus. A double immunization of Fluzone(®) adjuvanted with CpG elicited the highest level of protection in young adult mice which was associated with increases in influenza specific IgG, elevated HAI titres, reduced viral titres and lung inflammation. In contrast, the vaccine schedule which provided fully protective immunity in young adult mice conferred limited protection in aged mice. Antigen presenting cells from aged mice were found to be less responsive to in vitro stimulation by Fluzone and CpG which may partially explain this result. Our data are supportive of studies that have shown limited effectiveness of influenza vaccines in the elderly and provide important information relevant to the design of more immunogenic vaccines in this age group.","Ramirez, Alejandro; Co, Mary; Mathew, Anuja",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4774967/,91

2519,Mechanical unfolding kinetics of the SRV-1 gag-pro mRNA pseudoknot: possible implications for −1 ribosomal frameshifting stimulation,2016-12-21,"Minus-one ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding mechanism widely utilized by many RNA viruses to generate accurate ratios of structural and catalytic proteins. An RNA pseudoknot structure located in the overlapping region of the gag and pro genes of Simian Retrovirus type 1 (SRV-1) stimulates frameshifting. However, the experimental characterization of SRV-1 pseudoknot (un)folding dynamics and the effect of the base triple formation is lacking. Here, we report the results of our single-molecule nanomanipulation using optical tweezers and theoretical simulation by steered molecular dynamics. Our results directly reveal that the energetic coupling between loop 2 and stem 1 via minor-groove base triple formation enhances the mechanical stability. The terminal base pair in stem 1 (directly in contact with a translating ribosome at the slippery site) also affects the mechanical stability of the pseudoknot. The −1 frameshifting efficiency is positively correlated with the cooperative one-step unfolding force and inversely correlated with the one-step mechanical unfolding rate at zero force. A significantly improved correlation was observed between −1 frameshifting efficiency and unfolding rate at forces of 15–35 pN, consistent with the fact that the ribosome is a force-generating molecular motor with helicase activity. No correlation was observed between thermal stability and −1 frameshifting efficiency.","Zhong, Zhensheng; Yang, Lixia; Zhang, Haiping; Shi, Jiahao; Vandana, J.

Ginseng polysaccharides (GPs) are the responsible ingredient of ginseng in immunomodulation, and are classified as acidic and neutral GPs. Although GPs participate in various immune reactions including the stimulation of immune cells and production of cytokines, the precise function of GPs together with its potential receptor(s) and their signal transduction pathways have remained largely unknown. Animal lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that are highly specific for sugar moieties. Among many different biological functions in vivo, animal lectins especially play important roles in the immune system by recognizing carbohydrates that are found exclusively on pathogens or that are inaccessible on host cells. This review summarizes the immunological activities of GPs and the diverse roles of animal lectins in the immune system, suggesting the possibility of animal lectins as the potential receptor candidates of GPs and giving insights into the development of GPs as therapeutic biomaterials for many immunological diseases.","Loh, So Hee; Park, Jin-Yeon; Cho, Eun Hee; Nah, Seung-Yeol; Kang, Young-Sun",J Ginseng Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5223067/,91

The in vitro anti-proliferative potential of the synthesized compounds 4a-o and 7a-e was examined against HT-29 (colon), ZR-75 (breast) and A549 (lung) human cancer cell lines. Compounds 7b, 7d and 7e were the most active congeners against the tested human cancer cell lines with average IC(50) values of 4.77, 3.39 and 2.37 μM, respectively, as compared with the reference isatin-based drug, sunitinib, which exhibited an average IC(50) value of 8.11 μM. Compound 7e was selected for further pharmacological evaluation in order to gain insight into its possible mechanism of action. It increased caspase 3/7 activity by 2.4- and 1.85-fold between 4 and 8 h of treatment, respectively, at 10 μM and it caused a decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with a corresponding increase in the S-phase. In addition, compound 7e increased phosphorylated tyrosine (p-Tyr) levels nearly two-fold with an apparent IC(50) value of 3.8 μM. The 7e-loaded PLGA microspheres were prepared using a modified emulsion-solvent diffusion method. The average encapsulation efficiency of the 7e-loaded PLGA microspheres was 85% ± 1.3.

2834,The evolution of animal Argonautes: evidence for the absence of antiviral AGO Argonautes in vertebrates,2017-08-23,"In addition to mediating regulation of endogenous gene expression, RNA interference (RNAi) in plants and invertebrates plays a crucial role in defense against viruses via virus-specific siRNAs. Different studies have demonstrated that the functional diversity of RNAi in animals is linked to the diversification of the Argonaute superfamily, central components of RISCs (RNA induced silencing complexes). The animal Argonaute superfamily is traditionally grouped into AGO and PIWI Argonautes. Yet, by performing phylogenetic analyses and determining the selective evolutionary pressure in the metazoan Argonaute superfamily, we provide evidence for the existence of three conserved Argonaute lineages between basal metazoans and protostomes, namely siRNA-class AGO, miRNA-class AGO and PIWI Argonautes. In addition, it shown that the siRNA-class AGO lineage is characterized by high rates of molecular evolution, suggesting a role in the arms race with viruses, while the miRNA-class AGOs display strong sequence conservation. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that vertebrates lack siRNA-class AGO proteins and that vertebrate AGOs display low rates of molecular evolution. In this way, we provide supportive evidence for the loss of the antiviral siRNA-class AGO group in vertebrates and discuss the consequence hereof on antiviral immunity and the use of RNAi as a loss of function tool in these animals.","Wynant, Niels; Santos, Dulce; Vanden Broeck, Jozef",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569025/,91

3048,Far-UVC light: A new tool to control the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases,2018-02-09,"Airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public health challenges. A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm(2) of 222-nm light inactivating >95% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus.

The recognition of these peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes by T-cells is the cornerstone of cellular immunity, enabling the elimination of infected or tumoral cells. T-cell-based immunotherapies against cancer, which leverage this mechanism, can greatly benefit from structural analyses of pMHC complexes. Several attempts have been made to use molecular docking for such analyses, but pMHC structure remains too challenging for even state-of-the-art docking tools. To overcome these limitations, we describe the use of an incremental meta-docking approach for structural prediction of pMHC complexes. Previous methods applied in this context used specific constraints to reduce the complexity of this prediction problem, at the expense of generality. Our strategy makes no assumption and can potentially be used to predict binding modes for any pMHC complex. Our method has been tested in a re-docking experiment, reproducing the binding modes of 25 pMHC complexes whose crystal structures are available. This study is a proof of concept that incremental docking strategies can lead to general geometry prediction of pMHC complexes, with potential applications for immunotherapy against cancer or infectious diseases.","Antunes, Dinler A.; Devaurs, Didier; Moll, Mark; Lizée, Gregory; Kavraki, Lydia E.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5847594/,91
3103,Mapping road network communities for guiding disease surveillance and control strategies,2018-03-16,"Human mobility is increasing in its volume, speed and reach, leading to the movement and introduction of pathogens through infected travelers. An understanding of how areas are connected, the strength of these connections and how this translates into disease spread is valuable for planning surveillance and designing control and elimination strategies. While analyses have been undertaken to identify and map connectivity in global air, shipping and migration networks, such analyses have yet to be undertaken on the road networks that carry the vast majority of travellers in low and middle income settings. Here we present methods for identifying road connectivity communities, as well as mapping bridge areas between communities and key linkage routes. We apply these to Africa, and show how many highly-connected communities straddle national borders and when integrating malaria prevalence and population data as an example, the communities change, highlighting regions most strongly connected to areas of high burden. The approaches and results presented provide a flexible tool for supporting the design of disease surveillance and control strategies through mapping areas of high connectivity that form coherent units of intervention and key link routes between communities for targeting surveillance.","Strano, Emanuele; Viana, Matheus P.; Sorichetta, Alessandro; Tatem, Andrew J.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5856805/,91
3136,Assessment of the ability of V920 recombinant vesicular stomatitis-Zaire ebolavirus vaccine to replicate in relevant arthropod cell cultures and vector species,2018-01-03,"V920, rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP, is a recombinant vesicular stomatitis-Zaire ebolavirus vaccine which has shown an acceptable safety profile and provides a protective immune response against Ebola virus disease (EVD) induced by Zaire ebolavirus in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the V920 vaccine is capable of replicating in arthropod cell cultures of relevant vector species and of replicating in live mosquitoes. While the V920 vaccine replicated well in Vero cells, no replication was observed in Anopheles or Aedes mosquito, Culicoides biting midge, or Lutzomyia sand fly cells, nor in live Culex or Aedes mosquitoes following exposure through intrathoracic inoculation or feeding on a high-titer infectious blood meal. The insect taxa selected for use in this study represent actual and potential epidemic vectors of VSV. V920 vaccine inoculated into Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes demonstrated persistence of replication-competent virus following inoculation, consistent with the recognized biological stability of the vaccine, but no evidence for active virus replication in live mosquitoes was observed. Following administration of an infectious blood meal to Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes at a titer several log(10) PFU more concentrated than would be observed in vaccinated individuals, no infection or dissemination of V920 was observed in either mosquito species. In vitro and in vivo data gathered during this study support minimal risk of the vector-borne potential of the V920 vaccine.","Bergren, Nicholas A.; Miller, Megan R.; Monath, Thomas P.; Kading, Rebekah C.",Hum Vaccin Immunother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5893201/,91
3385,Sialylated keratan sulfate proteoglycans are Siglec-8 ligands in human airways,2018-07-17,"Human siglecs are a family of 14 sialic acid-binding proteins, most of which are expressed on subsets of immune cells where they regulate immune responses. Siglec-8 is expressed selectively on human allergic inflammatory cells—primarily eosinophils and mast cells—where engagement causes eosinophil apoptosis and inhibits mast cell mediator release. Evidence supports a model in which human eosinophils and mast cells bind to Siglec-8 sialoglycan ligands on inflammatory target tissues to resolve allergic inflammation and limit tissue damage. To identify Siglec-8-binding sialoglycans from human airways, proteins extracted from postmortem human trachea were resolved by size-exclusion chromatography and composite agarose–acrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted and probed by Siglec-8-Fc blot overlay. Three size classes of Siglec-8 ligands were identified: 250 kDa, 600 kDa and 1 MDa, each of which was purified by affinity chromatography using a recombinant pentameric form of Siglec-8. Proteomic mass spectrometry identified all size classes as the proteoglycan aggrecan, a finding validated by immunoblotting. Glycan array studies demonstrated Siglec-8 binding to synthetic glycans with a terminal Neu5Acα2-3(6-sulfo)-Gal determinant, a quantitatively minor terminus on keratan sulfate (KS) chains of aggrecan. Treating human tracheal extracts with sialidase or keratanase eliminated Siglec-8 binding, indicating sialylated KS chains as Siglec-8-binding determinants. Treating human tracheal histological sections with keratanase also completely eliminated the binding of Siglec-8-Fc. Finally, Siglec-8 ligand purified from human trachea extracts induced increased apoptosis of freshly isolated human eosinophils in vitro. We conclude that sialylated KS proteoglycans are endogenous human airway ligands that bind Siglec-8 and may regulate allergic inflammation.","Gonzalez-Gil, Anabel; Porell, Ryan N; Fernandes, Steve M; Wei, Yadong; Yu, Huifeng; Carroll, Daniela J; McBride, Ryan; Paulson, James C; Tiemeyer, Michael; Aoki, Kazuhiro; Bochner, Bruce S; Schnaar, Ronald L",Glycobiology,https://academic.oup.com/glycob/article-pdf/28/10/786/25792249/cwy057.pdf,91
3612,ISG20 promotes local tumor immunity and contributes to poor survival in human glioma,2018-10-31,"Recent evidence has confirmed that a mutation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene occurs early in gliomagenesis and contributes to suppressed immunity. The present study aimed to determine the candidate genes associated with IDH mutation status that could serve as biomarkers of immune suppression for improved prognosis prediction. Clinical information and RNA-seq gene expression data were collected for 932 glioma samples from the CGGA and TCGA databases, and differentially expressed genes in both lower-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) samples were identified according to IDH mutation status. Only one gene, interferon-stimulated exonuclease gene 20 (ISG20), with reduced expression in IDH mutant tumors, demonstrated significant prognostic value. ISG20 expression level significantly increased with increasing tumor grade, and its high expression was associated with a poor clinical outcome. Moreover, increased ISG20 expression was associated with increased infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils, and suppressed adaptive immune response. ISG20 expression was also positively correlated with PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 expression, along with the levels of several chemokines. We conclude that ISG20 is a useful biomarker to identify IDH-mediated immune processes in glioma and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.","Gao, Mengqi; Lin, Yi; Liu, Xing; Li, Yiming; Zhang, Chuanbao; Wang, Zheng; Wang, Zhiliang; Wang, Yulin; Guo, Zongze",Oncoimmunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6343791/,91
3861,ADAM17-dependent signaling is required for oncogenic human papillomavirus entry platform assembly,2019-05-20,"Oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) are small DNA viruses that infect keratinocytes. After HPV binding to cell surface receptors, a cascade of molecular interactions mediates the infectious cellular internalization of virus particles. Aside from the virus itself, important molecular players involved in virus entry include the tetraspanin CD151 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). To date, it is unknown how these components are coordinated in space and time. Here, we studied plasma membrane dynamics of CD151 and EGFR and the HPV16 capsid during the early phase of infection. We find that the proteinase ADAM17 activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) pathway by the shedding of growth factors which triggers the formation of an endocytic entry platform. Infectious endocytic entry platforms carrying virus particles consist of two-fold larger CD151 domains containing the EGFR. Our finding clearly dissects initial virus binding from ADAM17-dependent assembly of a HPV/CD151/EGFR entry platform.","Mikuličić, Snježana; Finke, Jérôme; Boukhallouk, Fatima; Wüstenhagen, Elena; Sons, Dominik; Homsi, Yahya; Reiss, Karina; Lang, Thorsten; Florin, Luise",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6557631/,91

While both have been under development since the 1990s, in recent years, significant excitement has turned to mRNA despite the licensure of several veterinary DNA vaccines. Both have required efforts to increase their potency either via manipulating the plasmid DNA and the mRNA directly or through the addition of adjuvants or immunomodulators as well as delivery systems and formulations. The greater inherent inflammatory nature of the mRNA vaccines is discussed for both its potential immunological utility for vaccines and for the potential toxicity. The status of the clinical trials of mRNA vaccines is described along with a comparison to DNA vaccines, specifically the immunogenicity of both licensed veterinary DNA vaccines and select DNA vaccine candidates in human clinical trials.","Liu, Margaret A.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631684/,91
3973,Divergent Peptide Presentations of HLA-A(*)30 Alleles Revealed by Structures With Pathogen Peptides,2019-07-23,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have a high degree of polymorphism, which determines their peptide-binding motifs and subsequent T-cell receptor recognition. The simplest way to understand the cross-presentation of peptides by different alleles is to classify these alleles into supertypes. A1 and A3 HLA supertypes are widely distributed in humans. However, direct structural and functional evidence for peptide presentation features of key alleles (e.g., HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03) are lacking. Herein, the molecular basis of peptide presentation of HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03 was demonstrated by crystal structure determination and thermostability measurements of complexes with T-cell epitopes from influenza virus (NP44), human immunodeficiency virus (RT313), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). When binding to the HIV peptide, RT313, the PΩ-Lys anchoring modes of HLA-A(*)30:01, and -A(*)30:03 were similar to those of HLA-A(*)11:01 in the A3 supertype. However, HLA-A(*)30:03, but not -A(*)30:01, also showed binding with the HLA(*)01:01-favored peptide, NP44, but with a specific structural conformation. Thus, different from our previous understanding, HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03 have specific peptide-binding characteristics that may lead to their distinct supertype-featured binding peptide motifs. Moreover, we also found that residue 77 in the F pocket was one of the key residues for the divergent peptide presentation characteristics of HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03. Interchanging residue 77 between HLA-A(*)30:01 and HLA-A(*)30:03 switched their presented peptide profiles. Our results provide important recommendations for screening virus and tumor-specific peptides among the population with prevalent HLA supertypes for vaccine development and immune interventions.","Zhu, Shiyan; Liu, Kefang; Chai, Yan; Wu, Yanan; Lu, Dan; Xiao, Wenling; Cheng, Hao; Zhao, Yingze; Ding, Chunming; Lyu, Jianxin; Lou, Yongliang; Gao, George F.; Liu, William J.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6664060/,91

4083,Enhancing genetic disease control by selecting for lower host infectivity and susceptibility,2019-01-16,"Infectious diseases have a huge impact on animal health, production and welfare, and human health. Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.","Tsairidou, Smaragda; Anacleto, O.; Woolliams, J.

4339,Leukocyte-derived extracellular DNA contributes to abnormal pressure elevation in the extracorporeal circulation circuit,2020-01-16,"An abnormal elevation in pressure is a serious complication involving the extracorporeal circulation circuit. Clot formation might be associated with this complication, but the precise mechanism of an abnormal elevation in pressure has not been identified. We investigated sufficient conditions for in-circuit elevation in pressure using an ex vivo re-circulation circuit with porcine blood. Specifically, we investigated the effect of blood conditions, the type of anticoagulation, and pro-inflammatory stimulation on in-circuit pressure. We also examined the cause of an abnormal elevation of in-circuit pressure by specifically degrading DNA, RNA, or protein components of an obstructed filter and by using immunofluorescent techniques. Neither a change in temperature nor change in pH in the blood increased in-circuit pressure. In contrast, long-term storage of blood, pro-inflammatory stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate, and heparin administration significantly increased in-circuit pressure. Abnormal in-circuit elevation in pressure was associated with deposition of extracellular DNA on the outlet surface of the filter. Administration of DNase resulted in a rapid decline of in-circuit pressure. In an ex vivo re-circulation circuit system, extracellular DNA deposition on the filter is responsible for an abnormal in-circuit elevation in pressure. Senescent leukocytes, stimulated leukocytes, and heparin exposure are associated with extracellular DNA deposition.","Yashima, Nozomi; Ito, Takashi; Kajiyama, Kenji; Maeda, Hiroyuki; Kakihana, Yasuyuki; Maruyama, Ikuro",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6965310/,91

The assay is based on a time-gated luminescence microscopy technique enabling visualization and enumeration of individual germinating endospores. Germinating endospores release calcium dipicolinate to form highly luminescent terbium dipicolinate complexes surrounding each germinating endospore. EGA and heterotrophic plate counting (HPC) were used to evaluate the swab/rinse recovery efficiency of endospores from stainless steel surfaces. EGA and HPC results were highly correlated for endospore recovery from stainless steel coupons inoculated with range of 1,000 endospores per coupon down to sterility. Dosage-dependent decrease of surface endospore germinability were observed in dry heat, UV irradiation, oxygen plasma and vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatments, measured with EGA and HPC. EGA is a fast and complementary method to traditional HPC for quantitative sterility assurance testing of surfaces. This work introduces and validates a 15-minute or faster assay for germinable endospores to complement the conventional lengthy, culture-based surface sterility validation, which is critical in hospitals, food and pharmaceutical industries to help minimize nosocomial infection, food spoilage, and pharmaceutical contamination.","Yung, Pun To; Lester, Elizabeth; Ponce, Adrian",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6965650/,91

Here, we introduce a system for long-term assessment of AF susceptibility (substrate) in ambulatory rats implanted with miniature electrodes on the atrium. Rats were subjected to excessive aldosterone (Aldo) or solvent only (Sham). An additional group was exposed to myocardial infarction (MI). AF substrate was tested two- and four-weeks post implantation and was also compared with implanted rats early post-implantation (Base). Aldo and MI increased the AF substrate and atrial fibrosis. In the MI group only, AF duration was correlated with the level of atrial fibrosis and was inversely correlated with systolic function. Unexpectedly, Shams also developed progressive AF substrate relative to Base individuals. Further studies indicated that serum inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha) were not elevated in the shams. In addition, we excluded anxiety\depression due to social-isolation as an AF promoting factor. Finally, enhanced biocompatibility of the atrial electrode did not inhibit the gradual development of AF substrate over a testing period of up to 8 weeks.

Titration curves of hyperimmune sera were included on assay plates, assay signals underwent 5-parameter regression, and inspection of the median and interquartile range (IQR) for the y-inflection point was used to determine assay precision. The medians and IQRs were similar for Surveys 1 and 2 for most antigens, while the IQRs increased for some antigens in Survey 3. Levey-Jennings charts for selected antigens provided a pass/fail criterion for each assay plate and, of 387 assay plates, 13 (3.4%) were repeated. Individual samples failed if IgG binding to the generic glutathione-S-transferase protein was observed, with 659 (2.0%) samples failing. An additional 455 (1.4%) observations failed due to low bead numbers (<20/analyte). The final dataset included 609,438 anti-malaria IgG data points from 32,099 participants; 96.6% of all potential data points if no QC failures had occurred.

4634,Yeast Infections after Esophagectomy: A Retrospective Analysis,2020-03-09,"The nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway presents a challenge for RNA viruses with termination codons that precede extended 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). The umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) is a nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA virus with an unusually long 3′ UTR that is susceptible to NMD. To establish a systemic infection, the PEMV2 long-distance movement protein p26 was previously shown to both stabilize viral RNAs and bind them for transport through the plant’s vascular system. The current study demonstrated that p26 protects both viral and nonviral messenger RNAs from NMD. Although p26 localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleolus, p26 exerts its anti-NMD effects exclusively in the cytoplasm independently of long-distance movement. Using a transcriptome-wide approach in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana, p26 protected a subset of cellular NMD target transcripts, particularly those containing long, structured, GC-rich 3′ UTRs. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the NMD pathway is highly dysfunctional during PEMV2 infection, with 1,820 (48%) of NMD targets increasing in abundance. Widespread changes in the host transcriptome are common during plant RNA virus infections, and these results suggest that, in at least some instances, virus-mediated NMD inhibition may be a major contributing factor.","May, Jared P.; Johnson, Philip Z.; Ilyas, Muhammad; Gao, Feng; Simon, Anne E.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7064760/,91

5696,Conclusion,2013-12-06,"Hurler's syndrome (HS), the most severe form of mucopolysaccharidosis type-I, causes progressive deterioration of the central nervous system and death in childhood. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) before the age of 2 years halts disease progression. Graft failure limits the success of SCT. We analyzed data on HS patients transplanted in Europe to identify the risk factors for graft failure. We compared outcomes in 146 HS patients transplanted with various conditioning regimens and grafts. Patients were transplanted between 1994 and 2004 and registered to the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation database. Risk factor analysis was performed using logistic regression. ‘Survival’ and ‘alive and engrafted’-rate after first SCT was 85 and 56%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, T-cell depletion (odds ratio (OR) 0.18; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04–0.71; P=0.02) and reduced-intensity conditioning (OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.02–0.39; P=0.002) were the risk factors for graft failure. Busulfan targeting protected against graft failure (OR 5.76; 95% CI 1.20–27.54; P=0.028). No difference was noted between cell sources used (bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells or cord blood (CB)); however, significantly more patients who received CB transplants had full-donor chimerism (OR 9.31; 95% CI 1.06–82.03; P=0.044). These outcomes may impact the safety/efficacy of SCT for ‘inborn-errors of metabolism’ at large. CB increased the likelihood of sustained engraftment associated with normal enzyme levels and could therefore be considered as a preferential cell source in SCT for ‘inborn errors of metabolism’.","Boelens, J J; Wynn, R F; O'Meara, A; Veys, P; Bertrand, Y; Souillet, G; Wraith, J E; Fischer, A; Cavazzana-Calvo, M; Sykora, K W; Sedlacek, P; Rovelli, A; Uiterwaal, C S P M; Wulffraat, N",Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094454/,91

RESULTS: We obtained detailed demographic, clinical, and biochemical data, daily FB, and continuous renal replacement days. Fifty-seven per cent of patients had acute kidney injury (AKI) at ECMO initiation, and 60 % (n = 103) of patients received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) during ECMO course, beginning at a median of 1 (0–3.5) days after ECMO initiation. Overall 90-day mortality was 24 %. Survivors exhibited lower daily FB from day 3 to day 5. After adjustments, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III, CRRT during the first 3 days, major bleeding event at day 1 and positive FB on day 3 were independent predictors of 90-day mortality. Positive FB at ECMO day 3 remained an independent predictor of hospital and 90-day mortality, regardless of the statistical model used or the inclusion of a propensity score to have positive FB. CONCLUSIONS: Positive FB at ECMO day 3 is an independent predictor of 90-day mortality. Further interventional studies aimed at testing the value of strategy of tight control of FB during the early ECMO period are now warranted.

5795,Preparing for emerging infections,1994,"PURPOSE: Intensive care unit survivors suffer from prolonged impairment, reduced quality of life, and higher mortality rates after discharge compared to the general population. Socioeconomic status may play a partial but important role in mortality and recovery. Therefore, the detection of factors that are responsible for poor long-term outcomes would be beneficial in designing targeted interventions for at-risk populations. METHODS: For an endpoint analysis, 1834 intensive care unit patients with known French Deprivation Index (FDep) scores were included from the French and euRopean Outcome reGistry in Intensive Care Units (FROG-ICU) study, which was a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study performed in 20 French intensive care units in 13 different hospitals. Socioeconomic status was defined by using the FDep score [represented as quintiles when referring to the general French population, as quintiles when referring to the FROG-ICU cohort, or as dichotomized data (which was defined as a FDep ≤ 0 for nondeprived patients)] and by using a detailed social questionnaire that was completed 3 months after discharge. The primary outcome included an all-cause, 1-year mortality after ICU discharge when regarding socioeconomic status. The secondary outcomes included both ICU and hospital lengths of stay, both short- and medium-term mortality, and the quality of life, as assessed during the 1-year follow-up by using the Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36). The Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) was used to evaluate the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to screen for anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Of the 1447 patients who were discharged alive from the ICU, 19.2% died over the following year. No association was found between 1-year mortality and socioeconomic status, regardless of whether this association was analyzed in quintiles (p = 0.911 in the quintiles of the general French population; p = 0.589 in the quintiles of the FROG-ICU cohort itself) or as dichotomized data [nondeprived (n = 177; 1-year mortality of 18.2%) versus deprived (n = 97; 1-year mortality of 20.5%; p = 0.304)]. Moreover, no differences were found between the nondeprived and the deprived patients in the ICU and hospital lengths of stay, ICU mortalities, in-hospital mortalities, or 28-day mortalities. The SF-36 was below the score for the normal French population throughout the follow-up period. Socially deprived patients showed significantly lower median scores in the physical function subscale [55, interquartile range (IQR) (28.8–80) vs. 65, IQR (35–90); p = 0.014], the physical role subscale [25, IQR (0–75) vs. 33.3, IQR (0–100); p = 0.022], and the overall physical component scale [47.5, IQR (30–68.8) vs. 54.4, IQR (35–78.8); p = 0.010]. Up to 31.6% of survivors presented symptoms that indicated post-traumatic stress disorder, and up to 31.5% of survivors reported clinically meaningful symptoms of anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: A lower socioeconomic status was associated with lower self-reported physical component scores in the nondeprived patients. Psychiatric symptoms are frequently reported after an ICU stay, and subsequent interventions should target those fields.

Various synonyms for this type of infection are used, often due to the difficult diagnosis. Necrotizing fasciits of the extremities is found after simple skin lacerations and often in rural, farming or garden setting environments. Many of the infections are found in immunologically healthy people, but persons revealing a compromised wound healing are endangered additionally, e.g., diabetes. In the majority of the microbiological analyses, streptococci alone or a mixture with mainly anaerobic bacteria may be detected. The management of infected extremities requires a rapid diagnosis, dedicated aggressive surgical management as soon as possible, and a wide debridement extending the border of the infected fascia. Timely surgical revisions within the first day or days together with antibiotic treatment are the only measures to stop the infection. Depending on the status of the patient a hyperbaric oxygenation treatment seems to be useful in order to limit the infection. In fulminated cases early amputations, maximal intensive care treatment of the septic patient are required, where all means are warranted to save the patients life. As a consequence, early clinical diagnoses with thorough surgical debridement of the infected liquid necrotic fascia as well as correct antibiotic treatment are needed. Secondary plastic reconstruction of the soft tissue defects will generally be required.","Frank, Johannes; Barker, John H.; Marzi, Ingo",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095926/,91

Thiazolidine motifs behave as a bridge between organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry and compel researchers to explore new drug candidates. Thiazolidine motifs are very intriguing heterocyclic five-membered moieties present in diverse natural and bioactive compounds having sulfur at the first position and nitrogen at the third position. The presence of sulfur enhances their pharmacological properties, and, therefore, they are used as vehicles in the synthesis of valuable organic combinations. They show varied biological properties viz. anticancer, anticonvulsant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antioxidant activity and so on. This diversity in the biological response makes it a highly prized moiety. Based on literature studies, various synthetic approaches like multicomponent reaction, click reaction, nano-catalysis and green chemistry have been employed to improve their selectivity, purity, product yield and pharmacokinetic activity. In this review article, we have summarized systematic approaches for the synthesis of thiazolidine and its derivatives, along with their pharmacological activity, including advantages of green synthesis, atom economy, cleaner reaction profile and catalyst recovery which will help scientists to probe and stimulate the study of these scaffolds.","Sahiba, Nusrat; Sethiya, Ayushi; Soni, Jay; Agarwal, Dinesh K.; Agarwal, Shikha",Top Curr Chem (Cham),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101601/,91

While pneumonia is commonly observed during RSV infection, the burden and epidemiology of bacterial superinfection is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify microorganisms associated with RSV-positive pneumonia in adults. A retrospective study was conducted during three consecutive winters (October to April 2013–2016) in the University Hospital of Lyon, France. During RSV circulation periods, a systematic RSV screening was performed by reverse-transcription PCR on all respiratory samples collected from adults. Records of RSV-positive patients were subsequently analyzed to identify radiologically confirmed pneumonia cases. Bacteria were identified by standard bacteriology cultures or urinary antigen screening and classified as potentially causative of pneumonia if quantification was above the specific threshold as defined by the European Manual of Clinical Microbiology. Overall, 14,792 adult respiratory samples were screened for RSV detection by PCR. In total, 292 had a positive RSV detection (2.0%) among which 89 presented with pneumonia including 27 bacterial superinfections (9.3%) with Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Most patients were elderly (55.6%) and patients with comorbidities (77.8%). A more severe outcome was observed for RSV-bacteria-associated pneumonia compared with RSV pneumonia: length of stay was significantly longer (16 days vs 10 days) and ICU hospitalization more frequent (66.7% vs 21.0%) (p < 0.05). In conclusion, we did not observe major differences in the epidemiology of bacterial superinfections in RSV-positive pneumonia compared to reports on post-influenza pneumonia.","Jeannoël, M.; Lina, G.; Rasigade, J.

In summary there are reports of the successful treatment of 7 patients with rheumatoid vasculitis, 39 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, 3 patients each with microscopic Polyangiitis, and 5 patients each with temporal Arteritis or Takayasu disease with Etanercept as well as with Infliximab. In addition, Infliximab was also used with a good response in severe Polymyalgia rheumatica in 4 cases and in one case of a cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. More than 60 patients with Panuveitis and other manifestations of Behçet's disease were treated with Infliximab or Etanercept according to preliminary reports.

Nonrandom chromosomal aberrations that are frequently observed in tumors are presented. Altered metabolic demands of the tumor cell are reflected in altered gene expressions of a wide range of enzymes and other proteins, and these changed enzyme patterns are described. The study of oncogenes increasingly suggests that they may be significant in certain cancers, and the assignment of these genes has been tabulated.

7845,Evolutionary Influences in Arboviral Disease,2006,"Few catastrophes can compare with the global impact of a severe influenza pandemic. The 1918–1919 pandemic was associated with more than 500,000 deaths in the USA and an estimated 20–40 million deaths worldwide, though some place the global total much higher. In an era when infectious disease mortality had been steadily decreasing, the 1918–1919 pandemic caused a large spike in overall population mortality, temporarily reversing decades of progress. The US Department of Health and Human Services, extrapolating from the 1918–1919 pandemic to the current US population size and demographics, has estimated that a comparable pandemic today would result in almost two million deaths. Vaccination is an important component of a pandemic response. Public health measures such as reduction of close contacts with others, improved hygiene, and respiratory protection with facemasks or respirators can reduce the risk of exposure and illness (Germann et al. 2006; Ferguson et al. 2006), but would not reduce susceptibility among the population. Prophylaxis with antiviral medications also may prevent illness but depends on the availability of large antiviral drug stockpiles and also does not provide long-term immunity. By contrast, immunization with a well-matched pandemic vaccine would provide active immunity and represent the most durable pandemic response. However, given current timelines for the development of a pandemic influenza vaccine and its production capacity, vaccine is likely not to be available in sufficient quantities to protect the entire population before pandemic outbreaks occur, and thus potentially limited stocks may need to be prioritized. This chapter reviews information on influenza vaccine production capacity, describes approaches used in the USA to set priorities for vaccination in the setting of limited supply, and presents a proposed strategy for prioritization.","Schwartz, Benjamin; Orenstein, Walter A.",Vaccines for Pandemic Influenza,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120171/,91

The Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has thousands of years’ clinical application among China and other Asian countries, is the pioneer of the “Multi-component–multi-target” and network pharmacology. Hundreds of different components in a TCM prescription can cure the diseases or relieve the patients by modulating the network of potential therapeutic targets. Although there is no doubt of the efficacy, it is difficult to elucidate convincing underlying mechanism of TCM due to its complex composition and unclear pharmacology. Without thorough investigation of its potential targets and side effects, TCM is not able to generate large-scale medicinal benefits, especially in the days when scientific reductionism and quantification are dominant. The use of ligand-protein networks has been gaining significant value in the history of drug discovery while its application in TCM is still in its early stage. This article firstly surveys TCM databases for virtual screening that have been greatly expanded in size and data diversity in recent years. On that basis, different screening methods and strategies for identifying active ingredients and targets of TCM are outlined based on the amount of network information available, both on sides of ligand bioactivity and the protein structures. Furthermore, applications of successful in silico target identification attempts are discussed in details along with experiments in exploring the ligand-protein networks of TCM. Finally, it will be concluded that the prospective application of ligand-protein networks can be used not only to predict protein targets of a small molecule, but also to explore the mode of action of TCM.","Zhao, Mingzhu; Wei, Dongqing",Advance in Structural Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120483/,91

Historically, nucleoli have been tenuously linked to the biogenesis and, in particular, export of mRNAs in yeast and mammalian cells. Recently, data from plants have extended the functions in which the plant nucleolus is involved to include transcriptional gene silencing as well as mRNA surveillance and nonsense-mediated decay, and mRNA export.

To date, less than 200 animals remain in the wild. Low numbers and genetic uniformity may contribute to render this species particularly susceptible to infectious diseases. Different pathogens have been identified in Iberian lynxes; including several feline bacterial and viral agents. Within a 6-month period starting in December 2006, 12 lynxes living in the northern part of the Doñana area were found to be infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Eleven of these animals were antigenemic, and four of them died in the wild in less than 6 months since the first infected animal had been discovered. The remaining viremic lynxes were captured and allocated to a quarantine center to stop the spread of the infection. An additional three animals died shortly in the quarantine center due to acute anemic disease. Sequencing of the envelope surface unit gene revealed a common origin for the FeLV found in all lynxes. The sequences were closely related to FeLV-A/61E, originally isolated from cats in the USA. Our data demonstrate that, similarly to FeLV, the introduction of a new or particularly pathogenic infection brought into the small population of Iberian lynxes by other wild carnivores or feral cats and dogs roaming in the same habitats have severe consequences. It could result in epidemics that have the potential to eradicate the entire lynx population.","Meli, Marina L.; Cattori, Valentino; Martínez, Fernando; López, Guillermo; Vargas, Astrid; Palomares, Francisco; López-Bao, José V.; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127500/,91

Incorporation of [(3)H]mannose into N-linked glycoproteins by aged cells was further reduced (∼35%). Similarly microsomal membranes from parotid glands of aged animals showed ∼50% reduction in the synthesis of mannosylphosphoryl dolichol, a key intermediate in the dolichol pathway of protein N-glycosylation. Man-P-Dol synthase, the microsomal enzyme responsible for production of this saccharide-lipid, displayed no change in apparent K(m) for GDP-mannose when preparations from aged animals were utilized, but did show ∼50% reduction in V(max). Following β-adrenoreceptor activation, cells from both young adult and aged glands showed increased N-linked protein glycosylation almost to the same extent (∼2-fold).

8555,Requiem pour l’autopsie,2007-09-21,"This chapter discusses the virus infections of the central nervous system (CNS) and DNA vaccines. Mild central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, such as headache and drowsiness, can result from systemically elevated cytokine levels and therefore are common in many virus infections, even in the absence of the infection of the CNS. CNS infection is quite unusual and is initiated either as a result of the viremia or, more rarely, as a result of neural spread. The poliovirus infects the anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, causing poliomyelitis, the disease for which the virus is named. DNA vaccination is a relatively new entrant in the vaccine sweepstakes, but is viewed with optimism, for a number of reasons. DNA vaccines encoding the nucleoprotein from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can confer protection against the normally lethal intracranial challenge. In rabies, in a mouse model, immunization with plasmids encoding the rabies glycoprotein conferred complete protection against subsequent viral challenge. Several virus-induced CNS diseases may be explained by their triggering of autoimmunity. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a well-characterized CNS disease induced by the administration of certain CNS proteins.","Lindsay Whitton, J.; Fujinami, Robert S.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130639/,91

Bacterial gene mutation assays with Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium were negative in all tester strains. In vitro chromosomal aberration assays were positive on CHO cells but negative on human lymphocytes. Moreover, HCFC-141b was negative in vivo in a mouse micronucleus inhalation assay. On the basis of these data and previously reported genotoxicity testing, HCFC-141b is considered non-genotoxic. Groups of 80 male and 80 female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed, by inhalation (6 hr/day, 5 days/wk) to vapours of HCFC-141b for 104 wk at target concentrations of 0 (control), 1500, 5000 and 20,000 ppm (increased from 15,000 ppm after 17 wk of exposure). No exposure-related effects of toxicological significance were noted with respect to survival, clinical signs, ophthalmoscopy, haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or organ weight analysis. Reduced food intake and body weight gain were noted in both sexes of the 15,000 ppm group during the first 16 wk; thereafter, body weight gains in all groups were similar although the intergroup differences in body weight remained evident. Reduced food intake persisted in both sexes through wk 52 and in females during the second year of exposure. Treatment-related effects on macroscopic pathology were confined to increased incidences of testicular masses and altered appearance. Microscopic pathology examinations confirmed the testes as the target organ with findings of increased incidences of benign interstitial cell tumours and hyperplasia at 5000 and 20,000 ppm. The no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 1500 ppm. The testicular changes at high exposure levels were considered to be due to a change of the senile hormonal imbalance in geriatric rats and of little significance for the assessment of human health effects.","Millischer, R.-J.; de Rooij, C.G.; Rush, G.M.; Farr, C.H.; Ben-Dyke, R.; Hardy, C.J.; Lewis, D.J.; Hodson-Walker, G.",Food Chem Toxicol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131127/,91

9314,The asymmetric distribution of phosphatidylcholine in rat brain synaptic plasma membranes,2003-03-14,"Background: Advances have been made in selecting sensitive cell lines for isolation, in early detection of respiratory virus growth in cells by rapid culture assays, in production of monoclonal antibodies to improve many tests such as immunofluorescence detection of virus antigens in nasopharyngeal aspirates, in highly sensitive antigen detections by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays (TR-FIAs) and biotin-enzyme immunoassays (BIOTH-E), and, finally, in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of respiratory virus DNA or RNA in clinical specimens. All of these advances have contributed to new or improved possibilities for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections. Objectives and study design: This review summarizes our experiences during the last 15 years in the development of diagnostic tests for respiratory virus infections, and in use of these tests in daily diagnostic work and in epidemiological studies. Results: Immunofluorescence tests based on monoclonal antibodies, all-monoclonal TR-FIAs, and biotin-enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) have about the same sensitivities and specificities. They compare well with the sensitivity of virus culture. PCR followed by liquid-phase hybridization is a sensitive method for detecting adenovirus DNA and enterovirus and rhinovirus RNA in clinical specimens. IgG EIA on paired acute and convalescent phase sera is the most sensitive serological test for respiratory virus infections and is a valuable reference method when evaluating the sensitivity of new diagnostic tests. The IgG avidity test can distinguish primary infections from re-infections at least in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. IgM antibody assays, on the other hand, had low sensitivities in our studies. Conclusions: The choice of diagnostic methods for respiratory virus infections depends on the type and location of the laboratory, the number of specimens tested, and the previous experience of the laboratory. Virus culture, whenever possible, should be the basic diagnostic method; the results, including identification of the virus, should be available no more than 24 h later than the results of rapid diagnostic tests. In small laboratories, especially in hospitals where specimen transportation is well organized, immunofluorescence may be the best choice for antigen detection with the provision that an experienced microscopist and a good UV microscope are available. If the laboratory receives a large number of specimens and has previous experience with EIAs, then biotin-EIAs or TR-FIAs may be the most practical techniques. Their advantages include the stability of the antigens in clinical samples since intact, exfoliated epithelial cells are not required, treatment of specimens is practical, testing of large numbers of specimens is possible, and reading the printed test result is less subjective than reading fluorescence microscopy. The larger role of PCR in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections depends on future developments such as practical methods to extract DNA or RNA and to purify the extracts from nonspecific inhibitors, plus further improvements to minimize cross-contamination. Group-specific detection of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses is an example of the potential for PCR technology. In experienced laboratories. EIA IgG antibody tests should be available. Recombinant antigens may be a useful part of such assays.","Halonen, Pekka; Herholzer, John; Ziegler, Thedi",Clin Diagn Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135643/,91
9403,Antibiotic antagonist: the curious career of René Dubos,2015-11-18,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonotic disease which is a major challenge for clinicians and public health professionals in tropical countries. The cytokine storm during the second (immune) phase is thought to be a major contributory factor for the leptospirosis disease severity. We aim to summarize evidence for cytokine response in leptospirosis at different clinical outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review was carried out to examine the cytokine response in leptospirosis patients using relevant scientific databases. Reference lists of the selected articles were also screened. Quality of the selected studies was assessed by using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. RESULTS: Of the 239 articles retrieved in the initial search, 18 studies fulfilled the selection criteria. India and Thailand have produced the highest number of studies (17% each, n = 3). The majority were comparative cross-sectional studies (72%, n = 13). Overall the quality of the selected studies was fair regardless of few drawbacks such as reporting of sample size and the lack of adjustment for confounders. Microscopic agglutination test (67% - 12/18) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (50% - 9/18) were commonly used for the confirmation of leptospirosis and the measurement of cytokines respectively. IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α levels were found to be significantly higher in severe than in mild leptospirosis. There were equivocal findings on the association between IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-10/TNF-α ratio and disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis had a wide-range of elevated cytokines. However, prospective studies in-relation to the onset of the symptom are required to better understand the pathophysiology of cytokine response in leptospirosis.","Senavirathna, Indika; Rathish, Devarajan; Agampodi, Suneth",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137275/,91

The occurrence of spontaneous human and animal models of demyelination, serologic studies, and epidemiologic data provide pursuasive circumstantial evidence for an infectious trigger in this disease. Potential mechanisms for viral induced demyelination include persistent infection of host tissues or immune mediated organ damage either in the presence or absence of the infectious agent. Any proposed viral candidate should cause demyelination in animals or man and the pattern of infection should be consistent with the unique geographic features of MS epidemiology. In addition, serologic studies should support an infection by the agent and/or viral genome should be detected in MS tissues. At this time no virus can be unequivocally linked to MS but cumulative evidence is more supportive of canine distemper virus than other viruses.","Cook, S.

When the force generated by cyclic interactions between myosin crossbridges and actin filaments is greater than the average load shared by the crossbridges, sliding of the actin filaments occurs and the muscle shortens. The shortening velocity as a function of muscle load can be described mathematically by a hyperbola; this characteristic force–velocity relationship stems from stochastic interactions between the crossbridges and the actin filaments. Beyond the actomyosin interaction, there is not yet a unified theory explaining smooth muscle contraction, mainly because the structure of the contractile unit in smooth muscle (akin to the sarcomere in striated muscle) is still undefined. In this review, functional and structural data from airway smooth muscle are analyzed in an engineering approach of quantification and correlation to support a model of the contractile unit with characteristics revealed by mathematical analyses and behavior matched by experimental observation.","Seow, Chun Y.",J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164502/,91

The viviparous clade, with 446 species, has significantly more species than its sister clade (one species), and high species richness was shown to be an apomorphic trait of only the viviparous gyrodactylids within the Gyrodactylidae. Reconciliation of the phylogenetic tree of the viviparous Gyrodactylidae with that of its hosts showed a low probability for cospeciation suggesting that adaptive modes of speciation and not vicariance were predominant during the historical diversification of the clade. The proposed hypothesis suggests that the Gyrodactylidae originated on the South American continent about 60 Mya after geographical dispersal and host switching of its common ancestor to demersal freshwater catfishes by a marine ancestor. Development of hyperviviparity and the consequent loss of ‘sticky’ eggs in conjunction with other symplesiomorphic and apomorphic features allowed rapid diversification coupled with high dispersal to new host groups and geographical areas by viviparous members of the Gyrodactylidae.","Boeger, Walter A.; Kritsky, Delane C.; Pie, Marcio R.",Zool Scr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165889/,91

10267,TSANZ Oral Presentations,2017-03-15,"Infectious particles can be deposited on surfaces. Susceptible persons who contacted these contaminated surfaces may transfer the pathogens to their mucous membranes via hands, leading to a risk of respiratory infection. The exposure and infection risk contributed by this transmission route depend on indoor surface material, ventilation, and human behavior. In this study, quantitative infection risk assessments were used to compare the significances of these factors. The risks of three pathogens, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus, in an aircraft cabin and in a hospital ward were assessed. Results showed that reducing the contact rate is relatively more effective than increasing the ventilation rate to lower the infection risk. Nonfabric surface materials were found to be much more favorable in the indirect contact transmission for RSV and rhinovirus than fabric surface materials. In the cases considered in this study, halving the ventilation rate and doubling the hand contact rate to surfaces and the hand contact rate to mucous membranes would increase the risk by 3.7–16.2%, 34.4–94.2%, and 24.1–117.7%, respectively. Contacting contaminated nonfabric surfaces may pose an indirect contact risk up to three orders of magnitude higher than that of contacting contaminated fabric surfaces. These findings provide more consideration for infection control and building environmental design.","Sze‐To, Gin Nam; Yang, Yang; Kwan, Joseph K. C.; Yu, Samuel C. T.; Chao, Christopher Y.

Hypoxemia (97.2%), hyperleukocytosis (61.1%) and encephalopathy (52.8%) were common complications. Intensive care needs were mechanical ventilation in 11 (30.6%), vasoactive support in 7 (19.4%) and exchange transfusion in 3 (8.3%). Female gender, apnea, hyperleukocytosis, encephalopathy, need for vasoactive support, and mechanical ventilation predicted mortality.

It exerts remarkable anticancer activity and induces apoptotic cell death in various human cancer cells. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of TET on the inhibition of tumor growth and the induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer in xenograft mice. Tumor weight and volume were measured. The histopathological changes in the tumor tissue were observed. Immunohistochemistry analysis of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) was carried out. The expression of apoptosis-associated genes and proteins, such as cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease-3 (Caspase-3), Survivin, Bax, Bcl-2, BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. TET inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. The mechanism underlying this effect might be mediated by TET-upregulated Caspase-3, Bax, and Bid and downregulated by Bcl-2, Survivin, and PARP. Taken together, this study supported the fact that TET is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of TNBC, thereby providing experimental evidence for its use in the treatment of breast cancer.","Wang, Chun-hui; Yang, Jia-min; Guo, Yu-bo; Shen, Jing; Pei, Xiao-hua",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7345956/,91

METHODS: From January 2005 to June 2008, 48 consecutive patients (male: n=29; median age: 30 years, range 14–51 years) with high-risk acute leukemia underwent allo-SCT following an IDA- or VP16-intensified conditioning regimen. The conditioning regimens were modified BUCY2 (busulfan+cyclophosphamide) consisting of IDA (15 mg/m(2) per day, days -12 to -10) or VP16 (25 mg/kg per day, days -3 to -2) and CY/TBI (cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation) intensified with IDA (15 mg/m(2) per day, days -6 to -5) or VP16 (25 mg/kg per day, days -3 to -2) for acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively. RESULTS: Between the two groups, no significant differences in terms of baseline characteristics, incidence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or transplant-related mortality (TRM) (P=0.50) were observed. However, the IDA group demonstrated higher incidences of mucositis and Aspergillus pneumonia (P<0.01 and P=0.03, respectively). For the IDA and VP16 groups, relapse rates were 28% and 50%, respectively (P=0.13).

Using an in vitro MDCK cystogenesis model, we identified ganoderic acid A (GA-A) as the most promising candidate among the 12 ganoderic acid (GA) monomers. We further showed that GA-A (6.25−100 μM) significantly inhibited cyst growth in MDCK cyst model and embryonic kidney cyst model in vitro, and the inhibitory effect was reversible. In kidney-specific Pkd1 knockout (kPKD) mice displaying severe cystic kidney disease, administration of GA-A (50 mg· kg(−1) ·d(−1), sc) significantly attenuated renal cyst development. In both MDCK cells and kidney of kPKD mice, we revealed that GA-A dose-dependently downregulated the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. The expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was also suppressed, suggesting a possible effect of GA-A on cell proliferation.

Specifically, genes involved in innate immune responses and chemokines and receptors associated with T-cell homing to lymphoid tissues were down regulated. As a result, homing of virus-specific T-cells to lymphoid tissues seems to be ineffective, evidenced by the lower frequencies of virus-specific T-cell in lymphoid tissue than in peripheral blood. Genes associated with T-cell exhaustion were upregulated. Likewise, genes involved in the anti-apoptotic pathway were upregulated.

Nitrogen-containing glycomimetics such as aza- or iminosugars are known to behave as PCs for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). As part of our research into lysosomal sphingolipidoses inhibitors and looking in particular for new β-galactosidase inhibitors, we report the synthesis of a series of alkylated azasugars with a relative “all-cis” configuration at the hydroxy/amine-substituted stereocenters. The novel compounds were synthesized from a common carbohydrate-derived piperidinone intermediate 8, through reductive amination or alkylation of the derived alcohol. In addition, the reaction of ketone 8 with several lithium acetylides allowed the stereoselective synthesis of new azasugars alkylated at C-3. The activity of the new compounds towards lysosomal β-galactosidase was negligible, showing that the presence of an alkyl chain in this position is detrimental to inhibitory activity. Interestingly, 9, 10, and 12 behave as good inhibitors of lysosomal β-glucosidase (GCase) (IC(50) = 12, 6.4, and 60 µM, respectively). When tested on cell lines bearing the Gaucher mutation, they did not impart any enzyme rescue.

However, the serious cardiotoxic effect restricted its clinical application. We previously have illuminated the protective role of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) is one of the endogenous inhibitors of both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling. In this study, we investigated the relationship between sFRP1 and noncanonical Wnt/PCP-JNK (Wnt/planar cell polarity-c-Jun N-terminal kinase) pathway in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. We showed that treatment of H9c2 cardiac myoblasts with Dox (1 μM) time-dependently suppressed cell viability accompanied by significantly decreased sFRP1 protein level and increased Wnt/PCP-JNK signaling. Pretreatment with SP600125, the Wnt/PCP-JNK signaling inhibitor, attenuated Dox-induced apoptosis of H9c2 cells. Overexpression of sFRP1 protected H9c2 cells from Dox-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the Wnt/PCP-JNK pathway. After intraperitoneal injection of a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg Dox, rats displayed significant cardiac dysfunction; their heart showed inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling and activated Wnt/PCP-JNK signaling.

13611,A second cohort of CHD3 patients expands the molecular mechanisms known to cause Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome,2020-06-01,"Neuroinflammation is a major contributor to secondary neuronal injury that accounts for a significant proportion of final brain cell loss in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). However, the immunological mechanisms that underlie HIE remain unclear. MicroRNA-210 (miR-210) is the master “hypoxamir” and plays a key role in hypoxic-ischemic tissue damage. Herein, we report in an animal model of neonatal rats that HIE significantly upregulated miR-210 expression in microglia in the neonatal brain and strongly induced activated microglia. Intracerebroventricular administration of miR-210 antagomir effectively suppressed microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and significantly reduced brain injury caused by HIE. We demonstrated that miR-210 induced microglial M1 activation partly by targeting SIRT1, thereby reducing the deacetylation of the NF-κB subunit p65 and increasing NF-κB signaling activity. Thus, our study identified miR-210 as a novel regulator of microglial activation in neonatal HIE, highlighting a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of infants with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.","Li, Bo; Dasgupta, Chiranjib; Huang, Lei; Meng, Xianmei; Zhang, Lubo",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608107/,91

This is the first prospective incidence study of presumed ocular tuberculosis performed in the United Kingdom (UK). METHOD: New cases of ocular tuberculosis presenting to hospitals in the UK were prospectively ascertained between October 2016 and November 2017 with the aid of the British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit (BOSU). Initial presentation data and 1-year follow-up data was collected using questionnaires. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were recruited giving an overall incidence for ocular TB of 0.73 per million population per annum. The origin of birth for 71% of the patients was a non-UK country and 87.5% had their initial diagnosis of TB made by an ophthalmologist. The most common first line treatment was isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide which 71% of patients were treated with 60% of patients were commenced on a reducing course of oral steroids. At 1-year follow-up, 29 patients (83%) had complete resolution of active clinical signs. Mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at presentation was +0.41 LogMAR(SD = 0.62), compared to +0.31 LogMAR (SD = 0.56) at 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: It is increasingly the responsibility of the ophthalmologist to diagnose ocular TB and although it remains a rare condition, consensus on diagnostic criteria and treatment is required. Increasing recognition and accessibility to gamma-interferon testing should enable earlier detection. Treatment with quadruple ATT treatment regimens for at least 6 months shows good clinical outcomes. However, it is still unclear whether steroid use is beneficial. Further large studies with longer follow-up would be warranted to answer these questions.","Shirley, Katherine; Dowlut, Samir; Silvestri, Julie; Pavesio, Carlos; Foot, Barny",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608193/,91

In the present study, the interplay within algae-dominated microbial communities exposed to harsh environmental influences in the Austrian Alps was assessed in order to reveal the interconnectivity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic inhabitants. All analyzed snowfields harbored distinct microbial communities. Network analyses revealed that mutual exclusion prevailed among microalgae in the alpine environment, while bacteria were mainly positively embedded in the interaction networks. Especially members of Proteobacteria, with a high prevalence of Oxalobacteraceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Sphingomonadaceae showed genus-specific co-occurrences with distinct microalgae. Co-cultivation experiments with algal and bacterial isolates confirmed beneficial interactions that were predicted based on the bioinformatic analyses; they resulted in up to 2.6-fold more biomass for the industrially relevant microalga Chlorella vulgaris, and up to 4.6-fold increase in biomass for the cryophilic Chloromonas typhlos. Our findings support the initial hypothesis that microbial communities exposed to adverse environmental conditions in alpine systems harbor inter-kingdom supportive capacities. The insights into mutualistic inter-kingdom interactions and the ecology of microalgae within complex microbial communities provide explanations for the prevalence and resilience of such assemblages in alpine environments.","Krug, Lisa; Erlacher, Armin; Markut, Katharina; Berg, Gabriele; Cernava, Tomislav",ISME J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608445/,91

The lipid-derived messenger oleoylethanolamide (OEA) acts as a satiety signal inhibiting food intake through the involvement of central noradrenergic and oxytocinergic neurons. We investigated the anti-binge effects of OEA in a rat model of binge-like eating, in which, after cycles of intermittent food restrictions/refeeding and palatable food consumptions, female rats show a binge-like intake of palatable food, following a 15-min exposure to their sight and smell (“frustration stress”). Systemically administered OEA dose-dependently (2.5, 5, and 10 mg kg(−1)) prevented binge-like eating. This behavioral effect was associated with a decreased activation (measured by mapping the expression of c-fos, an early gene widely used as a marker of cellular activation) of brain areas responding to stress (such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) and to a stimulation of areas involved in the control of food intake, such as the VTA and the PVN. These effects were paralleled, also, to the modulation of monoamine transmission in key brain areas involved in both homeostatic and hedonic control of eating. In particular, a decreased dopaminergic response to stress was observed by measuring dopamine extracellular concentrations in microdialysates from the nucleus accumbens shell, whereas an increased serotonergic and noradrenergic tone was detected in tissue homogenates of selected brain areas. Finally, a decrease in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA levels was induced by OEA in the central amygdala, while an increase in oxytocin mRNA levels was induced in the PVN. The restoration of a normal oxytocin receptor density in the striatum paralleled the oxytocinergic stimulation produced by OEA. In conclusion, we provide evidence suggesting that OEA might represent a novel potential pharmacological target for the treatment of binge-like eating behavior.","Romano, Adele; Micioni Di Bonaventura, Maria Vittoria; Gallelli, Cristina Anna; Koczwara, Justyna Barbara; Smeets, Dorien; Giusepponi, Maria Elena; De Ceglia, Marialuisa; Friuli, Marzia; Micioni Di Bonaventura, Emanuela; Scuderi, Caterina; Vitalone, Annabella; Tramutola, Antonella; Altieri, Fabio; Lutz, Thomas A.; Giudetti, Anna Maria; Cassano, Tommaso; Cifani, Carlo; Gaetani, Silvana",Neuropsychopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7609309/,91

Emergency medicine (EM) physicians should feel comfortable encountering these conditions. We assessed EM physicians’ comfort working up, diagnosing, and managing ophthalmic emergencies. SUBJECTS/METHODS: 329 EM physicians participated in this cross-sectional multicentre survey. Questions inquired about the amount, type, and self-perceived adequacy of ophthalmic training. Likert scales were used to assess confidence and comfort working up, diagnosing, and managing ophthalmic emergencies. RESULTS: Participants recall receiving a median of 5 and 10 h of ophthalmic training in medical school and residency, respectively. Few feel this prepared them for residency (16.5%) or practice (52.0%). Only 50.6% feel confident with their ophthalmic exam. Most (75.0%) feel confident in their ability to identify an ophthalmic emergency, but 58.8% feel well prepared to work them up. Responders feel more comfortable diagnosing acute retrobulbar hematoma (72.5%), retinal detachment (69.8%), and acute angle closure glaucoma (78.0%) than central retinal artery occlusion (28.9%) or giant cell arteritis (53.2%). Only 60.2% feel comfortable determining if canthotomy and cantholysis is necessary in the setting of acute retrobulbar hematoma, and 40.3% feel comfortable performing the procedure. There was a trend towards attending physicians and providers in urban and academic settings feeling more comfortable diagnosing and managing ophthalmic emergencies compared to trainees, non-urban, and non-academic physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Many participants do not feel comfortable using ophthalmic equipment, performing an eye exam, making vision or potentially life-saving diagnoses, or performing vision-saving procedures, suggesting the need to increase ophthalmic training in EM curricula.","Uhr, Joshua H.; Governatori, Nicholas J.; Zhang, Qiang (Ed); Hamershock, Rose; Radell, Jake E.; Lee, Jun Yeop; Tatum, Jasmine; Wu, Albert Y.",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7609324/,91

It frequently emerges in the presence of immunosuppression states such as myeloproliferative syndrome (MS). MS is treated with ruxolitinib, a selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor. Avelumab, an anti PDL-1 inhibitor, is the standard treatment for MCC. To date it is unknown if avelumab and ruxolitinib have a synergistic or antagonistic effect when used together. Methods: We have identified all patients diagnosed with MCC, treated with avelumab, concomitant ruxolitinib, belonging to Tortora Hospital, Pagani and Santa Maria La Pietà Hospital, Nola, Italy between June 1 2019 and April 1 2020. Results: Among six MCC patients, we have found two patients in treatment with concomitant drugs. Both patients were being treated with ruxolitinib for MS as a standard regimen without suffering any hematological side effects. After starting doses of avelumab, we found thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia after cycle 1 and cycle 4, respectively, and decided to suspend both treatments. Following the suspension, the hematological values improved allowing us to restart treatment with avelumab without the need to resume ruxolitinib treatment. Conclusions: The combined treatment of ruxolitinib and avelumab demonstrated severe toxicity. Modifying the schedule or reducing the dose of both drugs needs to be studied in order to be able to treat both pathologies.","Buonerba, Luciana; Di Trolio, Rossella; Grimaldi, Antonio; Tucci, Aniello; Leo, Emilio; Ingenito, Concetta; Costabile, Ferdinando; Ragone, Gianluca; Savastano, Beatrice; Uzzauto, Maria Teresa; Belsito Petrizzi, Valeria; Di Lorenzo, Giuseppe",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7642625/,91

We investigated MAIT cells during clinical and experimental sepsis, and their contribution to host responses. In experimental sepsis, MAIT-deficient mice had significantly increased mortality and bacterial load, and reduced tissue-specific cytokine responses. MAIT cells of WT mice expressed lower levels of IFN-γ and IL-17a during sepsis compared to sham surgery, changes not seen in non-MAIT T cells. MAIT cells of patients at sepsis presentation were significantly reduced in frequency compared to healthy donors, and were more activated, with decreased IFN-γ production, compared to both healthy donors and paired 90-day samples. Our data suggest that MAIT cells are highly activated and become dysfunctional during clinical sepsis, and contribute to tissue-specific cytokine responses that are protective against mortality during experimental sepsis.","Trivedi, Shubhanshi; Labuz, Daniel; Anderson, Cole P; Araujo, Claudia V; Blair, Antoinette; Middleton, Elizabeth A; Jensen, Owen; Tran, Alexander; Mulvey, Matthew A; Campbell, Robert A; Hale, J Scott; Rondina, Matthew T; Leung, Daniel T",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7679140/,91

Nevertheless, we still lack an adequate understanding of HPAI H5N1 epidemiology and infection ecology. The nature of the wild waterfowl–poultry interface, and the sharing of diverse wetland habitat among these birds, currently underscore important knowledge gaps. India has emerged as a global hotspot for HPAI H5N1, while also providing critical wintering habitat for many species of migratory waterfowl and year-round habitat for several resident waterfowl species. The current study sought to examine the extent to which the wild waterfowl–poultry interface, varied wetland habitat, and climate influence HPAI H5N1 epizootics in poultry in India. Using World Organisation for Animal Health reported outbreaks, this study showed that the wild waterfowl–poultry interface and lacustrine, riparian, and coastal marsh wetland systems were strongly associated with landscape suitability, and these relationships varied by scale. Although increasing poultry density was associated with increasing risk, this was only the case in the absence of wild waterfowl habitat, and only at a local scale. In landscapes increasingly shared between wild waterfowl and poultry, suitability was greater among lower density poultry, again at a local scale only. These findings provide further insight into the occurrence of HPAI H5N1 in India and suggest important landscape targets for blocking the waterfowl–poultry interface to interrupt virus transmission and prevent future outbreaks.","Walsh, Michael G.; Mor, Siobhan M.; Hossain, Shah",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7697759/,91

Effective monitoring and surveillance of VBDs is of paramount importance for the prevention of and timely response to outbreaks. Although international regulations exist to support this, barriers and operational challenges within countries hamper efficient monitoring. As a first step to optimise VBD surveillance and monitoring, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of system characteristics and experiences in to date non-endemic regions at risk of becoming endemic in the future. Therefore, this study qualitatively analyses the nature and flexibility of VBD surveillance and response in Beijing. Methods: In this qualitative study, eleven experts working in Beijing’s vector-borne diseases surveillance and response system were interviewed about vector-borne disease surveillance, early warning, response, and strengths and weaknesses of the current approach. Results: Vector-borne disease surveillance occurs using passive syndromic surveillance and separate vector surveillance. Public health authorities use internet reporting networks to determine vector-borne disease risk across Beijing. Response toward a vector-borne disease outbreak is uncommon in this setting due to the currently low occurrence of outbreaks. Conclusions: A robust network of centralised institutions provides the continuity and flexibility needed to adapt and manage possible vector-borne disease threats. Opportunities exist for population-based health promotion and the integration of environment and climate monitoring in vector-borne disease surveillance.","Lock-Wah-Hoon, Jerome; Zheng, Yang; Braks, Marieta; van Asten, Liselotte; Liu, Qiyong; Sushama, Preeti; Doreleijers, Simone; Krafft, Thomas; van der Hoek, Wim; Fanoy, Ewout; Wang, Quanyi; Pilot, Eva",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7698447/,91

Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Prognosticating after ICH is complex and may be influenced by clinicians’ subjective impressions and biases, which may, in turn, influence decision making regarding the level of care provided. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore perceptions of neurocritical care in relation to the expected functional outcome for ICH patients. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with neurocritical care doctors and nurses. SETTING: Neurocritical care (NCC) department in a UK neuroscience tertiary referral center. SUBJECTS: Eleven neurocritical care nurses, five consultant neurointensivists, two stroke physicians, three neurosurgeons. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We conducted 21 semi-structured interviews and identified five key themes: (1) prognostic uncertainty (2) subjectivity of good versus poor outcome (3) perceived inappropriate care (PIC) situations (including for frail elderly patients) (4) challenging nature of decision-making (5) clinician distress. CONCLUSIONS: Caring for severely affected ICH patients in need of neurocritical care is challenging, particularly with frail elderly patients. Awareness of the challenges could facilitate interventions to improve decision-making for this group of stroke patients and their families, as well as measures to reduce the distress on clinicians who care for this patient group. Our findings highlight the need for effective interdisciplinary shared decision making involving the family, taking into account patients’ previously expressed values and preferences and incorporating these into bespoke care planning.","Mc Lernon, Siobhan; Werring, David; Terry, Louise",Neurocrit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7707900/,91

One of the populations that can benefit the most from them are elderly people. Unfortunately, in this group, vaccines are less effective than in other groups, due to immunosenescence. The immune system ages like the whole body and becomes less effective in responding to infections and vaccinations. At the same time, immunosenescence also favors an inflammatory microenvironment, which is linked to many conditions typical of the geriatrics population. The microbiota is one of the key actors in modulating the immune response and, in this review, we discuss the current evidence on the role of microbiota in regulating the immune response to vaccines, particularly in elderly people.","Cianci, Rossella; Franza, Laura; Massaro, Maria Grazia; Borriello, Raffaele; De Vito, Francesco; Gambassi, Giovanni",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7712068/,91

METHODS: A systematic search was employed to identify studies that examined creative arts interventions for older informal caregivers, which were synthesised in this integrative review. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, EBSCO, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We also backwards searched references of all relevant studies and inspected trials registers. RESULTS: Of the 516 studies identified, 17 were included: one was quantitative, nine were qualitative and seven used mixed methods. All included quantitative studies were pilot or feasibility studies employing pre- and post-test design with small sample sizes. Studies varied in relation to the type of creative intervention and evaluation methods, which precluded meta-analysis. Large effect sizes were detected in wellbeing measures following singing and art interventions. The qualitative synthesis highlighted that interventions created space for caregivers to make sense of, accept and adapt to their identity as a caregiver. Personal developments, such as learning new skills, were viewed positively by caregivers as well as welcoming the opportunity to gain cognitive and behavioural skills, and having opportunities to unload emotions in a safe space were important to caregivers. Group creative interventions were particularly helpful in creating social connections with their care-recipients and other caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: The current review revealed all creative interventions focused on caregivers of people living with dementia; subsequently, this identified gaps in the evidence of creative interventions for informal caregivers of other neurological conditions. There are encouraging preliminary data on music and art interventions, however, little data exists on other art forms, e.g., drama, dance. Creative interventions may appeal to many caregivers, offering a range of psycho-social benefits. The findings of the current review open the way for future research to develop appropriate and creative arts programmes and to test their efficacy with robust tools.","Irons, J.

14495,Recent Development of Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase Inhibitors for Human Diseases: A Future Perspective,2020-12-01,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Ctenolepisma longicaudata is emerging as a nuisance pest in private homes in some European countries, and it is considered a serious problem in museums and libraries where it can do damage to objects of historical value. It is a silverfish that may be difficult to eradicate because it utilizes many parts of a building. Heavy use of pesticides is undesirable from a health perspective, and baits with low concentrations of toxins are consequently preferable. To safeguard the indoor environment during management, the present study describes procedures for the efficient control of Ctenolepisma longicaudata with small amounts of bait. This is as efficient, as sprayable pesticides and declines with more than 90% reduction of the pest population can be achieved within 15 to 20 weeks. Successful eradication can be achieved with as little as 0.5 to 1.0 g bait per 100 m(2). ABSTRACT: Pest management strives to be an efficient, yet healthy and environmentally safe control method, and the use of poisoned bait often fulfils these criteria. In the present study, we show that bait with indoxacarb as the active ingredient is highly efficient for controlling Ctenolepisma longicaudata (Escherich, 1905) and two of its relatives, Lepisma saccharina (Linnaeus, 1758) and Ctenolepisma calva (Ritter, 1910). Applying small bait droplets (size ~10 mg) along the walls of several types of buildings, at no more than 0.5 to 1.0 g bait per 100 m(2), was a cost-efficient and safe strategy for the knockdown and eradication of C. longicaudata. During field experiments, the demography changed from an initial mixture of different stages to total dominance of early instars preceding the population collapse. Poisonous bait outcompeted mass-trapping with sticky-traps and conventional insect spray treatment for the efficient control of C. longicaudata in apartments. Different droplet densities (1 vs. 0.5/m(2)) and active ingredients (indoxacarb vs. clothianidin) did not have different effects in field experiments. These results show that poisoned bait is a highly relevant tool for managing C. longicaudata and potentially against other silverfish infestations.","Aak, Anders; Hage, Morten; Lindstedt, Heidi Heggen; Rukke, Bjørn Arne",Insects,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7760683/,91

It is therefore important to systematically summarize published literature in order to find out which mental health interventions generate effective support for informal caregivers of persons living with dementia. The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of intervention content, effectiveness and subgroup differentiation of mental health interventions for informal caregivers of persons with dementia living at home. METHOD: We searched four electronic databases (PubMed, PsychINFO, Scopus and CINAHL) and included only methodically high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English or German language between 2009 and 2018. The intervention programmes focused on mental health of family caregivers. A narrative synthesis of the included studies is given. RESULTS: Forty-eight publications relating to 46 intervention programmes met the inclusion criteria. Burden, depression and quality of life (QoL) are the predominant parameters that were investigated. Twenty-five of forty-six interventions (54.3%) show positive effects on at least one of the outcomes examined. Most often, positive effects are reported for the outcome subjective burden (46.2%). Only six studies explicitly target on a certain subgroup of informal dementia caregivers (13%), whereas all other interventions (87%) target the group as a whole without differentiation. CONCLUSION: The most beneficial results were found for cognitive behavioural approaches, especially concerning the reduction of depressive symptoms. Besides this, leisure and physical activity interventions show some good results in reducing subjective caregiver burden.

Research was carried out using data obtained from a questionnaire administered to a representative sample of students who took the university entrance examination (PEvAU, its Spanish acronym) in Spanish North Africa. A quantitative research design was adopted in which multivariate analysis (MANOVA) was applied anda decision tree, which was also used for graphical and analytical analysis. The main results indicated a significant influence of parents on their children’s choices, this being the best predictor regarding the decision to take the said examination. It was also verified that their choice of Spanish Baccalaureate programme was significantly associated with their selected career path, and gender and socioeconomic status had a significant impact on that decision. These results lead to the need for further research on guidance from secondary education onwards. It would be interesting to analyse factors neglected thus far, such as those related to the cultural environment of students.","Olmos-Gómez, María del Carmen; Luque-Suárez, Mónica; Becerril-Ruiz, Diego; Cuevas-Rincón, Jesús Manuel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7908397/,91
15694,Pancreatogenic Diabetes: Triggering Effects of Alcohol and HIV,2021-02-03,"The interaction and crosstalk of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is an established pathway in which the innate immune system recognises and fights pathogens. In a single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis of an Indian cohort, we found evidence for both TLR4-399T and TRL8-1A conveying increased susceptibility towards tuberculosis (TB) in an interdependent manner, even though there is no established TLR4 ligand present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which is the causative pathogen of TB. Docking studies revealed that TLR4 and TLR8 can build a heterodimer, allowing interaction with TLR8 ligands. The conformational change of TLR4-399T might impair this interaction. With immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we precipitated TLR4 with TLR8-targeted antibodies, indicating heterodimerisation. Confocal microscopy confirmed a high co-localisation frequency of TLR4 and TLR8 that further increased upon TLR8 stimulation. The heterodimerisation of TLR4 and TLR8 led to an induction of IL12p40, NF-κB, and IRF3. TLR4-399T in interaction with TLR8 induced an increased NF-κB response as compared to TLR4-399C, which was potentially caused by an alteration of subsequent immunological pathways involving type I IFNs. In summary, we present evidence that the heterodimerisation of TLR4 and TLR8 at the endosome is involved in Mtb recognition via TLR8 ligands, such as microbial RNA, which induces a Th1 response. These findings may lead to novel targets for therapeutic interventions and vaccine development regarding TB.","Thada, Shruthi; Horvath, Gabor L.; Müller, Mario M.; Dittrich, Nickel; Conrad, Melanie L.; Sur, Saubashya; Hussain, Abid; Pelka, Karin; Gaddam, Suman Latha; Latz, Eicke; Slevogt, Hortense; Schumann, Ralf R.; Burkert, Sanne",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7913854/,91
15799,High Levels of Genetic Variation in MHC-Linked Microsatellite Markers from Native Chicken Breeds,2021-02-08,"Infiltration of the endothelial layer of the blood-brain barrier by leukocytes plays a critical role in health and disease. When passing through the endothelial layer during the diapedesis process lymphocytes can either follow a paracellular route or a transcellular one. There is a debate whether these two processes constitute one mechanism, or they form two evolutionary distinct migration pathways. We used artificial intelligence, phylogenetic analysis, HH search, ancestor sequence reconstruction to investigate further this intriguing question. We found that the two systems share several ancient components, such as RhoA protein that plays a critical role in controlling actin movement in both mechanisms. However, some of the key components differ between these two transmigration processes. CAV1 genes emerged during Trichoplax adhaerens, and it was only reported in transcellular process. Paracellular process is dependent on PECAM1. PECAM1 emerged from FASL5 during Zebrafish divergence. Lastly, both systems employ late divergent genes such as ICAM1 and VECAM1. Taken together, our results suggest that these two systems constitute two different mechanical sensing mechanisms of immune cell infiltrations of the brain, yet these two systems are connected. We postulate that the mechanical properties of the cellular polarity is the main driving force determining the migration pathway. Our analysis indicates that both systems coevolved with immune cells, evolving to a higher level of complexity in association with the evolution of the immune system.","Mickael, Michel-Edwar; Kubick, Norwin; Klimovich, Pavel; Flournoy, Patrick Henckell; Bieńkowska, Irmina; Sacharczuk, Mariusz",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7916592/,91

In this review we have highlighted the results of the most recent studies published and have related what the evidence suggests and how we can utilize this knowledge best in directing patients’ diets and future research at this time. ABSTRACT: Many studies performed to date have implicated select microbes and dietary factors in a variety of cancers, yet the complexity of both these diseases and the relationship between these factors has limited the ability to translate findings into therapies and preventative guidelines. Here we begin by discussing recently published studies relating to dietary factors, such as vitamins and chemical compounds used as ingredients, and their contribution to cancer development. We further review recent studies, which display evidence of the microbial-diet interaction in the context of cancer. The field continues to advance our understanding of the development of select cancers and how dietary factors are related to the development, prevention, and treatment of these cancers. Finally, we highlight the science available in the discussion of common misconceptions with regards to cancer and diet. We conclude this review with thoughts on where we believe future research should focus in order to provide the greatest impact towards human health and preventative medicine.","Armstrong, Heather; Bording-Jorgensen, Michael; Wine, Eytan",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7917909/,91

ROS are involved in a plethora of processes in cells in all domains of life, ranging from bacteria, plants and animals, including humans. The importance of ROS for macrophage-mediated immunity is unquestioned. Their functions comprise direct antimicrobial activity against bacteria and parasites as well as redox-regulation of immune signaling and induction of inflammasome activation. However, only a few studies have performed in-depth ROS analyses and even fewer have identified the precise redox-regulated target molecules.

DHM use for healthy, term infants is increasing, but evidence for growth and tolerability is limited. This retrospective study evaluated growth in term infants in the community who received DHM from a UK milk bank. Mothers of infants receiving DHM between 2017 and 2019 were contacted (n = 49), and 31 (63.2%) agreed to participate. Fourteen infants received DHM as a supplement to other feeds (MOM and/or infant formula) and 17 were exclusively fed DHM where breastfeeding was impossible (range: 3–6 weeks). Growth was assessed by deriving z‐scores using the WHO standard for infant growth and compared with 200 exclusively breastfed infants. Multivariate regression analysis revealed no feeding method‐specific association between z‐score and age, nor between weight and age, suggesting that z‐scores and growth velocity were not affected by feeding exclusive MOM, supplemental DHM or exclusive DHM. DHM was well‐tolerated with no adverse events that led to early cessation. After receiving supplemental DHM group, 63% of infants whose mothers had no physical barrier to breastfeeding (5/8 infants) were exclusively breastfed. This novel study reports adequate growth outcomes of healthy nonhospitalized infants receiving DHM, either as the sole milk source or supplement. Prospective studies are needed to confirm whether DHM is a suitable feeding alternative for term infants in the community, optimal durations, as well as the impact of DHM availability on breastfeeding rates and maternal mental health.","Bramer, Solange; Boyle, Robert; Weaver, Gillian; Shenker, Natalie",Matern Child Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988867/,91

These increases in volume, diversity and complexity of the data generated and their analysis expose the necessity of a structured and standardized reporting template. BioCompute Objects (BCOs) provide the requisite support for communication of HTS data analysis that includes support for workflow, as well as data, curation, accessibility and reproducibility of communication. BCOs standardize how researchers report provenance and the established verification and validation protocols used in workflows while also being robust enough to convey content integration or curation in knowledge bases. BCOs that encapsulate tools, platforms, datasets and workflows are FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) compliant. Providing operational workflow and data information facilitates interoperability between platforms and incorporation of future dataset within an HTS analysis for use within industrial, academic and regulatory settings. Cloud-based platforms, including High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE), Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) and Galaxy, support BCO generation for users. Given the 100K+ userbase between these platforms, BioCompute can be leveraged for workflow documentation. In this paper, we report the availability of platform-dependent and platform-independent BCO tools: HIVE BCO App, CGC BCO App, Galaxy BCO API Extension and BCO Portal. Community engagement was utilized to evaluate tool efficacy. We demonstrate that these tools further advance BCO creation from text editing approaches used in earlier releases of the standard. Moreover, we demonstrate that integrating BCO generation within existing analysis platforms greatly streamlines BCO creation while capturing granular workflow details.

16986,Alternative splicing in normal and pathological human placentas is correlated to genetic variants,2021-01-12,"Advances in experimental technologies, such as DNA sequencing, have opened up new avenues for the applications of phylogenetic methods to various fields beyond their traditional application in evolutionary investigations, extending to the fields of development, differentiation, cancer genomics, and immunogenomics. Thus, the importance of phylogenetic methods is increasingly being recognized, and the development of a novel phylogenetic approach can contribute to several areas of research. Recently, the use of hyperbolic geometry has attracted attention in artificial intelligence research. Hyperbolic space can better represent a hierarchical structure compared to Euclidean space, and can therefore be useful for describing and analyzing a phylogenetic tree. In this study, we developed a novel metric that considers the characteristics of a phylogenetic tree for representation in hyperbolic space. We compared the performance of the proposed hyperbolic embeddings, general hyperbolic embeddings, and Euclidean embeddings, and confirmed that our method could be used to more precisely reconstruct evolutionary distance. We also demonstrate that our approach is useful for predicting the nearest-neighbor node in a partial phylogenetic tree with missing nodes. Furthermore, we proposed a novel approach based on our metric to integrate multiple trees for analyzing tree nodes or imputing missing distances. This study highlights the utility of adopting a geometric approach for further advancing the applications of phylogenetic methods.","Matsumoto, Hirotaka; Mimori, Takahiro; Fukunaga, Tsukasa",Biol Methods Protoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8058397/,91

Sixty-three bulls were distributed over 3 treatments and fed SS, SY, or OH-SeMet at 0.2 mg kg(−1) dry matter (DM) for 60 d. None of the Se sources affected the growth performance or carcass characteristics. OH-SeMet showed a higher Se transfer to the meat than SS or SY (p < 0.01). SY and OH-SeMet reduced the shear force of the meat (p < 0.0001), improved pH (p < 0.001), and reduced the drip losses (p < 0.001) and the lipid oxidation of the meat (p < 0.001). During 8 d of storage, OH-SeMet showed higher levels of meat lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) than SS (p < 0.001), while the SY meat showed a higher L* than SS, albeit only on d 6. OH-SeMet improved b*, compared to SS, and also compared to SY on days 4, 7, and 8 (p < 0.001). Supplementing beef with SY and OH-SeMet improved several meat quality parameters.

The risk factors affecting the survival and multidrug-resistance of tuberculosis patients were examined. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used to assess the differences in survival among the patients, while Cox regression model was used for multivariate analysis. The qualitative data was tested with chi-square test in the single factor analysis of multidrug-resistant TB. Multivariate analysis was performed using binary logistic regression analysis. The significance level for all the tests were set at 0.05. The mean period of the follow-up of patients was 10 months. In the 337 patients, 33 (9.8%) died, the 21-month survival rate was 90.2%. The results of multivariate Cox regression analysis show that overcrowding (HR = 7.942, 95% CI 3.258–19.356), former smoking (HR = 3.773, 95% CI 1.601–8.889), current smoking (HR = 3.546, 95% CI 1.195–10.521), multidrug-resistance tuberculosis (HR = 4.632, 95% CI 1.913–11.217) were risk factors for death during anti-tuberculosis treatment in TB patients in Liberia.

17183,Sphingomyelin liposome bearing whole Leishmania lysate antigens induce strong Th2 immune response in BALB/c mice,2021-02-11,"BACKGROUND: Despite recent intensification of control measures, Plasmodium vivax poses a major challenge for malaria elimination efforts. Liver-stage hypnozoite parasites that cause relapsing infections can be cleared with primaquine; however, poor treatment adherence undermines drug effectiveness. Tafenoquine, a new single-dose treatment, offers an alternative option for preventing relapses and reducing transmission. In 2018, over 237,000 cases of malaria were reported to the Brazilian health system, of which 91.5% were due to P. vivax. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated the impact of introducing tafenoquine into case management practices on population-level transmission dynamics using a mathematical model of P. vivax transmission. The model was calibrated to reflect the transmission dynamics of P. vivax endemic settings in Brazil in 2018, informed by nationwide malaria case reporting data. Parameters for treatment pathways with chloroquine, primaquine, and tafenoquine with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) testing were informed by clinical trial data and the literature. We assumed 71.3% efficacy for primaquine and tafenoquine, a 66.7% adherence rate to the 7-day primaquine regimen, a mean 5.5% G6PDd prevalence, and 8.1% low metaboliser prevalence. The introduction of tafenoquine is predicted to improve effective hypnozoite clearance among P. vivax cases and reduce population-level transmission over time, with heterogeneous levels of impact across different transmission settings. According to the model, while achieving elimination in only few settings in Brazil, tafenoquine rollout in 2021 is estimated to improve the mean effective radical cure rate from 42% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 41%–44%) to 62% (95% UI 54%–68%) among clinical cases, leading to a predicted 38% (95% UI 7%–99%) reduction in transmission and over 214,000 cumulative averted cases between 2021 and 2025. Higher impact is predicted in settings with low transmission, low pre-existing primaquine adherence, and a high proportion of cases in working-aged males. High-transmission settings with a high proportion of cases in children would benefit from a safe high-efficacy tafenoquine dose for children. Our methodological limitations include not accounting for the role of imported cases from outside the transmission setting, relying on reported clinical cases as a measurement of community-level transmission, and implementing treatment efficacy as a binary condition. CONCLUSIONS: In our modelling study, we predicted that, provided there is concurrent rollout of G6PDd diagnostics, tafenoquine has the potential to reduce P. vivax transmission by improving effective radical cure through increased adherence and increased protection from new infections. While tafenoquine alone may not be sufficient for P. vivax elimination, its introduction will improve case management, prevent a substantial number of cases, and bring countries closer to achieving malaria elimination goals.","Nekkab, Narimane; Lana, Raquel; Lacerda, Marcus; Obadia, Thomas; Siqueira, André; Monteiro, Wuelton; Villela, Daniel; Mueller, Ivo; White, Michael",PLoS Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8064585/,91

Memory is a key feature of adaptive immunity, which allows organisms to respond more readily upon re-infections. However, differentiation of memory cells is still one of the least understood cell fate decisions. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework to characterize optimal strategies to store memory to maximize the utility of immune response over an organism’s lifetime. We show that memory production should be actively regulated to balance between affinity and cross-reactivity of immune receptors for an effective protection against evolving pathogens. Moreover, we predict that specificity of memory should depend on the organism’s lifespan, and shorter lived organisms with fewer pathogenic encounters should store more cross-reactive memory. Our framework provides a baseline to gauge the efficacy of immune memory in light of an organism’s coevolutionary history with pathogens.","Schnaack, Oskar H; Nourmohammad, Armita",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8116052/,91

To date, there is no FDA-approved licensed vaccine against arenaviruses and treatments have been limited to supportive therapy. Hence, the study was employed to design a highly immunogenic cross-reactive vaccine against Arenaviridae family using reverse vaccinology approach. The whole proteome of Lassa virus (LASV), Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Lujo virus and Guanarito virus were retrieved and assessed to determine the most antigenic viral proteins. Both T-cell and B-cell epitopes were predicted and screened based on transmembrane topology, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and molecular docking analysis. The final constructs were designed using different adjuvants, top epitopes, PADRE sequence and respective linkers and were assessed for the efficacy, safety, stability and molecular cloning purposes. The proposed epitopes were highly conserved (84%–100%) and showed greater cumulative population coverage. Moreover, T cell epitope GWPYIGSRS was conserved in Junin virus (Argentine mammarenavirus) and Sabia virus (Brazilian mammarenavirus), while B cell epitope NLLYKICLSG was conserved in Machupo virus (Bolivian mammarenavirus) and Sabia virus, indicating the possibility of final vaccine construct to confer a broad range immunity in the host. Docking analysis of the refined vaccine with different MHC molecules and human immune receptors were biologically significant. The vaccine-receptor (V1-TLR3) complex showed minimal deformability at molecular level and was compatible for cloning into pET28a(+) vector of E. coli strain K12. The study could be helpful in developing vaccine to combat arenaviral infections in the future.

AgNPs were synthesized and characterized using TEM, XRD and FTIR spectroscopy. A. baumannii (n = 200) were isolated and identified. Resistance pattern was determined and virulence genes (afa/draBC, cnf1, cnf2, csgA, cvaC, fimH, fyuA, ibeA, iutA, kpsMT II, PAI, papC, PapG II, III, sfa/focDE and traT) were screened using PCR. Biofilm formation was evaluated using Microtiter plate method. Then, the antimicrobial activity of AgNPs was evaluated by the well-diffusion method, growth kinetics and MIC determination. Inhibition of biofilm formation and the ability to disperse biofilms in exposure to AgNPs were evaluated. The effect of AgNPs on the expression of virulence and biofilm-related genes (bap, OmpA, abaI, csuA/B, A1S_2091, A1S_1510, A1S_0690, A1S_0114) were estimated using QRT-PCR. In vitro infection model for analyzing the antibacterial activity of AgNPs was done using a co-culture infection model of A. baumannii with human fibroblast skin cell line HFF-1 or Vero cell lines. A. baumannii had high level of resistance to antibiotics. Most of the isolates harbored the fimH, afa/draBC, cnf1, csgA and cnf2, and the majority of A. baumannii produced strong biofilms. AgNPs inhibited the growth of A. baumannii efficiently with MIC ranging from 4 to 25 µg/ml. A. baumannii showed a reduced growth rate in the presence of AgNPs. The inhibitory activity and the anti-biofilm activity of AgNPs were more pronounced against the weak biofilm producers. Moreover, AgNPs decreased the expression of kpsMII , afa/draBC,bap, OmpA, and csuA/B genes. The in vitro infection model revealed a significant antibacterial activity of AgNPs against extracellular and intracellular A. baumannii. AgNPs highly interrupted bacterial multiplication and biofilm formation. AgNPs downregulated the transcription level of important virulence and biofilm-related genes. Our findings provide an additional step towards understanding the mechanisms by which sliver nanoparticles interfere with the microbial spread and persistence.","Hetta, Helal F.; Al-Kadmy, Israa M.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean pulse rates from measures taken in the clinic or hospital and a composite health care use score were recorded. The composite outcome included evaluation and management, ablation, cardioversion, telephone encounters, and number of rate or rhythm control medication orders. RESULTS: Among 16 320 patients with AF included in the analysis, 348 patients used wearables and 15 972 individuals did not use wearables. Prior to matching, patients using wearables were younger (mean [SD] age, 64.0 [13.0] years vs 70.0 [13.8] years; P < .001) and healthier (mean [SD] CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 65 years or 65-74 years, diabetes, prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, sex] score, 3.6 [2.0] vs 4.4 [2.0]; P < .001) compared with individuals not using wearables, with similar gender distribution (148 [42.5%] women vs 6722 women [42.1%]; P = .91). After matching, mean pulse rate was similar between 125 patients using wearables and 500 patients not using wearables (75.01 [95% CI, 72.74-77.27] vs 75.79 [95% CI, 74.68-76.90] beats per minute [bpm]; P = .54), whereas mean composite use score was higher among individuals using wearables (3.55 [95% CI, 3.31-3.80] vs 3.27 [95% CI, 3.14-3.40]; P = .04). Among measures in the composite outcome, there was a significant difference in use of ablation, occurring in 22 individuals who used wearables (17.6%) vs 37 individuals who did not use wearables (7.4%) (P = .001). In the regression analyses, mean composite use score was 0.28 points (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.56 points) higher among individuals using wearables compared with those not using wearables and mean pulse was similar, with a −0.79 bpm (95% CI −3.28 to 1.71 bpm) difference between the groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that follow-up health care use among individuals with AF was increased among those who used wearables compared with those with similar pulse rates who did not use wearables. Given the increasing use of wearables by patients with AF, prospective, randomized, long-term evaluation of the associations of wearable technology with health outcomes and health care use is needed.","Wang, Libo; Nielsen, Kyron; Goldberg, Joshua; Brown, Jeremiah R.; Rumsfeld, John S.; Steinberg, Benjamin A.; Zhang, Yue; Matheny, Michael E.; Shah, Rashmee U.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8160588/,91

There is considerable uncertainty around these measurements and their interpretation. The uncertainty is composed of several sources of measurement error and the limit of detection of fecal smear tests on the one hand, and key assumptions on STH biology on the other hand, including assumptions on the aggregation of worms within hosts and on the impact of density-dependent influences on worm reproduction. Using 2 independently developed models of STH transmission we show how different aspects of STH biology and human behavior impact on STH surveillance and control programs and how accounting for uncertainty can help to develop optimal and sustainable control strategies to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) morbidity target for STHs.","Vegvari, Carolin; Giardina, Federica; Malizia, Veronica; de Vlas, Sake J; Coffeng, Luc E; Anderson, Roy M",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8218855/,91

Thirteen patients and eight next of kin responded completing Quality of Life and Psychological distress questionnaires in this cross-sectional study, and participating in a semi-structured interview. The findings indicate a higher level of anxiety and hopelessness in next of kin compared to patients, while patients were more depressed. Next of kin reported higher physical, but lower emotional quality of life than patients. Qualitative interviews confirmed the questionnaire findings. The findings from this study may be helpful in genetic counseling. Genetic counselors and geneticists should not only be aware of the burden of being a next of kin, but include discussions about opportunities to minimize the burden in families affected with DM.

Firstly, by drawing on the spiritual leadership concept, the differences between leaders’ spirituality in Poland and Bhutan were examined. Secondly, the relationships between the constructs: vision, calling, membership, organizational commitment and performance of both Polish and Bhutanese managers were studied. METHODS: This study adopted the spiritual leadership scale proposed by Fry. The data used in this study were gathered through a survey of 194 managers. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the path coefficient were applied in the study. RESULTS: By comparing spiritual dimensions of leadership, the study demonstrated positive and significant relationships between the constructs that influence each other in various ways. The study indicates that the strength of the influence of specific dimensions depends on the perception of their significance for managers due to the cultural context. CONCLUSION: The study contributed to the literature by examining the dimensions of spiritual leadership that are endorsed differently by the Polish and the Bhutanese managers. The findings shed light on the creation of a positive work environment by managers in which employees can feel appreciated and fulfilled.","Samul, Joanna; Wangmo,",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8236275/,91

The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in the risk reduction of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with depression. METHODS: We enrolled patients diagnosed with depression between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2010, through the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Propensity score was used to match equal numbers (n=14,647) of acupuncture cohort and no-acupuncture cohort based on characteristics including sex, age, baseline comorbidity and medication. Patients were followed up until December 31, 2013, or withdrawn from the NHIRD. The Cox regression model was used to compare the hazard ratios (HRs) of CHD in the two cohorts. RESULTS: The basic characteristics of the two groups were similar. A lower cumulative incidence of CHD was noted in the acupuncture cohort (Log rank test, p < 0.001). Over time, 1626 patients in the acupuncture cohort (21.05 per 1000 person-years) and 2412 patients in the no-acupuncture cohort (39.84 per 1000 person-years) developed CHD (adjusted HR=0.50, 95% CI 0.47–0.53). The decreased CHD incidence was independent of age, sex, comorbidities, and medications used. The cumulative incidence of CHD was significantly lower in the acupuncture cohort than in the no-acupuncture cohort (Log rank test, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The results provided a real-world evidence that acupuncture may have beneficial effect on CHD risk reduction in patients with depression.","Huang, Chia-Yu; Huang, Ming-Cheng; Sun, Mao-Feng; Lin, Cheng-Li; Wu, Mei-Yao; Lin, Wu-Chou; Yen, Hung-Rong",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8286083/,91

HIV-1 infection models were established to investigate HIV-1 latency and its reversal; recent work began to probe the dynamics of HIV-1 latency reversal at single-cell resolution. Signals that establish HIV-1 latency and govern its reactivation are complex and may not be completely resolved at the cellular and regulatory levels by the aggregated measurements of bulk cellular-sequencing methods. High-throughput single-cell technologies that characterize and quantify changes to the epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome continue to rapidly evolve. Combinations of single-cell techniques, in conjunction with novel computational approaches to analyze these data, were developed and provide an opportunity to improve the resolution of the heterogeneity that may exist in HIV-1 reactivation. In this review, we summarize the published single-cell HIV-1 transcriptomic work and explore how cutting-edge advances in single-cell techniques and integrative data-analysis tools may be leveraged to define the mechanisms that control the reversal of HIV-1 latency.","Zhao, Suhui; Tsibris, Athe",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310207/,91

We performed semi-structured interviews of hospitals from four diverse health systems in the United States to understand determinants of adoption within a range of clinical settings. We used the diffusion of innovation theory to guide a framework analysis of the data. Of the 27 hospitalists invited, we performed 22 interviews from four hospitals of diverse types. Median years post-residency of interviewees was 10.5 [IQR:5-15]. Four main themes emerged: (1) There are important clinical advantages to LUS despite operator dependence, (2) LUS enhances patient and clinician experience, (3) Investment of clinician time to learn and perform LUS is a barrier to adoption but yields improved efficiency for the health system and (4) Mandated training and use may be necessary to achieve broad adoption as monetary incentives are less effective. Despite the perceived benefits of LUS for patients, clinicians and health systems, a significant barrier to broad LUS adoption is the experience of time scarcity by hospitalists. Future implementation strategies should focus on changes to the clinical environment that address clinician barriers to learning and adoption of new skills.","Maw, Anna M.; Ho, P.

The transmission routes primarily involve blood products, and infections are worldwide, leading up to 25% of persistent infections. To date, no effective therapeutic means are available to clear Pegivirus infections. Effective vaccine therapeutics is the best alternative to manage this disease and any associated potential pandemic. Thus, whole proteome-based mining of immunogenic peptides, i.e., CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), HTL (helper T lymphocytes), and B cell epitopes, was mapped to design a vaccine ensemble. Our investigation revealed that 29 different epitopes impart a critical role in immune response induction, which was also validated by exploring its physiochemical properties and experimental feasibility. In silico expression and host immune simulation were examined using an agent-based modeling approach and confirmed the induction of both primary and secondary immune factors such as IL, cytokines, and antibodies.

It is uncertain whether standard-dose (SD) quadrivalent vaccine offers better protection over other formulations in the elderly. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of SD-trivalent, high-dose (HD) trivalent, SD-quadrivalent, and adjuvanted trivalent vaccines in seniors (≥65 years) in a real-world setting. We selected over 200,000 individuals in each of 6 influenza seasons from 2012 to 2018 using MarketScan® databases. The two outcomes were hospitalization or emergency room (ER) visit due to (1) influenza or (2) pneumonia. Here, SD-quadrivalent was associated with higher risk of influenza-related hospitalization/ER visit (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.14 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.05–1.24) and of pneumonia-related hospitalization/ER visit (aHR 1.04 and 95% CI 1.01–1.07) vs. HD-trivalent. SD-trivalent followed similar trends compared to HD-trivalent (aHR 1.16 and 95% CI 1.06–1.27 for hospitalized/ER visit influenza; aHR 1.07 and 95% CI 1.05–1.10 for hospitalized/ER visit pneumonia). We could not demonstrate risk differences between SD vaccine formulations and between adjuvanted trivalent and one of the other three vaccines. Risk estimates slightly varied across seasons. These findings suggest that SD vaccine formulations vs. HD-trivalent were associated with higher risk of hospitalization/ER visit for influenza and pneumonia in seniors.","Machado, Marina Amaral de Avila; Moura, Cristiano S.; Abrahamowicz, Michal; Ward, Brian J.; Pilote, Louise; Bernatsky, Sasha",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8385076/,91

OBJECTIVE: To compare treatment retention following release from jail among adults receiving daily sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (SLB) vs those receiving XRB. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This open-label, randomized comparative effectiveness study included 52 incarcerated adults in New York City observed for 8 weeks postrelease between June 2019 and May 2020. Participants were soon-to-be-released volunteers from 1 men’s and 1 women’s jail facility who had OUDs already treated with SLB. Follow-up treatment was received at a primary care clinic in Manhattan. Data were analyzed between June 2020 and December 2020. INTERVENTIONS: XRB treatment was offered prior to release and continued monthly through 8 weeks after release. SLB participants continued to receive daily directly observed in-jail SLB administration, were provided a 7-day SLB supply at jail release, and followed up at a designated clinic (or other preferred clinics). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Buprenorphine treatment retention at 8 weeks postrelease. RESULTS: A total of 52 participants were randomized 1:1 to XRB (26 participants) and SLB (26 participants). Participants had a mean (SD) age of 42.6 (10.0) years; 45 participants (87%) were men; and 40 (77%) primarily used heroin prior to incarceration. Most participants (30 [58%]) reported prior buprenorphine use; 18 (35%) reported active community buprenorphine treatment prior to jail admission. Twenty-one of 26 assigned to XRB received 1 or more XRB injection prior to release; 3 initiated XRB postrelease; and 2 did not receive XRB. Patients in the XRB arm had fewer jail medical visits compared with daily SLB medication administration (mean [SD] visits per day: XRB, 0.11 [0.03] vs SLB, 1.06 [0.08]). Community buprenorphine treatment retention at week 8 postrelease was 18 participants in the XRB group (69.2%) vs 9 in the SLB group (34.6%), and rates of opioid-negative urine tests were 72 of 130 tests in the XRB group (55.3%) and 50 of 130 tests in the SLB group (38.4%). There were no differences in rates of serious adverse events, no overdoses, and no deaths. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: XRB was acceptable among patients currently receiving SLB, and patients had fewer in-jail clinic visits and increased community buprenorphine treatment retention when compared with standard daily SLB treatment. These results support wider use and further study of XRB as correctional and reentry OUD treatment.

We separated chicken bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs); investigated whether BM-MSCs can improve lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung and distal organ injury; and explored the underlying mechanisms. Ninety-six male ICR (6 weeks old) mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, LPS, and LPS + MSC groups. The mice were intratracheally injected with 5 mg/kg LPS to induce acute lung injury (ALI). The histopathological severity of injury to the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and aortic tissues was detected. Wet/dry ratio, protein concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), BALF cell counts, inflammatory cytokine levels in serum, inflammatory cytokine gene expression, and oxidative stress-related indicators were detected. In addition, a survival analysis was performed in sixty male ICR mice (6 weeks old, 18–20 g). This study used chicken BM-MSCs, which are easier to obtain and more convenient than other animal or human MSCs, and have MSC-associated properties, such as a colony forming ability, multilineage differentiation potential, and certain phenotypes. BM-MSCs administration significantly improved the survival rate, systemic inflammation, and the histopathological severity of lung, liver, kidney, and aortic injury during ALI. BM-MSCs administration reduced the levels of inflammatory factors in BALF, the infiltration of neutrophils, and oxidative stress injury in lung tissue. In addition, BM-MSCs administration reduced TRL4 and Mdy88 mRNA expression during ALI. Chicken BM-MSCs serve as a potential alternative resource for stem cell therapy and exert a prominent effect on LPS-induced ALI and extrapulmonary injury, in part through TRL4/Mdy88 signaling and inhibition of neutrophil inflammation and oxidative stress injury.","Niu, Hexuan; Song, Hanan; Guan, Yuhan; Zong, Xianchun; Niu, Ruili; Zhao, Shiyu; Liu, Cong; Yan, Wenzaixiang; Guan, Weijun; Wang, Xishuai",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8433226/,91

The adage that “prevention is better than cure” is especially true regarding antibiotic resistance because the resistance appears and spreads much faster than the production of new antibiotics. Vaccination is an important strategy to fight infectious agents; however, this strategy has not attracted sufficient attention in antibiotic resistance prevention. New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) confers resistance to many beta-lactamases, including important carbapenems like imipenem. Our goal in this study is to use an immunoinformatics approach to develop a vaccine that can elicit strong and specific immune responses against NDMs that prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. RESULTS: In this study, 2194 NDM sequences were aligned to obtain a conserved sequence. One continuous B cell epitope and three T cell CD4(+) epitopes were selected from NDMs conserved sequence. Epitope conservancy for B cell and HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP epitopes was 100.00%, 99.82%, 99.41%, and 99.86%, respectively, and population coverage of MHC II epitopes for the world was 99.91%. Permutation of the four epitope fragments resulted in 24 different peptides, of which 6 peptides were selected after toxicity, allergenicity, and antigenicity assessment. After primary vaccine design, only one vaccine sequence with the highest similarity with discontinuous B cell epitope in NDMs was selected. The final vaccine can bind to various Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The prediction implied that the vaccine would be stable with a good half-life. An immune simulation performed by the C-IMMSIM server predicted that two doses of vaccine injection can induce a strong immune response to NDMs. Finally, the GC-Content of the vaccine was designed very similar to E. coli K12. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, immunoinformatics strategies were used to design a vaccine against different NDM variants that could produce an effective immune response against this antibiotic-resistant factor.

Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Adaptation is governed by dynamic transcriptional re-programming, which is tightly connected to chromatin architecture. Here, we report a pivotal role for the HIR histone chaperone complex in modulating virulence of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Genetic ablation of HIR function alters chromatin accessibility linked to aberrant transcriptional responses to protein as nitrogen source. This accelerates metabolic adaptation and increases the release of extracellular proteases, which enables scavenging of alternative nitrogen sources. Furthermore, HIR controls fungal virulence, as HIR1 deletion leads to differential recognition by immune cells and hypervirulence in a mouse model of systemic infection. This work provides mechanistic insights into chromatin-coupled regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune pathogen gene expression and virulence. Furthermore, the data point toward the requirement of refined screening approaches to exploit chromatin modifications as antifungal strategies.","Jenull, Sabrina; Mair, Theresia; Tscherner, Michael; Penninger, Philipp; Zwolanek, Florian; Silao, Fitz-Gerald S.; de San Vicente, Kontxi Martinez; Riedelberger, Michael; Bandari, Naga C.; Shivarathri, Raju; Petryshyn, Andriy; Chauhan, Neeraj; Zacchi, Lucia F.; LeibundGut -Landmann, Salomé; Ljungdahl, Per O.; Kuchler, Karl",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493472/,91
22086,Looking into the flora of Dutch Brazil: botanical identifications of seventeenth century plant illustrations in the Libri Picturati,2021-10-05,"Aims of this study were: to verify if Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) time series could determine both ventilatory thresholds in individuals with different fitness levels, and to assess the validity of RQA method compared to gas-exchange method (GE). The two thresholds were estimated in thirty young individuals during incremental exercise on cycle-ergometer: Heart rate (HR), Oxygen consumption (VO(2)) and Workload were measured by the two methods (RQA and GE). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess main effects of methods and methods-by-groups interaction effects for HR, VO(2) and Workload at aerobic (AerT) and anaerobic (AnT) thresholds. Validity of RQA at both thresholds was assessed for HR, VO(2) and Workload by Ordinary Least Products (OLP) regression, Typical Percentage Error (TE), Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and the Bland Altman plots. No methods-by-groups interaction effects were detected for HR, VO(2) and Workload at AerT and AnT. The OLP analysis showed that at both thresholds RQA and GE methods had very strong correlations (r >0.8) in all variables (HR, VO(2) and Workload). Slope and intercept values always included the 1 and the 0, respectively. At AerT the TE ranged from 4.02% (5.48 bpm) to 10.47% (8.53 Watts) (HR and Workload, respectively) and in all variables ICC values were excellent (≥0.85). At AnT the TE ranged from 2.53% (3.98 bpm) to 6.64% (7.81 Watts) (HR and Workload, respectively) and in all variables ICC values were excellent (≥0.90). Therefore, RQA of HRV time series is a new valid approach to determine both ventilatory thresholds in individuals with different physical fitness levels, it can be used when gas analysis is not possible or not convenient.","Zimatore, Giovanna; Falcioni, Lavinia; Gallotta, Maria Chiara; Bonavolontà, Valerio; Campanella, Matteo; De Spirito, Marco; Guidetti, Laura; Baldari, Carlo",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8496840/,91

However, websites still present information to laypeople on how to treat and manage social media addiction, which can pose the risk of spreading low quality or incorrect information. As such, we aimed to assess how the most popular social media addiction websites present information across multiple metrics. We conducted an in-depth online search to identify the top social media addiction websites in November 2019 (N = 23). Websites were separated into four distinct classifications: (1) treatment/therapy/medical; (2) informational; (3) news article; and (4) blog/essay. Based on previous website analysis research, three trained coders evaluated these websites on six metrics: (1) design; (2) credibility; (3) accessibility; (4) literacy; (5) engagement; and (6) social media addiction content. Design features were the top-rated metric across all websites, followed by credibility. Websites scored the lowest for the engagement and social media addiction content metrics. Across website classifications, scores for social media addiction content varied greatly, with blog/essay websites ranking the lowest and informational websites ranking the highest. Our findings provide necessary information for both patients and healthcare providers, apprising these individuals and the field about the current online health information landscape for disordered social media use.","McCarroll, Alexis M.; Holtz, Bree E.; Meshi, Dar",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8507750/,91
22226,"Red Book: 2006 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, 27th Edition",2006-12-11,"Lung endothelial cell dysfunction plays a central role in septic-induced lung injury. We hypothesized that endothelial cell subsets, capillary endothelial cells (capEC) and post capillary venules (PCV), might play different roles in regulating important pathophysiology in sepsis. In order to reveal global transcriptomic changes in endothelial cell subsets during sepsis, we induced sepsis in C57BL/6 mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We confirmed that CLP induced systemic and lung inflammation in our model. Endothelial cells (ECs) from lung capillary and PCV were isolated by cell sorting and transcriptomic changes were analyzed by bioinformatic tools. Our analysis revealed that lung capEC are transcriptionally different than PCV. Comparison of top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of capEC and PCV revealed that capEC responses are different than PCV during sepsis. It was found that capEC are more enriched with genes related to regulation of coagulation, vascular permeability, wound healing and lipid metabolic processes after sepsis. In contrast, PCV are more enriched with genes related to chemotaxis, cell–cell adhesion by integrins, chemokine biosynthesis, regulation of actin filament process and neutrophil homeostasis after sepsis. In addition, we predicted some transcription factor targets that regulate a significant number of DEGs in sepsis. We proposed that targeting certain DEGs or transcriptional factors would be useful in protecting against sepsis-induced lung damage.","Rahman, Milladur; Ding, Zhiyi; Rönnow, Carl-Fredrik; Thorlacius, Henrik",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8507973/,91

Although CMV reactivation often becomes a serious problem in immunocompromised patients, the prevalence of CMV reactivation caused by methylprednisolone therapy for ARDS after esophagectomy has yet to be determined. METHOD: Among 175 consecutive patients with thoracic squamous cell esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy with extensive lymph node dissection at Akita University Hospital between 2007 and 2010, 11 patients (6.3 %) diagnosed with ARDS during the acute phase of esophagectomy were enrolled and treated with steroid pulse therapy, high-dose (15–20 mg/kg/day) administration and tapering in this retrospective study. RESULTS: Seven of the 11 patients (63.6 %) were diagnosed with CMV reactivation based on CMV antigenemia assayed 19.1 days after the start of methylprednisolone administration and were treated with ganciclovir for 39.6 days. Six of the 7 patients (85.7 %) diagnosed with CMV reactivation were administered a total methylprednisolone dose of more than 4,000 mg. Though there was no significant difference between patients with and without CMV reactivation, there was a tendency that patients with CMV reactivation showed a lower minimum number of lymphocytes during the acute phase of esophagectomy (p = 0.051, Student’s t test, average 223.3 and 298.0/μl, respectively). CONCLUSION: Though the number of study patients is small, the prevalence of CMV reactivation caused by high-dose methylprednisolone therapy for ARDS after esophagectomy is remarkably high. This result strikes a note of warning concerning the management of these patients and suggests the importance of screenings for CMV reactivation so as to make an accurate diagnosis and initiate treatment in a timely manner.","Sato, Yusuke; Motoyama, Satoru; Maruyama, Kiyotomi; Yoshino, Key; Sasaki, Tomohiko; Wakita, Akiyuki; Ogawa, Jun-ichi",Esophagus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101544/,91

23409,Infectious disease: Inextricable linkages between human and ecosystem health,2006-06-06,"Hog-badgers (mustelid carnivorans classified in the genus Arctonyx) are distributed throughout East and Southeast Asia, including much of China, the eastern Indian Subcontinent, Indochina and the large continental Asian island of Sumatra. Arctonyx is usually regarded as monotypic, comprising the single species A. collaris F. Cuvier, 1825, but taxonomic boundaries in the genus have never been revised on the basis of sizeable series from throughout this geographical range. Based on a review of most available specimens in world museums, we recognize three distinctive species within the genus, based on craniometric analyses, qualitative craniodental features, external comparisons, and geographical and ecological considerations. Arctonyx albogularis (Blyth, 1853) is a shaggy-coated, medium-sized badger widely distributed in temperate Asia, from Tibet and the Himalayan region to eastern and southern China. Arctonyx collaris F. Cuvier, 1825, is an extremely large, shorter-haired badger, distributed throughout Southeast Asia, from eastern India to Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. The world's largest extant badger, A. collaris co-occurs with A. albogularis in eastern India and probably in southern China, and fossil comparisons indicate that its geographical range may have extended into central China in the middle Pleistocene. The disjunctly distributed species Arctonyx hoevenii (Hubrecht, 1891), originally described within the order ‘Edentata’ by a remarkable misunderstanding, is the smallest and darkest member of the genus and is endemic to the Barisan mountain chain of Sumatra. Apart from A. hoevenii, no other Arctonyx occurs on the Sunda Shelf below peninsular Thailand. The natural history of each species of Arctonyx, so far as is known, is briefly reviewed.

In transplant recipients, this group can include viruses with no recognized pathogenicity in immunocompetent patients and those that result in atypical or more severe disease presentations in the immunocompromised host. In this chapter, we begin by discussing viral diagnostics and techniques used for viral discovery, specifically as they apply to emerging and rare infections in this patient population. Focus then shifts to specific emerging and re-emerging viruses in the transplant population, including human T-cell leukemia virus 1, rabies, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, human bocavirus, parvovirus 4, measles, mumps, orf, and dengue. We have also included a brief discussion on emerging viruses and virus families with few or no reported cases in transplant recipients: monkeypox, nipah and hendra, chikungunya and other alphaviruses, hantavirus and the Bunyaviridae, and filoviruses. Finally, concerns regarding infectious disease complications in xenotransplantation and the reporting of rare viral infections are addressed. With the marked increase in the number of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants performed worldwide, we expect a corresponding rise in the reports of emerging viral infections in transplant hosts, both from known viruses and those yet to be identified.","Tan, Susanna K.; Waggoner, Jesse J.; Deresinski, Stan",Principles and Practice of Transplant Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119999/,91
23896,Emerging Animal Coronaviruses: First SARS and Now MERS,2017-02-08,"Although emerging plant viruses receive much less publicity than their animal- or human-infecting cousins, they pose a serious threat to worldwide agricultural production. These viruses can be new (i.e., not previously known) or already known; however, they share the common characteristic of occupying and spreading within new niches. Factors driving the emergence of plant viruses include genetic variability in the virus, changes in agricultural practices, increases in the population and/or distribution of insect vectors and long-distance transport of plant materials. In recent years, individual as well as entire groups of viruses have emerged, and this has involved a variety of mechanism(s), depending on the virus and the environment. Here, we will discuss some of these viruses, and highlight the mechanisms that have mediated their emergence. Special emphasis is placed upon the whiteflytransmitted geminiviruses (begomoviruses) and the thrips-transmitted tosposviruses, which have emerged as major threats to crop production throughout the world. Other examples include the recent emergence of novel viruslike agents, the acquisition and role of satellite DNA or RNA molecules in emergence of plant viruses, and cases where emerging viruses have had only a transient impact. It seems clear that global movement of plant materials, expansion of agriculture and large-scale monoculture will continue to favor emergence of plant viruses. However, improved diagnostics should allow for rapid identification of emerging viruses and better understanding of viral biology. This information can be used in the development of effective management strategies, which will hopefully minimize impact on agricultural production.","Rojas, Maria R.; Gilbertson, Robert L.",Plant Virus Evolution,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120024/,91

24461,Testing the Donor,2010-04-01,"Biological risk relates to a broad spectrum of possible scenarios, that can be classified in three categories: natural occurring, unintended and deliberate. The prevention and management of such events require dedicated measures at national and international level, in terms of biosafety and biosecurity: an optimized intervention can minimize the probability of occurrence, but also adverse short-term (i.e.: number of casualties, population reaction…) and long-term (i.e.: chronic illnesses, ecological changes, trades drop…) consequences. Natural scenarios include common, emerging/re-emerging and chronic infectious diseases: they are caused by biological agents, which can be normally present in the communities, as acute or chronic pathologies, or suddenly appear, causing new or uncommon syndromes. In particular, a lot of environmental and human factors can influence emerging and re-emerging diseases: for example, urbanization and people mobility facilitate microorganisms spread, while climate changes are likely to induce a relocation of pathogens vectors. Unintended events are usually due to research and diagnostic activities: laboratories are the places where biological agents are handled and a lack in Biosafety measures or negligence can result in accidental release; the so called Laboratory Acquired Infections represent the main consequence, since they cause pathologies in the laboratory workers, but could be also transmitted in the population. Deliberate use of biological agents is strictly related to terroristic activities: microorganisms are very suitable for this purpose, since they are hidden and can easily spread. The present chapter summarizes the main characteristics of biological agents related events, taking in account their origin and the principal consequences on the community.","Mancon, Alessandro; Mileto, Davide; Gismondo, Maria Rita",Defence Against Bioterrorism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120774/,91
24494,Pharmacogenomics and Molecular Diagnostics,2017-10-18,"Regulatory risk assessments are an important part of the introduction of insect-resistant genetically modified (GM) crops (e.g., Bacillus thuringiensis [Bt] crops) into the environment to ensure the safe use of such products. In doing so, the regulatory assessment process can be clearly beneficial to integrated pest management (IPM) programs. In general, the regulatory framework for insect-resistant GM crops includes an assessment of the following: effects of the insecticidal trait on non-target organisms, other potential adverse environmental impacts, evolution of resistance to target pests, and environmental and agronomic benefits of the insecticidal trait. Each country’s regulatory system is dependent on the overall environmental risk management goals, relevant and available risk information, scientific capacity, and the available financial resources. A number of regulatory activities can help to ensure that new products such as Bt crops fit well within IPM programs: (1) evaluation of the environmental safety of new products, and their ability to enhance IPM; (2) encouragement of the adoption of new technologies with improved environmental safety profiles; (3) adoption of an expedited regulatory review system; and (4) encouragement and appropriate oversight of sustainable use of such products. Governmental regulation of insect-resistant GM crops can also hinder IPM programs by creating significant barriers to the adoption of such technologies. Such barriers include: (1) absence of functioning regulatory systems in many developing countries; (2) meeting the obligations and understanding the various interpretations of international treaties, e.g., Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety; (3) lack of public sector research to generate data supporting the safety of these crops; and (4) regulatory costs involved in the development and commercialization of novel products for small market sectors. Ways in which regulatory data requirements can be globally harmonized need to be considered to decrease the regulatory barriers for insect-resistant GM crops and comparable technologies. International organizations can play a key role in rationalizing regulatory systems; however, public sector research will also be needed to make sure that the risk assessment process is scientifically sound and transparent.","Matten, Sharlene R.; Head, Graham P.; Quemada, Hector D.",Integration of Insect-Resistant Genetically Modified Crops within IPM Programs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120821/,91

One codon in a synonymous codon family is often strongly over-used, especially in highly expressed genes, which often leads to a high dN/dS ratio because dS is very small. Many different codon usage indices have been proposed to measure codon usage and codon adaptation. Sense codon could be misread by release factors and stop codons misread by tRNAs, which also contribute to codon usage in rare cases. This chapter outlines the conceptual framework on codon evolution, illustrates codon-specific and gene-specific codon usage indices, and presents their applications. A new index for codon adaptation that accounts for background mutation bias (Index of Translation Elongation) is presented and contrasted with codon adaptation index (CAI) which does not consider background mutation bias. They are used to re-analyze data from a recent paper claiming that translation elongation efficiency matters little in protein production.

At present, there are no true curative treatments that can stop the progression of the disease, and new therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. Advances in cell-based therapies provide a platform for the development of new therapeutic approaches in severe lung diseases such as COPD. At present, a lot of focus is on mesenchymal stem (stromal) cell (MSC)-based therapies, mainly due to their immunomodulatory properties. Despite increasing number of preclinical studies demonstrating that systemic MSC administration can prevent or treat experimental COPD and emphysema, clinical studies have not been able to reproduce the preclinical results and to date no efficacy or significantly improved lung function or quality of life has been observed in COPD patients. Importantly, the completed appropriately conducted clinical trials uniformly demonstrate that MSC treatment in COPD patients is well tolerated and no toxicities have been observed. All clinical trials performed so far, have been phase I/II studies, underpowered for the detection of potential efficacy. There are several challenges ahead for this field such as standardized isolation and culture procedures to obtain a cell product with high quality and reproducibility, administration strategies, improvement of methods to measure outcomes, and development of potency assays. Moreover, COPD is a complex pathology with a diverse spectrum of clinical phenotypes, and therefore it is essential to develop methods to select the subpopulation of patients that is most likely to potentially respond to MSC administration. In this chapter, we will discuss the current state of the art of MSC-based cell therapy for COPD and the hurdles that need to be overcome.","Enes, Sara Rolandsson; Uriarte, Juan J.; Pouliot, Robert A.; Weiss, Daniel J.",Stem Cell-Based Therapy for Lung Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121219/,91

While most of the ASEAN countries have been modernising their force structures for conventional conflict since the waning years of the Cold War, many still retain doctrines and equipment geared for internal security needs. The advent of non-traditional security threats ranging from natural disasters to transnational terrorism may challenge this state of affairs. Against this backdrop, how can one analyse and conceptualise the Asia-Pacific’s diplomacy of counter-terrorism in tackling the threat posed by the Islamic State? This chapter will examine the counter-terrorism policies of Asia-Pacific states and analyse how non-traditional threats such as that posed by terrorism have been managed by the armed forces of the region.

This chapter examines these major threats to human health, individually and as elements of a complex health security system, and relates them to human security in Southeast Asia and to the global security situation. Loss of confidence in government’s ability to protect its citizens makes people vulnerable to extremists who promise near-term solutions, leading to civil unrest and political violence, refugee migrations into neighboring states, insurgencies and disruption of regional security. Case studies are included to show how governmental failure to respond effectively to health challenges can compromise national and regional security. Additional case studies demonstrate best practices in preventing and mitigating negative health effects on human security and regional stability. Finally, this chapter posits that multilateral collaboration and cross-sectoral interagency cooperation are essential for sustainable regional health security solutions.","Campbell, James R.",Human Security,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121934/,91
25599,Pulmonary Delivery of Plasmid DNA for Disease Prevention and Therapy,2011-05-25,"The rationale to investigate the role of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] in cancer relies on the fact that the heptapeptide inhibits the growth of several cell lines. The first studies showed that Ang-(1-7) accelerated hematopoietic recovery in the peripheral blood and bone marrow after chemotherapy and inhibits lung cancer cell growth through the activation of Mas receptor. In this chapter, we summarize studies on the role of Ang-(1-7) in different types of cancer, especially lung, breast, prostate, hepatocellular cancers and in gliobalstoma multiforme (GBM). The antitumor effect of Ang-(1-7) was due to reduction of angiogenesis, cancer-associated fibrosis, osteoclastogenesis, tumor-induced inflammation, and metastasis as well as inhibition of cancer cell growth and proliferation. In clinical trials, Ang-(1-7) was well tolerated with limited toxic or quality-of-life side effects and showed clinical benefit in cancer patients with solid tumors. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm safety, to determine doses and clinical indications.","Simões e Silva, Ana Cristina; Sampaio, Walkyria O.",Angiotensin-(1-7),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122233/,91

Significant geologic cataclysmic events have caused the extinction of countless species, but these “Wrath of God” events predate the emergence of Homo sapiens. Pandemic infections have accompanied the rise of human civilization frequently re-occurring leaving a lasting imprint on human history punctuated by profound loss of life. Emerging infections become endemic and are here to stay marking their presence with an annual death toll. Each decade brings a new onslaught of emerging infectious agents. We are surprised again and again but are never prepared. The long-term consequences often remain unrecognized and are always inconvenient including cancer, cardiovascular disease and immune associated diseases that threaten our health. Reliance on clusters of clinical symptoms in the face of diverse and non-descriptive viral infection symptoms is a foolhardy form of crisis management. Viral success is based on rapid replication resulting in large numbers. Single-stranded RNA viruses with their high replication error rate represent a paradigm for resilience.","Iversen, Patrick L.",Molecular Basis of Resilience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122756/,91

Virus-containing allantoic fluid was inactivated with formalin. The phenomenon of antigenic drift of the virus HA was soon recognized and, as WHO began to coordinate the world influenza surveillance, it became easier for manufacturers to select an up-to-date virus. Influenza vaccines remain unique in that the virus strain composition is reviewed yearly but modern attempts are being made to free manufacturers from this yolk by investigating internal virus proteins including M2e and NP as “universal” vaccines covering all virus sub types. Recent technical innovations have been the use of Vero and MDCK cells as the virus cell substrate, the testing of two new adjuvants and the exploration of new presentations to the nose or epidermal layers as DNA or antigen mixtures. The international investment into public health measures for a global human outbreak of avian H5N1 influenza is leading to enhanced production of conventional vaccine and to a new research searchlight on T cell epitope vaccines, viral live attenuated carriers of influenza proteins and even more innovative substrates to cultivate virus, including plant cells.","Oxford, John; Lambkin-Williams, Robert; Gilbert, Anthony",Influenza Vaccines for the Future,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123026/,91
26218,Colonization of Parasites and Vectors,2017-07-28,"Although advances in antineoplastic therapy have considerably improved the survival of patients with hematological malignancies, current treatment modalities increase the risk of late complications. Several forms of chronic pulmonary dysfunction due to infectious or noninfectious causes commonly occur in the months to years after chemo-radiotherapy and can be fatal or result in long-term morbidity. The judicious use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents has tipped the balance toward noninfectious etiologies. Hence, while opportunistic infections still contribute to chronic lung disease, late sequelae resulting from antineoplastic therapy have been identified and reported. Patients who proceed to receive hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) are particularly prone to developing lung complications. Pulmonary dysfunction occurring after HSCT may manifest with obstructive or restrictive pulmonary mechanics and may range in severity from subtle, subclinical functional changes to frank respiratory failure. Insights generated using animal models suggest that the immunologic mechanisms contributing to lung inflammation after HSCT may be similar to those responsible for graft-versus host disease. In sum, chronic fibrotic pulmonary dysfunction is a frequent and significant complication facing survivors of hematologic malignancies and their practitioners. The high incidence and suboptimal response to current support care and immunosuppressive therapy underscore the need for heightened awareness and continued research in this area.","Salman, Huda; Cooke, Kenneth R.; Lazarus, Hillard M.",Pulmonary Involvement in Patients with Hematological Malignancies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123073/,91

28743,Effects of geographic scale on population factors in acute disease diffusion analysis,2015-07-29,"Microglial heterogeneity has been the topic of much discussion in the scientific community. Elucidation of their plasticity and adaptability to disease states triggered early efforts to characterize microglial subsets. Over time, their phenotypes, and later on their homeostatic signature, were revealed, through the use of increasingly advanced transcriptomic techniques. Recently, an increasing number of these “microglial signatures” have been reported in various homeostatic and disease contexts. Remarkably, many of these states show similar overlapping microglial gene expression patterns, both in homeostasis and in disease or injury. In this review, we integrate information from these studies, and we propose a unique subset, for which we introduce a core signature, based on our own research and reports from the literature. We describe that this subset is found in development and in normal aging as well as in diverse diseases. We discuss the functions of this subset as well as how it is induced.","Benmamar-Badel, Anouk; Owens, Trevor; Wlodarczyk, Agnieszka",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147523/,91

When the colonies first formed the United States, there was no national public health law. In a time when traveling any significant distance was rare, infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics were often localized, to an extent that is difficult to imagine today. The origin of independent federal public health authority derives from laws designed to provide medical care for eighteenth-century merchant seamen, a group who traveled constantly and often had little access to care when they became ill in unfamiliar cities. Moreover, their illnesses threatened the mercantile trade that was essential to the economy of the fledging nation. The origins of what is now the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) began in 1798, when Congress established a fund to provide treatment for sick and injured merchant seamen. The PHS is now a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The core of federal public health law is found in the statutes that grant authority for various actions to DHHS, PHS, and CDC.","Hunter, Nan D.",The Law of Emergencies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152008/,91

30114,Diseases of game birds,2009-05-15,"Twenty-four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeted to a total of 16 different antigens are currently approved for the treatment of an increasing number of cancers. Six are directed against antigens expressed on B lymphocytes (ibritumomab tiuxetan, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, and rituximab to CD20, brentuximab vedotin to CD30, and alemtuzumab to CD52); cetuximab, panitumumab, and necitumumab target EGFR; bevacizumab and ramucirumab are specific for VEGF and VEGFR2, respectively; pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and ado-trastuzumab target HER2; nivolumab and pembrolizumab are directed to the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1); and denosumab, ipilimumab, siltuximab, and dinutuximab recognize RANKL, CTLA-4, IL-6, and the disialoganglioside (GD2), respectively. In November 2015, the FDA approved daratumumab, the first anti-CD38 mAb and the first mAb to be approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Elotuzumab, targeted to the receptor SLAMF7, was also given approval for multiple myeloma soon after. Two antibodies are bispecific: the rat-mouse chimera, catumaxomab, recognizes both EpCAM and CD3, while blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell-engaging (BiTE) fusion protein, targets both CD19 and CD3. Although mAbs used for cancer immunotherapy are generally better tolerated than small molecule chemotherapeutic drugs, their range of adverse effects is still wide and varied from mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient rashes to severe cytopenias; anaphylaxis; autoimmunity; pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic, kidney, neurological, and embryofetal toxicities; and rare life-threatening toxidermias. Because of their immunogenic potential, mAbs generally carry warnings of immune reactions, especially anaphylaxis, but the observed incidences of such reactions are actually quite small. Cytopenias occur in some patients treated with mAbs during anticancer immunotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms frequently remain unexplored. Type II and III hypersensitivities induced by mAbs may be underdiagnosed. Severe infusion reactions have been reported for all the mAbs although some show a much higher incidence with the chimeric rituximab and humanized trastuzumab antibodies being the leading offenders. Distinguishing features in the literature between cytokine release syndrome and severe infusion reactions are often not clear. At least ten of the currently approved mAbs for cancer therapy show some pulmonary toxicity. These pulmonary adverse events can be grouped into four categories: interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Cardiac adverse events, including congestive heart failure, decreased LVEF, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and arrhythmias, have occurred with at least 11 of the mAbs. Papulopustular eruptions, cutaneous reactions that are not immune-mediated, as well as a range of other adverse mucocutaneous effects, are elicited in a large proportion of patients by mAbs targeted to EGFR. Other rare but mAb-induced serious adverse events are tumor lysis syndrome and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.","Baldo, Brian A.",Safety of Biologics Therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153453/,91

The PCR screening procedure for nine common respiratory viruses was performed on lung tissue obtained from both asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. Six additional cases (four lifetime non-smokers and two with remote minimal smoking histories) were added to control for the fact that both the asthmatics and non-asthmatics smoked heavily.

30435,Oral Abstract,2016-06-08,"Nanotechnology is an enabling technology with great potential for applications in stem cell research and regenerative medicine. Fluorescent nanodiamond (FND), an inherently biocompatible and nontoxic nanoparticle, is well suited for such applications. We had developed a prospective isolation method using CD157, CD45, and CD54 to obtain lung stem cells. Labeling of CD45(−)CD54(+)CD157(+) cells with FNDs did not eliminate their abilities for self-renewal and differentiation. The FND labeling in combination with cell sorting, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, and immunostaining identified transplanted stem cells allowed tracking of their engraftment and regenerative capabilities with single-cell resolution. Time-gated fluorescence (TGF) imaging in mouse tissue sections indicated that they reside preferentially at the bronchoalveolar junctions of lungs, especially in naphthalene-injured mice. Our results presented in Subchapter 1.1 demonstrate not only the remarkable homing capacity and regenerative potential of the isolated stem cells, but also the ability of finding rare lung stem cells in vivo using FNDs. The topical use of antiretroviral-based microbicides, namely of a dapivirine ring, has been recently shown to partially prevent transmission of HIV through the vaginal route. Among different formulation approaches, nanotechnology tools and principles have been used for the development of tentative vaginal and rectal microbicide products. Subchapter 1.2 provides an overview of antiretroviral drug nanocarriers as novel microbicide candidates and discusses recent and relevant research on the topic. Furthermore, advances in developing vaginal delivery platforms for the administration of promising antiretroviral drug nanocarriers are reviewed. Although mostly dedicated to the discussion of nanosystems for vaginal use, the development of rectal nanomicrobicides is also addressed. Infectious diseases are currently responsible for over 8 million deaths per year. Efficient treatments require accurate recognition of pathogens at low concentrations, which in the case of blood infection (septicemia) can go as low as 1 mL(–1). Detecting and quantifying bacteria at such low concentrations is challenging and typically demands cultures of large samples of blood (∼1 mL) extending over 24–72 h. This delay seriously compromises the health of patients and is largely responsible for the death toll of bacterial infections. Recent advances in nanoscience, spectroscopy, plasmonics, and microfluidics allow for the development of optical devices capable of monitoring minute amounts of analytes in liquid samples. In Subchapter 1.3 we critically discuss these recent developments that will, in the future, enable the multiplex identification and quantification of microorganisms directly on their biological matrix with unprecedented speed, low cost, and sensitivity. Radiolabeled nanoparticles (NPs) are finding an increasing interest in a broad range of biomedical applications. They may be used to detect and characterize diseases, to deliver relevant therapeutics, and to study the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters of nanomaterials. The use of radiotracer techniques in the research of novel NPs offers many advantages, but there are still some limitations. The binding of radionuclides to NPs has to be irreversible to prevent their escape to other tissues or organs. Due to the short half-lives of radionuclides, the manufacturing process is time limited and difficult, and there is also a risk of contamination. Subchapter 1.4 presents the main selection criteria for radionuclides and applicable radiolabeling procedures used for the radiolabeling of various NPs. Also, an overview of different types of NPs that have so far been labeled with radionuclides is presented.","Wu, Tsai-Jung; Chiu, Hsiao-Yu; Yu, John; Cautela, Mafalda P.; Sarmento, Bruno; das Neves, José; Catala, Carme; Pazos-Perez, Nicolas; Guerrini, Luca; Alvarez-Puebla, Ramon A.; Vranješ-Đurić, Sanja; Ignjatović, Nenad L.",Nanotechnologies in Preventive and Regenerative Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156018/,91

30950,Oral Presentations,2008-10-07,"In the past few decades there have been increased investigations into the effects of captive environments on behavior. Simultaneously, zoological gardens have undergone a revolution in philosophy and design, resulting in a proliferation of “naturalistic” habitats. Complex environments such as these have been found to affect the behavior of captive animals favorably, including increasing reproductive and rearing success, encouraging the expression of species‐typical behavior patterns, and decreasing abnormal behaviors. In June 1988, Zoo Atlanta completed four naturalistic habitats for western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). These new habitats afforded a unique opportunity to study the adaptation of lowland gorillas to novel, naturalistic habitats. During the first year of habitation, a total of 451 hours of data were collected on 11 gorillas housed in three harem groups. Focal animal sampling with a behavioral change scoring system was used to obtain information on behavior, substrate, environmental components utilized, and location in sun or shade. Instantaneous scans at 15 minute intervals provided information on location and behavior of all individuals. Adaptation to the environments was assessed by using the indices of: time spent manipulating objects across the course of the study, the percent of the habitats utilized, and the dispersal of individual animals over the habitats. Trends in these behaviors indicated that exploration of the environments significantly decreased, but that this decline in exploration took over six months to occur. Several interpretations of these findings are presented including the unfamiliarity of these naturalistic habitats to these subjects.","Ogden, Jacqueline J.; Finlay, Ted W.; Maple, Terry L.",Zoo Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165752/,91

The three groups of areas studied were: (1) bare pastures, with an intermediate number of bird species, few individuals and high biomass of mainly carnivorous and insectivorous birds; (2) conifer plantations 1 to 5 years old, with the smallest number of bird species and the smallest biomass, but an intermediate number of individuals; (3) plantations six to twenty years old, with the highest number of both species and individuals of birds, but only intermediate biomass. 2. The change from pasture to forest occurs about six to ten years after planting. The last forest birds come in about 20 years after planting. 3. Birds have an important role in establishing the shrub layer and mixing some tree‐species into the plantation, by dissemination. 4. Throughout the entire successional series the bird population seems to have a kernel of species, while other species come or go and/or change in density with the stages.","Turc̄ek, F.

31123,European Society of Veterinary Clinical Pathology (ESVCP)/ European College of Veterinary Clinical Pathology (ECVCP) 15th Annual Congress,2013-11-06,"The vegetation of a small Scottish metal‐mine spoil heap was sampled by means of 70 0.25‐m(2) quadrats and classified into three groups. The most common species were Agrostis capillaris and Festuca rubra which were important constituents of all three groups. Soil samples were collected from each quadrat and analysed for pH, loss‐on‐ignition, heavy metal and nutrient elements in the soil solution and for several physical properties. The mine spoil was physically and chemically heterogenous with many of the soil solution samples having potentially toxic concentrations of copper, lead and zinc. The vegetation data were ordinated: axis 1 of the ordination was significantly correlated (positively) with all three heavy metal concentrations, silt and sand, and (negatively) with loss‐on‐ignition and potassium concentration; axis 2 was significantly negatively correlated with pH and calcium, nitrate and phosphate concentrations. Consideration of this ordination and comparisons between soil parameters associated with each of the three vegetation groups and with non‐vegetated quadrats, suggest that lead and zinc may be the major determining factors of the spoil‐heap vegetation. Low nutrients (except phosphate) and in some cases adverse soil physical factors might be important also. The apparently small influence of copper is discussed. Above‐ground parts of five plant species were collected from the mine spoil and were shown often to have high heavy metal concentrations which differed between species. Finally we discuss some implications of interspecific differences in metal‐mine occurrence within the genera Agrostis and Festuca.","THOMPSON, JILL; PROCTOR, J.",New Phytol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167647/,91

31893,Principle and Technology of Dynamic Isolation,2016-12-01,"BACKGROUND: The discovery of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan city (China) has raised a global public health concern, as the city consists of around 11 million people and is considered a major transport and logistics hub. This deadly virus caused the world to be in high alert as the death toll and the number of confirmed cases is continuously rising since the first case was reported. The Chinese government warned that the transmission ability of the virus is increasing, and international efforts are needed to overcome this outbreak. The purpose of this review is to focus on the published articles about the new virus, which will give an insight into the current state of research and data available, as well as recommending future studies. METHODS: For this narrative review, more than 20 relevant scientific articles and reports were considered from various databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct) using keywords such as Coronavirus Outbreak, COVID-19, Emerging Epidemics, Emerging Infections, and Novel Coronavirus. RESULTS: The results from this review show that the situation is rapidly evolving, as human-to-human transmission is occurring, and the number of new cases and mortalities is increasing by the day and on a global level. There is still ambiguity about mutation risks and how the virus spreads as the source was not yet identified. Major gaps in knowledge about the origin of the virus, epidemiology and transmission impose a great challenge, which emphasizes the need for further studies in the future.","AlTakarli, Nourah S.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7179703/,91

In return, they provide bioactive molecules which can play critical roles on plant defense system. Fifty six endophytes were isolated from the leaves, root, bark and fruits of Sonneratia apetala, a pioneer mangrove plant in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh. A total of 56 isolates were obtained and 12 different species within 8 genera were identified using morphological and molecular characteristics. Antimicrobial activity of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and methanolic (MeOH) extracts of these 12 different species were analyzed by resazurin assay and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined. The fungal extracts showed antimicrobial activities against more than one tested bacterium or fungus among 5 human pathogenic microbes, i.e. Escherichia coli NCTC 12241, Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 12981, Micrococcus lutus NCTC 7508, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 7508 and Candida albicans ATCC 90028. Overall, methanolic extracts showed greater activity than that of ethyl acetate extracts. Of the isolates identified, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium equiseti were the most active isolates and showed activity against microorganisms under investigation. Methanolic extracts of C. gloeosporioides and A. niger showed the lowest MIC (0.0024 mg/mL) against P. aeruginosa. The study indicates that endophytic fungi isolated from S. apetala species possess potential antimicrobial properties, which could be further investigated.","Nurunnabi, Tauhidur R.; Sabrin, Farah; Sharif, Dilara I.; Nahar, Lutfun; Sohrab, Md.

35591,What do geologists do when the coronavirus bites? Ideas for educators,2020-06-18,"Where graphs are used for modelling and specifying systems, consistency is an important concern. To be a valid model of a system, the graph structure must satisfy a number of constraints. To date, consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property: a graph either is or is not consistent with respect to a set of graph constraints. This has enabled the definition of notions such as constraint-preserving and constraint-guaranteeing graph transformations. Many practical applications—for example model repair or evolutionary search—implicitly assume a more graduated notion of consistency, but without an explicit formalisation only limited analysis of these applications is possible. In this paper, we introduce an explicit notion of consistency as a graduated property, depending on the number of constraint violations in a graph. We present two new characterisations of transformations (and transformation rules) enabling reasoning about the gradual introduction of consistency: while consistency-sustaining transformations do not decrease the consistency level, consistency-improving transformations strictly reduce the number of constraint violations. We show how these new definitions refine the existing concepts of constraint-preserving and constraint-guaranteeing transformations. To support a static analysis based on our characterisations, we present criteria for deciding which form of consistency ensuring transformations is induced by the application of a transformation rule. We illustrate our contributions in the context of an example from search-based model engineering.","Kosiol, Jens; Strüber, Daniel; Taentzer, Gabriele; Zschaler, Steffen",Graph Transformation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314710/,91

This tool is employed to (i) build finite Markov decision processes (MDPs) as finite abstractions of given original systems, and (ii) synthesize controllers for the constructed finite MDPs satisfying bounded-time high-level properties including safety, reachability and reach-avoid specifications. In AMYTISS, scalable parallel algorithms are designed such that they support the parallel execution within CPUs, GPUs and hardware accelerators (HWAs). Unlike all existing tools for stochastic systems, AMYTISS can utilize high-performance computing (HPC) platforms and cloud-computing services to mitigate the effects of the state-explosion problem, which is always present in analyzing large-scale stochastic systems. We benchmark AMYTISS against the most recent tools in the literature using several physical case studies including robot examples, room temperature and road traffic networks. We also apply our algorithms to a 3-dimensional autonomous vehicle and 7-dimensional nonlinear model of a BMW 320i car by synthesizing an autonomous parking controller.","Lavaei, Abolfazl; Khaled, Mahmoud; Soudjani, Sadegh; Zamani, Majid",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363210/,91

This is a challenging question given that the traditional reservoirs of convenience (like metaphysical universalism) are no longer at our disposal the way they used to be. The paper is divided into eight sections: (1) It is specified what challenges a non-foundationalist justification and normativity has to meet. (2) A three-dimensional conception of responsibility is developed based on the human triangular I–We–World relations. (3) The concepts of bounded responsibility and bounded ethics of science and technology are formulated. (4) The principle of reflective equilibrium is introduced as a principle of rationality, and it is shown how this principle generates rational and reasonable justifications in the ethics of science and technology. (5) Against this background, a reconception of internal and external responsibilities of science is given. (6) The type of responsibility demanded is exemplified by today’s climate research. (7) The paper argues for a hand-in-hand model of uncertainties in the sciences and for ethical obligations to preserve the conditions of human life on earth. The ethical argument is spelled out in terms of ethical care, preservation, and precaution.

39411,HealthMap,2009-07-14,"BACKGROUND: Safety data is required to be collected in all clinical trials and can be separated into two types of data, adverse events and serious adverse events. Often, these types of safety data are collected as two discrete data sets, where adverse events that also meet the criteria for seriousness should be reported in both datasets. Safety analyses are often conducted using only the adverse event dataset, which should feature all safety events reported. We investigated whether the reporting of safety in both datasets was systematically followed and explored the impact of this on safety analyses in ICON8, an ovarian cancer clinical trial. METHODS: Text searches of serious adverse event data identified events that could potentially match the data reported in the adverse event dataset (looking at pre-specified AE terms only). These serious adverse events were then mapped to adverse event data according to predefined criteria: (a) event term matches, (b) date of onset and date of assessment within 30 days of each other, (c) date of assessment lies between date of onset and date of resolution and (d) events confirmed to occur in the same chemotherapy cycle. A combined dataset of all unique safety events (whether originally reported in the adverse event or serious adverse event dataset) was created and safety analyses re-performed. RESULTS: 51,019 adverse events were reported in ICON8, of which 42,410 were included in the mapping exercise. One thousand five hundred six serious adverse event elements were reported, of which 668 were included in the mapping exercise. Sixty-one percent of serious adverse event elements was matched to an already-reported adverse event. Supplementing these additional safety events and re-performing safety analyses increased the proportion of patients with at least one grade 3 or worse safety events in all arms from 42 to 47% in the control arm and 61 to 65% and 52 to 59% in the research arms. The difference in proportions of grade 3 or worse event in the research arms compared to the control arm changed by 18% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12 to 24%) and 12% (95% CI 6 to 18%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There was low agreement in mapping serious adverse events to already reported adverse events, with nearly 40% of serious adverse events included in the mapping exercise not mapped to an already reported adverse event. Any analyses of safety data that use only adverse event datasets or do not clearly account for serious adverse event data will likely be missing important safety information. Reporting standards should make clear which datasets were used for analyses.","James, Elizabeth C.; Dunn, David; Cook, Adrian D.; Clamp, Andrew R.; Sydes, Matthew R.",Trials,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7495966/,91
39415,The Clinical Application of Ozonetherapy,2010-09-24,"BACKGROUND: Health communication is a field that uses social and behavioral models to improve health outcomes and raise awareness on major health risks that threaten human well-being. Low-income countries (LICs) suffer from the effects of communicable and noncommunicable diseases that are exacerbated by weak health-care systems, lack of awareness campaigns, and ineffective communication tactics. This work aims to explore health communication research in LICs to find strategies that help improve health outcomes in the future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed database was explored systematically for publications related to health communication from LICs between January 1, 1960, and January 1, 2020. Publications were categorized according to country of origin and were analyzed with respect to population size, gross domestic product (GDP), and primary school enrollment of each state as obtained from the World Bank Open Data. RESULTS: Collectively, LICs published 796 contributions, comprising 1.08% of the total biomedical research published by LICs and 0.27% of the world's health communication research. Malawi had the highest number of publications per GDP, with 32.811 publications per billion US$. Uganda had the most contributions per population, with 9.579 publications per million persons. Ethiopia had the highest amount of contributions per primary school enrollment with a ratio of 2.461 publications per %gross. The role of health communication in promoting HIV awareness and prevention was the most common theme explored. Other infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and Ebola, were also highlighted. Improving communication in health education was also explored. CONCLUSION: Health communication is a rising field in LICs, with research focusing on disease prevention. Efforts to amplify research are key to effectively utilize the health communication models and improve health outcomes in LICs.","Mheidly, Nour; Fares, Jawad",J Educ Health Promot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7482704/,91
39673,Kostenträgerrechnungen von strabologischen Operationen an einer Universitäts-Augenklinik,2020-09-22,"This paper argues for the regular testing of people in groups that are more likely to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and resume economic activity. We call this ‘stratified periodic testing’. It is ‘stratified’ as it is based on at-risk groups, and ‘periodic’ as everyone in the group is tested at regular intervals. We argue that this is a better use of scarce testing resources than ‘universal random testing’, as has been recently discussed globally. We find that, under reasonable assumptions and allowing for false negative results 30 per cent of the time, 17 per cent of a subgroup would need to be tested each day to lower the effective reproduction number R from 2.5 to 0.75, under stratified periodic testing. Using the same assumptions the universal random testing rate would need to be 27 per cent (as opposed to 7 per cent as argued by Romer (2020b)). We obtain this rate of testing using a corrected method for calculating the impact of an infectious person on others, and allowing for asymptomatic cases. We also find that the effect of one day’s delay between testing positive and self-isolating is similar to having a test that is 30 per cent less accurate.","Cleevely, Matthew; Susskind, Daniel; Vines, David; Vines, Louis; Wills, Samuel",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7499786/,91

43189,Natural history of social and sexual behavior in fruit flies,2020-12-14,"The humanitarian–development nexus is increasingly being cast as the solution to humanitarian concerns, new and protracted crises, and to manage complex war-to-peace transitions. Despite widely endorsed amongst policymakers, this nexus presents some challenges to those implementing it. Humanitarian action and development assistance represent two distinct discursive and institutional segments of the international system that are hard to juxtapose. Humanitarianism’s apolitical and imminent needs-based approaches building on established humanitarian principles are fundamentally different from the more long-term, political, rights-based approaches of development. As they rub shoulders, as intentionally instigated by the nexus, they affect and challenge each other. These challenges are more acute to the humanitarian domain given the constitutive status of the humanitarian principles, which, when challenged, may cause changes to the humanitarian space and a mission-cum-ethics creep. This article explores the formation and effects of the humanitarian–development nexus as rendered both at the top, amongst policymakers, and from the bottom. The latter explores the discursive transition from conflict to reconstruction in Northern Uganda. Humanitarian organisations’ different response to the transition demonstrate more pragmatic approaches to the humanitarian principles and thus how the nexus itself is also formed bottom up and further exacerbates the mission creep.","Lie, Jon Harald Sande",Int J Humanitarian Action,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7725665/,91
43573,50 Years of Drugs,2020-12-24,"“Social distancing” and stay-at-home orders were enacted in many states in response to the spread of COVID-19. We sought to understand intergenerational differences in the impact of the initial COVID-19 restrictions on interactions, loneliness, and stress. Data was collected via online survey from individuals ages 18 and above during the period April 7-May 8, 2020. The predominantly female, White, and well-educated sample (n = 962) included 245 younger adults (YAs) ages 18-34, 374 middle-aged adults (MAs) ages 35-64, and 343 older adults (OAs) ages 65+, with overall mean age 51.67 (SD=20.257; range 18-96). Before the restrictions, 41% of these OAs infrequently/never interacted face-to-face with children, increasing to 74% after restrictions. Three quarters (77%) of YAs reported seeing OAs less often, but 42% reported increasing their connections with OAs via technology. About a third of MAs (35%) and OAs (36%) were lonely, compared to 48% of YAs (p = .003), and a higher percentage of YAs (57%) reported being “more lonely” now, compared to MAs (36%) and OAs (41%). OAs reported the least stress; 42% reported low/very low levels of stress compared to YAs (9%) and MAs (20%). All generations most often identified “being able to go places” as the thing they missed most, but it increased significantly with age (p < .001), from YAs (32%), MAs (37%), to OAs (44%). More YAs (20%) than OAs (7%) reported missing “structure to their day.” Results of these intergenerational comparisons suggest the resilience of older adults is helping them during the current pandemic.","Glass, Anne; Lawlor, Lauretta",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7742165/,91

It has elevated and expanded the role of essential workers, not only in healthcare but also in the food industry. The food industry has undergone major disruptions in the pandemic for reasons including compromised labor resources. In this paper, we develop a supply chain-generalized network optimization framework focused on perishable food. The model explicitly includes labor availability associated with the network economic activities of production, transportation, storage, and distribution in order to quantify the impacts of associated disruptions due to illnesses, physical/social distancing requirements, and decreases in labor productivity. Theoretical results are presented along with a series of numerical examples on a fresh produce product with quantification of a spectrum of pandemic-induced disruptions on product flows, demands, prices, and the profits of the food firm. We also show that including more direct demand markets for fresh produce can yield gains for the firm.","Nagurney, Anna",Dynamics of Disasters,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982086/,91

The immediate impacts of this are economic pains and infrastructural decay, but long-term effects include crawling pace of national development and loss of integrity in the global system. So, how does corruption affect politics and governance in Nigeria? This chapter examines the relationship between them and where it has positioned the country in terms of development and progress. Anchored on the argument that corrupt and other related acts would inevitably discount the gains of democratic governance, pollute the political space, create a spatial economy, and lead to a “massification” of the poor, this chapter posits that corruption has thrown spanners in the wheels of national development. The chapter also argues that the politics and government of Nigeria have suffered for too long in the hands of habitual and unrepentant treasury looters, political jobbers and beneficiaries of interminable orchestrations of scandals and frauds. It recommends that anti-corruption agencies should be answerable only to the judiciary, made up of persons with records of integrity, and led by a judge with a record of accomplishment, forthrightness and fearlessness.","Folarin, Sheriff",Nigerian Politics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991512/,91

Such a viewpoint requires careful reconsideration, thanks to elegant experiments and novel theoretical approaches that have come about in recent years. In this work, we perform a detailed classical and quantum dynamical study of a model two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian, which captures the essence of the debate regarding the dominance of a concerted or a stepwise reaction mechanism. We show that the ultrafast shift of the mechanism from a concerted to a stepwise one is essentially a classical dynamical effect. In addition, due to the classical phase space being a mixture of regular and chaotic dynamics, it is possible to have a rich variety of dynamical behavior, including a Murrell – Laidler type mechanism, even at energies sufficiently above that of the index-[Formula: see text] saddle. We rationalize the dynamical results using an explicit construction of the classical invariant manifolds in the phase space.

The policy changes have ensured the steady growth of education financial investment, but also brought a series of unknown or uncertain factors to the allocation of educational resources. According to the text context from the selected mainstream Chinese media in the past two decades, this study creates a newspaper-based policy uncertainty indices of China’s education fiscal policy under the framework of Baker (JAMA 131(4):1593–1636, 2016)'s study. We also apply the EGARCH model to test the robustness of the results. Our findings reveal that the uncertainty indices are highly consistent with the fluctuation of education fiscal policy in various stages in China. It suggests that the government sectors should define the reasonable boundaries of the ""tangible hand"" and harden the budget in the process of allocating education resources, to eliminate the negative impact brought by the uncertainty of education fiscal policy. Moreover, this study puts forward the research prospect of the application of policy uncertainty in the field of education.","Wang, Dong; Fang, Jingxuan; Zhang, Qiqi",Asia Pacific Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8056198/,91
52497,Application of the adverse outcome pathway framework to predict the toxicity of chemicals in the semiconductor manufacturing industry,2021-05-05,"Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) is rare in pediatrics, particularly in patients with antibody positive diabetes mellitus (DM). Recent literature has implicated COVID-19 in the reported increase in new-onset DM cases, as well as mixed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and HHS cases, however a rise in HHS cases alone has not been well reported [1,2]. We noted an anecdotal increase in the frequency of HHS cases in our pediatric tertiary care center following the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. To investigate further, a retrospective chart review evaluating all patients with DM admitted in the first 6 months of 2019 and the first 6 months of 2020 was conducted. A diagnosis of HHS was defined as a blood glucose over 600 mg/dL with a serum osmolality (calculated or measured) greater than 320 mOsm/kg on initial laboratory evaluation. Patients with DKA, defined as a serum bicarbonate level less than 16 mmol/L with evidence of significant ketosis (serum ketones greater than 3 mmol/L), were excluded from the study. During the first 6 months of 2019, 1 patient met inclusion criteria. However, the diagnosis of HHS was complicated by a concurrent diagnosis of diabetes insipidus, which may have contributed to the hyperosmolar state, and a nonketotic lactic acidosis. Five HHS cases were noted in the first 6 months of 2020, 4 of which occurred in May and June. For the 2020 HHS cohort, the average patient age ± SD was 12 ± 3.34 years. The mean ± SD laboratory values included bicarbonate 18.2 ± 1.64 mmol/L, serum blood glucose 776.8 ± 30.75 mg/dL, calculated serum osmolality 328 ± 4.18 mOsm/kg, and HgA1C 12.72 ± 1.16%. All 5 patients in the 2020 cohort had new-onset DM, with 4 of the 5 patients having at least 1 positive DM antibody (GAD antibodies were positive in 3, ICA/IA-2 antibodies in 2, and Zinc Transporter 8 antibodies in 1). No patients displayed COVID-19 symptoms, and only 1 patient was tested for COVID-19 by PCR, which returned negative. However, SARS-CoV2 antibody testing was not available, and it is unknown if these patients had prior COVID-19 illness. In conclusion, we noted an increased incidence of HHS at our hospital, particularly among new-onset, antibody positive DM patients during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further study and investigation are needed to determine the cause of this increased local incidence, and if infectious, social, or economic influences related to the COVID-19 pandemic contributed.

According to the adsorption energy, charge transfer value, and the change in the bang gap energy, the tendency of the pristine GDY towards LET is insignificant. However, the interaction of LET with SiGDY was strong and the adsorption energy was approximately − 19.20 kcal/mol. In addition, the associated electrical conductivity with SiGDY increased by approximately 23.53 % following the adsorption of LET. The results show that SiGDY can be employed as an electronic sensor to detect LET. Furthermore, LET is detected by SiGDY in the water phase based on the magnitude of solvation energy. Finally, a considerable charge-transfer between LET and SiGDY is a precondition for the adsorption of the LET molecule with proper binding energies, which delivers the Si atoms with a significant positive charge.","Karbakhshzadeh, Ayda; Derakhshande, Maryam; Farhami, Nabieh; Hosseinian, Akram; Ebrahimiasl, Saeideh; Ebadi, Abdolghaffar",Silicon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8109220/,91

During the epidemic period, Chinese people united and actively fought against the epidemic. However, in the eyes of the international public, the situation reported about China is not optimistic. To better understand how the international public portrays China, especially during the epidemic, we present a case study with big data technology. We aim to answer three questions: (1) What has the international media focused on during the COVID-19 epidemic period? (2) What is the media’s tone when they report China? (3) What is the media’s attitude when talking about China? In detail, we crawled more than 280 000 pieces of news from 57 mainstream media agencies in 22 countries and made some interesting observations. For example, international media paid more attention to Chinese livelihood during the COVID-19 epidemic period. In March and April, “progress of Chinese vaccines,” “specific drugs and treatments,” and “virus outbreak in U.S.” became the media’s most common topics. In terms of news attitude, Cuba, Malaysia, and Venezuela had a positive attitude toward China, while France, Canada, and the United Kingdom had a negative attitude. Our study can help understand China’s image in the eyes of the international media and provide a sound basis for image analysis.","Huang, Hong; Chen, Zhexue; Shi, Xuanhua; Wang, Chenxu; He, Zepeng; Jin, Hai; Zhang, Mingxin; Li, Zongya",Front Inform Technol Electron Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8150621/,91
54837,The Evolution of Cancer Immunotherapy,2021-06-08,"Both psychological and entrepreneurship research have highlighted the pivotal role of job satisfaction in the process of entrepreneurial career decisions. In support of this, mounting evidence point to inter-relationships between entrepreneurial intention, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. Prior research operationalized entrepreneurial careers as an escape from poor work environments; thus, there is a lack of understanding regarding how job-satisfaction can trigger entrepreneurship within and related to the environment of universities. This study, draws on Social Cognitive Career Theory and the concept of entrepreneurial intention, to address whether the role of job satisfaction is a moderating factor between outcome expectations and entrepreneurial intention. Furthermore, we examine to what extent (I) entrepreneurial intention and (II) spin-off intention are determined by certain outcome expectations and perceived behavioral control. To address these questions this study examined academic researchers in specialized and non-technical fields and builds on a survey of 593 academic researchers at Swiss Universities of Applied Science. The results showed that outcome expectations are a significant predictor for entrepreneurial intentions, in general, and spin-off intentions, in particular. A multi-group analysis corroborated that job satisfaction operates as a motivational factor in entrepreneurial transition and interactions with entrepreneurial outcome expectations. In conclusion, the concept of job satisfaction and Social Cognitive Career Theory were powerful constructs to better the understand the process of entrepreneurial career decisions by academic researchers.","Blaese, Richard; Noemi, Schneider; Brigitte, Liebig",Int Entrep Manag J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8215324/,91

However, considering public attitudes on tidal energy are not well known, especially in developing countries, a barrier exists in implementing public engagement strategies. This study aims to contribute by identifying strategies for information provision—the initial step in public engagement—and estimate how these can be engaged to enhance support for tidal energy among the local public in a remote area of a developing country, in this case, Flores Timur Regency, Indonesia, considering their socio-cultural background. METHODS: In this paper, we employ statistical analyses using multinomial probit modelling to identify the key variables that shape information flow. The aptness of the variables is then verified using post-estimation techniques for their use as input parameters for the simulation of the information flow in the field study area. Agent-based simulation (ABS) is employed to replicate the actual conditions in Flores Timur Regency, Indonesia, and simulate the flow of information through the local community. RESULTS: According to the multinomial probit estimations, the people belonging to the top hierarchical group show a higher probability to support tidal energy compared to the members belonging to the lower groups. Understandably, around twice as many information flow cycles are needed to disseminate information to the members of the lowest hierarchical group, compared to the members of the top hierarchical group. The results also show that increasing the amount of available information has a positive impact on information dissemination. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that information provision is highly effective with propagation of information that specifically highlights the individual benefits, rather than the community benefits of tidal energy. Additionally, savings in terms of costs, time, and efforts can be realized if the most influential members of the local community are targeted initially before including all other stakeholders. The study also indicated that locals absorb more information and increase their support for tidal energy when additional data is made available. Finally, as long-term strategy, information provision becomes most effective when the local population gains higher educational capabilities.

We examined the larynx of 40 critically ill children in the first 24 h after extubation to estimate the frequency and analyze the risk factors for laryngeal trauma using the classification system for acute laryngeal injury (CALI). RESULTS: The post-extubation stridor patients had a higher frequency of diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism, longer duration of ventilation, longer hospital stay, moderate to severe involvement of glottic and subglottic area, frequent intubation attempts, and more than 60 s to intubate Regression analysis of the risk factors of severity of the injury has shown that development of ventilator-associated pneumonia carried the highest risk (OR 32.111 95% CI 5.660 to 182.176), followed by time elapsed till intubation in seconds (OR 11.836, 95% CI 2.889 to 48.490), number of intubation attempts (OR 10.8, CI 2.433 to 47.847), and development of pneumothorax (OR 10.231, 95% CI 1.12 to 93.3). CONCLUSION: The incidence of intubation-related laryngeal trauma in pediatric ICU is high and varies widely from mild, non-symptomatic to moderate, and severe and could be predicted by any of the following: prolonged days of ventilation, pneumothorax, multiple tube changes, or difficult intubation.","Algebaly, HebatAllah Fadel; Mohsen, Mona; Naguib, Maggie Louis; Bazaraa, Hafez; Hazem, Noran; Aziz, Miriam Magdy",Egypt Pediatric Association Gaz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8317139/,91

56723,The Verification of Nanosatellites Solar Panels Automatic Deployment in Microgravity Conditions,2021-08-12,"Conservation increasingly seeks knowledge of human behaviour. However, securing reliable data can be challenging, particularly if the behaviour is illegal or otherwise sensitive. Specialised questioning methods such as Randomised Response Techniques (RRTs) are increasingly used in conservation to provide greater anonymity, increase response rates, and reduce bias. A rich RRT literature exists, but successfully navigating it can be challenging. To help conservationists access this literature, we summarise the various RRT designs available and conduct a systematic review of empirical applications of RRTs within (n = 32), and beyond conservation (n = 66). Our results show increased application of RRTs in conservation since 2000. We compare the performance of RRTs against known prevalence of the sensitive behaviour and relative to other questioning techniques to assess how successful RRTs are at reducing bias (indicated by securing higher estimates). Findings suggest that RRT applications in conservation were less likely than those in other disciplines to provide prevalence estimates equal to, or higher than those derived from direct questions. Across all disciplines, we found reports of non-compliance with RRT instructions were common, but rarely accounted for in study design or analysis. For the first time, we provide conservationists considering RRTs with evidence on what works, and provide guidance on how to develop robust designs suitable for conservation research contexts. We highlight when alternate methods should be used, how to increase design efficiency and improve compliance with RRT instructions. We conclude RRTs are a useful tool, but their performance depends on careful design and implementation.","Ibbett, Harriet; Jones, Julia P.G.; St John, Freya A.V.",Biol Conserv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346952/,91

The retail industry is not an exception and is facing a paradigm shift in many aspects of its operations. One of the latest innovations in this industry is the development of unmanned stores concepts and business models. These novel business models are mostly used in the grocery stores segment with an impetus to eliminate the need for check-out lines and to create more efficiencies in the whole process of the shopping experience. Because of the disruptive nature of this business model, it is important to research the effects of its expansion into society. In this article, we are making a critical analysis of the sustainability impact of unmanned stores and assess the strategic direction and growth strategies of major corporations and organizations within the value chain. We used an unambiguous and straightforward questionnaire as the research tool and the results show grocery as the current target for expansion, however, future expectations from business developers lean heavily towards coffee and books. Interestingly, the investment logic for expected benefits from the participants seemed to be biased towards efficiencies and the value chain benefits seemed to mostly come from the use of big data and data analytics. The most important use of the data was associated with the dynamic pricing models.

The XRD profile proved the cubic crystal structure of the samples without any impurity related phases. The reduced size from 63 to 51 Å and the dissimilarities in lattice parameters and micro-strain has been discussed by Ni addition in Cd(0.87)Zn(0.1)Ni(0.03)S structure.

The energy gap reduction during the substitution of Ni = 3% is explained by the generation of extra energy levels associated with defects within the two bands. The release of additional charge carriers, improved optical property, reduced particle size and more defect generation are responsible for the enhanced photo-catalytic performance of Ni doped Cd(0.9)Zn(0.1)S. The enhanced anti-bacterial capacity in Cd(0.87)Zn(0.1)Ni(0.03)S is described by the collective response of reduced particle size and higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) like O(2)(⋅−), H(2)O(2) and OH(⋅) generating capacity.","Jothi, S.; Ganesh, Rane Caroleena; Muthukumaran, S.; Rathiha, S.

For the early stages of osteonecrosis, core decompression combined with bone grafting, is a procedure worthy of attention and clinical trial. And the study of bone graft substitutes has become a hot topic in the area of osteonecrosis research. In recent years, polymers have received more attention than other materials due to their excellent performance. However, because of the harsh microenvironment in osteonecrosis, pure polymers may not meet the stringent requirements of osteonecrosis research. The combined application of polymers and various other substances makes up for the shortcomings of polymers, and to meet a broad range of requirements for application in osteonecrosis therapy. This review focuses on various applying polymers in osteonecrosis therapy, then discusses the development of biofunctionalized composite polymers based on the polymers combined with different bioactive substances. At the end, we discuss their prospects for translation to clinical practice.","Dong, Hengliang; Zhu, Tongtong; Zhang, Mingran; Wang, Dapeng; Wang, Xukai; Huang, Guanning; Wang, Shuaishuai; Zhang, Minglei",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8498195/,91

As a result, many university students were forced to utilize online learning through channels such as mobile social media. Due to the novelty of this situation, there are many unknowns particularly with the negative influences of mobile learning via social media on university students. Thus, this study looks to examine this subject matter from the perspective of the stimulus–organism–response theory. The uniquely developed research model included four stimuli (i.e., social overload, information overload, life invasion, and privacy invasion), two organisms (i.e., technostress and exhaustion) as well as a response in terms of reduced intention to use mobile learning via social media. The responses were collected from 384 university students via an online survey and analyzed with the Partial-Least-Square-Structural-Equation-Modelling. It was found that the antecedents for both technostress and exhaustion were able to account for more than half of their respective variances. Furthermore, technostress and exhaustion were significant facilitators of the students’ reduced intention to use mobile learning via social media. In addition to the practical insights for stakeholders in the education industry, this study also posited several theoretical implications for researchers.","Loh, Xiu-Kin; Lee, Voon-Hsien; Loh, Xiu-Ming; Tan, Garry Wei-Han; Ooi, Keng-Boon; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.",Inf Syst Front,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8501931/,91

METHODS: In two studies we investigate the levels and domains of pathological worrying in university student participants. Study 1 is a retrospective study of Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) data collected between 2001 and 2019. Study 2 describes the development of the Student Worry Questionnaire, a short and easily delivered measure of student worrying that identifies both frequency of worry as well as the student-relevant domains across which worrying occurs. RESULTS: Study 1 revealed a steady increase in student worry scores of around 20% between 2001 and 2019, with a significant positive correlation between year of data collection and mean PSWQ score. The domain scores in Study 2 indicated that academic work was a significantly higher worry than any of the other domains, and worries about intimate relationships and ‘what people think of me’ were also worries that scored higher than either financial or health worries. CONCLUSIONS: The present studies indicate that pathological worrying can be added to the list of anxiety- and stress-related symptoms that have been shown to be on the increase in student populations in recent decades, and we discuss whether these increases represent a greater willingness to report symptoms or a genuine increase in experienced symptoms over time.","Davey, Graham C.

Method: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), and undifferentiated arthritis (UA), participating in the Northern Savo 2010 Study, were evaluated for metabolic syndrome (MetS), metabolic and inflammatory markers, antibodies to MAA-LDL, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Results: Among 135 newly diagnosed untreated patients, of whom 53 (39%) were diagnosed to have RA, 44 (33%) SpA, and 38 (28%) UA, 49%, 30%, and 47%, respectively, had MetS. After adjusting for age and gender, anti-MAA-LDL immunoglobulin (Ig)A (p = 0.009), IgG (p = 0.031), and IgM (p = 0.001) levels differed between the diagnostic categories, but not in patients with MetS present or absent. All antibody classes to MAA-LDL correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and IgA and IgG antibodies with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). IgA antibodies to MAA-LDL correlated with rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), fasting plasma glucose, IgA antibodies to A. actinomycetemcomitans, and in IgA and IgG antibodies to P. gingivalis. Conclusion: Among various arthritis groups, antibodies to MAA-LDL were most common in RA. Antibodies to modified lipoproteins were associated with inflammation measured by ESR and hs-CRP. IgA antibodies to MAA-LDL correlated with age, antibodies to periodontal bacteria, RF, ACPA, and fasting glucose. Associations between antibodies to MAA-LDL and antibodies to periodontal bacteria, RA-associated antibodies, inflammatory parameters, and plasma glucose already reflect cardiovascular burden in inflammatory joint diseases at diagnosis.","Kononoff, A; Hörkkö, S; Pussinen, P; Kautiainen, H; Elfving, P; Savolainen, E; Arstila, L; Niinisalo, H; Rutanen, J; Marjoniemi, O; Kaipiainen-Seppänen, O",Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/03009742.2020.1795244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985314/,91

RESULTS Of the 215 patients evaluated, 147 underwent functional end-to-end anastomosis (FEEA) as the intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy (FEEA group), and 68 patients received a circular stapler anastomosis (Circular group). The rate of tumor invasion to the esophagus was significantly higher in the Circular group than in the FEEA group (33% vs. 6%, respectively; P<0.0001). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the circular stapler anastomosis and high preoperative BMI were statistically significant risk factors for postoperative leakage.

Serious respiratory complications aside, the heart is also frequently involved. The mechanisms and the extent of the myocardial injury, along with the short and long-term cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in COVID-19 survivors remain unclear. AREAS COVERED myocardial injury has been found in a considerable proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is associated with a worse prognosis. The late onset of CV complications with myocarditis-like changes revealed by CMR have been reported in COVID-19 survivors. Previous observational studies on viral myocarditis provide evidence of a significant incomplete recovery with residual dysfunction and remodeling of left ventricle. Incomplete recovery is thought to be the result of persistent myocardial inflammation due to a post-viral autoimmune response. Considering the significant inflammatory nature of COVID-19, COVID-19 survivors may be at risk of developing persistent residual myocardial injury, the sequelae of which are unclear. EXPERT COMMENTARY COVID-19 is an emerging threat for the heart. The extent of CV injury, along with the short and long-term sequelae, requires further investigation. The early detection of residual myocardial changes in COVID-19 survivors is of utmost importance in order to identify those patients at risk CV complication development.","Shchedrygina, Anastasia; Nagel, Eike; Puntmann, Valentina O; Valbuena-Lopez, Silvia",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14779072.2021.1844005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119418/,91

While moderate success has been achieved with provider- and parent-focused interventions, HPV vaccination in the U.S. lags well behind desired goals. In order to maximize HPV vaccination and prevention of HPV-related cancers, it may be prudent to consider state policy approaches, such as school-entry requirements as part of the patchwork of provider, parent, and structural interventions. In this paper, we reviewed the history of efforts to implement school-entry requirements for HPV vaccine, the challenges and benefits associated with implementing these requirements, and the evidence for the effectiveness of school-entry requirements. In addition, we presented new data from Rhode Island's Immunization Information System (IIS) showing how their school-entry requirement, implemented in 2015, has impacted HPV vaccination rates. These registry data indicate that HPV vaccination rates improved significantly after the 2014-2015 school year and policy implementation, and add to the ongoing evidence supporting the value of school-entry requirements for HPV vaccination. School-entry requirements should be considered alongside other initiatives and policies for promoting HPV vaccine uptake.

Endemic transmission was recognized in Canada in early February 2020, making it urgent for public health stakeholders to have access to robust and reliable tools to support decision-making for epidemic management. The objectives of this paper are to present one of these tools-an aged-stratified dynamic compartmental model developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada in collaboration with Statistics Canada-and to model the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the attack rate of COVID-19 infection in Canada. Methods This model simulates the impact of different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions, including case detection/isolation, contact tracing/quarantine and changes in the level of physical distancing in Canada, as restrictive closures began to be lifted in May 2020. Results This model allows us to highlight the importance of a relatively high level of detection and isolation of cases, as well as tracing and quarantine of individuals in contact with those cases, in order to avoid a resurgence of the epidemic in Canada as restrictive closures are lifted. Some level of physical distancing by the public will also likely need to be maintained. Conclusion This study underlines the importance of a cautious approach to lifting restrictive closures in this second phase of the epidemic. This approach includes efforts by public health to identify cases and trace contacts, and to encourage Canadians to get tested if they are at risk of having been infected and to maintain physical distancing in public areas.","Ludwig, Antoinette; Berthiaume, Philippe; Orpana, Heather; Nadeau, Claude; Diasparra, Maikol; Barnes, Joel; Hennessy, Deirdre; Otten, Ainsley; Ogden, Nicholas",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v46i1112a08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447163/,91

Although these genome-wide average measures of genetic similarity are consistent with the hypothesis of archaic admixture in Eurasia, analyses of individual loci exhibiting the signal of archaic introgression are needed to test alternative hypotheses and investigate the admixture process. Here, we provide a detailed sequence analysis of the innate immune gene OAS1, a locus with a divergent Melanesian haplotype that is very similar to the Denisova sequence from the Altai region of Siberia. We resequenced a 7-kb region encompassing the OAS1 gene in 88 individuals from six Old World populations (San, Biaka, Mandenka, French Basque, Han Chinese, and Papua New Guineans) and discovered previously unknown and ancient genetic variation. The 5' region of this gene has unusual patterns of diversity, including 1) higher levels of nucleotide diversity in Papuans than in sub-Saharan Africans, 2) very deep ancestry with an estimated time to the most recent common ancestor of >3 myr, and 3) a basal branching pattern with Papuan individuals on either side of the rooted network. A global geographic survey of >1,500 individuals showed that the divergent Papuan haplotype is nearly restricted to populations from eastern Indonesia and Melanesia. Polymorphic sites within this haplotype are shared with the draft Denisova genome over a span of ∼90 kb and are associated with an extended block of linkage disequilibrium, supporting the hypothesis that this haplotype introgressed from an archaic source that likely lived in Eurasia.","Mendez, Fernando L; Watkins, Joseph C; Hammer, Michael F",Molecular biology and evolution,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msr301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22319157/,91

63353,Surgical treatment of a chronic postmyocardial infarction ventricular septal rupture.,2020-11-30,"UNLABELLED Coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) is a 60-kDa protein encoded by the replicase gene that is part of the replication-transcription complex. It is a bifunctional enzyme bearing 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activities. ExoN hydrolyzes single-stranded RNAs and double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and is part of a proofreading system responsible for the high fidelity of CoV replication. nsp14 N7-MTase activity is required for viral mRNA cap synthesis and prevents the recognition of viral mRNAs as ""non-self"" by the host cell. In this work, a set of point mutants affecting different motifs within the ExoN domain of nsp14 was generated, using transmissible gastroenteritis virus as a model of Alphacoronavirus Mutants lacking ExoN activity were nonviable despite being competent in both viral RNA and protein synthesis. A specific mutation within zinc finger 1 (ZF-C) led to production of a viable virus with growth and viral RNA synthesis kinetics similar to that of the parental virus. Mutant recombinant transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) ZF-C (rTGEV-ZF-C) caused decreased cytopathic effect and apoptosis compared with the wild-type virus and reduced levels of dsRNA accumulation at late times postinfection. Consequently, the mutant triggered a reduced antiviral response, which was confirmed by evaluating different stages of the dsRNA-induced antiviral pathway. The expression of beta interferon (IFN-β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interferon-stimulated genes in cells infected with mutant rTGEV-ZF-C was reduced compared to the levels seen with the parental virus. Overall, our data revealed a potential role for CoV nsp14 in modulation of the innate immune response. IMPORTANCE The innate immune response is the first line of antiviral defense that culminates in the synthesis of interferon and proinflammatory cytokines to control viral replication. CoVs have evolved several mechanisms to counteract the innate immune response at different levels, but the role of CoV-encoded ribonucleases in preventing activation of the dsRNA-induced antiviral response has not been described to date. The introduction of a mutation in zinc finger 1 of the ExoN domain of nsp14 led to production of a virus that induced a weak antiviral response, most likely due to the accumulation of lower levels of dsRNA in the late phases of infection. These observations allowed us to propose a novel role for CoV nsp14 ExoN activity in counteracting the antiviral response, which could serve as a novel target for the design of antiviral strategies.","Becares, Martina; Pascual-Iglesias, Alejandro; Nogales, Aitor; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis; Zuñiga, Sonia",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03259-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009949/,91

This study aimed to determine whether organisational skills related to Core Surgical Training (CST) outcome. Primary outcome measures include operative experience, publications, examination success (Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons or the Diploma in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (MRCS/DO-HNS)) and ARCP outcome. METHODS The study was conducted prospectively at three consecutive CST induction boot camps (2017-2019) providing clinical and simulation training for 125 trainees. Arrival time at course registration was the selected surrogate for organisational skills. Trainees were advised to arrive promptly at 8:45 for registration and that the course would start at 9:00. Trainee arrival times were grouped as follows: early (before 8:45), on time (8:45-8:59am) or late (after 9:00). Arrival times were compared with primary outcome measures. SETTING Health Education and Improvement Wales' School of Surgery, UK. RESULTS Median arrival time was 8:53 (range 7:55-10:03), with 29 trainees (23.2%) arriving early, 63 (50.4%) on-time and 33 (26.4%) late. Arrival time was associated with operative experience (early vs late; 206 vs 164 cases, p=0.012), publication (63.2% vs 18.5%, p=0.005), MRCS/DO-HNS success (44.8% vs 15.2%, p=0.029), ARCP outcome (86.2% vs 60.6% Outcome 1, p=0.053), but not National Training Number success (60.0% vs 53.3%, p=0.772). CONCLUSIONS Better-prepared trainees achieved 25% more operative experience, were four-fold more likely to publish and pass MRCS, which aligned with consistent desirable ARCP outcome.

63799,Management of cutaneous human papillomavirus infection: surgery.,2014,"Immunity to currently used oil-adjuvanted inactivated vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has been studied in detail in adult animals; however, the influence of maternally derived antibodies transferred through colostrum (Mat-Abs) in the immune responses of vaccinated calves is less clear. Here, we report the anti-FMDV humoral responses elicited in calves with or without Mat-Abs that received one or two doses of the current tetravalent oil-adjuvanted commercial vaccine used in Argentina. Anti-FMDV (O1/Campos strain) antibodies (Abs) were evaluated by Liquid Phase Blocking ELISA (LPB-ELISA), virus neutralization test (VNT), isotype ELISA (IgG1, IgG2 and IgM) and avidity ELISA, to allow for the first time a more detailed description of the humoral responses elicited. Our results show that primary IgM responses to FMDV vaccination only became evident as Mat-Abs titers decreased. Likewise, prime and boost vaccination schedules, applied 35 days apart to groups of calves with high or low levels of Mat-Abs, showed that the levels of preexisting neutralizing Mat-Abs prevented the loss of total Abs measured by LPB-ELISA but negatively interfered with the induction of virus neutralizing responses. Altogether, these findings indicate that comprehensive serological characterization of immune responses generated after vaccination in calves may reveal important information on the actual effectiveness of vaccination strategies for young animals, particularly in endemic settings.","Bucafusco, Danilo; Di Giacomo, Sebastián; Pega, Juan; Juncos, María Sol; Schammas, Juan Manuel; Pérez-Filgueira, Mariano; Capozzo, Alejandra Victoria",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.06.056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968156/,91

SUMMARY ANSWER Temporary ovarian suspension for 36-48 h following laparoscopic treatment of severe endometriosis does not result in a significant reduction of postoperative ovarian adhesions. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Pelvic adhesions often develop following laparoscopic surgery for severe pelvic endometriosis. Adhesions can cause chronic pelvic pain and fertility problems compromising the success of treatment. Small observational studies suggested that temporary postoperative ovarian suspension to the abdominal wall may significantly reduce the prevalence of postoperative ovarian adhesions. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This was a prospective within group comparison double-blind RCT. We recruited premenopausal women with severe pelvic endometriosis who required extensive laparoscopic surgery with preservation of the uterus and ovaries. Severity of the disease and eligibility for inclusion were determined at surgery. A total of 55 women were randomized to unilateral ovarian suspension for 36-48 h, 52 of which were included in the final analysis. Both ovaries were routinely suspended to the anterior abdominal wall during surgery. At the end of the operation, each woman was randomized to having only one ovary suspended postoperatively. The suture suspending the contralateral ovary was cut and a new transabdominal suture was inserted to act as a placebo. Both sutures were removed 36-48 h after surgery prior to discharge. Three months after surgery, all women attended for a detailed transvaginal ultrasound scan to assess ovarian mobility. Both the women and the ultrasound operators were blinded as to the side of postoperative ovarian suspension. The primary outcome was the prevalence of ovarian adhesions as described on ultrasound examination. Secondary outcomes were the severity of adhesions and the presence and intensity of postoperative pain. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS All 55 participants had severe pelvic endometriosis confirmed at laparoscopy. As each participant had only one of their ovaries suspended at the end of surgery, they acted as their own control. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The median interval between ovarian suspension and postoperative scan was 99 days (interquartile range 68-114). There was no significant difference (P = 0.23) in the prevalence of postoperative ovarian adhesions between the suspended (20/52) and unsuspended (27/52) side (38.5 versus 51.9%) [odds ratio 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.22-1.35)]. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Ovaries were suspended postoperatively for 36-48 h. Longer suspension could result in lower prevalence of postoperative adhesions. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The value of temporary ovarian suspension in women having surgery for mild-to-moderate endometriosis should be investigated further. The potential benefits of other adhesion prevention strategies, such as surgical barrier agents, in women undergoing surgical treatment for severe pelvic endometriosis should also be explored.

There is limited data available on pregnancy sequelae of maternal infection in the first or second trimester. STUDY DESIGN We present a patient with monochorionic-diamniotic twins that develops coronavirus disease 2019 infection at 15 weeks of gestation. The pregnancy is further complicated by stage II twin-twin transfusion syndrome. She undergoes laser ablation, which is complicated by development of a subchorionic hematoma. The patient then develops Escherichia coli bacteremia, resulting in septic shock and preterm labor followed by previable delivery at 21 weeks of gestation. Amniotic fluid and placenta were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION This case of SARS-CoV-2 argues against transplacental transmission after a second-trimester infection but brings attention to the possible downstream complications that may arise following early infection. KEY POINTS · Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not evident after a second-trimester infection.. · Antepartum coronavirus disease 2019 may cause vascular placental changes and placental insufficiency.. · SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a maternal hypercoagulable state with adverse perinatal outcomes..","Mok, Thalia; Contreras, Deisy; Chmait, Ramen H; Goldstein, Jeffrey; Pluym, Ilina D; Tabsh, Khalil; Aldrovandi, Grace; Afshar, Yalda",American journal of perinatology,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1726428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853148/,91

Currently, there is no effective way to prevent PRRSV infection. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of dipotassium glycyrrhetate (DG), a derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid, on PRRSV infection ability. METHODS The cytotoxicity of DG was measured by MTT assay, and the effects of DG on PRRSV N gene/protein were investigated using real-time PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence assay. In addition, the effect of DG on cell apoptosis was analysed by fluorescence staining. RESULTS Our results indicated that DG could effectively inhibit virus replication and N gene expression in MARC-145 cells infected with PRRSV. When the infected cells received DG, the numbers of apoptotic cells were decreased, and the cleaved caspase-3 contents were decreased dramatically. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that DG could effectively inhibit the PRRS virus via multiple pathways including inhibition of virus replication and N gene expression and reduction of apoptotic cells. DG can serve as a potential chemical for PRRSV prevention and control.","Wang, Zhi-Wei; Sun, Na; Wu, Cai-Hong; Jiang, Jun-Bing; Bai, Yuan-Sheng; Li, Hong-Quan",Antiviral therapy,https://doi.org/10.3851/imp2662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23872789/,91

This paper introduces a variant of molecular dynamics-based simulated annealing that is useful for optimizing atomistic structures, and makes use of the heat capacity of the system, determined on the fly during optimization, to adaptively control the cooling rate. This adaptive cooling approach is demonstrated to be more computationally efficient than classical simulated annealing when applied to Lennard-Jones clusters. The increase in efficiency is approximately a factor of two for clusters with 25-40 atoms, and improves as the size of the system increases.","Karabin, Mariia; Stuart, Steven J",The Journal of chemical physics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0018725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962382/,91

Following general anesthesia of 4 adult pigs, 6 different trocars were randomly inserted at preselected locations in the porcine abdominal wall. The functional luminal imaging probe was used to profile the trocar holes during bag distension from 8 axial cross-sectional area measurements. The cross-sectional areas and pressure in the bag were recorded and exported to Matlab for analysis and data display. Geometric profiles were generated, and the minimum cross-sectional area and hole length (abdominal wall thickness) were used as endpoints. Successful distensions were made in all cases. The slope of the contours increased away from the narrowest point of the hole. The slope increased more rapidly toward the inner abdominal wall than toward the outer wall. The slope of the linear trend lines for the cross-sectional area-pressure relation represents the compliance at the narrowest point in the wall. The hole length (abdominal wall thickness) could be obtained at different cross-sectional area cutoff points. A cutoff point of 300 mm(2) gave good results when compared to the length of the hole measured after the tissue was excised. This technique represents a new and straightforward way to evaluate the effects of trocars on the abdominal wall. It may also prove useful in comparing techniques and technology from different manufacturers.","McMahon, Barry P; O'Donovan, Deidre; Liao, Donghua; Zhao, Jingbo; Schiretz, Rich; Heninrich, Russell; Gregersen, Hans",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350608321317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18757380/,91
67171,Antibiotic resistance: Time of synthesis in a post-genomic age.,2021,"Objective: To investigate the association between neck muscles pressure pain thresholds (PPT) and forward head posture (FHP) in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Methods: A total of 145 TMD patients, including 23 males and 122 females with a median age of 28 years, were enrolled in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine from December 2019 to April 2020. Informations of FHP and neck muscles PPT were collected for all participants. FHP was characterized by the craniocervical angle (CVA) between C7, the tragus of the ear and the horizontal line. Each of the participants completed a questionaire of the neck disability index (NDI). The patients with CVA≤51 ° were asigned into FHP group, otherwise the patients with CVA>51° were asigned into non-FHP group. PPT were measured at the midpoint of the upper trapezius and 1 cm aside from C5-C6 articular pillars. Nonparametric test and Spearman correlation analysis were conducted for the data analysis. Results: There were 70 patients in the FHP group and 75 patients in the non-FHP group. The trapezius PPT of the FHP group [2.82(0.86) kg] was significantly higher than that of the non-FHP group [2.46(0.80) kg] (P<0.01). No significant differences in PPT and NDI were observed between the two groups (P>0.05). Low correlation was found between trapezius PPT and FHP negatively (r=-0.273, P<0.01) and no correlation was found between C5-C6 PPT and FHP (r=-0.124, P>0.05). PPT in trapezius and C5-C6 was negatively correlated with NDI in moderate (r=-0.301, P<0.01) and low (r=-0.206, P<0.05) levels. Conclusions: The trapezius PPT was correlated with FHP negatively. The more FHP, the more pain tolerant of trapezius muscles. There was no correlation between neck function and FHP directly. The higher threshold was followed by better neck function.","Yao, Y; Cai, B; Xu, L L; Wang, J W",Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112144-20210312-00111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404141/,91

The impact of imaging selection modality on endovascular stroke therapy clinical outcomes in extended time window remains to be defined. We aimed to study this relationship and compare it to that noted in early-treated patients. METHODS Patients from a prospective multicentric registry (n=2008) with occlusions involving the intracranial internal carotid or the M1- or M2-segments of the middle cerebral arteries, premorbid modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2 and time to treatment 0 to 24 hours were categorized according to treatment times within the early (0-6 hour) or extended (6-24 hour) window as well as imaging modality with noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT)±CT angiography (CTA) or NCCT±CTA and CT perfusion (CTP). The association between imaging modality and 90-day modified Rankin Scale, analyzed in ordinal (modified Rankin Scale shift) and dichotomized (functional independence, modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) manner, was evaluated and compared within and across the extended and early windows. RESULTS In the early window, 332 patients were selected with NCCT±CTA alone while 373 also underwent CTP. After adjusting for identifiable confounders, there were no significant differences in terms of 90-day functional disability (ordinal shift: adjusted odd ratio [aOR], 0.936 [95% CI, 0.709-1.238], P=0.644) or independence (aOR, 1.178 [95% CI, 0.833-1.666], P=0.355) across the CTP and NCCT±CTA groups. In the extended window, 67 patients were selected with NCCT±CTA alone while 180 also underwent CTP. No significant differences in 90-day functional disability (aOR, 0.983 [95% CI, 0.81-1.662], P=0.949) or independence (aOR, 0.640 [95% CI, 0.318-1.289], P=0.212) were seen across the CTP and NCCT±CTA groups. There was no interaction between the treatment time window (0-6 versus 6-24 hours) and CT selection modality (CTP versus NCCT±CTA) in terms of functional disability at 90 days (P=0.45). CONCLUSIONS CTP acquisition was not associated with better outcomes in patients treated in the early or extended time windows. While confirmatory data is needed, our data suggests that extended window endovascular stroke therapy may remain beneficial even in the absence of advanced imaging.","Nogueira, Raul G; Haussen, Diogo C; Liebeskind, David; Jovin, Tudor G; Gupta, Rishi; Jadhav, Ashutov; Budzik, Ron F; Baxter, Blaise; Krajina, Antonin; Bonafe, Alain; Malek, Ali; Narata, Ana Paula; Shields, Ryan; Zhang, Yanchang; Morgan, Patricia; Bartolini, Bruno; English, Joey; Frankel, Michael R; Veznedaroglu, Erol",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.031685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33430634/,91

67896,Moments in autophagy and disease: Past and present.,2021-04-27,"BACKGROUND Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the preferred method to provide nutritional support for patients with normal gastrointestinal function but cannot be fed orally for a variety of reasons. Owing to safety concerns, the first feeding after PEG tube placement is generally delayed. Early feeding may be an option; however, childhood studies regarding early feeding after the PEG procedure are highly insufficient. METHODS A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted to compare early (4th hour) and late (12th hour) feeding after the PEG procedure. The PEG process was performed with the standard pull technique. Prophylactic antimicrobial drugs were not used. Complications such as gastric residue after feeding, vomiting, fever, systemic signs of infection, and duration of hospital stay were recorded. Tube feeding training was given to parents during their stay in the hospital in both groups. In the first and third days following PEG, the patients were visited by an experienced nurse in their homes and evaluated in terms of potential complications. RESULTS The study was completed with a total of 69 patients: 35 in the early feeding group and 34 in the late feeding group. The demographic characteristics of the groups were similar. Vomiting was rare and detected as similar in both groups (early feeding group 8.5% [3/35], late feeding group 8.8% [3/34], P = 1.00). Rarely, minor gastric residue was observed in both groups (early feeding group 11.4%, late feeding group 8.8% [P = 1.00]). The amount of gastric residue in the early feeding group was a maximum of 13.2 mL, whereas the late feeding group had a maximum of 14.3 mL. The average duration of stay in the hospital for the early and late feeding groups was calculated as 6.7 ± 0.64 and 28.3 ± 3.74 hours, respectively (P < 0.001). Leakage from gastrostomy fistulas, peritonitis, and aspiration were not observed in any patients. CONCLUSIONS The feeding at the fourth hour after PEG placement was safe and well tolerated by patients and shortened the duration of the hospital stay. The use of prophylactic antibiotics seems to be unnecessary before the procedure.","Islek, Ali; Sayar, Ersin; Yilmaz, Aygen; Artan, Reha",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0b013e3182a0d171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23799454/,91

Some patients with aSAH develop shunt dependency, which is often managed by ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. The objectives of this study were to review published risk factors for shunt dependency in patients with aSAH, determine the level of evidence for each factor, and calculate the magnitude of each risk factor to better guide patient management. METHODS The authors searched PubMed and MEDLINE databases for Level A and Level B articles published through December 31, 2014, that describe factors affecting shunt dependency after aSAH and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, stratifying the existing data according to level of evidence. RESULTS On the basis of the results of the meta-analysis, risk factors for shunt dependency included high Fisher grade (OR 7.74, 95% CI 4.47-13.41), acute hydrocephalus (OR 5.67, 95% CI 3.96-8.12), in-hospital complications (OR 4.91, 95% CI 2.79-8.64), presence of intraventricular blood (OR 3.93, 95% CI 2.80-5.52), high Hunt and Hess Scale score (OR 3.25, 95% CI 2.51-4.21), rehemorrhage (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.24-3.95), posterior circulation location of the aneurysm (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.35-2.53), and age ≥ 60 years (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.50-2.19). The only risk factor included in the meta-analysis that did not reach statistical significance was female sex (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.77-1.65). CONCLUSIONS The authors identified several risk factors for shunt dependency in aSAH patients that help predict which patients are likely to require a permanent shunt. Although some of these risk factors are not independent of each other, this information assists clinicians in identifying at-risk patients and managing their treatment.","Wilson, Christopher D; Safavi-Abbasi, Sam; Sun, Hai; Kalani, M Yashar S; Zhao, Yan D; Levitt, Michael R; Hanel, Ricardo A; Sauvageau, Eric; Mapstone, Timothy B; Albuquerque, Felipe C; McDougall, Cameron G; Nakaji, Peter; Spetzler, Robert F",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2015.11.jns152094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27035169/,91

68957,Evaluating the thermal performance of a balloon-based renal sympathetic denervation system with array electrodes: a finite element study.,2021-08-05,"BACKGROUND Bone wax is traditionally used as part of surgical procedures to prevent bleeding from exposed spongy bone. It is an effective hemostatic device which creates a physical barrier. Unfortunately it interferes with subsequent bone healing and increases the risk of infection in experimental studies. Recently, a water-soluble, synthetic, hemostatic compound (Ostene®) was introduced to serve the same purpose as bone wax without hampering bone healing. This study aims to compare sternal healing after application of either bone wax or Ostene®. METHODS Twenty-four pigs were randomized into one of three treatment groups: Ostene®, bone wax or no hemostatic treatment (control). Each animal was subjected to midline sternotomy. Either Ostene® or bone wax was applied to the spongy bone surfaces until local hemostasis was ensured. The control group received no hemostatic treatment. The wound was left open for 60 min before closing to simulate conditions alike those of cardiac surgery. All sterni were harvested 6 weeks after intervention.Bone density and the area of the bone defect were determined with peripheral quantitative CT-scanning; bone healing was displayed with plain X-ray and chronic inflammation was histologically assessed. RESULTS Both CT-scanning and plain X-ray disclosed that bone healing was significantly impaired in the bone wax group (p < 0.01) compared with the other two groups, and the former group had significantly more chronic inflammation (p < 0.01) than the two latter. CONCLUSION Bone wax inhibits bone healing and induces chronic inflammation in a porcine model. Ostene® treated animals displayed bone healing characteristics and inflammatory reactions similar to those of the control group without application of a hemostatic agent.","Vestergaard, Rikke F; Jensen, Henrik; Vind-Kezunovic, Stefan; Jakobsen, Thomas; Søballe, Kjeld; Hasenkam, John M",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1749-8090-5-117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106051/,91
68967,Metabolic response of the Siberian wood frog Rana amurensis to extreme hypoxia.,2020-09-03,"Cellular binding and entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are mediated by its spike glycoprotein (S protein), which binds with not only the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor but also glycosaminoglycans such as heparin. Cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (""cellular nanosponges"") mimic the host cells to attract and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 through natural cellular receptors, leading to a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy. Herein, we show that increasing surface heparin density on the cellular nanosponges can promote their inhibition against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, cellular nanosponges are made with azido-expressing host cell membranes followed by conjugating heparin to the nanosponge surfaces. Cellular nanosponges with a higher heparin density have a larger binding capacity with viral S proteins and a significantly higher inhibition efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Overall, surface glycan engineering of host-mimicking cellular nanosponges is a facile method to enhance SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. This approach can be readily generalized to promote the inhibition of other glycan-dependent viruses.","Ai, Xiangzhao; Wang, Dan; Honko, Anna; Duan, Yaou; Gavrish, Igor; Fang, Ronnie H; Griffiths, Anthony; Gao, Weiwei; Zhang, Liangfang",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c07798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647745/,91

However, there is a paradigm shift in this conception and oral health is now considered as a fundamental part of overall well-being. In recent years, the subject of oral-foci of infection has attained a resurgence in terms of systemic morbidities while limited observations denote the implication of chronic oral inflammation in the pathogenesis of eye diseases. Hitherto, there is a paucity for mechanistic insights underlying the reported link between periodontal disease (PD) and ocular comorbidities. In light of prevailing scientific evidence, this review article will focus on the understudied theme, that is, the impact of oral dysbiosis in the induction and/or progression of inflammatory eye diseases like diabetic retinopathy, scleritis, uveitis, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Furthermore, the plausible mechanisms by which periodontal microbiota may trigger immune dysfunction in the Oro-optic-network and promote the development of PD-associated AMD have been discussed.","Arjunan, Pachiappan",International reviews of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/08830185.2020.1845330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33179994/,91

70027,Risk of disease transmission with bone allograft.,2012,"Several early childhood obesity prediction models have been developed, but none for New Zealand's diverse population. We aimed to develop and validate a model for predicting obesity in 4-5-year-old New Zealand children, using parental and infant data from the Growing Up in New Zealand (GUiNZ) cohort. Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) for age and sex ≥ 95th percentile. Data on GUiNZ children were used for derivation (n = 1731) and internal validation (n = 713). External validation was performed using data from the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy Study (POI, n = 383) and Pacific Islands Families Study (PIF, n = 135) cohorts. The final model included: birth weight, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, paternal BMI, and infant weight gain. Discrimination accuracy was adequate [AUROC = 0.74 (0.71-0.77)], remained so when validated internally [AUROC = 0.73 (0.68-0.78)] and externally on PIF [AUROC = 0.74 [0.66-0.82)] and POI [AUROC = 0.80 (0.71-0.90)]. Positive predictive values were variable but low across the risk threshold range (GUiNZ derivation 19-54%; GUiNZ validation 19-48%; and POI 8-24%), although more consistent in the PIF cohort (52-61%), all indicating high rates of false positives. Although this early childhood obesity prediction model could inform early obesity prevention, high rates of false positives might create unwarranted anxiety for families.","Butler, Éadaoin M; Pillai, Avinesh; Morton, Susan M B; Seers, Blake M; Walker, Caroline G; Ly, Kien; Tautolo, El-Shadan; Glover, Marewa; Taylor, Rachael W; Cutfield, Wayne S; Derraik, José G B",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85557-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737627/,91
70056,The Use and Underuse of Model Systems in Infectious Disease Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.,2021-07-01,"Background During humanitarian crises, women and children are particularly vulnerable to morbidity and mortality. To address this problem, integrated child health interventions that include support for the well-being of mothers must be adapted and assessed in humanitarian settings. Baby Friendly Spaces (BFS) is a holistic program that aims to improve the health and wellbeing of pregnant and lactating women and their children under two years of age by providing psychosocial support and enhancing positive infant and young child-care practices. Using a mixed-methods, pre-post design, this study explored ways to strengthen the implementation and acceptability of the BFS program, and assess outcomes associated with participation among South Sudanese mothers and their children living in the Nguenyyiel refugee camp in Gambella, Ethiopia. Discussion A stronger evidence-base for integrated maternal and child health interventions, like BFS, in humanitarian emergencies is needed, but effectively conducting this type of research in unstable settings means encountering and working through myriad challenges. In this paper we discuss lessons learned while implementing this study, including, challenges related to ongoing local political and tribal conflicts and extreme conditions; implementation of a new digital data monitoring system; staff capacity building and turnover; and measurement were encountered. Strategies to mitigate such challenges included hiring and training new staff members. Regular weekly skype calls were held between Action Against Hunger Paris headquarters, the Action Against Hunger team in Gambella and Johns Hopkins' academic partners to follow study implementation progress and troubleshoot any emerging issues. Staff capacity building strategies included holding brief and focused trainings continuously throughout the study for both new and current staff members. Lastly, we engaged local Nuer staff members to help ensure study measures and interview questions were understandable among study participants. Conclusions Research focused on strengthening program implementation is critically important for improving maternal and child health in humanitarian emergencies. Research in such settings demands critical problem-solving skills, strong supervision systems, flexibility in timeline and logistics, and tailor-made training for program and research staff members and context- adapted strategies for retaining existing staff.","Lasater, M E; Woldeyes, G M; Le Roch, K; Phan, X; Solomon-Osborne, A; Murray, S M",Conflict and health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13031-020-00299-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724334/,91

This validation methodology evolved from a history of NIRS validations in the literature and FDA recommended use of Deming regression and bootstrapping statistical validation methods. For cerebral validation, forehead cerebral StO2 measurements were compared to a weighted 70:30 reference (REF CXB) of co-oximeter internal jugular venous and arterial blood saturation of healthy adult subjects during a controlled hypoxia sequence, with a sensor placed on the forehead. For somatic validation, somatic StO2 measurements were compared to a weighted 70:30 reference (REF CXS) of co-oximetry central venous and arterial saturation values following a similar protocol, with sensors place on the flank, quadriceps muscle, and calf muscle. With informed consent, 25 subjects successfully completed the cerebral validation study. The bias and precision (1 SD) of cerebral StO2 compared to REF CXB was -0.14 ± 3.07%. With informed consent, 24 subjects successfully completed the somatic validation study. The bias and precision of somatic StO2 compared to REF CXS was 0.04 ± 4.22% from the average of flank, quadriceps, and calf StO2 measurements to best represent the global whole body REF CXS.

Improvement of team communication and behavior is a popular target for safety programming at the institutional level. Despite these efforts, essential safety gaps remain in the OR and procedure rooms. A prime example is the use of energy-based devices in ORs and procedural areas. The lack of fundamental understanding of energy device function, design, and application contributes to avoidable injury and harm at a rate of approximately 1 to 2 per 1000 patients in the US. Hundreds of OR fires occur each year in the US, some causing severe injury and even death. Most of these fires are associated with the use of energy-based surgical devices.In response to this safety issue, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) developed the Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy (FUSE) program. This program includes a standardized curriculum targeted to surgeons, other physicians, and allied health care professionals and a psychometrically designed and validated certification test. A successful FUSE certification documents acquisition of the basic knowledge needed to safely use energy-based devices in the OR. By design FUSE fills a void in the curriculum and competency assessment for surgeons and other procedural specialists in the use of energy-based devices in patients.","Jones, Stephanie B; Munro, Malcolm G; Feldman, Liane S; Robinson, Thomas N; Brunt, L Michael; Schwaitzberg, Steven D; Jones, Daniel B; Fuchshuber, Pascal R",The Permanente journal,https://doi.org/10.7812/tpp/16-050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28333609/,91

In 2014, a coronavirus was identified and appeared as a possible viral pathogen involved in the disease. In the present study, intestinal content from a guinea fowl involved in a new case of the disease in 2017 was analyzed by deep sequencing, revealing the presence of a guinea fowl coronavirus (GfCoV) and a picornavirus (GfPic). Serial passage assays into the intra-amniotic cavity of 13-day-old specific pathogen free chicken eggs and 20-day-old conventional guinea fowl eggs were attempted. On chicken eggs, isolation assays failed, but on guinea fowl eggs, both viruses were successfully obtained. Furthermore, two GfCoV and two GfPic isolates were obtained from the same bird but from different sections of its intestines. This shows that using eggs of the same species in which the virus has been detected can be key for successful isolation.The consensus sequence of the full-length genomes of both GfCoV isolates were highly similar, and correlated to those previously described in terms of genome organization, ORF length and phylogenetic clustering. According to full-length genome analysis and the structure of the Internal Ribosome Entry Site, both GfPic isolates belong to the Anativirus genus and specifically the species Anativirus B. The availability of the first isolates of GfCoV and GfPic will now provide a means of assessing their pathogenicity in guinea fowls in controlled experimental conditions and to assess whether they are primary viral pathogens of the disease 'guinea fowl fulminating enteritis'.RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTSFirst isolation of guinea fowl coronaviruses and picornavirusesEggs homologous to the infected species are key for isolationIsolates available to precisely evaluate the virus roles in fulminating enteritisFirst full-length genome sequences of guinea fowl picornaviruses.","Courtillon, Céline; Briand, François-Xavier; Allée, Chantal; Contrant, Maud; Beven, Véronique; Lucas, Pierrick; Blanchard, Yannick; Mouchel, Simon; Eterradossi, Nicolas; Delforterie, Yves; Grasland, Béatrice; Brown, Paul",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2021.1976725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545751/,91

71454,Corrigendum.,2017,"The Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri (Insecta: Hemiptera: Psylloidea), a serious pest of citrus species worldwide, harbors vertically transmitted intracellular mutualists, Candidatus Profftella armatura (Profftella_DC, Gammaproteobacteria: Burkholderiales) and Candidatus Carsonella ruddii (Carsonella_DC, Gammaproteobacteria: Oceanospirillales). Whereas Carsonella_DC is a typical nutritional symbiont, Profftella_DC is a unique defensive symbiont with organelle-like features including intracellular localization within the host, perfect infection in host populations, vertical transmission over evolutionary time, and drastic genome reduction down to much less than 1 Mb. Large parts of the 460 kb genome of Profftella_DC are devoted to genes for synthesizing a polyketide toxin; diaphorin. To better understand the evolution of this unusual symbiont, the present study analyzed the genome of Profftella_Dco, a sister lineage to Profftella_DC, using Diaphorina cf. continua, a host psyllid congeneric with D. citri. The genome of co-residing Carsonella (Carsonella_Dco) was also analyzed. The analysis revealed nearly perfect synteny conservation in these genomes with their counterparts from D. citri. The substitution rate analysis further demonstrated genomic stability of Profftella which is comparable to that of Carsonella. Profftella_Dco and Profftella_DC shared all genes for the biosynthesis of diaphorin, hemolysin, riboflavin, biotin, and carotenoids, underlining multiple roles of Profftella, which may contribute to stabilizing symbiotic relationships with the host. However, acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) were extensively amplified in polyketide synthases DipP and DipT for diaphorin synthesis in Profftella_Dco. This level of ACP augmentation, unprecedented in modular polyketide synthases of any known organism, is not thought to influence the polyketide structure but may improve the synthesis efficiency.","Nakabachi, Atsushi; Piel, Jörn; Malenovský, Igor; Hirose, Yuu",Genome biology and evolution,https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evaa175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797185/,91

The study reacted rapidly to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, deploying an online questionnaire early on during lockdown (from 9 th April to 15 th May). In late May 2020, a second questionnaire was developed asking about physical and mental health, lifestyle and behaviours, employment and finances. The online questionnaire was deployed across the parent and offspring generations between the 26th May and 5 th July 2020. 6482 participants completed the questionnaire (2639 original mothers, 1039 original fathers/partners, 2711 offspring (mean age ~28 years) and 93 partners of offspring). 1039 new participants who did not respond to the first questionnaire deployed in April completed the second questionnaire. A positive COVID-19 was reported by 36 (0.6%) participants (12 G0 and 24 G1), 91 (1.4%; 35 G0 and 56 G1) reported that they had been told by a doctor they likely had COVID-19 and 838 (13%; 422 G0 and 416 G1) suspected that they have had COVID-19. Using algorithmically estimated cases based on symptoms, we estimate that the predicted prevalence of COVID-19 from mid-April to time of questionnaire completion was 3.1%. Data from both COVID questionnaires will be complemented with linkage to health records and results of biological testing as they become available. Data has been released as an update to the original dataset released in May 2020. It comprises: 1) a standard dataset containing all participant responses to both questionnaires with key sociodemographic factors and 2) as a composite release coordinating data from the existing resource, thus enabling bespoke research across all areas supported by the study.

However, some classes of stimuli may be able to override our efforts to ignore them. Here we assessed the relationship between involuntary attentional capture with emotional images and spatial attention at early stages of perceptual processing. Multiple scenes of unpleasant and neutral content were displayed in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) streams that elicited the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), a neural marker of selective attention at early visual areas. In a spatial cueing task, participants were cued to covertly attend to RSVP streams presented at 4 and 6 Hz presentation rates in the left and right visual hemifields. The task was to detect square targets occasionally displayed within the image streams, responding only to those appearing on the cued side. The RSVP streams were always neutral pictures in one visual hemifield but would unpredictably switch from neutral to aversive content in the other visual hemifield. We found that SSVEP amplitude was consistently modulated by a change in emotional valence of image streams, regardless of whether the change in content occurred in the attended or unattended spatial location, reflecting an automatic sensory amplification for affective stimuli. The present data provide further evidence in support that emotional images can attract visual processing resources independently of spatial attention allocation, and are consistent with sustained sensory facilitation of early visual areas through re-entrant feedback projections from higher-order cortical areas involved in the extraction of affective information.","Bekhtereva, Valeria; Craddock, Matt; Müller, Matthias M",Psychophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046905/,91

Objective To evaluate the immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) in humans, including the kinetics, magnitude, and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Design, Setting, and Participants Twenty-five participants were enrolled from July 29, 2020, to August 7, 2020, and the follow-up for this day 71 interim analysis was completed on October 3, 2020; follow-up to assess durability will continue for 2 years. This study was conducted at a single clinical site in Boston, Massachusetts, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial of Ad26.COV2.S. Interventions Participants were randomized to receive 1 or 2 intramuscular injections with 5 × 1010 viral particles or 1 × 1011 viral particles of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine or placebo administered on day 1 and day 57 (5 participants in each group). Main Outcomes and Measures Humoral immune responses included binding and neutralizing antibody responses at multiple time points following immunization. Cellular immune responses included immunospot-based and intracellular cytokine staining assays to measure T-cell responses. Results Twenty-five participants were randomized (median age, 42; age range, 22-52; 52% women, 44% male, 4% undifferentiated), and all completed the trial through the day 71 interim end point. Binding and neutralizing antibodies emerged rapidly by day 8 after initial immunization in 90% and 25% of vaccine recipients, respectively. By day 57, binding and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 100% of vaccine recipients after a single immunization. On day 71, the geometric mean titers of spike-specific binding antibodies were 2432 to 5729 and the geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies were 242 to 449 in the vaccinated groups. A variety of antibody subclasses, Fc receptor binding properties, and antiviral functions were induced. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were induced.

This study aimed to explore the dynamic topological properties (DTP) of dynamic brain functional network in women with PDM in the pain-free phase and their performance in distinguishing PDM in the pain-free phase from healthy controls. METHODS Thirty-five women with PDM and 38 healthy women without PDM were included. A dynamic brain functional network was constructed using the slide-window approach. The stability (TP-Stab) and variability (TP-Var) of the DTP of the dynamic functional network were computed using the graph-theory method. A support vector machine (SVM) was used to evaluate the performance of DTP in identifying PDM in the pain-free phase. RESULTS Compared with healthy controls, women with PDM had not only lower TP-Stab in global DTP, which included cluster clustering coefficient (Cp ), characteristic path length (Lp ), global efficiency (Eg ), and local efficiency (Eloc ), but also lower TP-Stab and higher TP-Var in nodal DTP (nodal efficiency, Enod ), mainly in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal regions, and insula. The TP-Stab and TP-Var were significantly correlated with psychological variables, i.e. positive emotions, sense of control, and meaningful existence. SVM analysis showed that the DTP could identify PDM in the pain-free phase from healthy controls with an accuracy of 79.31%, sensitivity of 82.61%, and specificity of 76%. CONCLUSIONS Women with PDM in the pain-free phase have altered global DTP and nodal DTP, mainly involving pain-related neurocircuits. The highly variable brain network is helpful for identifying PDM in the pain-free phase.","Wu, Xiaoyan; Yu, Wenjun; Hu, Huijun; Su, Yun; Liang, Zhiying; Bai, Zhiqiang; Tian, Xuwei; Yang, Li; Shen, Jun",European journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejp.1808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34008281/,91

74013,Issue Highlights.,2021-01-01,"INTRODUCTION Participatory research involving community engagement is considered the gold standard in Indigenous health research. However, it is sometimes unclear whether and how Indigenous communities are engaged in research that impacts them, and whether and how engagement is reported. Indigenous health research varies in its degree of community engagement from minimal involvement to being community-directed and led. Research led and directed by Indigenous communities can support reconciliation and reclamation in Canada and globally, however clearer reporting and understandings of community-led research is needed. This scoping review assesses (a) how and to what extent researchers are reporting community engagement in Indigenous health research in Atlantic Canada, and (b) what recommendations exist in the literature regarding participatory and community-led research. METHODS Eleven databases were searched using keywords for Indigeneity, geographic regions, health, and Indigenous communities in Atlantic Canada between 2001-June 2020. Records were independently screened by two reviewers and were included if they were: peer-reviewed; written in English; health-related; and focused on Atlantic Canada. Data were extracted using a piloted data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was performed. 211 articles were retained for inclusion. RESULTS Few empirical articles reported community engagement in all aspects of the research process. Most described incorporating community engagement at the project's onset and/or during data collection; only a few articles explicitly identified as entirely community-directed or led. Results revealed a gap in reported capacity-building for both Indigenous communities and researchers, necessary for holistic community engagement. Also revealed was the need for funding bodies, ethics boards, and peer review processes to better facilitate participatory and community-led Indigenous health research.

We applied the omental roll-up technique around pancreaticojejunostomy and investigated the effectiveness of this technique to prevent a pancreatic fistula. DESIGN Retrospective study. SETTING Tertiary hepatobiliary and pancreas surgery clinic, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul. PATIENTS Between March 1, 2009, and March 31, 2011, 68 patients underwent PD. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the surgical application of the omental roll-up technique around the PJ site: group 1 (those who did not undergo the omental roll-up technique) compared with group 2 (those who did undergo the omental roll-up technique). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The occurrence of a pancreatic fistula. RESULTS No differences were noted in the clinical characteristics, including patients' demographics and operation-related factors, between the 2 groups. A pancreatic fistula occurred in 23 of 39 patients in group 1 (59%) and in 6 of 29 patients in group 2 (20.7%). Group 2 had a significantly lower incidence of pancreatic fistula (P = .002), and these fistulas were classified as being grade A using the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula Definition showing a transient high amylase level in the drainage fluid without significantly affecting the patient's recovery. Drain removal was performed earlier in group 2 (P < .001). Mean postoperative hospital stay was 23.4 days in group 1 compared with 15.9 days in group 2 (P = .009). Overall mortality was 1.5%; however, no deaths were related to a pancreatic fistula. CONCLUSIONS The omental roll-up technique for the PJ site definitely reduced the occurrence of a pancreatic fistula. Therefore, the omental roll-up technique is a simple and effective strategy to prevent a pancreatic fistula.","Choi, Sae Byeol; Lee, Jin Suk; Kim, Wan Bae; Song, Tae Jin; Suh, Sung Ock; Choi, Sang Yong",Archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/archsurg.2011.865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22351908/,91

In addition to a higher risk for serious illness and death, the societal value of senescent adults was challenged. There have been conflicting results reported in the research literature regarding positive and negative stereotypes of older adults, and areliable and valid assessment tool to measure content (existence of astereotype) and strength (intensity of astereotype) is unavailable. To address issues with instruments employed to measure ageist stereotypes, researchers developed the Stereotypes Content and Strength Survey. University students (n=483) were directed to ""think about their perceptions of older adults"" and indicate how many they believed could be described using the terms listed on a5-point Likert-type scale from none-all. Response categories for each descriptive item were dichotomized into 1 = ""some, most or all"" and 0 = ""none or few."" Based on an odds analyses of 117 items, 84 met the content criteria to be considered astereotype regarding older adults. Using the criteria for strength, items were categorized into 36 ""strong,"" 25 ""moderate,"" and 23 ""weak"" stereotypes. Assessing the content and strength of stereotypic beliefs using this procedure may contribute to major bias influencing ageist perceptions.","Carlson, Kristy J; Black, David R; Coster, Daniel C",Journal of gerontological social work,https://doi.org/10.1080/01634372.2021.1978026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34533421/,91
74309,Microarray detection of gene overexpression in primary spontaneous pneumothorax.,2010,"Emerging data indicate that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells targeting different viral proteins are detectable in up to 70% of convalescent individuals1-5. However, very little information is currently available about the abundance, phenotype, functional capacity and fate of pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses during the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we define a set of optimal and dominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes. We also perform a high-resolution ex vivo analysis of pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, applying peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHCI) tetramer technology. We observe rapid induction, prolonged contraction and emergence of heterogeneous and functionally competent cross-reactive and induced memory CD8+ T cell responses in cross-sectionally analyzed individuals with mild disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection and three individuals longitudinally assessed for their T cells pre- and post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells exhibited functional characteristics comparable to influenza-specific CD8+ T cells and were detectable in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals who were seronegative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting spike (S) and nucleoprotein (N). These results define cross-reactive and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses as potentially important determinants of immune protection in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Schulien, Isabel; Kemming, Janine; Oberhardt, Valerie; Wild, Katharina; Seidel, Lea M; Killmer, Saskia; Sagar,; Daul, Franziska; Salvat Lago, Marilyn; Decker, Annegrit; Luxenburger, Hendrik; Binder, Benedikt; Bettinger, Dominik; Sogukpinar, Oezlem; Rieg, Siegbert; Panning, Marcus; Huzly, Daniela; Schwemmle, Martin; Kochs, Georg; Waller, Cornelius F; Nieters, Alexandra; Duerschmied, Daniel; Emmerich, Florian; Mei, Henrik E; Schulz, Axel Ronald; Llewellyn-Lacey, Sian; Price, David A; Boettler, Tobias; Bengsch, Bertram; Thimme, Robert; Hofmann, Maike; Neumann-Haefelin, Christoph",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-01143-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33184509/,91

This study compares the diagnostic accuracy and safety of FNB using a novel core needle to FNA in solid pancreatic lesions. Methods A retrospective review of patients in whom EUS FNA or FNB was performed for solid pancreatic lesions was conducted. Diagnostic performance was calculated based upon a dual classification system: classification 1, only malignant pathology considered a true positive, versus classification 2, atypical, suspicious, and malignant pathology considered a true positive. Results 43 patients underwent FNB compared with 51 FNA. Using classification 1, sensitivity was 74.0% versus 80.0%, specificity 100% versus 100%, and diagnostic accuracy 77.0% versus 80.0% for FNB versus FNA, respectively (all p > 0.05). Using classification 2, sensitivity was 97% versus 94.0%, specificity 100% versus 100%, and diagnostic accuracy 98.0% versus 94.0% for FNB versus FNA, respectively (all p > 0.05). FNB required significantly fewer needle passes (median = 2) compared to FNA (median = 3; p < 0.001). Adverse events occurred in two (4.5%) FNB patients compared with none in the FNA group (p > 0.05).

An effective treatment against this disease has not yet been developed; as such, several drugs are used without evidence of efficacy, which in some cases may lead to unwanted events. This is a cross-sectional study with the objective of evaluating adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients with COVID-19, identified between March 1 and August 15, 2020, in Brazil, as well as assessing the factors associated with the emergence of severe reactions. To compare the proportions of samples related to the notifier, patient, drugs and adverse events, we used Fisher's chi-square and exact nonparametric tests; and to compare the means of the data with normal distribution, we used the Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney's test. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed, estimating the crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) by the Stata software, version 10.0. A total of 631 ADRs were identified in 402 patients. The main drugs were hydroxychloroquine (59.5%), azithromycin (9.8%) and chloroquine (5.2%). The reactions manifested primarily in the cardiac system (38.8%), gastrointestinal system (14.4%), skin tissue (12.2%) and hepatic system (8.9%). Chloroquine (OR = 5.4; 95%CI: 1.9-15.6) and hydroxychloroquine (OR = 2.1; 95CI%: 1.2-3.6) were the only drugs associated with severe ADR.

However, due to the different HI correction methods, multiple NGD methods based on the fast neutron, thermal neutron, and capture gamma detection coexist in the well-logging field, and show considerable differences in the tool specifications. To clarify these differences and guide the NGD development, three typical NGD methods using the fast neutron count ratio, thermal neutron count ratio, and capture gamma count ratio (abbreviated as NGD-FC, NGD-TC, and NGD-CC methods) are selected as representatives for comparative study. Using the Monte Carlo simulation, an integrated NGD tool model was established for studying the differences of three NGD methods in the logging responses, data processing methods, and environmental applications. Research shows that, although the three NGD methods have different measurement systems and data processing methods, the three methods can get rid of the HI effect and obtain accurate formation density. The changes of wellbore size and wellbore fluid have similar and significant impact on the three NGD methods and lead to large density errors, especially for the large-size wellbore or wellbore gas conditions. In the different lithology conditions, three methods have good performances, but the NGD-FC and NGD-CC methods have smaller density errors than NGD-TC method. Compared to the other two NGD methods, the NGD-FC method also has a perfect performance in the oil or gas-saturated formation, while NGD-TC and NGD-CC methods have extremely large errors in the gas-saturated formation. Besides, the NGD-FC method are hardly affected by the formation water salinity, the NGD-TC method is slightly affected, while the NGD-CC method is greatly affected. This study can provide a guidance for the tool design, data processing and environment correction of the NGD technology.","Zhang, Quanying; Zhang, Feng; Yuan, Chao; Deng, Rui; Liu, Guobin","Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apradiso.2021.109672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740667/,91

However, evolutionary processes promoting cross-species transfers are poorly defined, especially for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). In theory, cross species transfers by arboviruses may be constrained by their alternating infection of disparate hosts, where optimal replication in one host involves a fitness tradeoff for the other. Accordingly, freeing arboviruses from alternate replication via specialization in a single host should accelerate adaptation. This hypothesis has been tested by using cell culture model systems with inconclusive results. Therefore, we tested it using an in vivo system with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an emerging alphavirus of the Americas. VEEV serially passaged in mosquitoes exhibited increased mosquito infectivity and vertebrate-specialized strains produced higher viremias. Conversely, alternately passaged VEEV experienced no detectable fitness gains in either host. These results suggest that arbovirus adaptation and evolution is limited by obligate host alternation and predict that arboviral emergence via host range changes may be less frequent than that of single host animal RNA viruses.","Coffey, Lark L; Vasilakis, Nikos; Brault, Aaron C; Powers, Ann M; Tripet, Frédéric; Weaver, Scott C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0712130105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18458341/,91

METHODS According to the PRISMA statements checklist, this systematic review and meta-analysis were designed. Data were extracted from public databases, such as PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and more. The quality of studies was evaluated using the MINORS scale. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated for binary outcome data, while the mean differences and 95% CIs were estimated for continuous data. I2 and χ2 tests were used to quantify statistical heterogeneity. If more than ten studies were included in each analysis, funnel plot would be performed to analysis publication bias. RESULTS Twelve studies with 620 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Primary outcomes collected in this meta-analysis included average postoperative auditory gain (APAG), postoperative air-bone gap (ABG), the rate of chorda tympani handling and bone curettage, which all showed a statistically significant difference in favor of endoscopy. While only secondary outcomes about postoperative pain and dysgeusia demonstrated a significantly reduced incidence. Furthermore, there was not any statistically significant difference on postoperative dizziness and average operative time between endoscopy and microscopy. CONCLUSION Although there is a need for high-quality pooled data in the future, a consistently superior effect of the endoscopic group was still shown in terms of total effectiveness, when compared to the microscopic group. We have reasons to support the application of endoscopy in stapes surgery.

The biggest challenge of achieving good infant pain control is obtaining objective pain assessment when direct communication is lacking. For years, computer scientists have developed many different facial expression-centred machine learning (ML) methods for automatic infant pain assessment. Many of these ML algorithms showed rather satisfactory performance and have demonstrated good potential to be further enhanced for implementation in real-world clinical settings. To date, there is no prior research that has systematically summarised and compared the performance of these ML algorithms. Our proposed meta-analysis will provide the first comprehensive evidence on this topic to guide further ML algorithm development and clinical implementation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search four major public electronic medical and computer science databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Embase and IEEE Xplore Digital Library from January 2008 to present. All the articles will be imported into the Covidence platform for study eligibility screening and inclusion. Study-level extracted data will be stored in the Systematic Review Data Repository online platform. The primary outcome will be the prediction accuracy of the ML model. The secondary outcomes will be model utility measures including generalisability, interpretability and computational efficiency. All extracted outcome data will be imported into RevMan V.5.2.1 software and R V3.3.2 for analysis. Risk of bias will be summarised using the latest Prediction Model Study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool.

Research into this cohort faces many uniqu1e challenges, such as inconsistent definitions, variable physiology, non-linear presentation and multi-morbidity. This scoping review sought to summarise the main challenges in providing prehospital care to older trauma patients to improve the care for this vulnerable group. METHODS AND FINDINGS A scoping review was performed searching Google Scholar, PubMed and Medline from 2000 until 2020 for literature in English addressing the management of older trauma patients in both the prehospital arena and Emergency Department. A thematic analysis and narrative synthesis was conducted on the included 131 studies. Age-threshold was confirmed by a descriptive analysis from all included studies. The majority of the studies assessed triage and found that recognition and undertriage presented a significant challenge, with adverse effects on mortality. We identified six key challenges in the prehospital field that were summarised in this review. CONCLUSIONS Trauma in older people is common and challenges prehospital care providers in numerous ways that are difficult to address. Undertriage and the potential for age bias remain prevalent. In this Scoping Review, we identified and discussed six major challenges that are unique to the prehospital environment.

Disturbance of cerebral perfusion might be an underlying factor. This study investigates the feasibility of serial transfontanellar ultrasound measurements of the pial arteries during neonatal surgery, and whether perioperative changes in cerebral perfusion can be observed and related to changes in the perioperative management. Methods: In this prospective, observational feasibility study, neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and esophageal atresia scheduled for surgical treatment within the first 28 days of life were eligible for inclusion. We performed transfontanellar directional power Doppler and pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound during major high-risk non-cardiac neonatal surgery. Pial arteries were of interest for the measurements. Extracted Doppler ultrasound parameters were: peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, the resistivity index and pulsatility index. Results: In 10 out of 14 patients it was possible to perform perioperative measurements; the others failed for logistic and technical reasons. In 6 out of 10 patients, it was feasible to perform serial intraoperative transfontanellar ultrasound measurements with directional power Doppler and pulsed wave Doppler of the same pial artery during neonatal surgery. Median peak systolic velocity was ranging between 5.7 and 7.0 cm s-1 and end diastolic velocity between 1.9 and 3.2 cm s-1. In patients with a vasoactive-inotropic score below 12 the trend of peak systolic velocity and end diastolic velocity corresponded with the mean arterial blood pressure trend. Conclusion: Perioperative transfontanellar ultrasound Doppler measurements of the pial arteries are feasible and provide new longitudinal data about perioperative cortical cerebral blood flow velocity.

Consequences of policy decisions to respond using nonpharmaceutical interventions.,2021-02-24,"PURPOSE C1q/TNF-related protein-3 (CTRP3) is a novel adipokine that lowers blood glucose levels, reduces liver triglyceride synthesis, and is protective against hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese mouse models. We hypothesized that higher circulating serum levels of CTRP3 would be associated with a lean body mass index (BMI) and a more favorable metabolic profile in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate CTRP3 levels in lean individuals compared to obese individuals. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study of obese (n=44) and lean control patients (n=60). Fasting metabolic parameters were measured in all patients and serum CTRP3 levels were measured by ELISA. RESULTS BMI of the lean group was 21.9 ± 0.2 kg/m2 and obese group was 45.2 ± 1.1 kg/m2. We found significantly lower circulating levels of CTRP3 in obese individuals (405 ± 8.3 vs. 436 ± 6.7 ng/mL, p=0.004) compared to the lean group. Serum CTRP3 levels were inversely correlated with BMI (p=0.001), and triglycerides (p<0.001), and significantly associated with gender (p<0.01), ethnicity (p=0.05), HDL-cholesterol (p<0.01), and adiponectin (p<0.01). We found BMI (p<0.01), gender (p<0.01), and ethnicity (p<0.05) to be significant predictors of CTRP3 levels when controlling for age in multiple regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS CTRP3 is a beneficial adipokine whose circulating levels are significantly lower in obese individuals. Obesity causes dysregulation in adipokine production, including the down-regulation of CTRP3. Lower CTRP3 levels may contribute to the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders associated with obesity. Optimizing CTRP3 levels through novel therapies may improve obesity and its comorbidities.","Wolf, Risa M; Steele, Kimberley E; Peterson, Leigh A; Magnuson, Thomas H; Schweitzer, Michael A; Wong, G William",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0133955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26222183/,91

Kunz.,2021,"Olive pomace, the solid by-product from virgin olive oil extraction, constitutes a remarkable source of functional compounds and has been exploited by several authors to formulate high-added value foods and, consequently, to foster the sustainability of the olive-oil chain. In this framework, the aim of the present review was to summarize the results on the application of functional compounds from olive pomace in food products. Phenolics-rich extracts from olive pomace were added to vegetable oils, fish burgers, fermented milk and in the edible coating of fruit, in order to take advantage of their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, olive pomace was directly used in the formulation of pasta and baked goods, by exploiting polyunsaturated fatty acids, phenolic compounds and dietary fiber to obtain high-value added healthy foods and/or to extend their shelf-life. With the same scope, olive pomace was also added to animal feeds obtaining healthy-improved animal products. Furthermore, different authors used olive pomace to produce biodegradable materials and/or active packaging able to increase the content of bioactive compounds and the oxidative stability of foods. Overall, the results highlighted in most cases the effectiveness of the addition of olive pomace-derived functional compounds in improving the nutritional value, the quality and/or the shelf-life of foods. However, more challenging was found to be the direct addition of olive pomace, especially due to alterations of sensory and textural features of food. This article is protected by copyright.

Yet health and politics are inexorably linked. To better understand this link, this paper adopts a disaster diplomacy perspective for analysing and assessing the impacts of acute public health events on diplomatic outcomes. Two gaps in understanding disaster-health-politics connections are addressed: (i) how health interventions can impact diplomatic endeavours, especially for (ii) acute public health events. Three diverse case studies are interpreted from a disaster diplomacy perspective: Cuba's medical diplomacy, China and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and polio vaccination. Disaster diplomacy permits deeper investigation and analysis of connections amongst health, disaster, and diplomatic activities by viewing efforts on acute public health events as being political through disaster risk reduction (beforehand) and disaster response (during and afterwards). Understanding improves how health interventions affect diplomacy and on disaster diplomacy's limitations.","Whittaker, Charlie; Frühauf, Anna; Burthem, Samuel John; Parry, Rebecca Shoshanah; Kotikalapudi, Meghana; Liang, Yihui; Barker, Mary Moffett; Patel, Parth Rohit; Kelman, Ilan",Disasters,https://doi.org/10.1111/disa.12306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30080259/,91

Results were analyzed, inspired by the Joanna Briggs Institute's method for synthesis of qualitative data. RESULTS A total of 842 studies were identified and screened; 84 were full-text assessed for eligibility and 7 were ultimately included. Two studies investigated the attitudes of older adults with limited life expectancy and their relatives towards deprescribing of statins and donepezil, respectively, while the five remaining studies related to attitudes towards deprescribing in general. Four main themes were identified: (1) the well-being of older adults with limited life expectancy; (2) involvement of older adults and their relatives in deprescribing; (3) the role of health care professionals in deprescribing; and (4) medication-related factors affecting deprescribing. Within each of these themes, several subthemes were identified. CONCLUSIONS Attitudes towards deprescribing among older adults with limited life expectancy and their relatives vary and highlight several barriers and enablers to the deprescribing process. Several of these factors must be addressed to successfully implement deprescribing initiatives in this patient group.","Burghle, Alaa; Lundby, Carina; Ryg, Jesper; Søndergaard, Jens; Pottegård, Anton; Nielsen, Dorthe; Graabæk, Trine",Drugs & aging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40266-020-00774-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32537682/,91
78665,B-1 Cells Carry the Memory of Neonatal Immune Imprinting.,2020-07-14,"BACKGROUND Patient portal use could help improve the care and health outcomes of patients with diabetes owing to functionalities, such as appointment booking, electronic messaging (e-messaging), and repeat prescription ordering, which enable patient-centered care and improve patient self-management of the disease. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to summarize the evidence regarding patient portal use (portals that are connected to electronic health care records) or patient portal functionality use (eg, appointment booking and e-messaging) and their reported associations with health and health care quality outcomes among adult patients with diabetes. METHODS We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases and reported the review methodology using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Three independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, and two reviewers assessed the full texts of relevant studies and performed data extraction and quality assessments of the included studies. We used the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Study Quality Assessment Tool to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. Data were summarized through narrative synthesis. RESULTS Twelve studies were included in this review. Five studies reported overall patient portal use and its association with diabetes health and health care quality outcomes. Six studies reported e-messaging or email use-associated outcomes, and two studies reported prescription refill-associated outcomes. The reported health outcomes included the associations of patient portal use with blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and BMI. Few studies reported health care utilization outcomes such as office visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. A limited number of studies reported overall quality of care for patients with diabetes who used patient portals. CONCLUSIONS The included studies mostly reported improved glycemic control outcomes for patients with diabetes who used patient portals. However, limitations of studying the effects of patient portals exist, which do not guarantee whether the outcomes reported are completely the result of patient portal use or if confounding factors exist. Randomized controlled trials and mixed-methods studies could help understand the mechanisms involved in health outcome improvements and patient portal use among patients with diabetes.

78755,Retrobulbar and peribulbar regional techniques in cats: a preliminary study in cadavers.,2013,"Cell therapy offers significant promise for traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), which despite many medical advances, has limited treatment strategies. Able to address the multi-factorial and dynamic pathophysiology of SCI, cells present various advantages over standard pharmacological approaches. However, the use of live cells is also severely hampered by logistical and practical considerations. These include specialized equipment and expertise, standardisation of cell stocks, sustained cell viability post-thawing and cryopreservation-induced delayed-onset cell death (CIDOCD). For this reason, we suggest a novel and clinically translatable alternative to live cell systemic infusion, which retains the efficacy of the latter whilst overcoming many of its limitations. This strategy involves the administration of concentrated cell secretome and exploits the trophic mechanism by which stromal cells function. Here, we compare the efficacy of intravenously delivered concentrated conditioned media (CM) from human umbilical cord matrix cells (HUCMCs), bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), as well as newborn and adult fibroblasts in a rat model of moderately severe cervical clip compression/contusion injury (C7-T1, 35-gram). This is further paired with a thorough profile of the CM cytokines, chemokines and angiogenic factors. The HUCMC-derived CM was most effective at limiting acute (48 hours post-SCI) vascular pathology, specifically lesion volume and functional vascularity. PCA, hierarchical clustering, and interaction analysis of proteins highly expressed in the HUCMC secretome, suggest involvement of the MAPK/ERK, JAK/STAT, and immune cell migratory pathways. This 'secretotherapeutic' strategy represents a novel and minimally invasive method to target multiple organ systems and several pathologies shortly after traumatic SCI.","Vawda, Reaz; Badner, Anna; Hong, James; Mikhail, Mirriam; Dragas, Rachel; Xhima, Kristiana; Jose, Alejandro; Fehlings, Michael G",Stem cells and development,https://doi.org/10.1089/scd.2020.0079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962528/,91
79024,"[Separase, a key-player of mitosis: A new target for cancer therapy?]",2021,"Background Different proportions of musculoskeletal or autoimmune manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been reported in literature. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with the aim of assessing the prevalence of rheumatic manifestations in patients affected by COVID-19, as initial symptom or during disease course. Methods A database search was run on May 18th, 2020, using two distinct strategies. We were interested in the percentage of symptoms of potential rheumatologic interest observed in large population studies of COVID-19 cases, and in identifying uncommon autoimmune disorders described in patients with COVID-19. For manifestations individually reported, a meta-analysis was performed taking into consideration the proportion of COVID-19 patients presenting the symptom. Results Eighty eight original articles were included in the systematic review and 51 in the meta-analysis. We found pooled estimates of 19% for muscle pain and 32% for fatigue as initial symptom of COVID-19 presentation and, respectively, of 16 and 36% during the disease course. Only one article discussed arthralgia as unique symptom. Additionally, we found that vasculitis, chilblains, presence of autoantibodies commonly found in patients with rheumatic diseases, or autoimmune haematological and neurological disorders have all been reported in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions In conclusion, our review and meta-analysis emphasises that symptoms potentially leading to rheumatologic referral are common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, COVID-19 is a new differential diagnosis to bear in mind when evaluating patients with musculoskeletal symptoms and rheumatologists might play a crucial role in identifying COVID-19 cases in early phases of the illness.","Ciaffi, Jacopo; Meliconi, Riccardo; Ruscitti, Piero; Berardicurti, Onorina; Giacomelli, Roberto; Ursini, Francesco",BMC rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41927-020-00165-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123675/,91

Medication non-adherence is particularly apparent in chronic diseases, where treatment is often preventative and may provide little or no symptomatic relief or feedback for the patient. A lot of research has been undertaken to describe the extent of non-adherence to long-term anticoagulation therapy, particularly with vitamin K antagonists and more recently with direct oral anticoagulants. However, the literature is scarce with respect to describing adherence to anticoagulation in terms of the behavioural aspects that influence medicine use. Utilizing the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation and behaviour) psychological model of non-adherence, we present the available evidence, not only in terms of describing the extent of the non-adherence problem, but also describing why patients do not adhere, offering theory-driven and evidence-based solutions to improve long-term adherence to chronic anticoagulation therapy. Lessons learned are not only applicable within the field of anticoagulation but throughout haematology.","Abdou, John K; Auyeung, Vivian; Patel, Jignesh P; Arya, Roopen",British journal of haematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.14134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27173746/,91

Tacrolimus metabolism was characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography- ultraviolet light (HPLC-UV) and two soft ionization mass spectrometric techniques; matrix-assisted lasers desorption/ionization (MALDI) and time-of-flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). The extent of tacrolimus metabolism, when normalized to the cytochrome P-450 content, was in the order: rat < hamster < rabbit < pig < guinea pig < dog < human < baboon. Tacrolimus metabolism exhibited significant qualitative and quantitative differences between the animal species tested. Desmethyl- (MI-MIII), didesmethyl- (MIV-MVI), monohydroxy- (MVII), dihydroxy- (MVIII), epoxide- (MIX), dihydrodiol- (MX), monodesmethyl and monohydroxy- (MXI-MXIII), and didesmethyl and monohydroxy- (MXIV-MXVI) tacroliums metabolites were identified in the species tested. MI-MX were identified in all the species tested; MXI-MXVI were identified in all species except rat, rabbit and guinea pig; and MXIV-MXVI were identified only in baboon. The current investigation was unable to detect any phase II metabolites due to the limitations of the test system used. The analytical methods were not able to differentiate optical and positional isomers of metabolites due to the nature of the analytical tools used, therefore groups of metabolites were identified based on their molecular weights and available information. From the current in-vitro metabolism studies, the pattern of tacroliums metabolism in baboons closely resembled that in humans and thus it is ideal for studying tacroliums metabolism-related work of clinical relevance.","Tata, P N V; Subbotina, N; Burckart, G J; Muddiman, D C; Gusev, A I; Hercules, D M; Starzl, T E; Venkataramanan, R",Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,https://doi.org/10.1080/00498250903114478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19604035/,91

Ten female mixed breed dogs were included in the study. Dogs were divided into group 1 (LESS-OVE; n = 5) and group 2 (Lap-OVE; n = 5). All procedures were performed by laparoscopic-skilled surgeons, and the anesthetic protocol was the same for all patients. In both groups, the ovarian vascular pedicle and ligaments were transected using a bipolar vessel sealer/divider device. The mean total surgical time was slightly longer in LESS-OVE (36.6 ± 3.5 min) than Lap-OVE (32.0 ± 3.0 min); however, the differences were not significant. Perioperative complications were not reported in any group. Both laparoscopic techniques were shown to be equally feasible and safe for patients. However, surgeons found LESS-OVE to require more skill than Lap-OVE. Therefore, additional studies should be conducted to evaluate this novel approach in clinical veterinary practice, and a proper laparoscopic training program for veterinary surgeons should be developed.","Tapia-Araya, Angelo E; Díaz-Güemes Martin-Portugués, Idoia; Bermejo, Laura Fresno; Sánchez-Margallo, Francisco Miguel",Journal of veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.4142/jvs.2015.16.4.525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26119164/,91

METHODS 40 aneurysms treated exclusively with Orbit or Galaxy coils and 18 aneurysms treated only with Penumbra coils from 2010 to February 2012 were compared. Measurements included packing density, number of coils per unit aneurysm volume, and total coil length per unit aneurysm volume. RESULTS Mean packing density of 33.7% using Penumbra coils was significantly greater than 24.4% for Orbit/Galaxy coils. The number of coils per aneurysm volume of 0.026 coils/mm(3) for the Penumbra coil was significantly lower than 0.114 coils/mm(3) for the Orbit/Galaxy coils. Aneurysm occlusion rates were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Compared with the Orbit/Galaxy coils, our analysis suggests that the Penumbra coil is more efficient and cost effective in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.","Milburn, James; Pansara, Ankit Limba; Vidal, Gabriel; Martinez, Raisa Coral",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2012-010587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23502706/,91

No population-based eye health survey has been conducted, and eye health services do not generate routine monitoring reports, so the extent of eye health inequality is unknown. This information is required to plan equitable eye health services. Here we outline the protocol for a scoping review to report the nature and extent of the evidence reporting vision impairment, and the use of eye health services by ethnicity in New Zealand. METHODS AND ANALYSIS An information specialist will conduct searches on MEDLINE and Embase, with no limit on publication dates or language. We will search the grey literature via websites of relevant government and service provider agencies. Reference lists of included articles will be screened. Observational studies will be included if they report the prevalence of vision impairment, or any of the main causes (cataract, uncorrected refractive error, macular degeneration, glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy) or report the use of eye health services in New Zealand among people of any age. Two authors will independently review titles, abstracts and full-text articles, and complete data extraction. Overall findings will be summarised using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis, with an emphasis on disaggregation by ethnicity where this information is available. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval has not been sought as our review will only include published and publicly accessible data. We will publish the review in an open access peer-reviewed journal. We anticipate the findings will be useful to organisations and providers in New Zealand responsible to plan and deliver eye care services, as well as stakeholders in other countries with differential access to eye care.

81702,Effects of heat stress on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in growing pigs.,2015,"Goldfish farming gained more attention among the ornamental fishes in aquaculture industry. The occurrence of bacterial infections and further antimicrobial treatment lead to the major crisis of antibiotic resistance in aquaculture. We have isolated diverse enterobacteriaceae groups which affect the goldfish and identified their response towards 46 antimicrobials of 15 different classes. Thirteen significant bacterial isolates such as Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus penneri, P. hauseri, Enterobacter cloacae, E. cancerogenus, E. ludwigii, Citrobacter freundii, E. coli, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Providencia vermicola were recovered from the infected fish with the Shannon-wiener diversity index of 2.556. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index was found to be maximum for P. penneri (0.87) and minimum for C. freundii and E. cloacae (0.22), highlighting the hyper antibiotic selection pressure in the farm. The minimum concentration of antibiotics required to inhibit most of the resistant isolates was found to be > 256 mcg/ml. All the isolates were susceptible towards ciprofloxacin. Plasmid curing and further AMR tests could reveal the location of antibiotic resistance genes mainly as plasmids which determine the large extent of AMR spread through horizontal gene transfer. This study is the first of its kind to investigate the antimicrobial resistance profile of enterobacteriaceae recovered from goldfish, before and after plasmid curing.","Preena, P G; Dharmaratnam, Arathi; Raj, N Sundar; Raja, S Arun; Nair, Reshma R; Swaminathan, T Raja",Archives of microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00203-020-02021-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803348/,91

To date, however, the effectiveness of teaching ear anatomy using 3-D holographic technology has not been studied. The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of learning ear anatomy using a holographic (HG) anatomic model in comparison to didactic lecture (DL) and a computer module (CM). METHODS A 3-D anatomic model of the middle and inner ear was created and displayed using presentation slides in a lecture, computer module, or via the Microsoft HoloLens. Twenty-nine medical students were randomized to one of the three interventions. All participants underwent assessment of baseline knowledge of ear anatomy. Immediately following each intervention, testing was repeated along with completion of a satisfaction survey. RESULTS Baseline test scores did not differ across intervention groups. All groups showed an improvement in anatomic knowledge post-intervention (p < 0.001); the improvement was equal across all interventions (p = 0.06). Participants rated the interventions equally for delivery of factual content (p = 0.96), but rated the HG higher than the DL and CM for overall effectiveness, ability to convey spatial relationships, and for learner engagement and motivation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that 3-D holographic technology is an effective method of teaching ear anatomy as compared to DLs and CMs. Furthermore, it is better at engaging and motivating learners compared to traditional methods, meriting its inclusion as a tool in undergraduate medical education curriculum.","Gnanasegaram, Joshua J; Leung, Regina; Beyea, Jason A",Journal of otolaryngology - head & neck surgery = Le Journal d'oto-rhino-laryngologie et de chirurgie cervico-faciale,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40463-020-00458-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814593/,91

METHODS From May 2009 to June 2012, 171 consecutive patients (mean age 74.5±7.8, years; 106 men) who presented with SFA stenosis or occlusion in 205 limbs underwent stent implantation in the SFA at a single center. Stent fractures were determined by radiography and classified into types I through V. Loss of patency was assessed by duplex ultrasonography (>2.4 peak systolic velocity ratio) or angiography (percent diameter stenosis >50%). RESULTS The 12- and 24-month primary patency rates were 49.8% and 43.4%, respectively. Stent fractures occurred in 12.5% and 26.8% per limb (6.6% and 19.4% per stent) at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Primary patency was numerically worse in the stent fracture group but not statistically different from the group without fractures at 2 years. Primary patency for different classes of stent fracture were 30.8% (type I), 50.0% (type II), and 31.3% (type III-V). Hyperlipidemia (p=0.001), TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II classification (p=0.007), chronic total occlusion (CTO; p<0.001), proximal lesion location (p=0.008), lesion calcification (p=0.025), total stent length (p=0.005), stent diameter (p=0.001), and number of stents (p=0.001) were statistically significant predictors of stent fracture. Multivariate analysis showed that CTO (hazard ratio 0.173, 95% confidence interval 0.042 to 0.716, p=0.015) was an independent predictor of stent fracture. CONCLUSION Stent fractures occur more frequently in patients with CTOs after treatment of longer stented lesions. Although multivariate analysis showed that CTO was the only independent predictor regardless of stent length or number, the stent fracture rate was numerically higher in the severe calcification and proximal SFA lesion subgroups. Stent fracture did not appear to affect long-term patency rates, but this is yet to be confirmed with further follow-up.","Lin, Yuting; Tang, Xiao; Fu, Weiguo; Kovach, Richard; George, Jon C; Guo, Daqiao",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602815580783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25862365/,91

To estimate the population lacking at least basic water and sanitation access in the urban United States.Methods. We compared national estimates of water and sanitation access from the World Health Organization/United Nations Children's Fund Joint Monitoring Program with estimates from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development on homelessness and the American Community Survey on household water and sanitation facilities.Results. We estimated that at least 930 000 persons in US cities lacked sustained access to at least basic sanitation and 610 000 to at least basic water access, as defined by the United Nations.Conclusions. After accounting for those experiencing homelessness and substandard housing, our estimate of people lacking at least basic water equaled current estimates (n = 610 000)-without considering water quality-and greatly exceeded estimates of sanitation access (n = 28 000).Public Health Implications. Methods to estimate water and sanitation access in the United States should include people experiencing homelessness and other low-income groups, and specific policies are needed to reduce disparities in urban sanitation. We recommend similar estimation efforts for other high-income countries currently reported as having near universal sanitation access. (Am J Public Health.

This study aims to identify specific lab markers, complications, and treatments that may be associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS This study is retrospective in nature; it included 217 COVID-19 positive patients who were admitted to a ProMedica Health System hospital in Northwest Ohio, United States, between March 25 - June 16, 2020. We collected various laboratory values, complications, and treatment courses. T-test and Chi-squared analyses were used to predict mortality. COVID-19 test was confirmed via PCR. RESULTS Of 217 patients included in the study, the mean age of the population was 63.13 (SD 17.8), of which 194 (89.4%, mean age 61.7 years) survived while 23 (10.6%, mean age 74.6 years) died. Among them, 53% were females and 47% male. Laboratory values that were associated with mortality were low hemoglobin (p-value 0.0046), elevated INR (p-value 0.0005), low platelets (p-value 0.0246) and elevated procalcitonin (p-value 0.0472). Marginally significant laboratory values included elevated troponin (p-value 0.0661), and elevated creatinine (p-value 0.0741). Treatment with either antibiotic, antifungals, antivirals, blood transfusion, steroids, and intubation were all statistically significant for mortality. COVID-19 related complications with either ARDS, myocarditis, elevated INR, septic shock, or age greater than 63 were significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION Low hemoglobin, elevated INR, Low platelet, elevated procalcitonin, treated with either antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, blood transfusion, steroids, and intubation are associated with high mortality related to COVID-19 infection.

One of the possibly serious complications is trocar site hernia. CASE REPORT We present a rare case of trocar site hernia, in particular herniation of the blind loop of the jejunojejunostomy in a patient previously operated for laparoscopic gastric bypass. CONCLUSION In patients with intermittent epigastric pain and regurgitation or nausea after RYGB, the differential diagnosis should include internal herniation and cholecystitis. Besides that, incarcerated trocar site hernia should also be considered. If obstructive symptoms are lacking, this might indicate Richter's hernia or herniation of the blind loop of the jejunojejunostomy. Due to the vague symptoms and the potentially late presentation, diagnosis can be challenging. However, this is a dangerous complication possibly leading to bowel strangulation and perforation, requiring urgent surgical repair.","Loret, Nele; De Visschere, Marieke; Berwouts, Luc",Acta chirurgica Belgica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00015458.2016.1215951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27684179/,91

Several studies have shown that demyelination in MS is caused by proinflammatory mediators and nitric oxide (NO), which is released by perivascular infiltrates and/or activated glial cells. Both endogenous NO released by microglia and astrocytes; and NO generated from exogenous NO donors are known to induce oligodendrocytes death. However, the molecular mechanism of oligodendroglial death is poorly understood. Here we explore the role of NO in modulating the expression of myelin-specific genes that leads to oligodendroglial death. We investigated the effect of NO on the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and proteolipid protein (PLP) in human primary oligodendrocytes. Combination of IFN-γ and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or double stranded RNA in the form of polyIC induced the production of NO and decreased the expression of myelin gene in human fetal mixed glial cultures. Either a scavenger of NO (PTIO) or an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (L-NIL) abrogated (LPS+IFN-γ)- and polyIC-mediated suppression of myelin genes in human mixed glial cells. The role of NO was further corroborated by the inhibition of myelin gene expression in purified human oligodendroglia by several NO donors including SNP, NOC-7, SIN-1, and SNAP. This study illustrates a novel biological role of NO in down-regulating the expression of myelin genes preceding the death of oligodendrocytes.","Jana, Malabendu; Pahan, Kalipada",Journal of clinical & cellular immunology,https://doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24273691/,91

In radiology, social determinants of health lead to disparate use of imaging services through multiple intersecting contributors, on both the provider and patient side, affecting diagnosis and treatment. Disparities on the provider side include ordering of initial or follow-up imaging studies and providing standard-of-care interventional procedures, while patient factors include differences in awareness of screening exams and confidence in the healthcare system. Disparate utilization of mammography and lung cancer screening lead to delayed diagnosis, while differential provision of minimally invasive interventional procedures contributes to differential outcomes related to treatment. Interventions designed to mitigate social determinants of health could help to equalize the healthcare system. Here we review disparities in access and health outcomes in radiology. We investigate underlying contributing factors in order to identify potential policy changes that could promote more equitable health in radiology.","Abraham, Peter; Bishay, Anthony E; Farah, Isabella; Williams, Ellen; Tamayo-Murillo, Dorathy; Newton, Isabel G",Academic radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2021.04.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34001438/,91

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV. They were admitted to the third people's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, there were 5 males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years old. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammation lesions. Seven cases of small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases of speckled ground glass opacities were found. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. Other 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important.","Feng, K; Yun, Y X; Wang, X F; Yang, G D; Zheng, Y J; Lin, C M; Wang, L F",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2020.0007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32061200/,91
83977,Observational analysis of successful reimplantation of explanted intrathecal drug delivery systems: a case series.,2011,"BACKGROUND The utilization of checklists, bundles, and protocols attempts to provide standardization in the delivery of patient care. Despite important progress obtained in the prevention of hospital-acquired infections, the daily management of mechanical ventilation is still prone to heterogeneity, depending on the number of providers manipulating the ventilator. Whether the number of changes made on ventilator parameters impacts clinical outcomes remains unknown. METHODS A quality improvement project was designed to assess whether liberal manipulations of ventilator settings affect the rate of tracheostomy and 28 ventilator-free days. Over the course of 7 d, respiratory therapists recorded all ventilator changes in newly ventilated subjects. Ventilator changes were considered as major changes if manipulations included changes in the mode of ventilation. Minor changes included manipulations of settings within the same mode of ventilation. We evaluated whether the number of total and major changes affected clinical outcomes. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS One-hundred seventeen ventilator manipulations were recorded among 54 subjects. Of those 117 ventilator changes, 35% were major manipulations. For every major ventilator manipulation, the odds of requiring tracheostomy increased 4.95 times. Furthermore, for every major ventilator change, there was an 18.6% decrease in 28 ventilator-free days. These associations were found after adjustments by APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score, body mass index, and type of ICU. The total number of changes was not associated with either primary outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS The number of major ventilator manipulations is associated with rate of tracheostomy and stay on the ventilator.","Modrykamien, Ariel M; Killian, Lori; Walters, Ryan W",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.03887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26396260/,91

ItOSS is a surveillance network that has been collecting data on maternal mortality and conducting population studies on obstetric near misses since 2013. At the beginning of the pandemic, ItOSS launched a new population-based project to monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and post-partum and promptly give back information useful to clinicians and decision-makers. All the regions and autonomous provinces, for a total of 289 birth units (PN), joined the study. Data relating to pregnant or post-partum women with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis addressing the maternities for outpatient visits or hospitalization were collected. The project methodology entails that each participating maternity reports the cases to ItOSS uploading data through an open-source platform. The on-line form includes sociodemographic and clinical data and maternal-neonatal outcomes. Biological samples to detect possible vertical transmission are also collected voluntarily. A total of 534 incident cases were reported from February 25th to July 10th 2020; 7 regions also collected biological samples for 227 cases; data collection is still ongoing.A preliminary analysis of the first 146 SARS-CoV-2 positive women who gave birth between February 25th to April 22nd shows an incidence rate of the infection equal to 2.1/1,000 in Italy and 6.9/1,000 in the Lombardy Region (Northern Italy). The brief time needed to setting up and operating the project, the national coverage, the adoption of shared tools for data collection, the quality and completeness of the information collected show how the availability of active networks like ItOSS represents a crucial element to hold a high level of preparedness in case of a health emergency.","Corsi, Edoardo; Maraschini, Alice; Perrone, Enrica; Salvatore, Michele Antonio; D'aloja, Paolo; Donati, Serana",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412797/,91
84803,Energy and time optimal trajectories in exploratory jumps of the spider Phidippus regius.,2018,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review reports recent evidence on intraoperative monitoring of cerebral oximetry and depth of anaesthesia during neuroanaesthesia procedures. RECENT FINDINGS The clinical benefits of intraoperative monitoring with cerebral oximetry [near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and brain tissue oxygenation monitoring (brptiO2)] and depth of anaesthesia with bispectral index (BIS) have recently been studied in surgical (carotid endarterectomy, cerebral arteriovenous malformations resection and brain tumour resections) and neuroradiological vascular procedures. BrptiO2/PaO2 ratio is much more reliable than absolute brptiO2 readings in detecting hypoxia in arteriovenous malformation resections. NIRS can help clinicians monitor those patients receiving endovascular treatment for acute ischaemic stroke and during carotid endarterectomy, but the value of applying cerebral oximetry in patients with cerebral vasospasm needs to be further evaluated. Awake craniotomy demonstrated that because of considerable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interindividual variation, BIS titration is recommended. Thus, the presence of a frontal brain tumour did not affect ipsilateral BIS values. SUMMARY Recent studies provide interesting evidence of intraoperative monitoring of NIRS, brptiO2 and BIS. The brptiO2/PaO2 ratio is much more reliable than an absolute brptiO2 reading; NIRS helps clinicians to monitor patients who are undergoing endovascular treatment, and BIS guides the titration of anaesthesia during awake craniotomy; its values are not affected by the presence of a frontal brain tumour.","Badenes, Rafael; García-Pérez, María L; Bilotta, Federico",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27367415/,91
84984,Innovations in Congenital Interventional Cardiology.,2020-10-01,"Alveolar epithelial type II cells, a major source of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 in the adult lung, are normally quiescent but actively proliferate in lung fibrosis and downregulate this protective enzyme. It was, therefore, hypothesised that ACE-2 expression might be related to cell cycle progression. To test this hypothesis, ACE-2 mRNA levels, protein levels and enzymatic activity were examined in fibrotic human lungs and in the alveolar epithelial cell lines A549 and MLE-12 studied at postconfluent (quiescent) versus subconfluent (proliferating) densities. ACE-2 mRNA, immunoreactive protein and enzymatic activity were all high in quiescent cells, but were severely downregulated or absent in actively proliferating cells. Upregulation of the enzyme in cells that were progressing to quiescence was completely inhibited by the transcription blocker actinomycin D or by SP600125, an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In lung biopsy specimens obtained from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, immunoreactive enzyme was absent in alveolar epithelia that were positive for proliferation markers, but was robustly expressed in alveolar epithelia devoid of proliferation markers. These data explain the loss of ACE-2 in lung fibrosis and demonstrate cell cycle-dependent regulation of this protective enzyme by a JNK-mediated transcriptional mechanism.","Uhal, Bruce D; Dang, MyTrang; Dang, Vinh; Llatos, Roger; Cano, Esteban; Abdul-Hafez, Amal; Markey, Jonathan; Piasecki, Christopher C; Molina-Molina, Maria",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00015612; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23100504/,91
85431,Differential in vitro interactions of the Janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib with human SLC drug transporters.,2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND More than 50% of Africa's population lives in rural areas, which have few professional health workers. South Africa has adopted task shifting health care to Community Health Workers (CHWs) to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, but little is known about CHWs' efficacy in rural areas. METHODS In this longitudinal prospective cohort study, almost all mothers giving birth (N = 470) in the Zithulele Hospital catchment area of the OR Tambo District were recruited and repeatedly assessed for 2 years after birth with 84.7-96% follow-up rates. During the cohort assessment we found that some mothers had received standard antenatal and HIV care (SC) (n = 313 mothers), while others had received SC, supplemented with home-visiting by CHWs before and after birth (HV) (n = 157 mothers, 37 CHWs). These visits were unrelated to the cohort study. Multiple linear and logistic regressions evaluated maternal comorbidities, maternal caretaking, and child development outcomes over time. RESULTS Compared to mothers receiving SC, mothers who also received home visits by CHWs were more likely to attend the recommended four antenatal care visits, to exclusively breastfeed at 3 months, and were less likely to consult traditional healers at 3 months. Mothers in both groups were equally likely to secure the child grant, and infant growth and achievement of developmental milestones were similar over the first 2 years of life. CONCLUSION CHW home visits resulted in better maternal caretaking, but did not have direct benefits for infants in the domains assessed. The South African Government is planning broad implementation of CHW programmes, and this study examines a comprehensive, home-visiting model in a rural region.","Stansert Katzen, Linnea; Tomlinson, Mark; Christodoulou, Joan; Laurenzi, Christina; le Roux, Ingrid; Baker, Venetia; Mbewu, Nokwanele; le Roux, Karl W; Rotheram Borus, Mary Jane",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05436-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600455/,91
85565,Ventilation control for airborne transmission of human exhaled bio-aerosols in buildings.,2018,"ABSTRACT In this article, we carry out an overview on the management options available for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and discuss possible treatment decisions, taking into account the issue of sustainability and availability. Targeted agents have shown to be superior compared with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) in terms of progression-free survival in high-risk CLL. In the majority of studies, however, continuous treatment was compared with fixed-duration CIT and no overall survival or progression-free survival-2 (time from randomization to second progression or death) advantage could be documented. Meanwhile, a substantial financial burden on both patients and payers has raised issues about affordability and adherence to treatment. Therefore, value-based pricing of new drugs has been used to set up price negotiation policies in several countries, and fixed-duration therapy has shown to be less costly than continuous treatment. Thus, CIT continues to have a role in the treatment of CLL patients with a favorable genetic profile, that is, with a mutated IGHV gene profile and a wild-type TP53. Targeted treatment represents the preferred choice in patients with an unmutated IGHV gene configuration and/or a TP53 disruption, provided that adherence to treatment is guaranteed and bearing in mind that should costly drugs not be available for frontline treatment, new agents can be very effective as first salvage treatment.","Cuneo, Antonio; Cavazzini, Francesco; Cavallari, Maurizio; Foà, Robin; Rigolin, Gian Matteo",Cancer journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/ppo.0000000000000531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398559/,91
85698,3D biomaterial models of human brain disease.,2021-04-19,"To help mitigate the impacts of climate change, many nature-based solutions are being explored. These solutions involve protection and restoration of ecosystems that serve as efficient carbon sinks, including vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs: tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows) also known as 'Blue Carbon' ecosystems. In fact, many nations are seeking to manage VCEs to help meet their climate change mitigation targets through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). However, incorporation of VCEs into NDCs requires national-scale estimates of contemporary and future blue carbon storage, which has not yet been achieved. Here we address this challenge using machine learning approaches to reliably map (with 62-72% accuracy) soil carbon stocks in VCEs based on geospatial data (topography, geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic impacts), using Australia as a case study. The resulting maps of soil carbon stocks showed that there is a total of 951 Tg (±65 Tg) of carbon stock within Australian VCEs. Strong relationships between soil carbon stocks and climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation) allowed us to project future changes in carbon storage across all RCP scenarios for the years 2050 and 2090 to determine changes in environmental suitability for soil carbon stocks. Results show that soil carbon stocks in mangrove/tidal marsh ecosystems are likely to predominantly experience declines in carbon stocks under predicted climate change scenarios (19% of ecosystems area is predicted to have an increase in soil carbon stocks, while 38% of ecosystems area is predicted to have a decrease in soil carbon stocks), but a majority of seagrass area is likely to have increased soil carbon stocks (56% increase, 7% decrease). This approach is effective for developing robust national blue carbon inventories and revealing the capacity for blue carbon to help meet NDCs. The resulting spatially-explicit maps can also be used to pinpoint areas for successful blue carbon projects both now and in the future.","Young, Mary A; Serrano, Oscar; Macreadie, Peter I; Lovelock, Catherine E; Carnell, Paul; Ierodiaconou, Daniel",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399348/,91

Methods We searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science for published articles, from their inception to 9 July 2019, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Studies reporting the correlation between CSF and blood NfL in humans were included. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to calculate the overall pooled correlation coefficient estimate, accounting for correlation technique and assay used. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic test. In sensitivity analyses, we calculated the pooled correlation coefficient estimate according to blood NfL assay: single-molecule array digital immunoassay (Simoa), electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay or ELISA. Results Data were extracted from 36 articles, including 3961 paired CSF and blood NfL samples. Overall, 26/36 studies measured blood NfL using Simoa, 8/36 ECL, 1/36 ELISA and 1 study reported all three assay results. The overall meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled correlation coefficient estimate for CSF and blood NfL was r=0.72. Heterogeneity was significant: I2=83%, p<0.01. In sensitivity analyses, the pooled correlation coefficient was similar for studies measuring blood NfL using Simoa and ECL (r=0.69 and r=0.68, respectively) but weaker for ELISA (r=0.35). Conclusion Moderate correlations are demonstrated between CSF and blood NfL, especially when blood NfL was measured using Simoa and ECL. Given its high analytical sensitivity, Simoa is the preferred assay for measuring NfL, especially at low or physiological concentrations, and this meta-analysis supports its use as the current most advanced surrogate measure of CSF NfL.

Its mutations have been implicated in multiple muscular diseases. These FHL1 related myopathies are characterized by symptoms such as progressive muscle loss, rigid or bent spine, even cardiac or respiratory failure in some patients, which implies pathological problems not only in muscles, but also in the nervous system. Moreover, decreased FHL1 protein level has been found in patients with FHL1 mutations, indicating the protein loss-of-function as a pathological cause of such diseases. These findings suggest the significance of understanding the systemic role of FHL1 in the homeostasis of nervous system and muscle. Here we reported that Fhl1 loss in C2C12 myotubes obscured acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering in addition to myotube fusion, which was associated with impaired MuSK phosphorylation. Mechanistically, myostatin-SMAD2/3 signaling was enhanced, whereas IGF-PI3K-AKT signaling was suppressed in Fhl1-/- C2C12 myotubes. Reversion of these molecular alterations rescued AChR clustering and differentiation deficits. These data outline a systemic regulation of AChR clustering and myotube fusion by FHL1, which may offer clues for mechanism study and development of therapeutic strategies to treat FHL1 related myopathies.","Wu, Jiamei; Zhao, Kai; Du, Zengmin; Chen, Ying; Zhang, Feixu; Jiang, Wei; Zheng, Jing; Wu, Xia; Shen, Chengyong; Xiao, Xiao",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.12.061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33401146/,91

87301,Comparison of skin-sparing mastectomy using LigaSure™ Small Jaw and electrocautery.,2017,"Approximately 15.5 million cancer survivors were alive in the United States in 2016 with expected growth to 26.1 million by 2040 (1). Cancer survivors are living longer because of advances in early detection and treatment, but face psychosocial, cognitive, financial, and physical challenges (1,2). Physical challenges include cardiovascular complications, partly because cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) share some cumulative risk factors including tobacco use, physical inactivity, obesity, poor diet, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia (3). In addition, many cancer treatments damage the heart, and some cancer types increase risk for developing CVD (4). The recognition and management of heart disease in cancer survivors has given rise to the discipline of cardio-oncology, which focuses on the cardiovascular health of this population (5). CVD risk has been previously estimated using prediction models, and studies suggest that physician-patient communication using predicted heart age rather than predicted 10-year risk has led to a more accurate perception of excess heart age, encouraged actions to adopt a healthy lifestyle, and improved modifiable CVD risk factors (6,7). Using the nonlaboratory-based Framingham Risk Score (FRS) to estimate 10-year risk for developing CVD, predicted heart age is estimated from the 10-year risk of CVD (predicted by age, sex, diabetes status, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment status, and body mass index); it is the age of an otherwise healthy person with the same predicted risk, with all other risk factors included in the prediction model at the normal level (systolic blood pressure of 125 mmHg, no hypertension treatment, body mass index of 22.5, nonsmoker, and nondiabetic) (6). Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), this study estimates predicted heart age, excess heart age (difference between predicted heart age and actual age), and racial/ethnic and sociodemographic disparities in predicted heart age among U.S. adult cancer survivors and noncancer participants aged 30-74 years using previously published methods (7). A total of 22,759 men and 46,294 women were cancer survivors with a mean age of 48.7 and 48.3 years, respectively. The predicted heart age and excess heart age among cancer survivors were 57.2 and 8.5 years, respectively, for men and 54.8 and 6.5 years, respectively, for women, and varied by age, race/ethnicity, education and income. The use of predicted heart age by physicians to encourage cancer survivors to improve modifiable risk factors and make heart healthy choices, such as tobacco cessation, regular physical activity, and a healthy diet to maintain a healthy weight, can engage survivors in informed cancer care planning after diagnosis.","Scott, Lia C; Yang, Quanhe; Dowling, Nicole F; Richardson, Lisa C",MMWR.

Intraperitoneal injections of morphine (2.5 mg/kg) or gabapentin (40 mg/kg) gave equivalent 2- to 3-hour-long relief of tactile hypersensitivity when tested 12 to 14 days postoperatively. In separate experiments, single trial CPP was conducted 1 week before thoracotomy and then 12 days (gabapentin) or 14 days (morphine) after surgery, followed the next day by 1 conditioning session with morphine or gabapentin, both versus saline. The gabapentin-conditioned but not the morphine-conditioned rats showed a significant preference for the analgesia-paired chamber, despite the equivalent effect of the 2 agents in relieving tactile allodynia. These results show that experimental thoracotomy in rats causes spontaneous pain and that some analgesics, such as morphine, that reduce evoked pain do not also relieve resting pain, suggesting that pathophysiological mechanisms differ between these 2 aspects of long-term postoperative pain. Perspective: Spontaneous pain, a hallmark of chronic postoperative pain, is demonstrated here in a rat model of experimental postthoracotomy pain, further validating the use of this model for the development of analgesics to treat such symptoms. Although stimulus-evoked pain was sensitive to systemic morphine, spontaneous pain was not, suggesting different mechanistic underpinnings.","Hung, Ching-Hsia; Wang, Jeffrey Chi-Fei; Strichartz, Gary R",The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2015.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26116369/,91
88208,FMT in IBS: a call for caution.,2020-05-15,"The appearance of eight new respiratory viruses in the human population in the past 9 years, including two new pandemics (SARS coronavirus in 2003 and swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 in 2009), has tested the ability of virology laboratories to develop diagnostic tests to identify these viruses. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) that first appeared two decades ago have been developed for both conventional and emerging viruses and now form the backbone of the clinical laboratory. NATs provide fast, accurate and sensitive detection of respiratory viruses and have significantly increased our understanding of the epidemiology of these viruses. Multiplex PCR assays have been introduced recently and several commercial tests are now available. The final chapter in the evolution of respiratory virus diagnostics will be the addition of allelic discrimination and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with antiviral resistance to multiplex assays. These resistance assays together with new viral load tests will enable clinical laboratories to provide physicians with important information for optimal treatment of patients.","Mahony, James B",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1586/eri.10.121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21073292/,91

There is a call to action in the United States to significantly increase access and uptake of home dialysis as the preferred dialysis treatment option. Although most do not object to patient choice in modality selection, the reality is that there are multilevel barriers both obvious and subtle that interfere with expanding home dialysis access. Financial barriers and how payment is structured continue to be key drivers, although new models of care are emerging that include for the first time incentives rather than penalties regarding home dialysis. Resources to support implementation include expert personnel requiring educational training. Policies requiring training curriculum content that is not only specified within nephrology but also for these multidisciplinary providers requisite for successful home dialysis to ensure professional expertise is ready and available, and also to cultivate champions of home modality within the broader nephrology community. Perhaps most importantly, innovation through expanded investment in research is necessary to advance practices, elevate quality, and improve outcomes.

Should There Be?,2021,"Brown seaweed (Phaeophyceae) polyphenolics such as phlorotannins are ascribed various biological activities, including neuroprotection. Of these seaweeds, Ecklonia radiata (E. radiata) is found abundantly along South Australian coastal regions; however it has not been explored for various biological activities relative to any component phlorotannins previously ascribed neuroprotective capacity. In the present study, we evaluated neuroprotective activity against the neurotoxic amyloid β protein (Aβ1-42) of an ethanol extract of E. radiata compared with various additional solvent-solubilised fractions in a neuronal PC-12 cell line. The ethyl acetate fraction comprising 62% phlorotannins demonstrated the most efficacious neuroprotective activity, inhibiting neurotoxicity at all Aβ1-42 concentrations. In addition, this fraction demonstrated a significant reduction in Aβ aggregate density, but did not alter overall aggregate morphology. Centrifugal partitioning chromatography was used to isolate the major component, eckol, in high yield and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to characterize the major components of the ethyl acetate fraction. Our results demonstrate that the prevalence of eckol-type phlorotannins are associated with neuroprotective bioactivity of E. radiata, suggestive of potential nutraceutical and biopharmaceutical uses of this brown seaweed phlorotannin in dementia.","Shrestha, Srijan; Zhang, Wei; Begbie, Alexander J; Pukala, Tara L; Smid, Scott D",Food & function,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0fo01438a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633748/,91

CASE PRESENTATION We report the case of a 67-year-old patient who presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) followed by behavioral changes, psychosis, sleep disorders, decreased consciousness, and faciobrachial dystonic seizures. Ancillary findings included serum hyponatremia and imaging evidence of high-intensity lesions within bilateral medial temporal lobes on T2-weighted fluid attenuation inversion recovery. Both LGI1 and NMDAR antibodies were positive in serum and cerebral spinal fluid using transfected cell based assays. Despite prominent clinical features of anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis (LGI1-LE), the patient also exhibited overlapping symptoms of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, like early-onset GTCS, which might be related to the concomitant positive NMDAR antibodies. CONCLUSIONS We report a rare case of LGI1-LE with overlapping symptoms and simultaneous positive NMDAR antibodies. It is necessary to evaluate the presence of NMDAR antibodies in certain LGI1-LE patients with unusual symptoms.

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a smart environment controlled through infrared oculography by people with severe motor disabilities. The study sample was composed of six individuals with motor disabilities. Initially, sociodemographic data forms, the Functional Independence Measure (FIMTM), and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) were applied. The participants used the system in their domestic environment for a week. Afterwards, they were reevaluated with regards to occupational performance (COPM), satisfaction with the use of the assistive technology resource (QUEST 2.0), psychosocial impact (PIADS) and usability of the system (SUS), as well as through semi-structured interviews for suggestions or complaints. The most common demand from the participants of this research was 'control of the TV'. Two participants did not use the system. All participants who used the system (four) presented positive results in all assessment protocols, evidencing greater independence in the control of the smart environment equipment. In addition, they evaluated the system as useful and with good usability.

METHODS Blood samples were obtained from 95 patients, and LTG plasma concentrations were determined. Population PK modeling was performed using NONMEM. A one-compartment PK model with first-order absorption and elimination was used to describe the LTG PK. Log-likelihood profiling and normalized prediction distribution errors (NPDE) were used for model evaluation. A simulation study was performed to investigate dose regimens. RESULTS Clearance (CL) was estimated to be 2.27 L/h with inter-individual variability (IIV) of 29 CV%. Volume of distribution (V) was estimated to be 53.6 L (31 CV% IIV). Body weight and concurrent use of carbamazepine and valproate were identified as significant covariates on clearance. Log-likelihood profiling indicated that parameters could be estimated with adequate precision, and NPDE indicated that the model adequately described the data observed. The simulation study illustrated the impact of carbamazepine and valproate on LTG PK, and negligible differences in PK between Indian and Caucasian patients. CONCLUSIONS This is the first PK analysis of LTG in Indian patients. The population PK model developed adequately described the data observed. Comparison of identified PK parameters with previous PK analyses in Caucasian patients indicates that CL of LTG is similar, while V is somewhat lower compared with Caucasian patients, but this is not expected to lead to relevant differences in PK profiles during steady state.","Mallaysamy, Surulivelrajan; Johnson, Martin G; Rao, Padma G M; Rajakannan, Thiyagu; Bathala, Lokesh; Arumugam, Karthik; van Hasselt, Johan G C; Ramakrishna, Devarakonda",European journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00228-012-1311-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22660444/,91

High-quality cancer care requires adequate pain management and often includes opioids for tumor- and/or treatment-related pain. Little is known about opioid use and misuse in children and AYAs with cancer, and we therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature using PRISMA guidelines to identify all relevant studies that evaluated opioid use and/or misuse among this population. Eleven studies were identified that met our inclusion criteria. The range of opioid use among the studies was 12-97%, and among the five studies that reported opioid misuse or aberrant behaviors, 7-90% of patients met criteria. Few studies reported factors associated with opioid misuse but included prior mental health and/or substance use disorders, and prior opioid use. In summary, opioid use is highly variable among children and AYAs with cancer; however, the range of use varies widely depending on the study population, such as survivors or end-of-life cancer patients. Few studies have examined opioid misuse and/or aberrant behaviors, and future research is needed to better understand opioid use and misuse among children and AYAs with cancer, specifically those who will be cured of their cancer and may subsequently experience adverse opioid-related outcomes.","Beauchemin, Melissa; Dorritie, Richard; Hershman, Dawn L",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05980-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33462726/,91
89996,"Recent Advances in Imaging with PET, Computed Tomography, and MR Techniques.",2020-10-01,"UNLABELLED The recent identification of highly divergent influenza A viruses in bats revealed a new, geographically dispersed viral reservoir. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of host-restricted viral tropism and the potential for transmission of viruses between humans and bats, we exposed a panel of cell lines from bats of diverse species to a prototypical human-origin influenza A virus. All of the tested bat cell lines were susceptible to influenza A virus infection. Experimental evolution of human and avian-like viruses in bat cells resulted in efficient replication and created highly cytopathic variants. Deep sequencing of adapted human influenza A virus revealed a mutation in the PA polymerase subunit not previously described, M285K. Recombinant virus with the PA M285K mutation completely phenocopied the adapted virus. Adaptation of an avian virus-like virus resulted in the canonical PB2 E627K mutation that is required for efficient replication in other mammals. None of the adaptive mutations occurred in the gene for viral hemagglutinin, a gene that frequently acquires changes to recognize host-specific variations in sialic acid receptors. We showed that human influenza A virus uses canonical sialic acid receptors to infect bat cells, even though bat influenza A viruses do not appear to use these receptors for virus entry. Our results demonstrate that bats are unique hosts that select for both a novel mutation and a well-known adaptive mutation in the viral polymerase to support replication. IMPORTANCE Bats constitute well-known reservoirs for viruses that may be transferred into human populations, sometimes with fatal consequences. Influenza A viruses have recently been identified in bats, dramatically expanding the known host range of this virus. Here we investigated the replication of human influenza A virus in bat cell lines and the barriers that the virus faces in this new host. Human influenza A and B viruses infected cells from geographically and evolutionarily diverse New and Old World bats. Viruses mutated during infections in bat cells, resulting in increased replication and cytopathic effects. These mutations were mapped to the viral polymerase and shown to be solely responsible for adaptation to bat cells. Our data suggest that replication of human influenza A viruses in a nonnative host drives the evolution of new variants and may be an important source of genetic diversity.","Poole, Daniel S; Yú, Shuǐqìng; Caì, Yíngyún; Dinis, Jorge M; Müller, Marcel A; Jordan, Ingo; Friedrich, Thomas C; Kuhn, Jens H; Mehle, Andrew",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01857-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25142579/,91

Twenty-seven consecutive patients with 28 runs of the DP3 between January 2013 and June 2014 were included for analysis. Median patient age, weight, and duration of support were 278 days (range: 0 days-14.2 years), 7.2 kg (range: 2.5-39 kg), and 8 days (range: 2-69 days). Midline sternotomy (n = 20, 71.4%) or cervical approaches (n = 8, 28.6%) were used for cannulation. The DP3 was employed for either veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (ECLS, n = 16), veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, n = 5), or ventricular assist devices (right ventricular assist device [RVAD], n = 1; left ventricular assist device [LVAD], n = 1; and univentricular assist device [UNIVAD], n = 5). Three patients initially supported with ECLS were switched to UNIVAD and one patient with UNIVAD was changed to ECLS. Required flow for neonates (n = 8) ranged between 0.2 and 0.75 L/min. Irreversible pump damage occurred in one patient during deairing after air block. Successful weaning, 30 day and hospital survival were 89.3% (n = 25), 85.7% (n = 24), and 71.4% (n = 20). All patients on UNIVAD, who did not require further extracorporeal respiratory assist, survived. In conclusion, the DP3 can be used for individual patient demands and adapted to their most suitable method of support. Meticulous flow adjustments render this pump highly effective for extracorporeal support particularly in pediatric patients.","Speth, Marlene; Münch, Frank; Purbojo, Ariawan; Glöckler, Martin; Toka, Okan; Cesnjevar, Robert A; Rüffer, André",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000000385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27164039/,91

Based on limited evidence, it was performed in several dedicated stroke centers worldwide on selected patients. Since 2015, EVT for patients with intracranial large vessel occlusion has quickly been implemented as standard treatment in many countries worldwide, supported by the revised international guidelines based on solid evidence from multiple clinical trials. We describe the development in use of EVT in the Netherlands before, during, and after the pivotal EVT trials. We used data from all patients who were treated with EVT in the Netherlands from January 2002 until December 2018. We undertook a time-series analysis to examine trends in the use of EVT using Poisson regression analysis. Incidence rate ratios per year with 95% CIs were obtained to demonstrate the impact and implementation after the publication of the EVT trial results. We made regional observation plots, adjusted for stroke incidence, to assess the availability and use of the treatment in the country. In the buildup to the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands), a slow increase of EVT patients was observed, with 0.2% of all ischemic stroke patients receiving EVT. Before the trial results were formally announced, a statistically significant increase in EVT-treated patients per year was observed (incidence rate ratio, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.46-2.04]), and after the trial publication, an immediate steep increase was seen, followed by a more gradual increase (incidence rate ratio, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.77-2.59]). In 2018, the percentage of ischemic stroke patients receiving EVT increased to 5.8%. A well-developed infrastructure, a pragmatic approach toward the use of EVT in clinical practice, in combination with a strict adherence by the regulatory authorities to national evidence-based guidelines has led to successful implementation of EVT in the Netherlands. Ongoing efforts are directed at further increasing the proportion of stroke patients with EVT in all regions of the country.","Wiegers, Eveline J A; Compagne, Kars C J; Janssen, Paula M; Venema, Esmee; Deckers, Jaap W; Schonewille, Wouter J; Albert Vos, Jan; Lycklama À Nijeholt, Geert J; Roozenbeek, Bob; Martens, Jasper M; Hofmeijer, Jeannette; van Oostenbrugge, Robert-Jan; van Zwam, Wim H; Majoie, Charles B L M; van der Lugt, Aad; Lingsma, H F; Roos, Yvo B W E M; Dippel, Diederik W J",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.026731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32568637/,91
90552,Retardation of some drugs in thin-layer chromatographic systems with impregnated silica gel plates with hen's egg white and bovine serum albumin.,2020-08-16,"BACKGROUND Our genetic code is now readable, writable and hackable. The recent escalation of genome-wide sequencing (GS) applications in population diagnostics will not only enable the assessment of risks of transmitting well-defined monogenic disorders at preconceptional stages (i.e. carrier screening), but also facilitate identification of multifactorial genetic predispositions to sub-lethal pathologies, including those affecting reproductive fitness. Through GS, the acquisition and curation of reproductive-related findings will warrant the expansion of genetic assessment to new areas of genomic prediction of reproductive phenotypes, pharmacogenomics and molecular embryology, further boosting our knowledge and therapeutic tools for treating infertility and improving women's health. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE In this article, we review current knowledge and potential development of preconception genome analysis aimed at detecting reproductive and individual health risks (recessive genetic disease and medically actionable secondary findings) as well as anticipating specific reproductive outcomes, particularly in the context of IVF. The extension of reproductive genetic risk assessment to the general population and IVF couples will lead to the identification of couples who carry recessive mutations, as well as sub-lethal conditions prior to conception. This approach will provide increased reproductive autonomy to couples, particularly in those cases where preimplantation genetic testing is an available option to avoid the transmission of undesirable conditions. In addition, GS on prospective infertility patients will enable genome-wide association studies specific for infertility phenotypes such as predisposition to premature ovarian failure, increased risk of aneuploidies, complete oocyte immaturity or blastocyst development failure, thus empowering the development of true reproductive precision medicine. SEARCH METHODS Searches of the literature on PubMed Central included combinations of the following MeSH terms: human, genetics, genomics, variants, male, female, fertility, next generation sequencing, genome exome sequencing, expanded carrier screening, secondary findings, pharmacogenomics, controlled ovarian stimulation, preconception, genetics, genome-wide association studies, GWAS. OUTCOMES Through PubMed Central queries, we identified a total of 1409 articles. The full list of articles was assessed for date of publication, limiting the search to studies published within the last 15 years (2004 onwards due to escalating research output of next-generation sequencing studies from that date). The remaining articles' titles were assessed for pertinence to the topic, leaving a total of 644 articles. The use of preconception GS has the potential to identify inheritable genetic conditions concealed in the genome of around 4% of couples looking to conceive. Genomic information during reproductive age will also be useful to anticipate late-onset medically actionable conditions with strong genetic background in around 2-4% of all individuals. Genetic variants correlated with differential response to pharmaceutical treatment in IVF, and clear genotype-phenotype associations are found for aberrant sperm types, oocyte maturation, fertilization or pre- and post-implantation embryonic development. All currently known capabilities of GS at the preconception stage are reviewed along with persisting and forthcoming barriers for the implementation of precise reproductive medicine. WIDER IMPLICATIONS The expansion of sequencing analysis to additional monogenic and polygenic traits may enable the development of cost-effective preconception tests capable of identifying underlying genetic causes of infertility, which have been defined as 'unexplained' until now, thus leading to the development of a true personalized genomic medicine framework in reproductive health.","Capalbo, Antonio; Poli, Maurizio; Riera-Escamilla, Antoni; Shukla, Vallari; Kudo Høffding, Miya; Krausz, Csilla; Hoffmann, Eva R; Simon, Carlos",Human reproduction update,https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmaa044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197264/,91

METHODS This was a prospective, institutional review board-approved, descriptive feasibility study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2) conducted at a university-affiliated hospital. Twelve class III morbidly obese women with a body mass index of 40 kg/m(2) or greater were selected to undergo robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy, classified as type IVE, with complete detachment of the cardinal-uterosacral ligament complex, unilateral or bilateral, with entry into the vagina was performed. RESULTS The median estimated blood loss was 146.3 mL (range, 15-550 mL), the mean length of stay in the hospital was 25.3 hours (range, 23- 48 hours), and the complication rate was 0%. The rate of conversion to laparotomy was 8%. The median surgical time was 109.6 minutes (range, 99 -145 minutes).

METHODS This was a multi-institutional evaluation of patients who underwent MWA between 2003 and 2012. Morbidity (90-day) and mortality were compared between patients who had MWA alone and those who underwent combined resection and MWA (CRA). Mortality and overall survival after CRA were compared with published data on two-stage resections. RESULTS Some 201 patients with bilobar colorectal liver metastasis treated with MWA from four high-volume institutions were evaluated (100 MWA alone, 101 CRA). Patients who had MWA alone were older, but the groups were otherwise well matched demographically. The tumour burden was higher in the CRA group (mean number of lesions 3·9 versus 2·2; P = 0·003). Overall (31·7 versus 15·0 per cent; P = 0·006) and high-grade (13·9 versus 5·0 per cent; P = 0·030) complication rates were higher in the CRA group. Median overall survival was slightly shorter in the CRA group (38·4 versus 42·2 months; P = 0·132) but disease-free survival was similar (10·1 versus 9·3 months; P = 0·525). The morbidity and mortality of CRA compared favourably with rates in the existing literature on two-stage resection, and survival data were similar. CONCLUSION Single-stage hepatectomy and MWA resulted in survival similar to that following two-stage hepatectomy, with less overall morbidity.","Philips, P; Groeschl, R T; Hanna, E M; Swan, R Z; Turaga, K K; Martinie, J B; Iannitti, D A; Schmidt, C; Gamblin, T Clark; Martin, R C G",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27191368/,91

METHOD The number of episodes of postoperative bleeding was identified prospectively from the day of surgery to the last follow-up visit in consecutive patients operated on during 2010 in two units dedicated to proctology. RESULTS A total of 2513 procedures were performed in 2314 patients (1379 men), 46 ± 16 years of age. Secondary bleeding occurred after 115 (4.6%) procedures, no later than day 24 after surgery, requiring rehospitalization in 86% of cases and further surgery and/or transfusion in 36%. The highest frequency was noted after surgery for haemorrhoids (haemorrhoidopexy, 7.9%; haemorrhoidectomy, 6.2%) (P = NS and transanal excision of rectal tumours (6.5%). On multivariate analysis, the frequency was significantly increased by clopidogrel (15%) [relative risk (RR) = 10). In patients on oral anticoagulants, bleeding occurred in 23% (RR = 5.8) if the anticoagulants were not interrupted and in 57% (RR = 42) if the anticoagulants were discontinued and replaced with heparin. CONCLUSION During proctological surgery the overall risk of postoperative bleeding is low, but it can occur up to 3 weeks after surgery and is often severe. Maintenance treatment with oral anticoagulants is the most important risk factor, aggravated by a change to heparin. Clopidogrel also significantly increases the bleeding risk.","Pigot, F; Juguet, F; Bouchard, D; Castinel, A",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2012.03063.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22564791/,91

A wide range of local internal haemostatic agents have been developed to help achieve intra-cavity control of bleeding, with choice of agent influenced by the circumstances and nature of the haemorrhage. Trauma patients are frequently coagulopathic, so products that incorporate pro-coagulant technology and thereby act independently of the clotting cascade may be more effective in these settings. A range of products that utilise thrombin and fibrinogen to promote local haemostasis at intra-cavity bleeding points are available or in development, including fibrin glues (e.g. Tisseel®/Tissucol® and Evicel®/Crosseal®/Quixil®), fibrin sealant patches (e.g. TachoSil®) and products based on a gelatin-thrombin haemostatic matrix (e.g. FloSeal®). MATERIALS AND METHODS This systematic review was performed to assess all peer-reviewed evidence of product efficacy. RESULTS Fibrin sealant patches have shown haemostatic efficacy in a variety of surgical procedures and appear to offer practical advantages over liquid fibrin glues. Existing evidence suggests that patch products enable delivery of pro-coagulants to defined areas with less chance of dilution and/or displacement by blood flow, but they require a pressure buttress for a suitable amount of time to achieve good results after trauma. CONCLUSIONS Our experience, supported by other reports in the literature, suggests the use of such fibrin patches may provide an effective option in helping to control haemorrhage after trauma. However, there is a general paucity of clinical data for intra-cavity haemostatic agent use, with the majority of data being based on animal models and case reports. Further clinical evidence, ideally including comparative studies between different agents, would be beneficial in helping guide surgeon choice to the most appropriate products to use in trauma settings.","Navarro, A; Brooks, A",European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00068-014-0441-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26037982/,91

Performance indicators measuring aspects of patient care processes can lead to improvements in health systems and the prevention of harm to the patient. We present our protocol for a scoping review to identify indicators for obstetric safety in low risk births. We aim to identify indicators addressing preventable hospital harms, to summarise the data and synthesise results. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use methods described by Arksey and O'Malley and further expanded by Levac et al. We will search electronic databases such as Medline, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library, and websites from professional bodies and other organisations, using an iterative search strategy.Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts of search results to determine eligibility for inclusion. If eligibility is not clear, the reviewers will screen the full text version. If reviewers' decisions regarding eligibility differ, a third reviewer will review the record. Two reviewers will independently extract data from records that meet our inclusion criteria using a standardised data collection form. We will narratively describe quantitative data, such as the frequency with which indicators are identified, and conduct a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We will compile a comprehensive list of patient safety indicators and organise them according to concepts that best suit the data such as the Donabedian model or the Hospital Harm Framework. We will discuss the implications for future research, clinical practice and policy-making. We will report the conduct of the review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews checklist. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The sources of information included in this scoping review will be available to the public. Therefore, ethics approval is not warranted. We will disseminate results in a peer-reviewed publication, conference/event presentation(s) and stakeholder communications.","Conway, Aislinn; Reszel, Jessica; Walker, Mark C; Grimshaw, Jeremy M; Dunn, Sandra I",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303516/,91

STUDY DESIGN We performed a prospective single-center study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). One surgeon trained in minimally invasive surgery performed 515 cases of LESS surgery from May 2008 to September 2011. RESULTS LESS gynecological surgery was performed on 515 patients (274 total hysterectomies; 26 subtotal hysterectomies; 87 adnexectomies including oophorectomy, salpingectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy; 100 ovarian cystectomies; 17 myomectomies; 11 others). The median age and body mass index of the patients were 45 years and 22.6 kg/m², respectively. LESS surgery was successfully completed in 493 patients (95.7%) without the need for one or more ancillary ports or conversion to laparotomy. Twenty patients needed one or more additional ports and two cases were converted to laparotomy. One or more additional ports were required most frequently in ovarian cystectomy procedures (12/100, 12%). Thirty-six patients (7.0%) required intraoperative and/or postoperative transfusions. Each of these patients underwent hysterectomy (33/274, 12.0%) or subtotal hysterectomy (3/26, 11.5%). Perioperative complications (<30 postoperative days), excluding transfusions, occurred in 8 patients (1.6%) and included one case each of vault bleeding, vault abscess, stump watery discharge, rectal injury, and vesicovaginal fistula, and three cases of urinary tract injury. Late complications occurred in three patients (0.6%) and included two umbilical hernias and one vault evisceration. The overall complication rate, excluding transfusions, was 2.1% (11/515). CONCLUSION The rate of late postoperative complications, including umbilical port site hernia and vault evisceration, was not increased in this study, as compared to previous reports of single-port and conventional laparoscopic surgeries.","Park, Jin-Young; Kim, Tae-Joong; Kang, Hyo-Jeong; Lee, Yoo-young; Choi, Chel Hun; Lee, Jeong-Won; Bae, Duk-Soo; Kim, Byoung-Gie","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2012.11.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23332141/,91

It is not known how accurate visual estimation of PPV is, or whether eyeballing of PPV in goal-directed fluid therapy studies may limit the ability to blind the control group to PPV value. The goal of this study was to test the accuracy of visual estimation of PPV. Using a simulator program designed by the authors that runs on a PC, 20 residents and 19 attendings were shown five arterial pressure waveforms each with different PPV values (range 1-30 %) moving at one of three sweep speeds (6.25, 12.5, or 25 mm/s) and asked to determine the PPV. There was a weak but significant relationship between true PPV and eyeball PPV (r (2) = 0.22; p < 0.01). The agreement between true PPV and eyeball PPV was 3.3 ± 8.7 %. The mean percent error was 122 %. The rate of correct response group classification was 65 %. Mean percent error was higher the faster the waveform sweep speed (130 % at 25 mm/s vs. 117 % at 6.25 mm/s), and correct responsiveness classification lower (58 % at 25 mm/s vs. 69 % at 6.25 mm/s).

In the hospital environment, certain high-risk procedures have the potential to cause transmission of the virus to health care workers and nosocomial transmission to patients through different mechanisms including the generation of aerosols and fomite formation via contamination of medical devices. AREAS COVERED Aerosol generating procedures such as bronchoscopy are considered high-risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. As a result, single use devices should be used where possible and changing to single-use flexible bronchoscopes has been advised by respiratory societies internationally. In this paper, we outline the rationale for this advice and have analysed the evidence relating to the reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission arising from a switch to these single use devices and the potential impact that this switch may have on the quality of pulmonology services.

92878,Addendum: A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.,2020-11-17,"AIM To determine the prevalence of various types of viruses in infants hospitalised due to respiratory distress, compare molecular diagnostic tests and evaluate symptom severity. METHODS All 136 nasopharyngeal aspirates from infants hospitalised for respiratory distress over a 9-month period were analysed for virus type by in-house respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) microarray-based and/or Luminex-based multiplex molecular tests. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively for clinical data. RESULTS Viral aetiology was confirmed in 126 subjects (92.6%) with 26 infected by more than one virus. RSVA/B was the most common (50.9%), followed by entero/rhinovirus (21.6%), human metapneumovirus (10.5%), parainfluenza virus (5.9%) and influenza (3.3%). RSV-infected infants had significantly lower saturation levels (89% versus 92%, p < 0.001), higher demand for oxygen (42.7% versus 21.6%, p = 0.021) and fluids (28% versus 9.8%; p = 0.014) and longer hospital stays (4 versus 3 days, <0.001) than other viruses. Luminex assays gave repeatable, slightly less sensitive results than in-house RSV PCR. Microarray-based assays were more sensitive, however, producing some unrepeatable results. CONCLUSION Respiratory syncytial virus dominates as the viral cause in hospitalised infants with respiratory distress in Sweden during the winter season, resulting in a clinical course that is significantly more severe. The multiplex assays produced reasonably concordant results.","Falkenstein-Hagander, Kathy; Månsson, Ann-Sofie; Redmo, Johan; Nilsson Wimar, Percy; Widell, Anders",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.12623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606114/,91
92881,Syndromic surveillance of vaccine-associated adverse events in U.S. emergency departments.,2021-06-21,"BanLec is a jacalin-related lectin isolated from the fruit of bananas, Musa acuminata. This lectin binds to high mannose carbohydrate structures, including those found on viruses containing glycosylated envelope proteins such as human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). Therefore, we hypothesized that BanLec might inhibit HIV-1 through binding of the glycosylated HIV-1 envelope protein, gp120. We determined that BanLec inhibits primary and laboratory-adapted HIV-1 isolates of different tropisms and subtypes. BanLec possesses potent anti-HIV activity, with IC(50) values in the low nanomolar to picomolar range. The mechanism for BanLec-mediated antiviral activity was investigated by determining if this lectin can directly bind the HIV-1 envelope protein and block entry of the virus into the cell. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed direct binding of BanLec to gp120 and indicated that BanLec can recognize the high mannose structures that are recognized by the monoclonal antibody 2G12. Furthermore, BanLec is able to block HIV-1 cellular entry as indicated by temperature-sensitive viral entry studies and by the decreased levels of the strong-stop product of early reverse transcription seen in the presence of BanLec. Thus, our data indicate that BanLec inhibits HIV-1 infection by binding to the glycosylated viral envelope and blocking cellular entry. The relative anti-HIV activity of BanLec compared favorably to other anti-HIV lectins, such as snowdrop lectin and Griffithsin, and to T-20 and maraviroc, two anti-HIV drugs currently in clinical use. Based on these results, BanLec is a potential component for an anti-viral microbicide that could be used to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV-1.","Swanson, Michael D; Winter, Harry C; Goldstein, Irwin J; Markovitz, David M",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m109.034926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20080975/,91

There is little published data on the experience of palliative care services catering to a population with low case numbers of COVID-19. AIM This study aimed to consider the impact of COVID-19 on utilisation of inpatient palliative care in the context of low community transmission, and low numbers of cases in hospital. DESIGN A retrospective service evaluation examining differences in number of admissions, diagnoses, number of deaths and time from admission to death, across three discrete 8-week time periods spanning the early COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS All admissions (n = 194) to a metropolitan tertiary hospital inpatient palliative care unit in Melbourne during the study period. RESULTS An initial 16.9% fall in admissions was followed by a return to baseline admission numbers, with a 46.7% increase in number of deaths compared to baseline. The number of deaths within 24 h rose from 10.8% to 37.3% (p < 0.01). The number of patients with non-malignant diagnoses increased from 32.4% to 52%, and those with non-malignant diagnoses were more likely to die rapidly (p < 0.01). There were no patients with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION Increased numbers of deaths within 24 h of admission occurred on the palliative care unit despite low COVID-19 case numbers in the wider community, and in the setting of widespread social restriction measures.

The purpose of this study was to compare the safety of laparoscopic anterior resection with natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE-LAR) and abdominal incision specimen extraction (AISE-LAR) for sigmoid or rectum tumors. METHODS MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), Scopus, and ClinicalTrials databases were systematically searched for related articles up to August 2019. The primary outcomes included postoperative complications (overall postoperative complication, incision-related complication, anastomotic fistula, and severe complication) and pathologic results (lymph nodes harvested, proximal resection margin, and distal resection edge). The statistical analysis was performed on STATA 12.0 software. RESULTS Ten studies comprising 1787 patients were used for meta-analysis. Compared with AISE-LAR, NOSE-LAR had more advantages in terms of overall postoperative complication (odds ratio (OR) = 0.65 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.90; P = 0.01)), incision-related complication (OR = 0.13 (95% CI, 0.05 to 0.35; P < 0.01)), distal resection edge (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 0.17 cm (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.33 cm; P = 0.02)), recovery of gastrointestinal function (WMD = - 0.38 day (95% CI, - 0.70 to - 0.06 day; P = 0.02 )), pain scores in postoperative day 1 (WMD = - 1.64 (95% CI, - 2.31 to - 0.98; P < 0.01)), additional analgesics usage (OR = 0.21 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.40; P < 0.01)) and hospital stay (WMD = - 0.71 day (95% CI, - 1.10 to - 0.32 day; P < 0.01)), while the operation time of NOSE-LAR was prolonged (WMD = 7.4 min (95% CI, 0.17 to 14.64 min; P = 0.04)). The anastomotic fistula, severe complication, lymph nodes harvested, proximal resection margin, intraoperative blood loss, and long-term outcomes in NOSE-LAR were comparable with AISE-LAR. CONCLUSIONS The safety of NOSE-LAR was demonstrated, and it could be an alternative to conventional surgery in laparoscopic anterior resection for sigmoid and rectal tumors.

The accuracy of laboratory diagnostic capacity for EBOV was assessed in 2014 to 2016 using a proficiency testing (PT) strategy developed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP) in Biosecurity. Following a literature search, EBOV-specific gene targets were ranked according to the frequency of their use in published methods. The most commonly used gene regions (nucleoprotein [NP], glycoprotein [GP], and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [L]) were selected for the design of in vitro RNA transcripts to be included in the simulated EBOV specimens used for EBOV detection with PCR-based assays. Specimens were tested for stability and found to be stable on long-term storage (1 year) at -80°C and on shorter-term storage in lyophilized form (1 week at ambient temperature and a subsequent week at -80°C). These specimens were used in three EBOV PTs offered from April 2014 to March 2016. In the first and third PTs, all laboratories (3/3 and 9/9, respectively) correctly identified specimens containing EBOV RNA transcripts, while in the second PT, all but one laboratory (5/6) correctly confirmed the presence of EBOV. The EBOV PT panel was useful for ensuring the competency of laboratories in detecting EBOV in the absence of readily available clinical samples. The simulated EBOV specimen was safe, stable, and reliable and can be used in lyophilized form for future EBOV PT programs, allowing simplicity of transport.","Lau, Katherine A; Theis, Torsten; Gray, Joanna; Rawlinson, William D",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02173-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27974537/,91
94093,Paper currency harbors antibiotic resistant coliform bacteria and integron integrase.,2020-09-23,"INTRODUCTION During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of laparoscopy has been discouraged by the Intercollegiate General Surgery because of its potential for aerosol generation and infection. In contrast, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons and the European Association of Endoscopic Surgery recommend continuing to use laparoscopy but with devices to filter released CO2 aerosol particles. However, commercially available systems are costly and may not be readily available. Herein, we describe a custom-made system to safely remove surgical smoke and CO2, as well as a case of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in which we used it. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE The patient had had multiple episodes of biliary pancreatitis and required urgent cholecystectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although India was in complete lockdown, it was decided to operate with precaution. A system was designed using underwater seal chest tube drainage and an electrostatic membrane filter with a viral retention function greater than 99.99%. The system was connected to an extra port for continuous controlled egression of CO2 pneumoperitoneum. A regular four-port cholecystectomy was performed at an intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mm Hg. The gas flow rate was 10 L/min. CO2 for pneumoperitoneum, surgical aerosol, and effluents passed through the system before collecting in the suction apparatus. The exchange of operating instruments through the ports was kept to a minimum. It was done after the abdomen was temporarily desufflated using this system. DISCUSSION The system we designed appears safe and is cost-effective. In resource-limited settings, it will be handy in patients requiring laparoscopic surgery both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bhattacharjee, Hemanga K; Chaliyadan, Shafneed; Verma, Eshan; Ramachandran, Rashmi; Makharia, Govind; Parshad, Rajinder",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32808489/,91

The risk of infection and the associated restrictions introduced to reduce the spread of the virus have also impacted help-seeking behaviours. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether there was a difference during the COVID-19 pandemic in the treated incidence of psychotic disorders and rates of admission to hospital for psychosis (including involuntary admission). METHODS Incident cases of first-episode psychosis in young people, aged 15 to 24, at an early intervention service in Melbourne from an 8-month period before the pandemic were compared with rates during the pandemic. Hospital admission rates for these periods were also compared. RESULTS Before the pandemic, the annual incidence of first-episode psychosis was 104.5 cases per 100,000 at-risk population, and during the pandemic it was 121.9 (incidence rate ratio = 1.14, 95% confidence interval = [0.92, 1.42], p = 0.24). Immediately after the implementation of restrictions, there was a non-significant reduction in the treated incidence (incidence rate ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval = [0.58, 1.09]), which was followed by a significant increase in the treated incidence in later months (incidence rate ratio = 1.94, 95% confidence interval = [1.52, 2.49]; incidence rate ratio = 1.64, 95% confidence interval = [1.25, 2.16]). Before the pandemic, 37.3% of young people with first-episode psychosis were admitted to hospital, compared to 61.7% during the pandemic (odds ratio = 2.71, 95% confidence interval = [1.73, 4.24]). Concerning the legal status of the admissions, before the pandemic, 27.3% were admitted involuntarily to hospital, compared to 42.5% during the pandemic (odds ratio = 1.97, 95% confidence interval = [1.23, 3.14]). CONCLUSION There was a mild increase, which did not reach statistical significance, in the overall incidence of first-episode psychosis; however, the pattern of presentations changed significantly, with nearly twice as many cases presenting in the later months of the restrictions. There was a significant increase in both voluntary and involuntary admissions, and the possible explanations for these findings are discussed.","O'Donoghue, Brian; Collett, Hannah; Boyd, Sophie; Zhou, Yuanna; Castagnini, Emily; Brown, Ellie; Street, Rebekah; Nelson, Barnaby; Thompson, Andrew; McGorry, Patrick",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674211053578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651504/,91
94315,A schlieren optical study of the human cough with and without wearing masks for aerosol infection control.,2009,"BACKGROUND The opioid epidemic continues to generate a significant mental and physical health burden on patients, and claims the life of almost 150 Americans daily. Making matters worse, an increase in relapses and/or opioid-related deaths has been reported in more than 40 U.S. states since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Opioid use disorder (OUD) is one of the single most expensive disorders in the United States, generating average medical costs of $60B from just 2M Americans diagnosed with the disorder. In commercial use since 2019, reSET-O is a non-drug, prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) that delivers evidence-based neurobehavioral treatment for OUD and helps overcome the barriers associated with access to care, stigma, and social distancing. Although shown to be cost effective and efficacious in clinical trials and real-world evidence studies, respectively, information on its value for money from a health utilities and cost per quality-adjusted life-year is needed to inform policy discussions. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of reSET-O on health utilities and assess its overall cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained vs. treatment-as-usual (TAU). METHODS Decision analytic model comparing reSET-O plus TAU to TAU alone (i.e., buprenorphine, face-to-face counseling, and contingency management) over 12 weeks. Clinical effectiveness data (abstinence and health utility) were obtained from a clinical trial, and resource utilization and cost data were adapted from a recent claims data analysis to reflect less frequent face-to-face counseling with the therapeutic. RESULTS The addition of reSET-O to TAU decreases total health care costs by -$131 and resulted in post-treatment utility values within population norms, with a corresponding gain of 0.003 QALYs. reSET-O when used adjunctively to TAU was economically dominant (less costly, more effective) vs. TAU alone. CONCLUSION reSET-O is an economically-dominant adjunctive treatment for OUD and is associated with an overall reduction in total incremental cost vs TAU.","Velez, Fulton F; Luderer, Hilary F; Gerwien, Robert; Parcher, Benjamin; Mezzio, Dylan; Malone, Daniel C",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2021.1884471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33593201/,91

94653,SNP-mediated disruption of CTCF binding at the IFITM3 promoter is associated with risk of severe influenza in humans.,2017,"OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to compare the peri-operative outcomes of single port access (SPA) laparoscopic adnexal surgery and conventional laparoscopic adnexal surgery. STUDY DESIGN This is a retrospective case-control study matched by body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)). A single surgeon (T-JK) performed 17 SPA laparoscopic adnexal surgeries (cases) consecutively between December 2008 and March 2009; 34 conventional laparoscopic adnexal surgeries (controls) were performed by another surgeon who had similar surgical skill at our hospital during the same time period. Data on the SPA laparoscopic adnexal surgery cases were collected prospectively into our data registry after Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and we reviewed the data on the controls from the electronic medical records with IRB approval. RESULTS In both groups all procedures were performed without failure. Among preoperative baseline characteristics there was no difference between the two groups including preoperative size of ovarian tumor and bilaterality. The pathology findings were similar; a mature cystic teratoma was the most common pathological feature in both groups. The two groups were comparable with regard to operative outcomes according the surgery type. There were no differences between SPA and conventional groups in median operation time (64 min vs. 57.5 min, p=0.252), the number of patients that requested additional parenteral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (7 patients vs. 19 patients, p=0.597), and the absolute decrease (1.3mg/dl vs. 1.1mg/dl, p=0.640) from preoperative hemoglobin to postoperative day 1 measurements. No patient from either cohort required a blood transfusion. There were no complications in either group including umbilical incision complications in the SPA group. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated that SPA laparoscopic adnexal surgery had comparable operative outcomes to conventional laparoscopic adnexal surgery. A prospective comparison is needed for confirmation and to define the role of SPA in gynecological adnexal surgery.","Lee, Yoo-Young; Kim, Tae-Joong; Kim, Chul-Jung; Park, Hwang Shin; Choi, Chel Hun; Lee, Jeong-Won; Lee, Je-ho; Bae, Duk-Soo; Kim, Byoung-Gie","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2010.03.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20392556/,91

95084,The 10th anniversary of the world primary immunodeficiency week: A J Project celebration.,2021-08-26,"OBJECTIVES The purposes of this study were to describe the clinical characteristics of febrile infants younger than 90 days with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, to investigate the prevalence of serious bacterial infections (SBIs) in these infants, and to compare the risk of SBI in SARS-CoV-2-positive febrile infants with sex- and age-matched SARS-CoV- 2-negative febrile infants. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study conducted from March to November 2020 in a tertiary children's hospital. Patients were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes and included if age was younger than 90 days, a SARS-CoV-2 test was performed, and at least 1 bacterial culture was collected. Positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were age- and sex-matched to negative controls for analysis. Serious bacterial infection was defined as a urinary tract infection, bacterial enteritis, bacteremia, and/or bacterial meningitis. RESULTS Fifty-three SARS-CoV-2-positive infants were identified with a higher rate of respiratory symptoms and lower white blood cell and C-reactive protein values than their SARS-CoV-2 matched controls. The rate of SBI in the SARS-CoV-2-positive infants was 8% compared with 34% in the controls; the most common infections were urinary tract infections (6% vs 23%). There were no cases of bacteremia or bacterial meningitis in the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) infants and 2 (4%) cases of bacteremia in the controls. The relative risk of any SBI between the 2 groups was 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.6; P ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that febrile infants younger than 90 days with COVID-19 have lower rates of SBI than their matched SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. These data are consistent with previous studies describing lower risks of SBI in febrile infants with concomitant viral respiratory tract infections.","Payson, Alison; Etinger, Veronica; Napky, Pablo; Montarroyos, Stephanie; Ruiz-Castaneda, Ana; Mestre, Marcos",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000002380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780408/,91
95591,Quantum entanglement maintained by virtual excitations in an ultrastrongly-coupled-oscillator system.,2020-07-28,"Objective Recently, there have been several studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, these studies have mainly been concentrated in Wuhan, China; the sample sizes of each article were different; and the reported clinical characteristics, especially blood biochemical indices, were quite different. This study aimed to summarize the blood biochemistry characteristics of COVID-19 patients by performing a systemic review and meta-analysis of published studies. Methods Comprehensive studies were screened from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library through March 11, 2020. The inclusion criteria included studies investigating the biochemical indexes of patients with COVID-19. The statistical software R3.6.3 was used for meta-analysis. Results Ten studies including 1745 COVID-19 patients met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that 16% and 20% of patients with COVID-19 had alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels higher than the normal range, respectively. Thirty-four percent of patients showed albumin (ALB) levels lower than the normal range, and 6% of patients showed abnormal total bilirubin (TBil) levels. The levels of creatinine (CRE) were increased in 8% of patients. The creatine kinase (CK) level of 13% of patients exceeded the normal range, and 52% of patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In addition, six studies met the inclusion criteria for the systemic review evaluating the relevance between LDH levels and the severity of COVID-19, and all six studies showed a positive association between these two factors. Conclusions Some patients with COVID-19 had different degrees of blood biochemical abnormalities, which might indicate multiple organ dysfunction. Some biochemical indexes, such as abnormal ALB and LDH, could reflect the severity of the disease to a certain extent. These blood biochemical indicators should be considered in the clinical management of the disease.","Deng, Xiaoling; Liu, Beibei; Li, Jiahuan; Zhang, Junli; Zhao, Yajuan; Xu, Keshu",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32554832/,91

In both cases, ophthalmic examination revealed the need for enucleation or exenteration. In case 1, systemic coccidioidomycosis was diagnosed with panuveitis and secondary glaucoma of the left eye. In this case, the parotid duct was ligated at the time of enucleation to stop salivary secretions. This dog encountered morbidity in the form of a sialocele that did not resolve for 11 months. In case 2, ultrasound and computed tomography revealed a discrete mass within the left medial orbit that was suspected to arise from the nictitating membrane. A combination of exenteration and parotid duct transposition reversal was performed to avoid morbidity associated with ligation of the parotid duct. The dog encountered no complications from this novel procedure. This case report represents the first report of re-routing a transposed parotid duct from the ventral conjunctival sac back to the mouth at the time of enucleation or exenteration in the dog.","Young, Whitney M; Betbeze, Caroline M; Fisher, Stephen C; Boulay, James P",Veterinary ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1111/vop.12497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28845574/,91

However, there are few reports describing clinical characteristics in less severely affected populations. METHODS We conducted a retrospective observational study from January 2010 to December 2015 in Yamagata, Japan. Using regional passive surveillance, 5794 respiratory specimens were collected from children who initially presented to an outpatient clinic with acute respiratory symptoms. The collected samples were tested for EV-D68 by reverse transcription PCR. RESULTS EV-D68 was detected in 79 specimens mainly during the two epidemic periods in August-October 2010 and August-October 2015, when detection rates were 10.2% (31 of 304 specimens) and 16.3% (46 of 282 specimens), respectively. Among the 69 EV-D68-positive children, excluding those with viral coinfection, 39 (57%) had upper respiratory tract infections, 23 (33%) bronchiolitis or asthma attack, 5 (7%) bronchitis, 1 (1%) meningitis and 1 (1%) acute flaccid paralysis. In 23 children with wheezing, retraction was observed in 10 (43%), and six (26%) were diagnosed with asthma exacerbation. Six children required hospital admission, five (83%) because of asthma exacerbation. A history of asthma or wheezing was the most significant risk factor for the development of wheezing (odds ratio, 8.23; 95% CI, 2.65-25.50; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS The low rate of hospitalization (9%, 6 of 69) indicates that most cases with EV-D68 infection were managed as outpatients. A history of asthma or wheezing was a potential risk factor for wheezing, resulting in hospitalization due to a severe asthma attack.","Itagaki, Tsutomu; Aoki, Yoko; Matoba, Yohei; Tanaka, Shizuka; Ikeda, Tatsuya; Mizuta, Katsumi; Matsuzaki, Yoko",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2017.1400176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29119851/,91
97196,Regional quantitative analysis of small animal myocardial sympathetic innervation and initial application in streptozotocin induced diabetes.,2009,"Background Numerous factors may influence academic performance and success in undergraduate physiotherapy programmes. Understanding these factors could assist with student selection and design of support structures. Objectives The objective of our study was to explore the amount of variance explained by the National Benchmark Test (NBT) and the National Senior Certificate (NSC) in passing the first year of study and to explore the association between the NBT performance bands and first-year progression outcome. Method The sample comprised 2013-2017 student cohorts. Hierarchical regression models were used to explore significant predictors for academic success in the first year of study. The chi-square test was used to assess the association between the NBT performance bands and the categorised progression outcome. Results The NBT domains explained 22% of the variance, R 2 = 0.229, F (3, 212) = 20.97, p = 0.000. The four NSC subjects accounted for 20% of the variance. All seven predicting variables contributed to 43% of the variance in the first year of study, R 2 = 0.435, F (7, 208) = 27.29, p = 0.000. Associations between NBT domains and GPA: quantitative literacy (Φ = 0.27; p < 0.000); academic literacy (Φ = 0.22; p < 0.000); mathematics (Φ = 0.18; p = 0.014). Conclusion Academic success is associated with academic factors as measured by the NBT and physical sciences matriculation results.

97275,Reduced Neuromuscular Performance in Night Shift Orthopedic Nurses: New Insights From a Combined Electromyographic and Force Signals Approach.,2020,"Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) are found inside the cellular niche at the tip of the ovary. They undergo asymmetric divisions to renew the stem cell lineage and to produce sibling cystoblasts that will in turn enter differentiation. GSCs and cystoblasts contain spectrosomes, membranous structures essential to orientate the mitotic spindle and that, particularly in GSCs, change shape depending on the cell cycle phase. Using live imaging and a GFP fusion of the spectrosome component Par-1, we follow the complete spectrosome cycle throughout GSC division and quantify the relative duration of the different spectrosome shapes. We also determine that the Par-1 kinase shuttles between the spectrosome and the cytoplasm during mitosis and observe the continuous addition of new material to the GSC and cystoblast spectrosomes. Next, we utilise the Fly-FUCCI tool to define in live and fixed tissues that GSCs have a shorter G1 compared to the G2 phase. The observation of centrosomes in dividing GSCs allowed us to determine that centrosomes separate very early in G1, prior to centriole duplication. Furthermore, we show that the anterior centrosome associates with the spectrosome only during mitosis and that, upon mitotic spindle assembly, it translocates to the cell cortex, where it remains anchored until centrosome separation. Finally, we demonstrate that the asymmetric division of GSCs is not an intrinsic property of these cells, since the spectrosome of GSC-like cells located outside of the niche can divide symmetrically. Thus, GSCs display unique properties during division, a behaviour influenced by the surrounding niche.","Villa-Fombuena, Gema; Lobo-Pecellín, María; Marín-Menguiano, Miriam; Rojas-Ríos, Patricia; González-Reyes, Acaimo",Development,https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.199716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370012/,91
97465,Analysis of inter-system variability of systolic and diastolic intraventricular pressure gradients derived from color Doppler M-mode echocardiography.,2020-04-28,"PURPOSE The COVID-19 outbreak rapidly became a public health emergency and led to radical changes in patient management. From the start of the pandemic, we used electronic medical record-assisted telephone follow-up (E-TFU) of cancer survivors (CS) to minimize hospital exposure. The aim of this prospective study was to assess how breast cancer survivors (bCSs) perceived E-TFU. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 15-item survey was e-mailed to bCSs who had been managed with E-TFU. The responses were measured using Likert-like scales and were correlated with the main characteristics of the bCS using Pearson's test. RESULTS One hundred thirty-seven of 343 bCSs (40%) completed the survey between March 9 and June 2, 2020. Their median age was 59 years. Although 80.3% of bCSs were satisfied with E-TFU, only 43.8% would like to have E-TFU in the future. A low educational level was correlated with higher COVID-19-related anxiety (P = .025). An older age (P = .002) and a low educational level (P < .0001) were correlated with the need to be accompanied to reach the hospital. A personal history of second cancer was inversely correlated with understanding medical advice (P = .015) and the expectation of feeling relief after a follow-up visit (P = .0027). Furthermore, pandemic phase II was correlated with satisfaction with E-TFU (P = .010). CONCLUSION E-TFU was an important means of avoiding hospital contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the majority of bCSs in the survey were satisfied with this procedure. Further studies are needed to investigate the implementation of telemedicine even outside an emergency situation.","Merz, Valeria; Ferro, Antonella; Piras, Enrico Maria; Zanutto, Alberto; Caffo, Orazio; Messina, Carlo",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.00643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351674/,91

97884,Using Genome Sequence to Enable the Design of Medicines and Chemical Probes.,2018,"BACKGROUND The sentinel node (SN) concept is safely applied and validated in early gastric cancer. Gastric lymph nodes are divided into five basins with the main gastric arteries, and the anterosuperior lymph nodes with the common hepatic artery (No. 8a) are classified in the right gastric artery (r-GA) basin. Although No. 8a are considered to have lymphatic flow from the r-GA basin, there might be additional multiple lymphatic flows into No. 8a. The aim of this study is to analyze the lymphatic flows to No. 8a and to investigate the clinical significance of No. 8a as a sentinel node (SN No. 8a). METHODS Four hundred and twenty-nine patients with cT1N0 or cT2N0 gastric cancer underwent SN mapping. We used technetium-99 tin colloid solution and blue dye as a tracer. RESULTS We detected SN No. 8a in 35 (8.2 %) patients. In these patients, we detected SN No. 8a with SNs that belonged to the left gastric artery (l-GA) basin (66 %), right gastroepiploic artery (r-GEA) basin (54 %), and right gastric artery (r-GA) basin (46 %). In addition, celiac artery lymph nodes were detected as SNs significantly more frequently. Function-preserving surgery was performed significantly less often in patients with SN No. 8a (p =0.018). CONCLUSIONS We found that SN No. 8a seemed to have lymphatic flow not only from the r-GA basin, but also from the l-GA basin or r-GEA basin. When SN No. 8a are detected, we should be careful to perform function-preserving surgery, even in SN-negative cases.","Shimada, Ayako; Takeuchi, Hiroya; Kamiya, Satoshi; Fukuda, Kazumasa; Nakamura, Rieko; Takahashi, Tsunehiro; Wada, Norihito; Kawakubo, Hirofumi; Saikawa, Yoshiro; Omori, Tai; Nakahara, Tadaki; Jinzaki, Masahiro; Murakami, Koji; Kitagawa, Yuko",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-015-0563-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26545881/,91

The fluid was chylous and revealed a very high triglyceride concentration (1,197 mg/dL). Total parenteral nutrition and administration of octreotide were performed, but the leakage did not improve. On the contrary, the drainage fluid gradually increased to 1,600 mL/day, and a laparoscopic fenestration was performed owing to a concern about the adverse effects of massive lymph loss. Ascites temporarily appeared but disappeared 3 months post fenestration. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of pelvic chyloretroperitoneum post living-donor transplantation.

99042,Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation of human primary visual cortex.,2016,"OBJECTIVES The law in Japan requires the declaration of a state of emergency and implementation of countermeasures for an epidemic of a new infectious disease. However, because a state of emergency has never been declared in Japan, its effects remain unknown. The required countermeasures are similar to those implemented in the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in Miyazaki in 2010. This study aimed to quantitatively estimate the effect of the declaration in 2010 and investigate the nature of the epidemic based on the day on which the declaration took effect. METHODS Only publicly available data were used. Data for farms in the most affected town were analyzed. A modified susceptible-infected-recovered model was used to estimate the effect and for the simulation. Another model was used to estimate the effective reproduction number. RESULTS After the declaration, the intra-bovine transmission rate decreased by 18.1 %, and there were few days when the effective reproduction number was >1.0. A few weeks delay in the declaration significantly increased the possibility of epidemic, number of farms at peak, and final infection scale. CONCLUSIONS Based on the substantial decrease in the transmission rate after the declaration of a state of emergency in 2010, a future declaration will have a similar effect for a new infectious disease even though a direct extrapolation is not valid. Although a declaration should be carefully considered owing to the potential socioeconomic effects, it is essential to prepare for the implementation given that a delay of only a few weeks should be acceptable.","Yamauchi, Takenori; Takeuchi, Shouhei; Horii, Yoichiro; Yamano, Yuko; Kuroda, Yoshiki; Nakadate, Toshio",Environmental health and preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12199-016-0517-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27032773/,91

High levels of uncarboxylated, dephosphorylated MGP have been associated with vascular calcification and are responsive to vitamin K treatment. In this systematic review, we summarize the available evidence examining whether vitamin K supplementation improves surrogate measures of cardiovascular disease including artery and valve calcification, atherosclerosis and artery stiffening. Data from controlled trials of adults were obtained by searching Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Web of Science Core Collection. We identified nine randomized controlled trials for review, including trials of vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 supplementation, that assessed a surrogate measure of cardiovascular disease including arterial calcification, atherosclerosis or arterial stiffening. For each trial, the risk of bias was assessed applying Cochrane Collaboration methodology. The findings indicate that vitamin K does not consistently prevent progression of calcification, atherosclerosis or arterial stiffness. There may be some benefit in people with calcification at study entry. Studies were heterogenous, with relatively short follow-up and outcome measures were varied. While vitamin K supplementation clearly improves the carboxylation of dephosphoylated MGP, its role in mitigating vascular calcification is uncertain, based on current evidence.","Vlasschaert, Caitlyn; Goss, Chloe J; Pilkey, Nathan G; McKeown, Sandra; Holden, Rachel M",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977548/,91

There were no significant differences in pain, discomfort, fatigue, satisfaction or quality of life between the two groups at the 1-year follow-up. Five patients (26 %) in the fibrin sealant group and one (6 %) in the tack group were diagnosed with a recurrence at the 1-year follow-up (p = 0.182) (overall recurrence rate 17 %). Hernia defects in patients with recurrence were significantly larger than in those without recurrence (median 4.0 vs. 2.8 cm, p = 0.009). CONCLUSION Patients with larger hernia defects and fibrin sealant mesh fixation had higher recurrence rates than expected, although the study was not powered for assessment of recurrence. There was no significant difference between groups in any parameters after the 1-year follow-up. The beneficial effects of mesh fixation with fibrin sealant on early outcome warrant further studies on optimization of the surgical technique to prevent recurrence.","Eriksen, J R; Bisgaard, T; Assaadzadeh, S; Jorgensen, L N; Rosenberg, J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-013-1101-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23657861/,91
100372,Tele-education assisted mentorship in surgery (TEAMS).,2021-08-01,"There are currently over 80 species of mosquito endemic in Canada-although only a few of these carry pathogens that can cause disease in humans. West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus and the California serogroup viruses (including the Jamestown Canyon and snowshoe hare viruses) are mosquito-borne viruses that have been found to cause human infections in North America, including in Canada. Over the last 20 years, the incidence of most of these endemic mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) has increased approximately 10% in Canada, due in large part to climate change. It is anticipated that both the mosquito lifecycle and virus transmission patterns will be affected by climate change, resulting in an increase in both the range and local abundance of several important mosquito species. Laboratory studies and mathematical modelling suggest that increased ambient temperatures, changes in precipitation and extreme weather events associated with climate change will likely continue to drive mosquito vector and MBD range expansion, increasing the duration of transmission seasons and leading to MBD-related epidemics. Furthermore, Canada's endemic MBDs have complex transmission cycles, involving multiple reservoir hosts (birds and mammals), multiple pathogens and multiple mosquito species-all of which may be sensitive to climate and other environmental changes, and making forecasting of potential emerging trends difficult. These expected climate-induced changes in mosquitoes and MBDs underline the need for continued (and expanded) surveillance and research to ensure timely and accurate evaluation of the risks to the public health of Canadians.","Ludwig, A; Zheng, H; Vrbova, L; Drebot, M A; Iranpour, M; Lindsay, L R",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v45i04a03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285698/,91

Some would argue that insulin's discovery by Banting, Best, Macleod, and Collip was the greatest scientific advance of the 20th century, being one of the first instances in which modern medical science was able to provide lifesaving therapy. As with all scientific discoveries, the work in Toronto built upon important advances of many researchers over the preceding decades. Furthermore, the Toronto work ushered in a century of discovery of the purification, isolation, structural characterization, and genetic sequencing of insulin, all of which influenced ongoing improvements in therapeutic insulin formulations. Here we discuss the body of knowledge prior to 1921 localizing insulin to the pancreas and establishing insulin's role in glucoregulation, and provide our views as to why researchers in Toronto ultimately achieved the purification of pancreatic extracts as a therapy. We discuss the pharmaceutical industry's role in the early days of insulin production and distribution and provide insights into why the discoverers chose not to profit financially from the discovery. This fascinating story of bench-to-beside discovery provides useful considerations for scientists now and in the future.","Lewis, Gary F; Brubaker, Patricia L",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci142239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393501/,91

101723,What Global-Before-Basic Trend? Commentary on Perceptually Based Approaches to Early Categorization.,2000-01-01,"PURPOSE To investigate the safety of facemasks worn by patients during intravitreal injections. METHODS A prospective, qualitative, interventional study performed in a tertiary university hospital. Healthy volunteers were asked to wear three different professional surgical facemasks while air leaks around the eyes were monitored. Three types of masks were investigated: A) surgical facemask with 4 tying strips, B) surgical facemask with elastic ear loops, and C) 2200 N95 TB particulate facemask. For each session the periocular area was inspected for air leak during normal respiration, speech, and deep respiration. Detection of air leak was performed using two professional thermal cameras: FLIR A310 -thermal camera; and EyeCGas 2.0 -super sensitive infrared camera used for detection of minute fugitive emissions of industrial gases. RESULTS Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. The experiment was repeated 45 times for each camera: three times, for each of three mask types, on five volunteers, for a total of 90 trials. Air jets were detected originating from the superior edges of the masks radiating towards the eyes in 81% (73/90) of cases in total; 71% (32/45) with the FLIR camera and 91% (41/45) with the OPGAL camera. Air leaks were detected with all investigated mask types. CONCLUSIONS Patients wearing facemasks during intravitreal injections may be at higher risk of endophthalmitis. Until further data is available, we recommend verifying proper facemask fitting and either taping the upper edges of the facemasks with medical adhesive tape or using adhesive surgical drape around the injected eye.","Hadayer, Amir; Zahavi, Alon; Livny, Eitan; Gal-Or, Orly; Gershoni, Assaf; Mimouni, Karin; Ehrlich, Rita",Retina,https://doi.org/10.1097/iae.0000000000002919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32701593/,91

103026,Surgical Technique: Endoscopic Endonasal Transphenoidal Resection of a Large Suprasellar Mixed Germ Cell Tumor.,2016,"Affibody molecules are a class of small (ca.7 kDa) robust scaffold proteins with high potential as tracers for radionuclide molecular imaging in vivo. Incorporation of a cysteine-containing peptide-based chelator at the C terminus provides an opportunity for stable labelling with the radionuclide (99m)Tc. The use of a GGGC chelator at the C terminus has provided the lowest renal radioactivity retention of the previously investigated peptide-based chelators. Previously, it has also been demonstrated that replacement of the His(6)-tag with the negatively charged histidine-glutamate-histidine-glutamate-histidine-glutamate (HEHEHE)-tag permits purification of affibody molecules by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) and provides low hepatic accumulation of radioactivity of conjugates site-specifically labelled at the C terminus using several different nuclides. We hypothesized that the combination of a HEHEHE-tag at the N terminus and a GGGC chelator at the C terminus of an affibody molecule would be a favourable format permitting IMAC purification and providing low uptake in excretory organs. To investigate this hypothesis, a (HE)(3)-Z(HER2:342)-GGGC affibody molecule was generated. It could be efficiently purified by IMAC and stably labelled with (99m)Tc. (99m)Tc-(HE)(3)-Z(HER2:342)-GGGC preserved specific binding to HER2-expressing cells. In NMRI mice, hepatic uptake of (99m)Tc-(HE)(3)-Z(HER2:342)-GGGC was lower than the uptake of the control affibody molecules, (99m)Tc-Z(HER2:2395)-VDC and (99m)Tc-Z(HER2:342)-GGGC. At 1 and 4 h after injection, the renal uptake of (99m)Tc-(HE)(3)-Z(HER2:342)-GGGC was 2-3-fold lower than uptake of (99m)Tc-Z(HER2:2395)-VDC, but it was substantially higher than uptake of (99m)Tc-Z(HER2:342)-GGGC. Further investigation indicated that a fraction of (99m)Tc was chelated by the HEHEHE-tag which caused a higher accumulation of radioactivity in the kidneys. Thus, a combination of a HEHEHE-tag and the GGGC chelator in targeting scaffold proteins was found to be undesirable in the case of (99m)Tc labelling due to a partial loss of site-specificity of nuclide chelation.","Lindberg, Hanna; Hofström, Camilla; Altai, Mohamed; Honorvar, Hadis; Wållberg, Helena; Orlova, Anna; Ståhl, Stefan; Gräslund, Torbjörn; Tolmachev, Vladimir",Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13277-011-0305-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22249974/,91
103058,Drainage of gastric intramural abscesses using lumen-apposing metal stents.,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND Obesity is the most frequent chronic metabolic disease globally. There is a direct correlation between increasing body mass index (BMI) and elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and triglycerides (Tg), and an inverse correlation with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL); all these lipid derangements are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Our aim was to evaluate lipid profiles in morbidly obese patients before and after one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) performed at a single-center during a 2-year follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective, observational and descriptive study was carried out, including morbidly obese patients with at least one lipid abnormality, who underwent laparoscopic OAGB. Lipid profiles were evaluated preoperatively and at different intervals during a 2-year follow-up. RESULTS A total of 150 patients were included (73 % females and 27 % males). Mean age was 45.83 ± 10.65 years, mean BMI was 42.82 kg/m2 ± 6.43, and mean weight was 116.23 kg ± 22.70; 2 years after surgery, the latter two decreased to 24.73 ± 4.43 (p < 0.001) and 67.34 ± 13.35 (p < 0.001), respectively, thus leading to a mean weight loss (WL) of 48.85 kg ± 15.64 and mean %excess WL of 71.87 ± 13.41. Tg, TC and LDL levels significantly decreased: 123.60 ± 56.34 versus 84.79 ± 33.67, 194.33 ± 43.90 versus 173.65 ± 34.84, and 124.47 ± 36.07 versus 97.36 ± 25.05, respectively (p < 0.001); HDL levels significantly increased: 43.61 ± 9.85 versus 61.56 ± 12.63 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION OAGB leads to substantial and durable WL in morbidly obese patients after a 2-year follow-up. Postoperative lipid profiles significantly improved; these changes translate into theoretical relevant cardiovascular risk benefits.","Carbajo, Miguel A; Fong-Hirales, Arlett; Luque-de-León, Enrique; Molina-Lopez, Juan Francisco; Ortiz-de-Solórzano, Javier",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-4990-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27317038/,91
103282,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa: arsenal of resistance mechanisms, decades of changing resistance profiles, and future antimicrobial therapies.",2015,"PURPOSE In peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), the maximum activity dose that can safely be administered is limited by high renal uptake and retention of radiolabelled peptides. The kidney radiation dose can be reduced by coinfusion of agents that competitively inhibit the reabsorption of radiolabelled peptides, such as positively charged amino acids, Gelofusine, or trypsinised albumin. The aim of this study was to identify more specific and potent inhibitors of the kidney reabsorption of radiolabelled peptides, based on albumin. METHODS Albumin was fragmented using cyanogen bromide and six albumin-derived peptides with different numbers of electric charges were selected and synthesised. The effect of albumin fragments (FRALB-C) and selected albumin-derived peptides on the internalisation of (111)In-albumin, (111)In-minigastrin, (111)In-exendin and (111)In-octreotide by megalin-expressing cells was assessed. In rats, the effect of Gelofusine and albumin-derived peptides on the renal uptake and biodistribution of (111)In-minigastrin, (111)In-exendin and (111)In-octreotide was determined. RESULTS FRALB-C significantly reduced the uptake of all radiolabelled peptides in vitro. The albumin-derived peptides showed different potencies in reducing the uptake of (111)In-albumin, (111)In-exendin and (111)In-minigastrin in vitro. The most efficient albumin-derived peptide (peptide #6), was selected for in vivo testing. In rats, 5 mg of peptide #6 very efficiently inhibited the renal uptake of (111)In-minigastrin, by 88%. Uptake of (111)In-exendin and (111)In-octreotide was reduced by 26 and 33%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The albumin-derived peptide #6 efficiently inhibited the renal reabsorption of (111)In-minigastrin, (111)In-exendin and (111)In-octreotide and is a promising candidate for kidney protection in PRRT.","Vegt, Erik; Eek, Annemarie; Oyen, Wim J G; de Jong, Marion; Gotthardt, Martin; Boerman, Otto C",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-009-1239-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19722105/,91

We describe the pathologic, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and molecular findings in 2 horses and 1 donkey that succumbed to natural infection with ECoV. One horse and the donkey (case Nos. 1, 3) had severe diffuse necrotizing enteritis with marked villous attenuation, epithelial cell necrosis at the tips of the villi, neutrophilic and fibrinous extravasation into the small intestinal lumen (pseudomembrane formation), as well as crypt necrosis, microthrombosis, and hemorrhage. The other horse (case No. 2) had hyperammonemic encephalopathy with Alzheimer type II astrocytosis throughout the cerebral cortex. ECoV was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in small intestinal tissue, contents, and/or feces, and coronavirus antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry in the small intestine in all cases. Coronavirus-like particles characterized by spherical, moderately electron lucent, enveloped virions with distinct peplomer-like structures projecting from the surface were detected by negatively stained transmission electron microscopy in small intestine in case No. 1, and transmission electron microscopy of fixed small intestinal tissue from the same case revealed similar 85- to 100-nm intracytoplasmic particles located in vacuoles and free in the cytoplasm of unidentified (presumably epithelial) cells. Sequence comparison showed 97.9% to 99.0% sequence identity with the ECoV-NC99 and Tokachi09 strains. All together, these results indicate that ECoV is associated with necrotizing enteritis and hyperammonemic encephalopathy in equids.","Giannitti, F; Diab, S; Mete, A; Stanton, J B; Fielding, L; Crossley, B; Sverlow, K; Fish, S; Mapes, S; Scott, L; Pusterla, N",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985814568683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25648965/,91

There is particular controversy over the importance of aerosol transmission and whether airborne precautions should be recommended for some respiratory viruses. Here, we review the current recommendations of transmission-based precautions and the latest evidence on the aerosol transmission of respiratory viruses. RECENT FINDINGS Viral nucleic acids, and in some instances viable viruses, have been detected in aerosols in the air in healthcare settings for some respiratory viruses such as seasonal and avian influenza viruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus. However, current evidences are yet to demonstrate that these viruses can effectively spread via airborne route between individuals, or whether preventive measures in airborne precautions would be effective. SUMMARY Studies that use transmission events as outcome to demonstrate human-to-human transmission over the aerosol route or quantitative measurement of infectious respiratory viruses in the air are needed to evaluate the infectiousness of respiratory viruses over the aerosol route. When a respiratory virus in concern only leads to disease with low severity, airborne precautions are not likely to be justified.","Shiu, Eunice Y C; Leung, Nancy H L; Cowling, Benjamin J",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31259864/,91

Present study design to determine the diagnostic value of LUS in the evaluation of children with COVID-19. METHOD AND OBJECTIVES Prospective multi-center study, 40 children with confirmed COVID-19 were included. LUS was performed to all patients at admission. The chest X-ray and CT were performed according to the decision of the primary physicians. LUS results were compared with chest X-ray and CT findings and diagnostic performance was determined. RESULTS Of the 40 children median (range) was 10.5 (0.4-17.8) years. Chest X-ray and LUS were performed on all and chest CT was performed on 28 (70%) patients at the time of diagnosis. Sixteen (40%) patients had no apparent chest CT abnormalities suggestive of COVID-19, whereas 12 (30%) had abnormalities. LUS confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary involvement in 10 out of 12 patients with positive CT findings. LUS demonstrated normal lung patterns among 15 patients out of 16 who had normal CT features. The sensitivity and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) identified by the chest X-ray and LUS tests were compared and statistically significantly different (McNemar's test: p-value 0.016 and 0.001 respectively) detected. Chest X-ray displayed false-negative results for pulmonary involvement in 75% whereas for LUS it was 16.7%. CONCLUSIONS LUS might be a useful tool in the diagnostic steps of children with COVID-19.

104910,Current understandings of the impact of mandatory vaccination laws in Europe.,2021-04-26,"Human communities living near nonhuman primate habitats often depend on wood from forests for their energy needs. Improving the efficiency of local cook stoves is a potential ""win-win"" solution that is commonly promoted to protect forests and improve human health and development. Despite the popularity of improved stove projects in primate conservation, few outcomes have been formally published. As a result, it is currently unclear whether this approach is a wise investment of limited conservation funds. This paper describes a pilot study conducted by the Gorilla Rehabilitation and Conservation Education Center to evaluate the potential for using improved stoves for the conservation of an important habitat for Grauer's gorillas and chimpanzees in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Community surveys and observations of human forest use revealed a heavy local reliance on forest-derived wood. Wood was the main source of fuel used in households, the most highly valued forest resource, and the primary resource extracted during forest observations. It was primarily collected by women and children. The use of traditional, inefficient three-stone hearths for cooking was also widespread. A 2-year campaign using a community-based social marketing approach resulted in an increase in improved stove installations from 18% to 78% of households in one village. After stove adoption, weekly household wood consumption was reduced by half. Campaign elements that showed promise include promotion using women's networks and intensive follow-up assessment and support. We conclude that, if scaled up, improved stoves may be a useful strategy for reducing encroachment into our target protected area but that successful implementation will require a significant long-term commitment with evaluation and oversight. It is recommended that before investing in improved stoves, primate conservation projects take long-term and evaluation requirements into consideration.","Kahlenberg, Sonya M; Bettinger, Tammie; Masumbuko, Honoré K; Basyanirya, Gracianne K; Guy, Simisi M; Katsongo, Jonathan K; Kocanjer, Nadine; Warfield, Laurie; Mbeke, Jackson K",American journal of primatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.23218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33232524/,91

People are all generally susceptible to the virus. The average incubation period was 5.2 days, and the basic reproductive number R(0) was 2.2 at the onset of the outbreak. Most NCP patients were clinically mild cases. The case fatality rate was 2.38%, and elderly men with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of death. Strategies for prevention and control of NCP include improving epidemic surveillance, quarantining the source of infection, speeding up the diagnosis of suspected cases, optimizing the management of close contacts, tightening prevention and control of cluster outbreaks and hospital infection, preventing possible rebound of the epidemic after people return to work from the Chinese Spring Festival holiday, and strengthening community prevention and control.",,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2020.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32057211/,91

105235,Advances in microfluidic in vitro systems for neurological disease modeling.,2021-02-13,"Recently, it was confirmed that ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing the recent outbreak of severe pneumonia around the world. It is confused that ACE2 is widely expressed across a variety of organs and is expressed moderately but not highly in lung, which, however, is the major infected organ. Therefore, we hypothesized that there could be some other genes playing key roles in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. Here we found that AGTR2 (angiotensin II receptor type 2), a G-protein coupled receptor, has interaction with ACE2 and is highly expressed in lung with a high tissue specificity. More importantly, simulation of 3D structure based protein-protein interaction reveals that AGTR2 shows a higher binding affinity with the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 than ACE2 (energy: -8.2 vs. -5.1 [kcal/mol]). A number of compounds, biologics and traditional Chinese medicine that could decrease the expression level of AGTR2 were predicted. Finally, we suggest that AGTR2 could be a putative novel gene for the the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, which could provide different insight for the research of SARS-COV-2 proteins with their receptors.","Cui, Chunmei; Huang, Chuanbo; Zhou, Wanlu; Ji, Xiangwen; Zhang, Fenghong; Wang, Liang; Zhou, Yuan; Cui, Qinghua",IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcbb.2020.3009099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32750889/,91

OBJECTIVE To better understand the clinical, imaging, and procedural predictors of successful recanalization and clinical outcomes in this population of patients. METHODS We performed a multicenter retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with acute MCA M2 segment occlusion who underwent thrombectomy with stent retrievers or primary aspiration thrombectomy (including A Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique approach). We correlated clinical and radiographic outcomes with demographic, clinical, and technical characteristics. RESULTS One hundred and seventeen patients were included in analysis (median admission National Institutes of Health stroke scale [NIHSS] score 15, mean age 67.0 ± 14.5, 42% females). Good clinical outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin scale [mRS] ≤ 2) was achieved in 56% of patients. Treatment beyond 6 h of symptoms onset (P = .69, OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.38-1.73) and age over 80 (P = .47, OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.25-1.70) were not predictive of poor outcome. NIHSS > 15 was a strong predictor of clinical outcome, based on mRS distribution at 3 months (P = .0085, OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.74). Direct aspiration and primary stent retriever thrombectomy approaches showed similar radiographic and clinical success rates. CONCLUSION Advanced age and time to treatment beyond 6 h from symptom onset were not predictive of clinical outcome with thrombectomy. NIHSS score above 15 was a strong predictor of outcome. Direct aspiration and primary stent retriever thrombectomy showed similar efficacy.","Mokin, Maxim; Primiani, Christopher T; Ren, Zeguang; Kan, Peter; Duckworth, Edward; Turner, Raymond D; Turk, Aquilla S; Fargen, Kyle M; Dabus, Guilherme; Linfante, Italo; Dumont, Travis M; Brasiliense, Leonardo B C; Shallwani, Hussain; Snyder, Kenneth V; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyx060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328002/,91

This article comprehensively reviews studies reporting ADHD-related incremental (excess) costs for children/adolescents and adults and presents estimates of annual national incremental costs of ADHD. METHOD A systematic search for primary United States-based studies published from January 1, 1990 through June 30, 2011 on costs of children/adolescents and adults with ADHD and their family members was conducted. Only studies in which mean annual incremental costs per individual with ADHD above non-ADHD controls were reported or could be derived were included. Per-person incremental costs were adjusted to 2010 U.S. dollars and converted to annual national incremental costs of ADHD based on 2010 U.S. Census population estimates, ADHD prevalence rates, number of household members, and employment rates by age group. RESULTS Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall national annual incremental costs of ADHD ranged from $143 to $266 billion (B). Most of these costs were incurred by adults ($105 B-$194 B) compared with children/adolescents ($38 B-$72 B). For adults, the largest cost category was productivity and income losses ($87 B-$138 B). For children, the largest cost categories were health care ($21 B-$44 B) and education ($15 B-$25 B). Spillover costs borne by the family members of individuals with ADHD were also substantial ($33 B-$43 B). CONCLUSION Despite a wide range in the magnitude of the cost estimates, this study indicates that ADHD has a substantial economic impact in the United States. Implications of these findings and future directions for research are discussed.","Doshi, Jalpa A; Hodgkins, Paul; Kahle, Jennifer; Sikirica, Vanja; Cangelosi, Michael J; Setyawan, Juliana; Erder, M Haim; Neumann, Peter J",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2012.07.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23021476/,91

Although most triage policies in the USA have seemingly converged on the use of clinical need and benefit as primary criteria for prioritisation, significant differences exist between institutions in how to assign priority to patients with identical medical prognoses: the so-called 'tie-breaker' situations. In particular, one's status as a frontline healthcare worker (HCW) has been a proposed criterion for prioritisation in the event of a tie. This article outlines two major grounds for reconsidering HCW prioritisation. The first recognises trust as an indispensable element of clinical care and mistrust as a hindrance to any public health strategy against the virus, thus raising concerns about the outward appearance of favouritism. The second considers the ways in which proponents of HCW prioritisation deviate from the very 'ethics frameworks' that often preface triage policies and serve to guide resource allocation-a rhetorical strategy that may undermine the very ethical foundations on which triage policies stand. By appealing to trust and consistency, we re-examine existing arguments in favour of HCW prioritisation and provide a more tenable justification for adjudicating on tie-breaker events during crisis standards of care.","Cheung, Alexander T M; Parent, Brendan",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106381/,91

We use epilepsy to exemplify how care for patients will be affected, and suggest ways in which healthcare systems can respond to deliver the most effective care. Where face-to-face outpatient appointments have been cancelled, telemedicine can facilitate remote clinical consultations for new and follow-up epilepsy clinic patients while reducing the risk of infection to both patients and healthcare staff. First-seizure patients will need investigation pathways rationalised, while those with chronic epilepsy will need to have reliable alternative avenues to access clinical advice. At the same time, neurologists should support emergency departments and acute medical units, advising on appropriate management of seizures and other acute neurological presentations. Ultimately, the revolution in our clinical practice is unlikely to cease after this pandemic, with reconfiguration of services likely to bring improvements in efficiency and convenience, and a reduced environmental impact.","Adan, Guleed H; Mitchell, James W; Marson, Tony",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32518102/,91

METHODS Sequential Ct data from COVID-19 nasal pharyngeal (NP) RT-PCR testing in all COVID-19 positive HCWs at a single institution. Analysis of Ct in relation to time until negative testing for RTW clearance. RESULTS Data for 12 employees showed that time elapsed until RT-PCR test-based RTW clearance ranged from 7 to 57 days (median, 34.5 days). Lower initial Ct correlated with the total time elapsed until clearance (r = -0.80; p= 0.002). CONCLUSION Considering the RT-PCR Ct, which correlates with the estimated viral load, may help inform RTW planning and decision making beyond solely relying on dichotomized positive/negative results.","Domeracki, Sandra; Clapp, Robert N; Taylor, Kristopher; Lu, Chuanyi M; Lampiris, Harry; Blanc, Paul D",Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/jom.0000000000001996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804748/,91

However, IFN is detectable in serum during acute infection in vivo for ∼5-7 d, which correlates with a period of leucopoenia and immunosuppression. In this study, we demonstrate that a highly enriched population of bovine plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) produced IFN in response to BVDV in vitro. We further show that the majority of the IFN produced in response to infection both in vitro and in vivo is type III IFN and acid labile. Further, we show IL-28B (IFN-λ3) mRNA is induced in this cell population in vitro. Supernatant from plasmacytoid DCs harvested postinfection with BVDV or recombinant bovine IFN-α or human IL-28B significantly reduced CD4(+) T cell proliferation induced by tubercle bacillus Ag 85-stimulated monocyte-derived DCs. Furthermore, these IFNs induced IFN-stimulated gene expression predominantly in monocyte-derived DCs. IFN-treated immature DCs derived from murine bone marrow also had a reduced capacity to stimulate T cell proliferative responses to tubercle bacillus Ag 85. Immature DCs derived from either source had a reduced capacity for Ag uptake following IFN treatment that is dose dependent. Immunosuppression is a feature of a number of pestivirus infections; our studies suggest type III IFN production plays a key role in the pathogenesis of this family of viruses. Overall, in a natural host, we have demonstrated a link between the induction of type I and III IFN after acute viral infection and transient immunosuppression.","Reid, Elizabeth; Juleff, Nicholas; Windsor, Miriam; Gubbins, Simon; Roberts, Lisa; Morgan, Sophie; Meyers, Gregor; Perez-Martin, Eva; Tchilian, Elma; Charleston, Bryan; Seago, Julian",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1600049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27053760/,91

There are conflicting data on sICH risk related to lipid levels and use of lipid-lowering medications. We evaluated whether there are associations between lipid levels, lipid-lowering medications, and sICH in Get With the Guidelines-Stroke. METHODS We identified acute ischemic stroke patients in the Get With the Guidelines-Stroke data set who were treated with IV tissue plasminogen activator between April 2003 and September 2009 and had complete data on lipid profiles and complications. Potential predictors of sICH were tested in univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS The analysis included 22 216 IV tissue plasminogen activator-treated acute ischemic stroke patients. Overall, 1104 (4.97%) experienced sICH (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke definition). In univariate analysis, patients with sICH were more often taking antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and diabetes mellitus medications. There was no relationship between low density lipoprotein or total cholesterol and sICH in univariate analysis. However, the risk of sICH increased with higher high density lipoprotein, 6.1% in Q4 versus 4.7% in Q1, P=0.0013; and lower triglyceride levels, 5.9% in Q1 versus 4.2% in Q4, P<0.0001. In multivariable models, although the high density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels were modestly associated with sICH, low density lipoprotein and total cholesterol were not. Lipid-lowering medications were not independently associated with sICH. CONCLUSIONS We found that low density lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels are not associated with risk of sICH after tissue plasminogen activator, although higher high density lipoprotein and lower triglyceride levels were modest risk factors. Lipid-lowering medications are not associated with risk of sICH.","Messé, Steven R; Pervez, Muhammad A; Smith, Eric E; Siddique, Khawaja A; Hellkamp, Anne S; Saver, Jeffrey L; Bhatt, Deepak L; Fonarow, Gregg C; Peterson, Eric D; Schwamm, Lee H",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.111.671966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23493734/,91

Nevertheless, its application to the particular case of pathogen detection from foodstuffs necessitates special requirements for reliable results. Firstly, a robust analytical chain, involving sample preparation and DNA isolation with purification, is necessary to ensure optimal performance. Secondly, for reliable quantification of Listeria monocytogenes from food, reproducible controls for all steps of the analytical chain are needed, which can give quantitative information about the performance of each individual step of the detection chain. Ideally, each individual sample should include a so-called internal sample process control (ISPC) which passes through all steps of the analytical chain and is phenotypically similar to the target organism (in this case L. monocytogenes).This chapter describes the modular and rapid (3 h) sample preparation method ""matrix lysis"" for the quantification of L. monocytogenes from food and gives detailed information regarding the application of an ISPC based on the example of the L. monocytogenes Δ-prfA/+IAC strain.","Mester, Patrick; Witte, Anna Kristina; Rossmanith, Peter",Methods in molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-0982-8_3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975764/,91

METHODS Following approval by the Institutional Review Board, performed a retrospective review of 12 months before (July 2016-June 2017) and after (July 2017-June 2018) implementation of the Postoperative Analgesia Protocol, which included all adults undergoing tonsillectomy, septoplasty, thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, tympanoplasty, middle ear exploration, stapedectomy, and ossicular chain reconstruction. RESULTS Seven hundred and thirty eight procedures met inclusion criteria. Following implementation, total morphine milligram equivalents decreased by 26% (P < .0001). The number of patients requiring opioid refills decreased by 49%, and morphine milligram equivalents received as refills decreased by 16% (P < .001). Thyroid and parathyroid surgery had the greatest reduction in morphine milligram equivalents prescribed (84%, P < .001), followed by septoplasty (30%, P = .001) and tonsillectomy (18%, P < .001). The number of patients receiving refills of opioid medications decreased for all procedures (tonsillectomy 54%; septoplasty 67%; thyroid/parathyroid surgery 80%, middle ear surgery 100%). CONCLUSIONS While every patient and surgery must be treated individually, this study demonstrates that a resident led standardization of pain control regimes can result in significant reductions in total quantity of opioids prescribed.

110335,The new age of molecular diagnostics for microbial agents.,2008,"UNLABELLED Human norovirus (NoV) accounts for 95% of nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine available to combat human NoV as it is not cultivable and lacks a small-animal model. Recently, we demonstrated that recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) expressing human NoV capsid protein (rVSV-VP1) induced strong immunities in mice (Y. Ma and J. Li, J. Virol. 85:2942-2952, 2011). To further improve the safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidate, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was inserted into the rVSV-VP1 backbone vector. A second construct was generated in which the firefly luciferase (Luc) gene was inserted in place of HSP70 as a control for the double insertion. The resultant recombinant viruses (rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1) were significantly more attenuated in cell culture and viral spread in mice than rVSV-VP1. At the inoculation dose of 1.0 × 10(6) PFU, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 triggered significantly higher vaginal IgA than rVSV-VP1 and significantly higher fecal and vaginal IgA responses than rVSV-Luc-VP1, although serum IgG and T cell responses were similar. At the inoculation dose of 5.0 × 10(6) PFU, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 stimulated significantly higher T cell, fecal, and vaginal IgA responses than rVSV-VP1. Fecal and vaginal IgA responses were also significantly increased when combined vaccination of rVSV-VP1 and rVSV-HSP70 was used. Collectively, these data indicate that (i) insertion of an additional gene (HSP70 or Luc) into the rVSV-VP1 backbone further attenuates the VSV-based vaccine in vitro and in vivo, thus improving the safety of the vaccine candidate, and (ii) HSP70 enhances the human NoV-specific mucosal and T cell immunities triggered by a VSV-based human NoV vaccine. IMPORTANCE Human norovirus (NoV) is responsible for more than 95% of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine for this virus. Development of a live attenuated vaccine for human NoV has not been possible because it is uncultivable. Thus, a live vector-based vaccine may provide an alternative vaccine strategy. In this study, we developed a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based human NoV vaccine candidate. We constructed rVSV-HSP70-VP1, coexpressing heat shock protein (HSP70) and capsid (VP1) genes of human NoV, and rVSV-Luc-VP1, coexpressing firefly luciferase (Luc) and VP1 genes. We found that VSVs with a double gene insertion were significantly more attenuated than VSV with a single VP1 insertion (rVSV-VP1). Furthermore, we found that coexpression or coadministration of HSP70 from VSV vector significantly enhanced human NoV-specific mucosal immunity. Collectively, we developed an improved live vectored vaccine candidate for human NoV which will be useful for future clinical studies.","Ma, Yuanmei; Duan, Yue; Wei, Yongwei; Liang, Xueya; Niewiesk, Stefan; Oglesbee, Michael; Li, Jianrong",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00019-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574391/,91

Methods In a cross-sectional study of 365 multiple sclerosis patients selected through a random sampling method from the MS society of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, we collected data by self-administered questionnaires - the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire - and analyzed by descriptive and analytical statistics. Results Approximately 51.1% of participants had moderate or severe anxiety and 64% of them had depression among community-based multiple sclerosis patients according to Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, and according to the PHQ-9 Arabic version about 28.85% showed mild to moderate depression. The MS patients aged 53 to over 60 years showed higher levels of mild anxiety (76.32%) and higher levels of depression ranging from mild to moderate (53.61%) (P = 0.001). While the MS patients younger than 53 years showed moderate to severe anxiety (60.71%) and depression levels (62.32%). In different age group bad health status (37.6%) was associated with a higher prevalence of depression levels (P =< 0.001) and people who were widowed (22.38%), divorced (26%), and separated (37.82%) had significant depression levels (P = 0.017). In terms of anxiety, 54.58% of females had anxiety (P = 0.005), more older people showed anxiety (43.17%) (P = 0.026), and people with a bad general health state (26.38%) had anxiety (P = <0.001).

In this study, VSCs in 21 cold-pressed rapeseed oils (CROs) from 9 regions in China were extracted and separated by headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography coupled with sulfur chemiluminescence detection. 19 VSCs were identified by authentic standards, and the total concentration of VSCs in all CROs ranged from 49.0 to 18129 μg/kg. Dimethyl sulfide (DMS), with its high odor activity value (7-14574), was the most significant aroma contributor to the CROs. Furthermore, S-methylmethionine (SMM) in rapeseed was first affirmed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and isotope quantitation. The positive correlation coefficient between DMS and SMM was 0.793 (p < 0.05), which confirmed SMM as a crucial precursor of DMS in CROs. This study provided a theoretical basis for selecting rapeseed materials by the distribution of essential VSCs and the source of DMS.","Yu, Pei; Yang, Yini; Sun, Jinyuan; Jia, Xiao; Zheng, Chang; Zhou, Qi; Huang, Fenghong",Food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.130741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399272/,91
111514,Applications of protein microarrays for biomarker discovery.,2008,"BACKGROUND Accelerated malignant behaviors induced by insufficient thermal ablation have been increasingly reported, however, the exact mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we investigated the importance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in modulating the progression of residual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after heat treatment. METHODS Heat-exposed residual HCC cells were cultured in different ECM gels. We used basement membrane gel (Matrigel) to simulate the normal microenvironment and collagen I to model the pathological stromal ECM. The alterations of morphology and parameters of proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS Increased collagen I deposition was observed at the periablational zone after incomplete RFA of HCC in a xenograft model. The markers of cell proliferation, EMT, motility and progenitor-like traits of heat-exposed residual HCC cells were significantly induced by collagen I as compared to Matrigel (p values all < 0.05). Importantly, collagen I induced the activation of ERK phosphorylation in heat-exposed residual HCC cells. ERK1/2 inhibitor reversed the collagen I-promoted ERK phosphorylation, cell proliferative, protrusive and spindle-like appearance of heat-treated residual HCC cells in vitro. Moreover, collagen I promoted the in vivo tumor progression of heat-exposed residual HCC cells, and sorafenib markedly reversed the collagen I-mediated protumor effects. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that collagen I could enhance the aggressive progression of residual HCC cells after suboptimal heat treatment and sorafenib may be a treatment approach to thwart this process.","Zhang, Rui; Ma, Min; Lin, Xia-Hui; Liu, Hua-Hua; Chen, Jie; Chen, Jun; Gao, Dong-Mei; Cui, Jie-Feng; Ren, Zheng-Gang; Chen, Rong-Xin",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-018-4820-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30227844/,91
111599,Relating phylogenetic trees to transmission trees of infectious disease outbreaks.,2013,"BACKGROUND The results of chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention (CTO-PCI) trials are inconclusive. Therefore, we studied whether CTO-PCI leads to improvement of clinical endpoints and patient symptoms when combining all available randomised data. METHODS AND RESULTS This meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO prior to starting. We performed a literature search and identified all randomised trials comparing CTO-PCI to optimal medical therapy alone (OMT). A total of five trials were included, comprising 1790 CTO patients, of whom 964 were randomised to PCI and 826 to OMT. The all-cause mortality was comparable between groups at 1‑year [risk ratio (RR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-5.80, p = 0.40] and at 4‑year follow-up (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.38-3.40, p = 0.81). There was no difference in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) between groups at 1 year (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.36-1.33, p = 0.27) and at 4 years (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60-1.22, p = 0.38). Left ventricular function and volumes at follow-up were comparable between groups. However, the PCI group had fewer target lesion revascularisations (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.52, p < 0.001) and was more frequently free of angina at 1‑year follow-up (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50-0.84, p = 0.001), although the scores on the subscales of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire were comparable. CONCLUSION In conclusion, in this meta-analysis of 1790 CTO patients, CTO-PCI did not lead to an improvement in survival or in MACE as reported at long-term follow-up of up to 4 years, or to improvement of left ventricular function. However, CTO-PCI resulted in less angina and fewer target lesion revascularisations compared to OMT.","van Veelen, A; Elias, J; van Dongen, I M; Hoebers, L P C; Claessen, B E P M; Henriques, J P S",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-020-01503-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064274/,91
112163,A double dissociation between action and perception in bimanual grasping: evidence from the Ponzo and the Wundt-Jastrow illusions.,2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND Surgical access to the cavernous sinus (CS) has proven a challenge for the skull base surgeon. Traditional approaches include the transcranial route, which broaches the lateral wall of the CS and has a high risk of cranial nerve weakness. A medial approach is more logical but the microscopic transsphenoidal approach has a restricted view. The endoscopic endonasal approach provides an alternative medial approach with improved visualization to that provided with the microscope. We describe our results using this approach for resection of CS tumors. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients treated surgically at a tertiary care referral center between January 2004 and February 2011 with a purely endoscopic endonasal approach to the CS. RESULTS Out of 400 total endoscopic skull base cases, 41 (10.3%) involved the cavernous sinus. The most common approach was the transsphenoidal transsellar approach (31 patients, 75.6%). Other approaches included the tran-sethmoidal transsphenoidal parasellar (4 patients, 9.8%) and transmaxillary transpterygoidal (6 patients, 14.6%). The most common pathology was pituitary macroadenoma (24 patients, 58.5%). Gross total resection was achieved in 18 patients (43.9%). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak was not encountered in any patient postoperatively. Complications included 1 case of new postoperative VIth nerve palsy, 1 case of intraoperative hemorrhage, 2 cases of persistent diabetes insipidus, and 2 cases of sinusitis. CONCLUSION The endoscopic endonasal approach is a safe and effective option for tumor resection in the CS using a medial to lateral route for selected cases. Morbidity is low and a variety of reconstructive options are available.","Raithatha, Roheen; McCoul, Edward D; Woodworth, Graeme F; Schwartz, Theodore H; Anand, Vijay K",International forum of allergy & rhinology,https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.20097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22311835/,91

At the beginning of the pandemic, media and case reports described pressure for medical interventions, visitor restrictions, separation from newborns, and an increase in patient demand for community birth (home and birth center). The purpose of this study was to describe birth experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic centering the birthing person's perspective. METHODS A survey was e-mailed to users of the Ovia Pregnancy app reaching a national convenience sample who gave birth between March 1, 2020, and June 11, 2020. Survey topics included birth location, the Mothers on Respect index, and open-ended questions capturing patient perspectives on the pandemic's effect on their birth experiences. Differences were assessed based on state-level COVID rate and by race. Content analysis was performed to analyze open-ended responses. RESULTS Respondents from highly impacted COVID-19 states more frequently changed or considered changing their birth location. Racial differences were also found with Black respondents reporting significantly more preterm births and lower respect scores when compared to White respondents. Six themes emerged from the content analysis: Institutional Policies, Changes in Care, Hospital Staff Interactions, Sub-par Care, Issues of Support, and Mental Health. DISCUSSION The health care community must continue to adapt policies and procedures to best support birthing patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The community must also continue to address the reality that Black patients receive less respectful care compared with White patients.","Breman, Rachel Blankstein; Neerland, Carrie; Bradley, Dani; Burgess, Adriane; Barr, Erik; Burcher, Paul",Birth,https://doi.org/10.1111/birt.12559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114262/,91

We analyzed 2,097 CTO PCIs performed in 2,049 patients from 2012 to 2017. Patient age was 65 ± 10 years, 85% were men, and 36% had prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Technical and procedural success were 88% and 87%, respectively. A major periprocedural adverse cardiovascular event occurred in 2.6%. Coronary perforation occurred in 85 patients (4.1%); The frequency of Ellis class 1, 2, and 3 perforations was 21%, 26%, and 52%, respectively. Perforation occurred more frequently in older patients and those with previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (61% vs 35%, p < 0.001). Cases with perforation were angiographically more complex (Multicenter CTO Registry in Japan score 3.0 ± 1.2 vs 2.5 ± 1.3, p < 0.001). Twelve patients (14%) with perforation experienced tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis. Patient age, previous PCI, right coronary artery target CTO, blunt or no stump, use of antegrade dissection re-entry, and the retrograde approach were associated with perforation. Adjusted odds ratio for periprocedural major periprocedural adverse cardiovascular events among patients with perforation was 15.04 (95% confidence interval 7.35 to 30.18). In conclusion, perforation occurs relatively infrequently in contemporary CTO PCI performed by experienced operators and is associated with baseline patient characteristics and angiographic complexity necessitating use of advanced crossing techniques. In most cases, perforations do not result in tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis, but they are associated with reduced technical and procedural success, higher periprocedural major adverse events, and reduced procedural efficiency.","Danek, Barbara Anna; Karatasakis, Aris; Tajti, Peter; Sandoval, Yader; Karmpaliotis, Dimitri; Alaswad, Khaldoon; Jaffer, Farouc; Yeh, Robert W; Kandzari, David E; Lembo, Nicholas J; Patel, Mitul P; Mahmud, Ehtisham; Choi, James W; Doing, Anthony H; Lombardi, William L; Wyman, R Michael; Toma, Catalin; Garcia, Santiago; Moses, Jeffrey W; Kirtane, Ajay J; Hatem, Raja; Ali, Ziad A; Parikh, Manish; Karacsonyi, Judit; Rangan, Bavana V; Khalili, Houman; Burke, M Nicholas; Banerjee, Subhash; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",The American journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.07.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28826896/,91

It has long been assumed that cargo triggers local CME site assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on the discovery that cortical actin patches, which cluster near exocytic sites, are CME sites. Quantitative imaging data reported here lead to a radically different view of which CME steps are regulated and which steps are deterministic. We quantitatively and spatially describe progression through the CME pathway and pinpoint a cargo-sensitive regulatory transition point that governs progression from the initiation phase of CME to the internalization phase. Thus, site maturation, rather than site initiation, accounts for the previously observed polarized distribution of actin patches in this organism. While previous studies suggested that cargo ensures its own internalization by regulating either CME initiation rates or frequency of abortive events, our data instead identify maturation through a checkpoint in the pathway as the cargo-sensitive step.","Pedersen, Ross T A; Hassinger, Julian E; Marchando, Paul; Drubin, David G",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202002160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33053166/,91

RESULTS For both left and right sensors, the median differences in rScO2 between neutral and left or right positions were between 0 and -1 with the head up (P = 0.14 to 0.84). The median differences with the head down were between 3.8 and -0.8, with a significant difference for the left sensor when turned left (P < 0.01) and for the right sensor (P = 0.006) when turned right. Ten patients showed reductions of more than 10 in rScO2 in the rotated (and lifted) positions. When the head was lifted from the head support, the rScO2 was -0.5 to 3.75 units higher, but there was high variability between patients. CONCLUSION We recommend the neutral head position for prone patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01760369.","Andersen, Johnny Dohn Holmgren; Baake, Gerben; Wiis, Julie Therese; Olsen, Karsten Skovgaard",European journal of anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/eja.0000000000000028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24335413/,91

Pharmacological treatment has proven to be effective and safe with nicotine replacement therapy as well as varenicline. Counselling plus pharmacotherapy is more effective in combination than either therapy is on its own. To better implement structures medical societies in Germany are seeking adequate funding e. g. in the DRG system for hospitalised patients.There are obvious and relevant benefits in smoking cessation. Not only for the main tobacco-related diseases such as coronary heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), positive effects of quitting on morbidity and mortality have been confirmed by high-quality meta-analyses. Furthermore, quality of life is increasing following cessation. Presently, smoking is found to be a significant risk factor for severe disease and mortality following coronavirus infection.Do e-cigarettes offer an alternative in smoking cessation? No. Animal and human data are suggesting toxic effects especially following longer use. The long-term effectiveness of e-cigarettes in tobacco cessation is still uncertain and epidemiologic data clearly point toward ineffectiveness. Furthermore, dual use with potentiation of the toxic effects is common. Therefore, e-cigarettes cannot be recommended for tobacco cessation.","Andreas, Stefan; Pankow, Wulf",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1259-8353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062591/,91

Regression analyses examined how political preferences influenced the association between governors' COVID-19 communications and residents' mobility patterns. Governors' recommendations for residents to stay at home preceded stay-at-home orders and led to a significant reduction in mobility that was comparable to the effect of the orders themselves. Effects were larger in Democratic- than in Republican-leaning counties, a pattern more pronounced under Republican governors. Democratic-leaning counties also responded more strongly to recommendations from Republican than from Democratic governors.

METHODS Following National Institute for Health Research's Research Centre (London, United Kingdom) approval, the authors of this study conducted a survey of specialist registrars' knowledge of the respiratory and skin protection requirements needed during a resuscitation scenario with Advanced Life Support. Participant responses were compared to UK national recommendations and to a previous survey in 2009. RESULTS A total of 98 specialist registrars (in Anesthesiology, n=51; in Emergency Medicine (EM), n=21; and in Intensive Care Medicine (ICM) n=26) completed hand-delivered surveys. The best knowledge of PPE requirements (76%) was found for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), with less knowledge about PPE requirements for anthrax, plague, Ebola virus disease (EVD), and smallpox (60%). The results show limited knowledge of PPE requirements (20%-30%) for various chemical warfare agents. Personal protective equipment knowledge regarding treatment of sarin-contaminated casualties was over-rated by 80%, and for patients with EVD, it was over-rated by up to 67% of participants. CONCLUSION The results of the tested cohort indicate that current knowledge regarding PPE for chemical warfare agents remains very limited.","Schumacher, Jan; Bond, Alexandra R; Woodham, Valentine; Buckingham, Anna; Garnham, Francesca; Brinker, Andrea",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x15004690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25901721/,91

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional, population level national survey of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life longitudinal cohort study (collected 2008-2016). Participants were specialist physicians from four career stage groups: pre-registrars (physician intent); registrars; new consultants (< 5 years since Fellowship); and consultants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Level of professional satisfaction across various job aspects, such as hours worked, working conditions, support networks and educational opportunities, comparing rural and metropolitan based physicians. RESULTS Participants included 1587 pre-registrars (15% rural), 1745 physician registrars (9% rural), 421 new consultants (20% rural) and 1143 consultants (13% rural). Rural physicians of all career stages demonstrated equivalent professional satisfaction across most job aspects, compared with metropolitan physician counterparts. Some examples of differences in satisfaction included rural pre-registrars being less likely to agree they had good access to support and supervision from qualified consultants (odds ratio [OR], 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9) and rural consultants being more likely to agree they had a poorer professional support network (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-2.9). In terms of demographics, relatively more rural physicians had a rural background or were trained overseas. Although most junior physicians were women, female consultants were less likely to be working in a rural location (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.8). CONCLUSION Junior physicians in metropolitan or rural settings have a similar professional experience, which is important in attracting future trainees. Increased opportunities for rural training should be prioritised, along with addressing concerns about the professional isolation and poorer support network of those in rural areas, not only among junior doctors but also consultants. Finally, making rural practice more attractive to female junior physicians could greatly improve the consultant physician distribution. CHAPTER 2: GENERAL PHYSICIANS AND PAEDIATRICIANS IN RURAL AUSTRALIA: THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY: Objective: To explore the construction of professional identity among general physicians and paediatricians working in non-metropolitan areas. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with general physicians and paediatricians, plus informants from specialist colleges, government agencies and academia who were involved in policy and programs for the training and recruitment of specialists in rural locations across three states and two territories. This research is part of the Training Pathways and Professional Support for Building a Rural Physician Workforce Study, 2018-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Individual and collective descriptors of professional identity. RESULTS We interviewed 36 key informants. Professional identity for general physicians and paediatricians working in regional, rural and remote Australia is grounded in the breadth of their training, but qualified by location - geographic location, population served or specific location, where social and cultural context specifically shapes practice. General physicians and paediatricians were deeply engaged with their local community and its economic vulnerability, and they described the population size and dynamics of local economies as determinants of viable practice. They often complemented their practice with formal or informal training in areas of special interest, but balanced their practice against subspecialist availability, also dependent on demographics. While valuing their professional roles, they showed limited inclination for industrial organisation. CONCLUSION Despite limited consensus on identity descriptors, rural general physicians and paediatricians highly value generalism and their rural engagement. The structural and geographic bias that preferences urban areas will need to be addressed to further develop coordinated strategies for advanced training in rural contexts, for which collective identity is integral. CHAPTER 3: SUSTAINABLE RURAL PHYSICIAN TRAINING: LEADERSHIP IN A FRAGILE ENVIRONMENT: Objectives: To understand Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) training contexts, including supervisor and trainee perspectives, and to identify contributors to the sustainability of training sites, including training quality. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional mixed-methods design was used. A national sample of RACP trainees and Fellows completed online surveys. Survey respondents who indicated willingness to participate in interviews were purposively recruited to cover perspectives from a range of geographic, demographic and training context parameters. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Fellows' and trainees' work and life satisfaction, and their experiences of supervision and training, respectively, by geographic location. RESULTS Fellows and trainees reported high levels of satisfaction, with one exception - inner regional Fellows reported lower satisfaction regarding opportunities to use their abilities. Not having a good support network was associated with lower satisfaction. Our qualitative findings indicate that a culture of undermining rural practice is prevalent and that good leadership at all levels is important to reduce negative impacts on supervisor and trainee availability, site accreditation and viability. Trainees described challenges in navigating training pathways, ensuring career development, and having the flexibility to meet family needs. The small number of Fellows in some sites poses challenges for supervisors and trainees and results in a blurring of roles; accreditation is an obstacle to provision of training at rural sites; and the overlap between service and training roles can be difficult for supervisors. CONCLUSION Our qualitative findings emphasise the distinctive nature of regional specialist training, which can make it a fragile environment. Leadership at all levels is critical to sustaining accreditation and support for supervisors and trainees. CHAPTER 4: PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR A SUSTAINABLE RURAL SPECIALIST PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE: Objective: To draw on research conducted in the Building a Rural Physician Workforce project, the first national study on rural specialist physicians, to define a set of principles applicable to guiding training and professional support action. DESIGN We used elements of the Delphi approach for systematic data collection and codesign, and applied a hybrid participatory action planning approach to achieve consensus on a set of principles. RESULTS Eight interconnected foundational principles built around rural regions and rural people were identified: FP1, grow your own ""connected to"" place; FP2, select trainees invested in rural practice; FP3, ground training in community need; FP4, rural immersion - not exposure; FP5, optimise and invest in general medicine; FP6, include service and academic learning components; FP7, join up the steps in rural training; and FP8, plan sustainable specialist roles. CONCLUSION These eight principles can guide training and professional support to build a sustainable rural physician workforce. Application of the principles, and coordinated action by stakeholders and the responsible organisations, are needed at national, state and local levels to achieve a sustainable rural physician workforce.","Ostini, Remo; McGrail, Matthew R; Kondalsamy-Chennakesavan, Srinivas; Hill, Peter; O'Sullivan, Belinda; Selvey, Linda A; Eley, Diann S; Adegbija, Odewumi; Boyle, Frances M; Dettrick, Zoe; Jennaway, Megan; Strasser, Sarah",The Medical journal of Australia,https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.51122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218436/,91

The results showed that improvements in family relations were associated with reduced odds of criminal outcomes a decade later for former MST participants. Furthermore, improvements in youth prosocial peer relations and academic performance were also related to lower odds of long-term criminal activity. These results are consistent with the underlying theory of change in family-based treatments and demonstrate that caregivers are critical to achieving and sustaining decreased antisocial behavior for youths with serious and violent criminal histories.","Sheerin, Kaitlin M; Borduin, Charles M; Brown, Cynthia E; Letourneau, Elizabeth J",Journal of marital and family therapy,https://doi.org/10.1111/jmft.12446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726483/,91

STUDY DESIGN Clinical report. ANIMALS Dogs (n = 3) undergoing thoracic wall resection and thoracotomy. METHODS A paramedian approach with cephalic angulation was used to place a 24-g epidural catheter in 3 dogs. Dogs 1 and 2 had left caudal thoracic wall resection and dog 3 had left thoracotomy. In dog 1, the epidural catheter was inserted at L2-L3 intervertebral space and the tip of the catheter advanced to the level of T13 vertebral body. In dog 2, the epidural catheter was inserted at T12-T13 intervertebral space and the tip of the catheter was advanced to the level of T8 vertebral body. In dog 3, the epidural catheter was inserted at T13-L1 intervertebral space and its tip advanced until reaching the vertebral body of T10. All dogs were administered a combination of bupivacaine and morphine through the epidural catheter to provide intra- and postoperative analgesia. RESULTS The peridural space was identified and the tip of the catheter was positioned where intended in all dogs. Dog 1 developed transient Horner's syndrome and dog 3 required intraoperative fentanyl during the first part of the procedure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review of published literature between 30th December 2019 and 21st June 2020 was conducted on Pubmed, Google Scholar, Ovid, Scopus, and ISI web of science. Studies investigating urinary viral shedding of COVID-19 in infected patients were included. Two reviewers selected relative studies and performed quality assessment of individual studies. Meta-analysis was performed on the pooled case reports and cohort with a sample size of ≥ 9. RESULTS Thirty-nine studies were finally included in the systematic review; 12 case reports, 26 case series, and one cohort study. Urinary samples from 533 patients were investigated. Fourteen studies reported the presence of COVID-19 in the urinary samples from 24 patients. The crude overall rate of COVID-19 detection in urinary samples was 4.5%. Considering case series and cohorts with a sample size of ≥ 9, the estimated viral shedding frequency was 1.18 % (CI 95%: 0.14 - 2.87) in the meta-analysis. In adult patients, urinary shedding of COVID-19 was commonly detected in patients with moderate to severe disease (16 adult patients with moderate or severe disease versus two adult patients with mild disease). In children, urinary viral shedding of COVID-19 was reported in 4 children who all suffered from mild disease. Urinary viral shedding of COVID-19 was detected from day 1 to day 52 after disease onset. The pathogenicity of virus isolated from urine has been demonstrated in cell culture media in one study while another study failed to reveal replication of isolated viral RNA in cell cultures. Urinary symptoms were not attributed to urinary viral shedding. CONCLUSION While COVID-19 is rarely detected in urine of infected individuals, infection transmission through urine still remains possible. In adult patients, infected urine is more likely in the presence of moderate or severe disease. Therefore, caution should be exerted when dealing with COVID-19 infected patients during medical interventions like endoscopy and urethral catheterization.","Kashi, Amir H; De la Rosette, Jean; Amini, Erfan; Abdi, Hamidreza; Fallah-Karkan, Morteza; Vaezjalali, Maryam",Urology journal,https://doi.org/10.22037/uj.v16i7.6248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888186/,91

We sought to validate our model by quantifying the pressure threshold of esophageal anastomoses in human cadavers as a step before a clinical trial. METHODS We performed stapled side-to-side, functional end-to-end esophageal anastomoses in 10 cadaveric specimens from autopsy. With intraluminal pressure monitoring, we insufflated the anastomosis with air until a leak was observed, and measured the maximum tolerated pressure. RESULTS Cadaveric esophageal anastomoses tolerated 101±39 cmH2O (range, 63-140 cmH2O) of pressure before leak was observed. The maximum pressure threshold ranged from 59 to 246 cmH2O. The leak was always at the anastomosis. There was no significant difference in pressure threshold between cadaveric and previously described porcine anastomoses. CONCLUSIONS We created a human cadaveric model that in conjunction with our porcine data demonstrates that a human esophageal anastomosis can tolerate manifold higher pressures than are delivered to the esophagus by NPPV. This is the final step before a trial of NPPV in patients following esophagectomy.","Raman, Vignesh; Ofoche, Obinna G; Chentorycki, Daniel J; Erkmen, Cherie P",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2305-5839.2015.12.17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26734637/,91
118473,Are we ready for the new coronavirus?,2020-04-01,"INTRODUCTION We describe a patient with a large cystic adenomyosis of the uterus who was treated by a laparoscopic approach. CASE PRESENTATION A 38-year-old woman presented with dysmenorrhoea for 4 months. A 104 mm × 55 mm × 60 mm cystic mass was detected on the right side of the posterior wall of the uterus by ultrasound. Laparoscopy was performed, during which a bumpy mass was discovered protruding from the surface of the uterine myometrium. Both ovaries were normal. When the wall of the cystic mass was opened, chocolate-colored fluid was visible. The cyst was completely removed, and postoperative histopathology confirmed a cystic adenomyosis. One month later, the uterus was found to be normal on ultrasound. DISCUSSION Endometriosis is a common disease in women and is divided into ovarian endometrioid cysts, superficial endometriosis, deep infiltrating endometriosis and other special types according to pathological characteristics. As a special type of endometriosis, the incidence of cystic adenomyosis is low, and its specific incidence is unknown. Cystic adenomyosis is clinically characterized by the appearance of one or more cystic cavities between the walls of the uterine muscles. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic surgery is an effective method for the diagnosis and treatment of large cystic masses in the uterine myometrium.","Li, Congqing; Xu, Youjiang; Cong, Lin",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.04.084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32460088/,91

Here, we evaluated the co-infection status of PCV2, PCV3 and PEDV in 76 enteric samples from piglets with severe diarrhea disease in Henan, China. All samples were tested by PCR/RT-PCR. Our results showed that the infection rate of PCV2, PCV3 and PEDV was 82.89%, 76.32% and 68.42%, respectively. Interestingly, most of these samples exhibited mixed infections. The co-infection rates of PCV2 and PCV3, PCV2 and PEDV, PCV3 and PEDV were 69.74%, 57.89% and 53.95%, respectively. And the triple infection rate was 48.68%.

The cap gene of PCV2b and PCV2d isolates only shared 94.6%-95.0% nucleotide identities. The PCV3 isolates together with the reference strains could be divided into four clades (clade1-4), and the cap genes of these isolates have 98.6%-100% nucleotide identities to each other. Distinctive amino acid substitutions were also characterized on the cap protein of PCV2 and PCV3 isolates. Our studies provide the new knowledge on the co-infectious status of PCV2, PCV3 and PEDV in China. The results also provide insight into the genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of PCV2 and PCV3.","Guo, Zhenhua; Ruan, Haiyu; Qiao, Songlin; Deng, Ruiguang; Zhang, Gaiping",Microbial pathogenesis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32036077/,91

The need to store, manage and analyze this rapidly growing resource of experimental, clinical and epidemiologic data has given rise to the field known as immunoinformatics. Immunoinformatics represents computational methods and resources that are used in the study of immune function. It lies at the intersection of experimental and computational sciences and encompasses domain-specific databases, computational models and strategies drawn from artificial intelligence. For example, computational or artificial intelligence models are increasingly being used to simulate and improve our understanding of immune system behavior, such as antigen processing and presentation, as well as for analysis of host and pathogen genomes. Systemic models focus on simulating the behavior of cells or whole organs and can be used for applications such as tracking the course of infection or optimization of immunization protocols. Immunomics, the large-scale screening of immune processes, which includes powerful immunoinformatic tools, offers great promise for future translation of basic immunology research advances into clinical practice. Immunoinformatics is central to the research fields of immunogenomics, immunoproteomics and computational vaccinology.","Brusic, Vladimir; Petrovsky, Nikolai",Expert review of clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1586/1744666x.1.1.145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20477662/,91

DATA SOURCES PubMed and hand-searched articles. REVIEW METHODS The PubMed electronic database was searched using Medical Subject Headings and free-text search terms relating to aerosolization and transnasal endoscopic procedures from inception to November 16, 2020. References were hand-searched to identify additional publications for consideration. Inclusion in the systematic review required quantification of aerosol generation during clinic transnasal endoscopic procedures. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and flowchart were followed during the systematic review. RESULTS Eight of 900 studies met criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. Five studies tested nasal endoscopy with mixed findings on the risk of aerosol generation during this procedure. Two studies assessed flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy and also reported mixed findings. Breathing, sneezing, speech, and spray anesthetic/decongestants were found to consistently increase aerosol generation above baseline. A number of studies tested new and general mitigation strategies and were found to be effective in decreasing aerosol generation. CONCLUSIONS The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has informed many considerations regarding patient and provider safety. It is valuable to understand the risk during outpatient otolaryngology procedures through the quantification of aerosolization. There are several effective methods to control aerosolization during these procedures. The findings of this systematic review will inform appropriate precautions to protect against spread of infectious agents by aerosolization.","Matos, Sophia; Sharma, Arun; Crosby, Dana",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/01945998211050632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637376/,91

To date, therapeutic vaccines have not been successful in eliciting HIV-specific CD8 T cell or bNAb responses that are capable of preventing long-term viral rebound upon ART cessation. These challenges suggest that a combinatorial approach that harnesses both bNAbs and CD8 T cell responses may be necessary for long term control of viral replication. In this study we demonstrate a synergistic interaction between CD8 T cells and bNAbs using an in vitro model. Our data suggest that this combinatorial approach is very effective at suppressing viral replication in vitro and should be considered in future therapeutic studies.","Veenhuis, Rebecca T; Garliss, Caroline C; Bailey, Justin R; Blankson, Joel N",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.708355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394110/,91

We applied spectral analysis to the weekly prevalence data of sputum smear positive (SSP) and sputum smear negative (SSN) pulmonary TB reported from 2006 to 2010. Cases of both SSP and SSN feature 1·0- and 0·5-year periodic modes. The least squares method was used to fit curves to the two periodic modes for SSP and SSN data. The curves demonstrated dominant peaks in spring similar to cases reported previously for other locations. Notably for SSP, dominant peaks were also observed in summer. The spring peaks of SSP and SSN were explained in terms of poorly ventilated and humid rooms and vitamin D deficiency. For the summer peaks of SSP, summer influenza epidemics in Wuhan may contribute to the increase in TB prevalence.","Luo, T; Sumi, A; Zhou, D; Kobayashi, N; Mise, K; Yu, B; Kong, D; Wang, J; Duan, Q",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268813003142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24331081/,91
119178,Introduction to the Regenerative Medicine Thematic Issue.,2021-08-01,"We review the principles of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the inactivation of infectious agents by UV, and current applications for the control of microorganisms. In particular, wavelengths between 200 and 280 nm (germicidal UV) affect the double-bond stability of adjacent carbon atoms in molecules including pyrimidines, purines and flavin. Thus, UV inactivation of microorganisms results from the formation of dimers in RNA (uracil and cytosine) and DNA (thymine and cytosine). The classic application of UV irradiation is the inactivation of microorganisms in biological safety cabinets. In the food-processing industry, germicidal UV irradiation has shown potential for the surface disinfection of fresh-cut fruit and vegetables. UV treatment of water (potable and wastewater) is increasingly common because the process is effective against a wide range of microorganisms, overdose is not possible, chemical residues or by-products are avoided, and water quality is unaffected. UV has been used to reduce the concentration of airborne microorganisms in limited studies, but the technology will require further development if it is to gain wider application. For bioaerosols, the primary technical challenge is delivery of sufficient UV irradiation to large volumes of air, but the absence of UV inactivation constants for airborne pathogens under a range of environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity) further compounds the problem.","Cutler, Timothy D; Zimmerman, Jeffrey J",Animal health research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1466252311000016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21676338/,91

The UK demographic has changed considerably with higher life expectancy and 'an ageing population'. Keeping this demographic healthy through prevention and management of age-related degeneration is crucial to their independence and improving resource utilisation. The Department of Health and Social Care's agenda for digital transformation of the NHS is facilitating a move towards preventative healthcare and greater community care, which will likely be supported by virtual healthcare delivery models. Despite views on digital illiteracy in the older population, this demographic may stand to benefit the most. Research has shown that the older demographic adopts technology in line with the technology acceptance model if their needs are carefully considered. Executed successfully, the deployment of virtual healthcare could save transformational costs to the NHS and support better quality of life for the senior members of society. This is particularly relevant in the current COVID-19 pandemic with patients facing challenges in accessing outpatient appointments. With many hospitals kickstarting virtual outpatient clinics to ensure continuity of care during a time of social isolation; we await to see the ingenuities that arise from the current pandemic.","Ahmed, Hanad; Haq, Iqraa; Rahman, Ammar; Tonner, Emma; Abbass, Rami; Sharif, Faraz; Asinger, Shad; Sbai, Magda",Future healthcare journal,https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791501/,91

We aimed to evaluate HCQ/CQ treatment for COVID-19. Methods Five databases were searched on April 15, 2020, without publication date restriction. We followed both Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement reporting recommendations. A random-model meta-analysis was conducted to pool odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR). The quality of evidence for each outcome and the final recommendation was assessed using the GRADE guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians. Results We identified four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and four observational studies with 2,063 COVID-19 cases. All-cause mortality was not affected by the administration of HCQ/CQ [OR: 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53-2.09, P=0.89]. No improvement of viral clearance was found neither by time-to-event analysis (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.74-1.94, P=0.47) nor frequency on day 7 (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.33-6.63, P=0.62). HCQ/CQ treatment increased the risk of the any adverse event with OR of 3.56 (95% CI: 1.62-7.83, P=0.002). Conclusions HCQ/CQ failed to decrease the all-cause mortality (very low quality evidence) and did not improve viral clearance (low or very low quality evidence) but increased the risk of any adverse event (moderate quality evidence). Routine administration of HCQ/CQ for COVID-19 patients is not recommended (weak recommendation, Grade 2C).","Ebina-Shibuya, Risa; Namkoong, Ho; Horita, Nobuyuki; Kato, Hideaki; Hara, Yu; Kobayashi, Nobuaki; Kaneko, Takeshi",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-2022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33569200/,91

Several studies have shown that uric acid level correlates with the incidence, severity, and prognosis of pulmonary diseases. However, the association between uric acid level and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has not been studied. This study was conducted to elucidate how serum uric acid level is related with clinical prognosis of ARDS. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study with propensity score matching was conducted at a medical intensive care unit of a tertiary teaching hospital. The medical records of patients diagnosed with ARDS admitted from 2005 through 2011 were reviewed. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-seven patients with ARDS met the inclusion criteria. Patients with a serum uric acid level <3.0 mg/dL were classified into the low uric acid group, and those with a level ≥3 mg/dL were classified into the normal to high uric acid group. We selected 40 patients in each group using propensity score matching. A higher percentage of patients in the low uric acid group experienced clinical improvement in ARDS. More patients died from sepsis in the normal to high uric acid group. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a low serum uric acid level was significantly associated with better survival rate. CONCLUSION: In patients with ARDS, a low serum uric acid level may be a prognostic marker of a low risk of in-hospital mortality.","Lee, Hyun Woo; Choi, Sun Mi; Lee, Jinwoo; Park, Young Sik; Lee, Chang-Hoon; Yim, Jae-Joon; Yoo, Chul-Gyu; Kim, Young Whan; Han, Sung Koo; Lee, Sang-Min",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066617698911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28351229/,91
121616,Propagation of spontaneous electrical activity in the ex vivo human uterus.,2020-07-20,"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to describe the current practice trends for managing symptomatic cartilage lesions of the knee with microfracture among ICRS (International Cartilage Regeneration & Joint Repair Society) members. DESIGN A 42-item electronic questionnaire was sent to all ICRS members, which explored indications, surgical technique, postoperative management, and outcomes of the microfracture procedure for the treatment of symptomatic, full thickness chondral and osteochondral defects of the knee. Responses were compared between surgeons from different regions and years of practice. RESULTS A total of 385 surgeons answered the questionnaire. There was a significant difference noted in the use of microfracture among surgeons by region (P < 0.001). There was no association between the number of years in practice and the self-reported proportion of microfracture cases performed (P = 0.37). Fifty-eight subjects (15%) indicated that they do not perform microfracture at all. Regarding indication for surgery, 56% of surgeons would limit their indication of microfracture to lesions measuring 2 cm2 or less. Half of the surgeons reported no upper age or body mass index limit. Regarding surgical technique, 90% of surgeons would recommend a formal debridement of the calcified layer and 91% believe it is important to create stable vertical walls. Overall, 47% of surgeons use biologic augmentation, with no significant difference between regions (P = 0.35) or years of practice (P = 0.67). Rehabilitation protocols varied widely among surgeons. CONCLUSIONS Indications, operative technique, and rehabilitation protocols utilized for patients undergoing microfracture procedures vary widely among ICRS members. Regional differences and resources likely contribute to these practice pattern variations.","Medina, Jesus; Garcia-Mansilla, Ignacio; Fabricant, Peter D; Kremen, Thomas J; Sherman, Seth L; Jones, Kristofer",Cartilage,https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603520954503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911974/,91

Yet, the electrophysiology underlying these contractions is poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the presence of uterine electrical activity and characterize its propagation in unstimulated ex vivo human uteri. Multichannel electrohysterographic measurements were performed in five freshly resected human uteri starting immediately after hysterectomy. Using an electrode grid externally and an electrode array internally, measurements were performed up to 24 h after hysterectomy and compared with control. Up to 2 h after hysterectomy, we measured biopotentials in all included uteri. The median root mean squared (RMS) values of the external measurements ranged between 3.95 μV (interquartile range (IQR) 2.41-14.18 μV) and 39.4 μV (interquartile range (IQR) 10.84-105.64 μV) and were all significantly higher than control (median RMS of 1.69 μV, IQR 1.13-3.11 μV), consisting of chicken breast meat. The RMS values decreased significantly over time. After 24 h, the median RMS (1.27 μV, IQR 0.86-3.04 μV) was comparable with the control (1.69 μV, IQR 1.13-3.11 μV, p = 0.125). The internal measurements showed a comparable pattern over time, but overall lower amplitude. The measured biopotentials propagated over the uterine surface, following both a plane-wave as well as an erratic pattern. No clear pacemaker location nor a preferred propagation direction could be identified. These results show that ex vivo uteri can spontaneously generate propagating biopotentials and provide novel insight contributing to improving our understanding of the electrophysiology of the human non-pregnant uterus.","Kuijsters, Nienke P M; Sammali, Federica; Ye, Xin; Blank, Celine; Xu, Lin; Mischi, Massimo; Schoot, Benedictus C; Rabotti, Chiara",Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00424-020-02426-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691139/,91

We present our experience with regard to incubation time for detection of Cutibacterium spp. in orthopaedic samples over a 10-year period. METHODS One hundred and nineteen samples were included in this retrospective study. Fifty-three were implants (having previously undergone sonication), 64 were periprosthetic tissue biopsies and two were synovial fluids. Atkins's criteria were used for interpreting the isolates. Quantification and number of days until a culture became positive for Cutibacterium spp. were evaluated. RESULTS The median number of days to detection of a clinically significant isolate and a contaminant was 4 days. No clinically significant isolates grew after day eight. CONCLUSION Most clinically significant isolates of Cutibacterium spp. are detected in the first 7 days of incubation, although a recommendation of prolonged incubation (up to 14 days) appears to be necessary for detecting other organisms.","Salar-Vidal, Llanos; Martin-Garcia, Marta; Auñón, Alvaro; Esteban, Jaime",Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eimc.2020.05.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680799/,91

Here, we report the increase of specificity of isothermal amplification in the presence of poly(aspartic) acids (pAsp). We hypothesized that side reactions occur due to the binding of the phosphate backbone of synthesized DNA strands with surface amino groups of the polymerase, and weakly acidic polyelectrolytes could shield polymerase molecules from DNA and thereby inhibit nonspecific amplification. Suppression of nonspecific polymerase activity by pAsp was studied on multimerization as a model side reaction. It was found that a low concentration of pAsp (0.01%) provides successful amplification of specific DNA targets. The inhibitory effect of pAsp is due to its polymeric structure since aspartic acid did affect neither specific nor nonspecific amplification. Strongly acidic polyelectrolyte heparin does not possess the same selectivity since it suppresses any DNA synthesis. The applicability of pAsp to prevent nonspecific reactions and reliable detection of the specific target has been demonstrated on the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus using Loop-mediated isothermal amplification.","Garafutdinov, Ravil R; Sakhabutdinova, Assol R; Kamalov, Marat I; Salakhieva, Diana V; Mavzyutov, Ayrat R",Analytical biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2021.114267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34089699/,91

Here, we performed a detailed characterization of age-related pathophysiological changes in the mouse neuromuscular system. METHODS Young, adult, middle-aged, and old (1, 4, 14, and 24-30 months old, respectively) C57BL/6J mice were used. Motor behavioural and electrophysiological tests and histological and immunocytochemical procedures were carried out to simultaneously analyse structural, molecular, and functional age-related changes in distinct cellular components of the neuromuscular system. RESULTS Ageing was not accompanied by a significant loss of spinal motoneurons (MNs), although a proportion (~15%) of them in old mice exhibited an abnormally dark appearance. Dark MNs were also observed in adult (~9%) and young (~4%) animals, suggesting that during ageing, some MNs undergo early deleterious changes, which may not lead to MN death. Old MNs were depleted of cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs (~40% and ~45%, respectively, P < 0.01), suggestive of age-associated alterations in MN excitability. Prominent microgliosis and astrogliosis [~93% (P < 0.001) and ~100% (P < 0.0001) increase vs. adults, respectively] were found in old spinal cords, with increased density of pro-inflammatory M1 microglia and A1 astroglia (25-fold and 4-fold increase, respectively, P < 0.0001). Ageing resulted in significant reductions in the nerve conduction velocity and the compound muscle action potential amplitude (~30%, P < 0.05, vs. adults) in old distal plantar muscles. Compared with adult muscles, old muscles exhibited significantly higher numbers of both denervated and polyinnervated neuromuscular junctions, changes in fibre type composition, higher proportion of fibres showing central nuclei and lipofuscin aggregates, depletion of satellite cells, and augmented expression of different molecules related to development, plasticity, and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions, including calcitonin gene-related peptide, growth associated protein 43, agrin, fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1, and transforming growth factor-β1. Overall, these alterations occurred at varying degrees in all the muscles analysed, with no correlation between the age-related changes observed and myofiber type composition or muscle topography. CONCLUSIONS Our data provide a global view of age-associated neuromuscular changes in a mouse model of ageing and help to advance understanding of contributing pathways leading to development of sarcopenia.","Blasco, Alba; Gras, Sílvia; Mòdol-Caballero, Guillem; Tarabal, Olga; Casanovas, Anna; Piedrafita, Lídia; Barranco, Alejandro; Das, Tapas; Pereira, Suzette L; Navarro, Xavier; Rueda, Ricardo; Esquerda, Josep E; Calderó, Jordi","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle",https://doi.org/10.1002/jcsm.12599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691534/,91

Aiming at improving the aesthetic outcome, we report a novel approach to the LSG where we place the trocars at the bikini line in what we described as bikini line sleeve gastrectomy (BLSG). METHODS The present work is a prospective, pilot study on the use of BLSG in patients, during the period between April and October 2016. Exclusion criteria included the following: large hiatal hernia, upper abdominal surgery, and xiphi-umbilical, xiphi-symphysis pubis, and xiphi-anterior superior iliac spine distances of > 25,36 and 33 cm, respectively. Four trocars were used: one at the umbilicus and three at the bikini line. All laparoscopic graspers were bariatric length instruments (43 cm). However, camera telescope, endoscopic stapler, and bipolar dissectors were standard length. RESULTS Twenty eight patients underwent BLSG. The mean age was 34.6 ± 3.7 years with a mean BMI of 42.46 kg/m2 ± 3. There were no major intra- or postoperative complications and no conversion to conventional port site placement. Patient's scar satisfaction was favorable. The mean postoperative BMI and weight at 6 m were 28.5 ± 1 kg/m2 and 79.8 kg ± 2, respectively. The mean percentage excess weight loss at 3, 6, and 12 months were 39.5 ± 4.6, 64.5 ± 5, and 69.8 ± 6%, respectively.

123878,The Inter-α-Trypsin Inhibitor Family: Versatile Molecules in Biology and Pathology.,2020-07-08,"GM1 ganglioside is particularly abundant in the mammalian central nervous system and has shown beneficial effects on neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of GM1 ganglioside in experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD) in vivo and in vitro. Mice were injected with MPTP (30 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.p.) for 5 days, resulting in a subacute model of PD. PD mice were treated with GM1 ganglioside (25, 50 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.p.) for 2 weeks. We showed that GM1 ganglioside administration substantially improved the MPTP-induced behavioral disturbance and increased the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in the striatal tissues. In the MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells and α-synuclein (α-Syn) A53T-overexpressing PC12 (PC12α-Syn A53T) cells, treatment with GM1 ganglioside (40 μM) significantly decreased α-Syn accumulation and alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. We further revealed that treatment with GM1 ganglioside promoted autophagy, evidenced by the autophagosomes that appeared in the substantia nigra of PD mice as well as the changes of autophagy-related proteins (LC3-II and p62) in the MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Cotreatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA or bafilomycin A1 abrogated the in vivo and in vitro neuroprotective effects of GM1 ganglioside. Using GM1 ganglioside labeled with FITC fluorescent, we observed apparent colocalization of GM1-FITC and α-Syn as well as GM1-FITC and LC3 in PC12α-Syn A53T cells. GM1 ganglioside significantly increased the phosphorylation of autophagy regulatory proteins ATG13 and ULK1 in doxycycline-treated PC12α-Syn A53T cells and the MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells, which was inhibited by 3-MA. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the anti-PD role of GM1 ganglioside resulted from activation of autophagy-dependent α-Syn clearance.","Guo, Yu-Lin; Duan, Wen-Jun; Lu, Dan-Hua; Ma, Xiao-Hui; Li, Xiao-Xiao; Li, Zhao; Bi, Wei; Kurihara, Hiroshi; Liu, Hai-Zhi; Li, Yi-Fang; He, Rong-Rong",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41401-020-0454-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724177/,91

124545,Expert consensus document: Advances in the evaluation of anorectal function.,2018,"BACKGROUND No currently used tracheal tube offers full protection against aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions into the lower airways. OBJECTIVE We developed a tracheal tube equipped with two polyvinylchloride (PVC) cuffs with a supplementary port opening between the cuffs through which a continuous positive pressure of 5 cmH2O is provided [double-cuffed PVC (PVCdc)]. We compared this PVCdc with four different cuff types (cylindrical PVC, conical PVC, cylindrical polyurethane and conical polyurethane). DESIGN A comparison study using an in-vitro benchtop model of an artificial rigid trachea. INTERVENTIONS Tracheal tubes were placed in the artificial trachea. Both cuffs were kept inflated at 25 cmH2O. Total 3 ml dyed water was placed above the cuff and leakage recorded under static and dynamic [5 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) alone or positive pressure ventilation plus 5 cmH2O PEEP] conditions. At the end of the dynamic experiments, PEEP was zeroed (PEEP alone) or the tracheal tubes were disconnected from the ventilator (positive pressure ventilation plus PEEP). RESULTS In the static model, leakage flows [medians (range)] were 9.8 (6.2 to 20) for the cylindrical PVC, 1.3 (0.2 to 3.8) for the conical PVC, 0.03 (0.007 to 0.1) for the cylindrical polyurethane, 0.04 (0.003 to 0.2) for the conical polyurethane and 0.0 (0.0 to 0.0) ml min for the PVCdc cuff (P < 0.001, PVCdc vs. all other cuffs). In the dynamic setting, no leakage was detected for up to 60 min with any of the cuffs studied. Loss of PEEP or tracheal tube disconnection resulted in dye inflow alongside all cuffs except for the PVCdc (P < 0.001, PVCdc vs. all other cuffs). CONCLUSION A 'pressure seal' incorporated in a double-cuffed tracheal tube prevented fluid passage into the lower airways. Clinically, this may translate into absence of inflow of bacteriologically contaminated secretions into the lungs and thus a lower incidence of ventilator-associated infection.","Spapen, Herbert D; Suys, Emiel; Diltoer, Marc; Stiers, Wim; Desmet, Geert; Honoré, Patrick M",European journal of anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/eja.0000000000000493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27479464/,91

METHODS The clinical and laboratory data and chest CT images of 51 patients were assessed in a fever observation ward for evidence of COVID-19 between January and February 2020. RESULTS 24 patients had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, whereas 27 individuals had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was found between COVID-19 and CAP patients except for diarrhoea. There was a significant difference in lymphocyte and eosinophil counts between COVID-19 and CAP patients. 22 (91.67%) COVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement and multiple lesions according to their lung CT images; the left lower lobe (87.50%) and right lower lobe (95.83%) were most often affected, and all lesions were located in peripheral zones of the lung. The most common CT feature of COVID-19 was ground-glass opacity, found in 95.83% of patients, compared to 66.67% of CAP patients. CONCLUSION Diarrhoea, lymphocyte counts, eosinophil counts and CT findings (e.g. ground-glass opacity) could help to distinguish COVID-19 from CAP at an early stage of infection, based on findings from our fever observation ward.","Qian, Guoqing; Lin, Yuanwei; Chen, Xueqin; Ma, Ada Hoi Yan; Zhang, Xuehui; Li, Guoxiang; Ruan, Xinzhong; Ruan, Liemin",Singapore medical journal,https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2021004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472338/,91

This study was conducted at a ground crossing of North India to assess the implementation status of International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) at a ground crossing in the prevention and control of public health emergencies and to assess the risk of imported infections from a ground crossing. METHODS A qualitative study was conducted at the selected point of entry. The World Health Organization (WHO) core capacity assessment tool and in-depth interviews were used for data collection in the form of meetings and visits to isolation sites, and general observations were conducted regarding facilities on routine and other infrastructure and equipment that can be used during emergencies. Respondents were recruited using purposive methods. RESULTS The findings reveal that there is lack of awareness among the travelers, which increases the risks of spreading diseases. The overall implementation status at the ground crossing according to the assessment conducted using WHO Tool was 76%. It showed the need for further strengthening of the implementation at the site. Gaps were identified regarding the local capacity for handling chemical, radiological and nuclear hazards, and shortage of regular staff through stakeholders. CONCLUSION The findings from this study, as well as the suggestions and recommendations given by stakeholders, should help revise the current strategies of action. Hence, the gaps identified should be fulfilled to better respond to PHEIC at the ground crossings.","Singh, Rahuldeep; Sumit, Kumar; Hossain, Shaikh Shah",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2019.46; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507260/,91

In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), maintenance of pluripotency coincides with a poised chromatin state containing active and repressive histone modifications. However, the structural features of poised chromatin are largely uncharacterized. By adopting mild time-course MNase-seq with computational analysis, the low-compact chromatin in mESCs is featured in two groups: one in more open regions, corresponding to an active state, and the other enriched with bivalent histone modifications, considered the poised state. A parameter called the chromatin opening potential index (COPI) is also devised to quantify the transcription potential based on the dynamic changes of MNase-seq signals at promoter regions. Use of COPI provides effective prediction of gene activation potential and, more importantly, reveals a few developmental factors essential for mouse neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation.","Yu, Juan; Xiong, Chaoyang; Zhuo, Baowen; Wen, Zengqi; Shen, Jie; Liu, Cuifang; Chang, Luyuan; Wang, Kehui; Wang, Min; Wu, Chenyi; Wu, Xudong; Xu, Xueqin; Ruan, Haihe; Li, Guohong",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726618/,91

The incidence reported in the literature range from 1:60 to 1:250 pregnancies. The aim was to determine incidence and risk factors of ectopic pregnancy in the Gambia. Methodology A longitudinal study of ectopic pregnancy at Gambian tertiary hospital from January 2016 to April 2018. Data was collected from patients' folders, entered into SPSS version 20 and analysed with descriptive statistics. The test of variation and significance was by ANOVA and Chi-square respectively with error margin set at 0.05 and confidence interval of 95%. Results A total number of 2562 pregnancies were recorded, 43 were ectopic pregnancies. The estimated incidence was 0.2%. Majority of the patients were between 26 - 35 years (56%), primiparous (32%), heterogeneous marriage (82%) and housewives (86%). Occupation was not associated with ruptured or unruptured ectopic pregnancy (p-0.421). Low parity was associated with more ectopic pregnancy than high parity (p-0.001). The commonest clinical feature was abdominal pain (65.1%), whilst the most prominent risk factors were pelvic inflammatory disease (27.9%) and previous abortion (23.3%). Ectopic pregnancy was seasonal. Conclusion The incidence rate of 0.2% was in the range reported in the literature. Low parity, previous abortion and pelvic inflammatory disease were the risk factors.","Anyanwu, Matthew; Titilope, Grace",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.38; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394310/,91

Here we studied the stability of Nudaurelia capensis omega virus (NωV) virus-like particles (VLPs) in simulated GI fluids. NωV VLPs capsids and procapsids were transiently expressed in plants, the VLPs were incubated in various simulated GI fluids and their stability was determined by gel electrophoresis, density gradient ultracentrifugation and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the capsids were highly resistant to simulated gastric fluids at pH ≥3. Even under the harshest conditions, which consisted of a pepsin solution at pH 1.2, NωV capsids remained assembled as VLPs, though some digestion of the coat protein occurred. Moreover, 80.8% (±10.2%) stability was measured for NωV capsids upon 4 hours incubation in simulated intestinal fluids. The high resistance of this protein cage to digestion and denaturation can be attributed to its distinctively compact structure. The more porous form of the VLPs, the procapsid, was less stable under all conditions. Our results suggest that NωV VLPs capsids are likely to endure transit through the GI tract, designating them as promising candidate protein nanocages for oral drug delivery.","Berardi, Alberto; Castells-Graells, Roger; Lomonossoff, George P",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2020.08.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32805362/,91

126323,Hydrothermal duodenal mucosal resurfacing: a novel procedural therapy for metabolic disease.,2016,"BACKGROUND Achalasia is a rare, chronic, and morbid condition with evolving treatment. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has gained considerable popularity, but its comparative effectiveness is uncertain. We aim to evaluate the literature comparing POEM to Heller myotomy (HM) and pneumatic dilation (PD) for the treatment of achalasia. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of comparative studies between POEM and HM or PD. A priori outcomes pertained to efficacy, perioperative metrics, and safety. Internal validity of observational studies and randomized trials (RCTs) was judged using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, respectively. RESULTS From 1379 unique literature citations, we included 28 studies comparing POEM and HM (n = 21) or PD (n = 8), with only 1 RCT addressing each. Aside from two 4-year observational studies, POEM follow-up averaged ≤ 2 years. While POEM had similar efficacy to HM, POEM treated dysphagia better than PD both in an RCT (treatment ""success"" RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.34-2.17; 126 patients) and in observational studies (Eckardt score MD - 0.43, 95% CI - 0.71 to - 0.16; 5 studies; I2 21%; 405 patients). POEM needed reintervention less than PD in an RCT (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08-0.47; 126 patients) and HM in an observational study (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16, 0.68; 98 patients). Though 6-12 months patient-reported reflux was worse than PD in 3 observational studies (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.02-7.00; I2 0%; 164 patients), post-intervention reflux was inconsistently measured and not statistically different in measures ≥ 1 year. POEM had similar safety outcomes to both HM and PD, including treatment-related serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS POEM has similar outcomes to HM and greater efficacy than PD. Reflux remains a critical outcome with unknown long-term clinical significance due to insufficient data and inconsistent reporting.","Dirks, Rebecca C; Kohn, Geoffrey P; Slater, Bethany; Whiteside, Jake; Rodriguez, Noe A; Docimo, Salvatore; Pryor, Aurora; Stefanidis, Dimitrios",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08353-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655443/,91

The novel ready-to-use calcium-silicate-based root-canal sealer iRoot SP is widely used in root filling. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of iRoot SP on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in human stem cells from the apical papilla (hSCAPs). METHODS hSCAPs were isolated and characterized in vitro, then cultured with various concentrations of iRoot SP extract. Cell proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 assay, and scratch-wound-healing assays were performed to evaluate cell-migration capacity. hSCAPs were then cultured in osteogenic medium supplemented with iRoot SP extracts. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay was used to evaluate ALP enzyme levels. Alizarin red staining and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) assays were performed to assess calcified-nodule formation and matrix-calcium accumulation of hSCAPs. The mRNA and protein expression levels of the osteogenic markers OCN, OSX, Runx2, and DSPP were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and LSD-t tests. RESULTS iRoot SP at low concentrations (2, 0.2, and 0.02 mg/mL) is nontoxic to hSCAPs. iRoot SP at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/mL significantly increases cell-migration capacity. In terms of osteogenic differentiation, 0.2 mg/mL iRoot SP promotes intracellular ALP activity and the formation of mineralized nodules. Moreover, the expression of osteogenic markers at the mRNA and protein levels are upregulated by iRoot SP. CONCLUSION iRoot SP is an effective filling material for periapical bone regeneration.","Wu, Laidi; Xue, Kaiyang; Hu, Guang; Du, Hanman; Gan, Kang; Zhu, Juanfang; Du, Tianfeng",BMC oral health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-021-01769-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407774/,91

Objective. To map the trajectory of UL performance and its relationships to other factors post-stroke. Methods. Participants (n = 67) with first stroke and UL paresis were assessed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks after stroke. Assessments captured UL impairment (Fugl-Meyer), capacity for activity (Action Research Arm Test), and performance of activity in daily life (accelerometer variables of use ratio and hours of paretic limb activity), along with other potential modifying factors. We modeled individual trajectories of change for each measurement level and the moderating effects on UL performance trajectories. Results. Individual trajectories were best fit with a 3-parameter logistic model, capturing the rapid growth early after stroke within the longer data collection period. Plateaus (90% of asymptote) in impairment (bootstrap mean ± SE: 32 ± 4 days post-stroke) preceded those in capacity (41 ± 4 days). Plateau in performance, as measured by the use ratio (24 ± 5 days), tended to precede plateaus in impairment and capacity. Plateau in performance, as measured by hours of paretic activity (41 ± 6 days), occurred at a similar time to that of capacity and slightly lagged impairment. Modifiers of performance trajectories were capacity, concordance, UL rehabilitation, depressive symptomatology, and cognition. Conclusions. Upper limb performance in daily life approached plateau 3 to 6 weeks post-stroke. Individuals with stroke started to achieve a stable pattern of UL use in daily life early, often before neurological impairments and functional capacity started to stabilize.","Lang, Catherine E; Waddell, Kimberly J; Barth, Jessica; Holleran, Carey L; Strube, Michael J; Bland, Marghuretta D",Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,https://doi.org/10.1177/15459683211041302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34510934/,91

The current assessment of COPD requires a maximal maneuver during a spirometry test to quantify airflow limitations of patients. Other less invasive measurements such as thoracic bioimpedance and myographic signals have been studied as an alternative to classical methods as they provide information about respiration. Particularly, strong correlations have been shown between thoracic bioimpedance and respiratory volume. The main objective of this study is to investigate bioimpedance and its combination with myographic parameters in COPD patients to assess the applicability in respiratory disease monitoring. We measured bioimpedance, surface electromyography and surface mechanomyography in forty-three COPD patients during an incremental inspiratory threshold loading protocol. We introduced two novel features that can be used to assess COPD condition derived from the variation of bioimpedance and the electrical and mechanical activity during each respiratory cycle. These features demonstrate significant differences between mild and severe patients, indicating a lower inspiratory contribution of the inspiratory muscles to global respiratory ventilation in the severest COPD patients. In conclusion, the combination of bioimpedance and myographic signals provides useful indices to noninvasively assess the breathing of COPD patients.","Blanco-Almazan, Dolores; Groenendaal, Willemijn; Lozano-Garcia, Manuel; Estrada-Petrocelli, Luis; Lijnen, Lien; Smeets, Christophe; Ruttens, David; Catthoor, Francky; Jane, Raimon",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2020.2998009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32746014/,91

DESIGN Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING Two Italian referral centres for gynaecological minimally invasive surgery. POPULATION Consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy. METHODS Tissue extraction was accomplished following laparoscopic myomectomy in a specimen retrieval bag via a posterior colpotomy incision. If morcellation was necessary, this was performed extracorporeally, using a scalpel within the specimen retrieval pouch, whose edges were exteriorised through the vaginal introitus. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Intra- and postoperative complications. RESULTS A total of 316 women underwent transvaginal specimen retrieval with enclosed manual morcellation. The mean myomectomy specimen weight was 154 ± 128 g, and the mean operative time was 79 ± 26 minutes. No intraoperative complications occurred related to the specimen extraction or morcellation technique, or from rupture of the retrieval bag. Two (0.6%) women had a haemoperitoneum that spontaneously resolved and 16 (5.1%) had fever postoperatively. The final pathological diagnosis was benign in all cases. At the 30-day follow-up, no pelvic infection, vaginal dehiscence, or complaints of dyspareunia were recorded. CONCLUSIONS Contained transvaginal extraction of fibroid specimens can be performed safely and efficiently in most women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy.

The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of stapling of a difficult CD in acute cholecystitis using Endo-GIA. From January 2008 to June 2012, 1441 patients with cholelithiasis underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) at the Department of General Surgery, Haydarpasa Numune Education and Research Hospital. Of these, 19 (0.62%) were identified as having a difficult CD and were ligated using an Endo-GIA stapler. All patients were successfully treated with a laparoscopic approach. The length of hospital stay was 3.4 days. There were umbilical wound infections in 4 patients (21%). The length of follow-up ranged from 1.0 to 50.4 months. In conclusion, Endo-GIA is a safe and easy treatment method for patients with a dilated and difficult CD. The cystic artery should be isolated and ligated if possible before firing the Endo-GIA stapler. If isolation and stapling are not possible, fibrin sealant can be applied to avoid bleeding. The vascular Endo-GIA can be applied in a large CD, but for acute cholecystitis with an edematous CD, the Endo-GIA roticulator 4.8 or 3.5 stapler is preferred.","Odabasi, Mehmet; Muftuoglu, M A Tolga; Ozkan, Erkan; Eris, Cengiz; Yildiz, Mehmet Kamil; Gunay, Emre; Abuoglu, Haci Hasan; Tekesin, Kemal; Akbulut, Sami",International surgery,https://doi.org/10.9738/intsurg-d-14-00035.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25216423/,91

We aimed to discover how elderly people coped with the psychological burdens of pandemic and the social isolation in Hungary. METHODS This study included 589 (441 females) Hungarian individuals, aged 60-83 (M = 68.1, SD = 4.46). We collected online survey data to reach a wide population of elderly. Results of hierarchical linear modelling and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses established how the current life-changing circumstances, the intolerance of uncertainty, loneliness and social support influence the mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, well-being) of the elderly. The model was used to explore how adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the effects. RESULTS Findings showed that perceived change in mood, social connectedness, and quality of life was negatively affected by catastrophizing and loneliness; whereas positive refocusing and contamination fear had a positive effect. According to the SEM analysis, intolerance of uncertainty and loneliness directly affected mental health. Further, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the connection between intolerance of uncertainty, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. Whereas adaptive emotion regulation strategy mediated the connection between social support from friends, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. CONCLUSION Overall, our research might help the understanding of how external and internal factors contributed to the well-being of elderly people during the COVID-19.

In general, they produce a mild clinical presentation consisting of an upper respiratory tract infection that does not usually infect the lungs, with the exception of preterm infants and children with chronic diseases. These infections exceptionally affect other organs (heart, brain, gastrointestinal tract), thus increasing their severity. In relation to the temporal coincidence with the beginning of the current situation of pandemic by the new beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for its associated disease (COVID-19), this study presents a clinical case of a 5-year-old patient showing multiple-organ failure and neurological sequelae due to bulbar injury and vascular thrombosis caused by an alpha coronavirus (CoV-NL63) due to its severity and exceptionality.","López Álvarez, José M; Quiralte Castillo, Joaquín; Pérez Quevedo, Olivia; Rubio García, Jano; Pérez González, Carmen; Lorenzo Villegasd, Dionisio L",Archivos argentinos de pediatria,https://doi.org/10.5546/aap.2021.eng.e252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34033432/,91
129291,Fabrication of a gradient hydrophobic surface with parallel ridges on pyrolytic carbon for artificial heart valves.,2021-06-02,"Background Our previous study found that urinary trypsin inhibitor (ulinastatin, UTI) protected tight junctions (TJs) of lung endothelia via TNF-α inhibition, thereby alleviating pulmonary capillary permeability in septic rats. As the activated macrophage is the main source of TNF-α in sepsis, we speculate that UTI may exert the above effects by regulating the functions of macrophages. Methods Bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) were divided into control, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), UTI+LPS and UTI groups. TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-10, CD86, CD206 and MCP-1 expression were assessed by Western blot. The phagocytosis and migration of BMDM were detected. Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were cultured with the conditioned medium (CM) from each group of BMDM above. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sham, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and UTI+CLP groups. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detected zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin and claudin-5 expression in PMVECs, as well as TNF-α, TGF-β, iNOS, CD86 and CD206 expression in lungs. Pulmonary capillary permeability was assessed by extravasated Evans blue, lung injury score (LIS), wet-to-dry weight ratio and electron microscope. Results TNF-α and CD86 expression were increased in LPS-treated BMDM, but were reversed by UTI pretreatment. TGF-β, IL-10 and CD206 expression were the opposite. UTI markedly decreased phagocytosis and migration of LPS-treated BMDM. ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5 expression were markedly decreased in PMVECs of the CM-LPS group, but significantly increased in the CM-UTI+LPS group. TNF-α, iNOS and CD86 expression were increased in the lungs of CLP-rats but decreased with UTI pretreatment, while TGF-β and CD206 expression were the opposite. UTI markedly ameliorated the lung EB leakage, improved LIS, reduced the wet-to-dry ratio and revised the damaged TJs of PMVECs in CLP-rats. Conclusion UTI effectively inhibits the conversion of M1 macrophage but increases M2, reduces the phagocytosis and migration, which helps to protect endothelia TJs and reduce pulmonary capillary permeability during sepsis.","Wang, Ruijie; Song, Wenliang; Xie, Chengyuan; Zhong, Wenhong; Xu, Hui; Zhou, Qiuping; Deng, Yiyu; Hong, Yimei; Li, Xin; Fang, Ming",Journal of inflammation research,https://doi.org/10.2147/jir.s303577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045879/,91
129438,Artificial intelligence in myopia: current and future trends.,2021-07-26,"OBJECTIVES Taste changes are common among paediatric patients receiving cancer treatments although specific descriptions and associations are uncertain. Primary objective was to describe the number of paediatric patients receiving cancer therapies who experienced taste changes, its impact on food intake and enjoyment of eating, and coping strategies. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study that included English-speaking paediatric patients aged 4-18 years with a diagnosis of cancer or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients receiving active treatment. Using a structured interview, we asked participants about their experience with taste changes, impacts and coping strategies. The respondent was the paediatric patient. RESULTS We enrolled 108 patients; median age was 11 years (IQR 8-15). The taste changes reported yesterday or today were food tasting bland (34%), bad (31%), different (27%), bitter (25%), extreme (19%), metallic (15%) or sour (12%). Taste changes were associated with decreased food intake (31%) and decreased enjoyment in eating (25%) yesterday or today. The most common coping strategies were eating food they liked (42%), eating strong-tasting food (39%), drinking liquids (35%), brushing teeth (31%) and sucking on candy (25%). Factors significantly associated with food tasting bad were as follows: older age (p=0.003), shorter time since cancer diagnosis (p=0.027), nausea and vomiting (p=0.008) and mucositis (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS Among paediatric patients receiving cancer treatments, taste changes were common and were associated with decreased food intake and enjoyment in eating. Common coping strategies were described. Reducing nausea, vomiting and mucositis may improve taste changes.","Loves, Robyn; Green, Gloria; Joseph-Frederick, Zakia; Palmert, Sasha; Plenert, Erin; Schechter, Tal; Tomlinson, Deborah; Vettese, Emily; Zahra, Serena; Zupanec, Sue; Dupuis, L Lee; Sung, Lillian",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2021-002951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34049968/,91
129576,Effect of generation rate on transient photoconductivity of semi-insulating 4H-SiC.,2020-07-17,"BACKGROUND In a previous article ( https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-019-03888-3 ), preliminary results of a survey, aiming to shed light on the number of surgical procedures performed and assisted during neurosurgery residency in Europe were reported. We here present the final results and extend the analyses. METHODS Board-certified neurosurgeons of European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) member countries were asked to review their residency case logs and participate in a 31-question electronic survey (SurveyMonkey Inc., San Mateo, CA). The responses received between April 25, 2018, and April 25, 2020, were considered. We excluded responses that were incomplete, from non-EANS member countries, or from respondents that have not yet completed their residency. RESULTS Of 430 responses, 168 were considered for analysis after checking in- and exclusion criteria. Survey responders had a mean age of 42.7 ± 8.8 years, and 88.8% were male. Responses mainly came from surgeons employed at university/teaching hospitals (85.1%) in Germany (22.0%), France (12.5%), the United Kingdom (UK; 8.3%), Switzerland (7.7%), and Greece (7.1%). Most responders graduated in the years between 2011 and 2019 (57.7%). Thirty-eight responders (22.6%) graduated before and 130 responders (77.4%) after the European WTD 2003/88/EC came into effect. The mean number of surgical procedures performed independently, supervised or assisted throughout residency was 540 (95% CI 424-657), 482 (95% CI 398-568), and 579 (95% CI 441-717), respectively. Detailed numbers for cranial, spinal, adult, and pediatric subgroups are presented in the article. There was an annual decrease of about 33 cases in total caseload between 1976 and 2019 (coeff. - 33, 95% CI - 62 to - 4, p = 0.025). Variables associated with lesser total caseload during residency were training abroad (1210 vs. 1747, p = 0.083) and female sex by trend (947 vs. 1671, p = 0.111), whereas case numbers were comparable across the EANS countries (p = 0.443). CONCLUSION The final results of this survey largely confirm the previously reported numbers. They provide an opportunity for current trainees to compare their own case logs with. Again, we confirm a significant decline in surgical exposure during training between 1976 and 2019. In addition, the current analysis reveals that female sex and training abroad may be variables associated with lesser case numbers during residency.","Stienen, Martin N; Freyschlag, Christian F; Schaller, Karl; Meling, Torstein",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04513-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803372/,91

129814,"Philip B. Clement, M.D. Reflections on a Rewarding 50 Year Career in Gynecologic Pathology: An Interview With Robert H. Young.",2020-09-01,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has transformed the way we work, with many employees working under isolating and difficult conditions. However, research on the antecedents, consequences, and buffers of work loneliness is scarce. Integrating research on need for belonging, regulatory loop models of loneliness, and self-compassion, the current study addresses this critical issue by developing and testing a conceptual model that highlights how COVID-related stressors frustrate employees' need for belonging (i.e., telecommuting frequency, job insecurity, and a lack of COVID-related informational justice), negatively impacting worker well-being (i.e., depression) and helping behaviors [i.e., organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)] through work loneliness. Furthermore, we examine the buffering role of self-compassion in this process. Results from a weekly diary study of U.S. employees conducted over 2 months during the initial stage of the pandemic provide support for the mediating role of work loneliness in relations between all three proposed antecedents and both outcomes. In addition, self-compassion mitigated the positive within-person relationship between work loneliness and employee depression, indicating that more self-compassionate employees were better able to cope with their feelings of work loneliness. Although self-compassion also moderated the within-person relationship between work loneliness and OCB, this interaction was different in form from our prediction. Implications for enhancing employee well-being and helping behaviors during and beyond the pandemic are discussed.

Six newborn calves were inoculated orally with Jena virus (JV), a bovine norovirus GIII.1 strain, and six calves served as mock-inoculated controls. Following infection, calves were euthanized before the onset of diarrhea (12 h postinoculation [hpi]), shortly after the onset of diarrhea (18 to 21 hpi), and postconvalescence (4 days pi [dpi]). Calves inoculated with JV developed severe watery diarrhea at 14 to 16 hpi, and this symptom lasted for 53.5 to 67.0 h. Intestinal lesions were characterized by severe villus atrophy together with loss and attenuation of villus epithelium. Viral capsid antigen (JV antigen) was detected by immunohistochemistry in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells on villi. In addition, granular material positive for JV antigen was detected in the lamina propria of villi. Lesions first appeared at 12 hpi and were most extensive at 18 to 19 hpi, extending from midjejunum to ileum. The intestinal mucosa had completely recovered at 4 dpi. There was no indication of systemic infection as described for norovirus infection in mice. JV was found in intestinal contents by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as early as 12 hpi. Fecal shedding of the virus started at 13 hpi and stopped at 23 hpi or at necropsy (4 dpi), respectively. Throughout the trial, none of the control calves tested positive for JV by ELISA or RT-PCR.","Otto, Peter H; Clarke, Ian N; Lambden, Paul R; Salim, Omar; Reetz, Jochen; Liebler-Tenorio, Elisabeth M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05342-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21880760/,91

We consider whether the Protection of Personal Information Act in South Africa will conflict with or complement existing protections in health law and research ethics. The Act is not applicable to de-identified samples that cannot be re-identified but we question whether genetic samples can ever be truly de-identified. The research participants in this matter provided consent for use of their samples for research but did not consent to commercialisation by global research institutions, and neither did the researchers. We suggest that consent models incorporating broad consent as an option should include explicit discussions around benefit-sharing and commercialisation.

Targeting the kynurenine pathway to modify disease outcomes has been trialled pharmacologically, but the evidence of non-pharmacological means (ie, exercise) remains unclear. Objective We aim to assess the evidence of the effects of exercise on the kynurenine pathway and psychological outcomes. Methods Under Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMCARE, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials. The main outcomes were changes in kynurenine pathway metabolite levels and psychological outcomes. Results Six studies were analyzed (total n = 379) with exercise demonstrating significant concomitant effects on kynurenine pathway metabolite levels and associated psychological outcomes in domains of somatization, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion Exercise has significant concomitant effect on kynurenine pathway metabolite levels and psychological outcomes. However, clear limitations exist in determining if the changes in the kynurenine pathway can fully explain the changes in psychological outcomes, or whether different diseases and exercise interventions act as confounding factors.","Lim, Anthony; Harijanto, Christel; Vogrin, Sara; Guillemin, Gilles; Duque, Gustavo",International journal of tryptophan research : IJTR,https://doi.org/10.1177/1178646921991119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33613029/,91

Re-education rather than indiscriminate elimination of these fibroblasts has emerged as a new strategy for combination therapy. Here, we studied the effects of global loss of pro-fibrotic non-coding regulatory microRNA-21 (miR-21) in K-Ras-driven p53-deleted genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC. Strikingly, loss of miR-21 accelerated tumor initiation via mucinous cystic neoplastic lesions and progression to locally advanced invasive carcinoma from which animals precipitously succumbed at an early age. The absence of tumor-restraining myofibroblasts and a massive infiltrate of immune cells were salient phenotypic features of global miR-21 loss. Stromal miR-21 activity was required for induction of tumor-restraining myofibroblasts in in-vivo isograft transplantation experiments. Low miR-21 expression negatively correlated with a fibroblast gene expression signature and positively with an immune cell gene expression signature in TCGA PDAC data set (n = 156) mirroring findings in the mouse models. Our results exposed an overall tumor suppressive function of miR-21 in in-vivo PDAC models. These results have important clinical implications for anti-miR-21-based inhibitory therapeutic approaches under consideration for PDAC and other cancer types. Mechanistic dissection of the cell-intrinsic role of miR-21 in cancer-associated fibroblasts and other cell types will be needed to inform best strategies for pharmacological modulation of miR-21 activity in order to remodel the tumor microenvironment and enhance treatment response in PDAC.

METHODS A prospective randomized crossover study using experienced and inexperienced neonatal intubators. All participants were shown an educational video on intubation with each device, followed by attempt of the procedure. The time for successful intubation was the primary outcome. RESULTS Seven subjects comprised the experienced group, while 10 individuals were in the inexperienced group. The overall intubation success rate was comparable between both devices (53% vs 26%, P = 0.09); however, mean time to intubate with the conventional laryngoscope was faster (25.5 vs 39.4 s, P = 0.02). Although both groups intubated faster with DL, it only reached statistical significance in the inexperienced group (27.0 vs 48.7 s, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Conventional DL and videolaryngoscopy are suitable modes for intubating extremely preterm baboons.

Emerging endovascular devices have helped in the successful restoration of flow for acute limb ischemia in both native arteries as well as bypass grafts. One such device, the Trellis thrombectomy system is being used more frequently in this setting. The device has previously been used in veins, native arteries, and rarely in aortofemoral grafts. We present its first successful use for the treatment of occluded AXF bypass graft. The use of this device helped to isolate the treatment zone in the occluded graft, which allowed the use of a lower dose of thrombolytics, less systemic release of thrombolytics, and less distal embolization. Resolution of extensive clot burden was achieved and, with subsequent stenting of the graft at the distal anastomotic site, arterial flow to the leg through the AXF graft was restored and a revision surgery was avoided.","Wayangankar, Siddharth; Patel, Jigar; Hennebry, Thomas A",Vascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1358863x13477233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439777/,91

PARTICIPANTS Between January 2002 and June 2015, a total of 134 patients were submitted with a mean age (SD) of 55 years (16) of which 69 (51%) were men. We included all patients undergoing surgery who presented with an anterior mediastinal mass and underwent PET/CT. PET/CT was considered positive for any reported avidity as stated in the official report and the reference was the resected specimen reported by histopathology using WHO criteria. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predicted values of [18F]-FDG PET in determining malignant aetiology for an anterior mediastinal mass. RESULTS The sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT to correctly classify malignant disease were 83% (95% CI 74 to 89) and 58% (95% CI 37 to 78). The positive and negative predictive values were 90% (95% CI 83% to 95%) and 42% (95% CI 26% to 61%). CONCLUSIONS The results of our study suggest reasonable sensitivity but no specificity implying that a negative PET/CT is useful to rule out the diagnosis of malignant disease whereas a positive result has no value in the discrimination between malignant and benign diseases of the anterior mediastinum.","Proli, Chiara; De Sousa, Paulo; Jordan, Simon; Anikin, Vladimir; Devaraj, Anand; Love, Susannah M; Shackcloth, Michael; Kostoulas, Nikolaos; Papagiannopoulos, Kostas; Haqzad, Yama; Loubani, Mahmoud; Sellitri, Francesco; Granato, Felice; Bush, Alexander; Marchbank, Adrian; Iyer, Swetha; Scarci, Marco; Lim, Eric",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29437755/,91

METHODS The extent of PAS involvement in the eyes of patients with angle closure was assessed by indentation gonioscopy, and the part of non-PAS and PAS were assigned into two groups (NPAS and PAS). Anterior chamber angles were then imaged by AS-OCT with light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation directly into the pupils, leading to pupillary constriction and increasing anterior chamber angle width. Parameters including the angle opening distance at 750 μm anterior to the scleral spur (AOD750) and trabecular-iris space area at 750 μm anterior to the scleral spur (TISA750) were then obtained. The differences before and after LED irradiation of AOD750 and TISA750 were calculated and used to generate a PAS model based on binary logistic regression. Validation data were then tested. RESULTS A total of 258 AS-OCT images in 14 eyes were assigned to the modeling data, and 120 were assigned to the validation data. There were no differences in AOD750 and TISA750 in the dark between NPAS and PAS (PAOD750 = 0.258, PTISA750 = 0.486), whereas after LED light exposure, TISA750light was larger in NPAS than in PAS (P = 0.047). The light-dark differences of both parameters showed significant differences between the two groups (PAOD750dif = 0.019, PTISA750dif < 0.001). The area under the curve of the model performance was 0.841, and the overall correct rate was 80.8% based on the validation data.

METHODS Four ANs were dissected combining the deltopectoral approach-medial to the CJ (A), the deltopectoral approach-lateral to the CJT (B) and the axillary approach (C) in 3 sequences: A-B-C, B-A-C, and C-B-A. After the first approach was completed, the proximal and distal margins were marked. Additional exposure with the second and third approaches and the 6 o'clock position were also marked. Then, the AN was excised and the amount of exposed nerve with the 3 approaches was measured. RESULTS The deltopectoral approach-medial to the conjoint tendon did not allow exposure of the AN at the 6 o'clock position. Six o'clock position exposure was accomplished using the lateral interval of the deltopectoral and the axillary approaches. A deltopectoral approach lateral to the CJT allowed exploration of the AN at the blind spot, but not the terminal branches. The axillary approach was able to expose the AN at the 6 o'clock position, the terminal branches, but not the nerve-muscle junction. Combining the 3 approaches exposed 81% to 94% of the total length of the AN. CONCLUSIONS The deltopectoral approach allowed visualization of the AN at the 6 o'clock position when explored lateral to the CJT. The axillary approach allowed visualization of the terminal branches of the AN and the 6 o'clock position of the glenoid. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The deltopectoral approach lateral to the conjoint tendon allows the surgeon to assess continuity of the AN at the 6-o'clock position and to perform a neurolysis. If nerve repair, nerve grafting, or nerve transfer is attempted, a combination of the 3 approaches could be used.","Pérez, Alfonso; Mahmood, Bilal; Jethanandani, Rishabh; Lee, Steve K; Wolfe, Scott W",The Journal of hand surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhsa.2019.11.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31948705/,91

133958,Toward the Next-Generation COVID-19 Vaccines That Circumvent Antigenic Drift while Defusing Viral Infection.,2021-04-09,"BACKGROUND When repairing an abdominal wall defect, sometimes a prosthetic mesh needs to be placed directly on the parietal peritoneum. Although the standard mesh for this purpose is the laminar implant expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), it is gradually being replaced by the laminar collagen-based meshes. This study was designed to assess the intraperitoneal behavior of three of these biomeshes, mainly in terms of their susceptibility to adhesion formation. METHODS Two 3-cm × 3-cm fragments of prosthetic material were placed on the parietal peritoneum in male New Zealand White rabbits in the following combinations: PTFE and CollaMend(®), PTFE and Permacol(®), or PTFE and Surgisis(®). The meshes were fixed at the four corners with individual 4/0 polypropylene sutures. Adhesion formation was quantified by sequential laparoscopy and image analysis performed at 3, 7, 14, and 90 days postimplant. All animals were killed at 90 days and the mesh specimens were subjected to microscopy and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Intensely vascularized adhesions to all the implants were observed, although Surgisis showed the lowest percentage of adhesions at each follow-up time. Adhesions had stabilized by 7-14 days. The PTFE meshes were enveloped by a layer of macrophages and connective tissue, bounded by a monolayer of mesothelial cells. Permacol and CollaMend showed similar histological behavior, including cell ingrowth through their fenestrations with no signs of degradation detected at 90 days. In contrast, the Surgisis mesh at 90 days was practically replaced with neoformed tissue. CONCLUSIONS No difference in susceptibility to adhesion formation was noted in the crosslinked collagen meshes compared to PTFE meshes. The noncrosslinked collagen mesh Surgisis showed the best behavior in that it induced fewer adhesions. Ninety days after implant, a more intense macrophage response was observed in CollaMend and Permacol than in PTFE or Surgisis.","Bellón, Juan M; Rodríguez, Marta; Gómez-Gil, Verónica; Sotomayor, Sandra; Buján, Julia; Pascual, Gemma",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1823-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21789645/,91

The catheter is externalized when initiation of dialysis is required. Details of the surgical procedure and management of associated complications are generally lacking. METHODS A total of 84 catheters including conventional and extended catheters were embedded and externalized during the study period. Factors influencing duration of embedment, functionality upon externalization, and long-term outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Mean duration of embedment was 13.9 months (median 9.4; range .5 to 68.5). Immediate function was exhibited in 85.7% of catheters. Employing laparoscopic revision, 98.8% of embedded catheters were successfully used for peritoneal dialysis. Extended catheters and duration of embedment were important determinants of catheter functionality. CONCLUSIONS Catheters can be embedded for prolonged periods and still result in functional dialysis access when needed. Complications are few and easily managed.","Crabtree, John H; Burchette, Raoul J",American journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2013.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23856085/,91
134914,MALT1 as a promising target to treat lymphoma and other diseases related to MALT1 anomalies.,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND Respiratory compromise (RC) including hypoxia and hypoventilation is likely to be missed in the postoperative period. Integrated pulmonary index (IPI) is a comprehensive respiratory parameter evaluating ventilation and oxygenation. It is calculated from four parameters: end-tidal carbon dioxide, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2), and pulse rate. We hypothesized that IPI monitoring can help predict the occurrence of RC in patients at high-risk of hypoventilation in post-anesthesia care units (PACUs). METHODS This prospective observational study was conducted in two centers and included older adults (≥ 75-year-old) or obese (body mass index ≥ 28) patients who were at high-risk of hypoventilation. Monitoring was started on admission to the PACU after elective surgery under general anesthesia. We investigated the onset of RC defined as respiratory events with prolonged stay in the PACU or transfer to the intensive care units; airway narrowing, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, wheezing, apnea, and any other events that were judged to require interventions. We evaluated the relationship between several initial parameters in the PACU and the occurrence of RC. Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between IPI fluctuation during PACU stay and the occurrences of RC using individual standard deviations of the IPI every five minutes (IPI-SDs). RESULTS In total, 288 patients were included (199 elderly, 66 obese, and 23 elderly and obese). Among them, 18 patients (6.3 %) developed RC. The initial IPI and SpO2 values in the PACU in the RC group were significantly lower than those in the non-RC group (6.7 ± 2.5 vs. 9.0 ± 1.3, p < 0.001 and 95.9 ± 4.2 % vs. 98.3 ± 1.9 %, p = 0.040, respectively). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) to evaluate their ability to predict RC. The AUCs of the IPI and SpO2 were 0.80 (0.69-0.91) and 0.64 (0.48-0.80), respectively. The IPI-SD, evaluating fluctuation, was significantly greater in the RC group than in the non-RC group (1.47 ± 0.74 vs. 0.93 ± 0.74, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that low value of the initial IPI and the fluctuating IPI after admission to the PACU predict the occurrence of RC. The IPI might be useful for respiratory monitoring in PACUs and ICUs after general anesthesia.","Kuroe, Yasutoshi; Mihara, Yuko; Okahara, Shuji; Ishii, Kenzo; Kanazawa, Tomoyuki; Morimatsu, Hiroshi",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-021-01338-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882856/,91

The current trial was designed to investigate the effects of ALA supplementation on some oxidative stress biomarkers in women with GDM. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty women with GDM at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy were selected and then they were divided into the drug (n = 30) received ALA 300 mg/day for 8 weeks and the placebo (n = 30) groups. Serum values of fasting blood sugar (FBS), thiol groups, glutathione, catalase, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. Values of the oxidative stress index (OSI), the MDA/TAC ratio and total antioxidant gap (TAG) were calculated. RESULTS After the intervention values of FBS (p = .001), TAC (p < .001), OSI (p = .003), TAG (p = .001) and catalase (p < .001) were improved significantly in the drug group. Values of TOS (p = .070) and glutathione (p = .088) were improved marginally in the drug group.

Forced-suction thrombectomy (FST) involves aspirating clots through the same reperfusion catheter using only a syringe, decreasing the procedure time and supplies needed. OBJECTIVE To evaluate multiple combinations of catheters and syringes to determine the optimal pairing for use in FST. METHODS Tests were performed using both the Penumbra system and syringes to aspirate water through Penumbra 0.041 inch (041), 4Max, 0.054 inch (054) and 5Max reperfusion catheters and a shuttle sheath. Dynamic pressure and flow at the catheter tip were calculated from the fill times for each system. Static pressure and force for each aspiration source were determined with a vacuum gauge. RESULTS All syringes provided significantly higher dynamic pressure at the catheter tip than the Penumbra system (p<0.001). Increasing syringe volume significantly increased static pressure (p<0.001). Both flow and aspiration force significantly increased with catheter size (p<0.001). Cases are presented to demonstrate the clinical value of the laboratory principles. CONCLUSIONS Maximizing static and dynamic pressure when performing FST is achieved by aspirating with a syringe possessing both the largest volume and the largest inlet diameter available. Maximizing aspiration force and flow rate is achieved by using the largest catheter possible.","Simon, Scott Douglas; Grey, Casey Paul",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2012-010638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23531712/,91

Moreover, psychopathological implications seem to last also after patients' discharge. Our goal is to investigate the psychological impact and psychopathological outcome of patients affected by COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS We have engaged 34 patients with COVID-19 conditions [eight of them were healthcare workers patients (HCW)] hospitalized at ""Policlinico Gemelli Foundation"" of Rome, Italy. All patients were evaluated through the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R) first, during their hospitalization (baseline), and then, after 4 months from hospital discharge (follow-up), through phone interviews. RESULTS At baseline, 82% of patients revealed from mild to severe psychological impact of COVID-19, according to the IES-R. At follow-up, the mean IES-R total score was significantly decreased (p<0.001) even if almost half (46.6%) of our cohort still showed it. HCW patients showed a significantly higher score than other patients at IES-R scale, both at baseline (p=0.005) and at follow-up (p<0.001). Moreover, at 4 months from discharge, they showed a significantly higher percentage of moderate and severe distress (p=0.015). In addition to this, at follow-up, our cohort of patients showed an increase of anxiety symptoms, even if not significant compared to baseline (46.7% vs. 35.3% respectively; p=1.000), and HCW patients suffered more sleep disorders (p=0.019) and anxiety symptoms (p=0.019) compared to other patients. CONCLUSIONS We indicate the importance of assessing psychopathology of COVID-19 survivors, monitoring their changes over time, and providing psychological support to improve their psychological well-being.","Chieffo, D P R; Delle Donne, V; Massaroni, V; Mastrilli, L; Belella, D; Monti, L; Silveri, M C; Cauda, R",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202011_23858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275271/,91
135672,Interhemispheric symmetry of µ-rhythm phase-dependency of corticospinal excitability.,2020-05-12,"Objective: To evaluate the hypothesis that light could reduce the lethality of COVID-19. Methods: Most models for projections of the spread and lethality of COVID-19 take into account the ambient temperature, neglecting light. Recent advances in understanding the mechanism of action of COVID-19 have shown that it causes a systemic infection that significantly affects the hematopoietic system and hemostasis, factors extremely dependent of light, mainly in the region of visible and infrared radiation. Results: In the COVID-19 patients hemoglobin is decreasing and protoporphyrin is increasing, generating an extremely harmful accumulation of iron ions in the bloodstream, which are able to induce an intense inflammatory process in the body with a consequent increase in C-reactive protein and albumin. Observing the unsaturation characteristics of the cyclic porphyrin ring allows it to absorb and emit radiation mainly in the visible region. This characteristic can represent an important differential to change this process in the event of an imbalance in this system, through the photobiomodulation to increase the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using red and near-infrared radiation (R-NIR) and vitamin D using ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. These two compounds have the primary role of activating the defense mechanisms of the immune system, enabling greater resistance of the individual against the attack by the virus. According to the theory of electron excitation in photosensitive molecules, similar to hemoglobin heme, after the photon absorption there would be an increase in the stability of the iron ion bond with the center of the pyrrole ring, preventing the losses of heme function oxygen transport (HbO2). The light is also absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase in the R-NIR region, with a consequent increase in electron transport, regulating enzyme activity and resulting in a significant increase of oxygen rate consumption by mitochondria, increasing ATP production. Conclusions: The most favorable range of optical radiation to operate in this system is between R-NIR region, in which cytochrome c oxidase and porphyrin present absorption peaks centered at 640 nm and HbO2 with absorption peak centered at 900 nm. Based on the mechanisms described earlier, our hypothesis is that light could reduce the lethality of COVID-19.","Fernandes, Adriana Barrinha; Lima, Carlos José de; Villaverde, Antônio G J Balbin; Pereira, Pamela Camila; Carvalho, Henrique Cunha; Zângaro, Renato Amaro","Photobiomodulation, photomedicine, and laser surgery",https://doi.org/10.1089/photob.2020.4882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32579049/,91
135714,Redox modification of ryanodine receptor contributes to impaired Ca2+ homeostasis and exacerbates muscle atrophy under high altitude.,2020-09-08,"OBJECTIVES Sepsis is characterised by the frequent presence of organ failure and marked immunologic alterations. We studied the association between the extent of organ failure and the transcriptomic response of septic patients. METHODS Gene expression profiles in the blood of 74 surgical patients with sepsis were compared with those of 30 surgical patients with no sepsis. Differentially expressed genes were assessed for their correlation with the sequential organ failure (SOFA) score. RESULTS The expression levels of a group of genes participating in the cell cycle (HIST1H1C, CKS2, CCNA2, CDK1, CCNB2, CIT, CCNB1, AURKA, RAD51), neutrophil protease activity (ELANE, ADORA3, MPO, MMP8, CTSG), IL-1R and IL-18R response correlated directly with SOFA and mortality. Genes involved in T cell (LCK, CD3G, CD3D, ZAP70, ICOS, CD3E, CD28, IL2RB, CD8B, CD8A, CD40LG, IL23A, CCL5, SH2D1A, ITK, CD247, TBX21, GATA3, CCR7, LEF1, STAT4) and NK cell immunity (CD244, KLRK1, KLRD1) were inversely associated with SOFA and mortality. CONCLUSIONS The extent of organ failure in sepsis correlates directly with the existence of imbalanced innate and adaptive responses at the transcriptomic level. Quantification of the expression levels of the genes identified here could contribute to the simultaneous assessment of disease severity and immunological alterations in sepsis.","Almansa, Raquel; Heredia-Rodríguez, María; Gomez-Sanchez, Esther; Andaluz-Ojeda, David; Iglesias, Verónica; Rico, Lucia; Ortega, Alicia; Gomez-Pesquera, Estefanía; Liu, Pilar; Aragón, Marta; Eiros, Jose Maria; Jiménez-Sousa, Maria Ángeles; Resino, Salvador; Gómez-Herreras, Ignacio; Bermejo-Martín, Jesús F; Tamayo, Eduardo",The Journal of infection,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2014.12.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25557485/,91

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analyses was to investigate whether postoperative respiratory interventions and mobilization interventions compared with usual care can prevent postoperative complications following abdominal surgery. METHODS The review was conducted in line with PRISMA and GRADE guidelines. MEDLINE, Embase, and PEDRO were searched for randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing postoperative respiratory interventions and mobilization interventions with usual care in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Meta-analyses with trial sequential analysis on the outcome pulmonary complications were performed. Review registration: PROSPERO (identifier: CRD42019133629) RESULTS: Pulmonary complications were addressed in 25 studies containing 2068 patients. Twenty-three studies were included in the meta-analyses. Patients predominantly underwent open elective upper abdominal surgery. Postoperative respiratory interventions consisted of expiratory resistance modalities (CPAP, EPAP, BiPAP, NIV), assisted inspiratory flow modalities (IPPB, IPAP), patient-operated ventilation modalities (spirometry, PEP), and structured breathing exercises. Meta-analyses found that ventilation with high expiratory resistance (CPAP, EPAP, BiPAP, NIV) reduced the risk of pulmonary complications with OR 0.42 (95% CI 0.18-0.97, p = 0.04, I2 = 0%) compared with usual care, however, the trial sequential analysis revealed that the required information size was not met. Neither postoperative assisted inspiratory flow therapy, patient-operated ventilation modalities, nor breathing exercises reduced the risk of pulmonary complications. CONCLUSION The use of postoperative expiratory resistance modalities (CPAP, EPAP, BiPAP, NIV) after abdominal surgery might prevent pulmonary complications and it seems the preventive abilities were largely driven by postoperative treatment with CPAP.","Kokotovic, Dunja; Berkfors, Adam; Gögenur, Ismail; Ekeloef, Sarah; Burcharth, Jakob",European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00068-020-01522-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026459/,91

OBJECTIVE To compare prevalence of comorbidities in immigrants and long-term residents at MS diagnosis, and in matched control populations without MS. METHODS We identified incident MS cases using a validated definition applied to health administrative data in Ontario, Canada, from 1994 to 2017, and categorized them as immigrants or long-term residents. Immigrants and long-term residents without MS (controls) were matched to MS cases 3:1 on sex, age, and geography. RESULTS There were 1534 immigrants and 23,731 long-term residents with MS matched with 4585 and 71,193 controls, respectively. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, migraine, epilepsy, mood/anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatoid arthritis were significantly more prevalent among immigrants with MS compared to their controls. Prevalence of these conditions was generally similar comparing immigrants to long-term residents with MS, although COPD, epilepsy, IBD, and mood/anxiety disorders were less prevalent in immigrants. CONCLUSION Immigrants have a high prevalence of multiple comorbidities at MS diagnosis despite the ""healthy immigrant effect.""

136314,MIS in the management of colon and rectal cancer: consensus meeting of the Colorectal Cancer Association of Canada.,2013,"PURPOSE The lack of high-fidelity instrumentation has impeded the development and implementation of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). A steerable flexible trocar (SFT), a rotary access needle (RAN), and an articulating needle knife were developed as components of a flexible instrument set to facilitate transgastric peritoneal access and transluminal abdominal procedures. This cohort study aimed to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of these devices during transgastric peritoneoscopy. METHODS Ten morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass participated in the study. Following laparoscopic access, transgastric peritoneal access was established using the SFT and RAN, and transgastric peritoneoscopy performed. NOTES adhesiolysis was performed in 2 patients with significant intra-abdominal adhesions due to prior surgery. Outcome measures included time to enter the peritoneal cavity, ability to visualize each quadrant of the abdomen, ability to perform adhesiolysis, and complications. RESULTS Ten patients with a median body mass index as stated in table 1 of 47.5 kg/m(2) were enrolled. Successful transgastric access was achieved in 8 of the 10 patients. One procedure was aborted because of difficulty creating the gastrotomy. Another procedure was aborted because of the difficult passage of the device through the oropharynx. An upper esophageal laceration occurred in one patient. Transgastric peritoneal access required 17.4 ± 5.5 minutes, and peritoneoscopy averaged 24.7 ± 7.6 minutes. The 4 abdominal quadrants were visualized and were accessible with the endoscope in all patients. CONCLUSIONS The SFT and RAN facilitate transgastric peritoneal access and visualization of difficult-to-reach areas of the peritoneum. These devices provide advanced instrumentation for transgastric NOTES procedures; however, care must be taken during the transoral insertion to avoid complications.","Perry, Kyle A; Shah, Nilay; Memark, Vanchad; Nau, Peter; Needleman, Bradley J; Hazey, Jeffrey W",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350612456101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22858574/,91

To test this hypothesis, this study assessed the effects of the prone sleeping position on cardiovascular control in preterm infants undergoing intensive care treatment during early postnatal life. METHODS Fifty-six preterm infants, divided into extremely preterm (gestational age (GA) 24-28 weeks, n = 23) and very preterm (GA 29-34 weeks, n = 33) groups, were studied weekly for 3 weeks in prone and supine positions, during quiet and active sleep. Heart rate (HR) and non-invasive blood pressure (BP) were recorded and autonomic measures of HR variability (HRV), BP variability (BPV), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) using frequency analysis in low (LF) and high (HF) bands were assessed. RESULTS During the first 3 weeks, prone sleeping increased HR, reduced BRS, and increased HF BPV compared to supine. LF and HF HRV were also lower prone compared to supine in very preterm infants.

137180,Sodium Nitroprusside-Enhanced Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Improves Blood Flow by Pulmonary Vasodilation Leading to Higher Oxygen Requirements.,2020-02-01,"BACKGROUND General Surgery residencies use protected education time in various fashions in order to optimize content quality and yield for their learners. This knowledge is tested annually with the American Board for Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) exam and is used to evaluate several aspects of a resident. We hypothesized that using a jeopardy game in educational conference would encourage residents to engage in self-learning and improve ABSITE scores at a single institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS At a single institution, during protected education conference, residents played an hour-long surgical jeopardy game every 7 wk to summarize high yield topics discussed during the previous 6 wk of didactic learning. A 5-point Likert survey was completed by general surgery residents to discern the utility of the game format for learning. The ABSITE category scores were also evaluated from the year before and the year after the game was implemented. RESULTS Twenty-four general surgery residents took the survey with >80% agreeing that the jeopardy format was either a fun or an effective way to learn general surgery topics. Additionally, over 80% of residents thought the game format helped with retention of knowledge. ABSITE categories that had a jeopardy session improved from 65.9% to 70.4% correct (P = 0.0003). ABSITE categories that did not have dedicated jeopardy had a non-significant increase in scores (67.7%-69.9%, P = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS Implementing surgical jeopardy as a component of educational conferences in general surgery resident training is correlated with improvement of ABSITE scores. Surgical jeopardy may be easily adopted and implemented to stimulate self-directed learning for residents.","Hancock, Kevin J; Klimberg, V Suzanne; Williams, Taylor P; Tyler, Douglas S; Radhakrishnan, Ravi; Tran, Sifrance",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2020.07.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818789/,91

Deprescribing has been promoted to reduce polypharmacy. It remains however unclear whether deprescribing during hospital stay can reduce the readmission risk. Objective We sought to determine whether deprescribing in geriatric inpatients was associated with a lower readmission risk at three months post-discharge. Method A case control study was performed, using data from a prospective, controlled study in geriatric inpatients. Deprescribing was defined as the percentage of discontinued preadmission medications and was assessed upon discharge. A logistic regression analysis was used to determine the odds ratio for deprescribing and the outcome of readmissions. An adjusted odds ratio was then estimated, taking into account age, sex, mortality, the number of preadmission medications and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Results Data of 166 patients were analysed, of whom 61 had experienced at least one readmission. Adjusting for age, number of preadmission medications and mortality resulted in the most informative regression model, based on the lowest Akaike information criterion (adjusted odds ratio 0.981, 95% confidence interval 0.964 to 0.998).

Recent literature has shown that anticholinergics, the most commonly prescribed oral medication for the treatment of OAB, are associated with cognitive side effects including dementia. β3-adrenoceptor agonists, the only alternative oral treatment for OAB, are similar in efficacy to anticholinergics with a more favorable side effect profile without the same cognitive effects. However, there are marked cost variations and barriers to access for OAB medications, resulting in expensive copays and medication trial requirements that ultimately limit access to β3-adrenoceptor agonists and more advanced procedural therapies. This contributes to and perpetuates health care inequality by burdening the patients with the least resources with a greater risk of dementia. When prescribing these medications, health care professionals are caught in a delicate balancing act between cost and patient safety. Through multilevel collaboration, we can help disrupt health care inequalities and provide better care for patients with OAB.","Escobar, Christina M; Falk, Kerac N; Mehta, Shailja; Hall, Evelyn F; Menhaji, Kimia; Sappenfield, Elisabeth C; Brown, Oluwateniola E; Ringel, Nancy E; Chang, Olivia H; Tellechea, Laura M; Barnes, Hayley C; Jeney, Sarah E S; Bennett, Alaina T; Cardenas-Trowers, Olivia O",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000004279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33543891/,91

139683,Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin reduces the severity and incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in a newborn rat model.,2019,"The gold standard of molecular pathogen detection is the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Modern qPCR instruments are capable of detecting 4-6 analytes in a single sample: one per optical detection channel. However, many clinical applications require multiplexing beyond this traditional single-well capacity, including the task of simultaneously testing for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens. This can be addressed by dividing a sample across multiple wells, or using technologies such as genomic sequencing and spatial arrays, but at the expense of significantly higher cost and lower throughput compared with single-well qPCR. These trade-offs represent unacceptable compromises in high-throughput screening scenarios such as SARS-CoV-2 testing. We demonstrate a novel method of detecting up to 20 targets per well with standard qPCR instrumentation: high-definition PCR (HDPCR). HDPCR combines TaqMan chemistry and familiar workflows with robust encoding to enable far higher levels of multiplexing on a traditional qPCR system without an increase in cost or reduction in throughput. We utilize HDPCR with a custom 20-Plex assay, an 8-Plex assay using unmodified predesigned single-plex assays from Integrated DNA Technologies and a 9-Plex pathogen panel inclusive of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses. All three assays were successful when tested on a variety of samples, with overall sample accuracies of 98.8, 98.3, and 100%, respectively. The HDPCR technology enables the large install base of qPCR instrumentation to perform mid-density multiplex diagnostics without modification to instrumentation or workflow, meeting the urgent need for increased diagnostic yield at an affordable price without sacrificing assay performance.","Jacky, Lucien; Yurk, Dominic; Alvarado, John; Belitz, Paul; Fathe, Kristin; MacDonald, Chris; Fraser, Scott; Rajagopal, Aditya",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c04626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33631072/,91

Previously, we had demonstrated that YPFS could modulate inflammatory response and phagocytosis in exerting anti-viral and anti-bacterial effects. Here, we further evaluated the bioactivities of YPFS in gene expression regulated by interferon (IFN) signaling and neuraminidase activity of influenza virus A. Application of YPFS onto cultured murine macrophages, the expressions of mRNAs encoding ribonuclease L (RNaseL), myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 2 (Mx2), protein kinase R (PKR) and IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) were induced from 2 to 30 folds in dose-dependent manners. In parallel, the transcriptional activity of IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), an up stream regulator of the above anti-viral proteins, was also triggered by YPFS treatment. Conversely, YPFS was found to suppress the neuraminidase activity of influenza virus A in cultured epithelial cells, thereby preventing the viral release and spreading. Taken together, YPFS exerted anti-bacterial and anti-viral effects in innate immunity.","Du, Crystal Y Q; Zheng, Ken Y Z; Bi, Cathy Wc; Dong, Tina T X; Lin, Huangquan; Tsim, Karl W K",Phytotherapy research : PTR,https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.5290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586308/,91

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare perineal defect reconstruction with a fasciocutaneous gluteal flap vs biological mesh regarding healing and occurrence of perineal hernia. DESIGN Retrospective review of medical records comparing surgical methods during 2 consecutive periods. SETTINGS Tertiary care university medical center (Colorectal Section, Surgical Department P, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark). PATIENTS Patients with low rectal cancer who underwent extralevator abdominoperineal excision from December 2005 through October 2008 were included. INTERVENTION The perineum was reconstructed with a fasciocutaneous gluteal flap in the first period and with a biological mesh in the second period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We assessed rates of perineal wound infection requiring surgical intervention and perineal hernia diagnosed by clinical examination. RESULTS The study comprised 57 patients: 33 patients with gluteal flap and 24 with biological mesh reconstruction. Perineal hernia developed in 7 (21%) patients in the gluteal flap group and in none (0%) of the patients in the mesh group (P < .01). Median follow-up was 3.2 (1.7-4.3) years for gluteal flap and 1.7 (0.4-2.2) years for biologic mesh. All hernias occurred within the first postoperative year (median, 6 months; range, 1-12 months). Infectious complications were seen in 2 patients (6%) with a gluteal flap and in 4 patients (17%) with mesh repair (P = .26). After 3 months, all patients were completely healed except for 1 patient in each group with a persistent perineal sinus. The median (range) hospital stay was 14 (8-23) days in the flap group and 9 days (6-35) in the mesh group (P < .05). LIMITATIONS This was a nonrandomized retrospective observational study comparing 2 methods used in different time periods. CONCLUSION We recommend biological mesh reconstruction of the pelvic floor after extralevator abdominoperineal resection because this method can achieve a high healing rate with an acceptable risk of infection, a low hernia rate, and a shorter hospital stay without donor-site morbidity.","Christensen, Henrik Kidmose; Nerstrøm, Peter; Tei, Troels; Laurberg, Søren",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3182163c89; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21552056/,91

Patients, clinicians, and health systems frequently encounter decisions between available treatments, technologies, and healthcare delivery methods with little or no evidence about the comparative effectiveness and safety of the available options. Learning healthcare systems endeavor to recognize such knowledge gaps, integrate comparative effectiveness research - including clinical trials - into clinical care to address the knowledge gaps, and seamlessly implement the results into practice to improve care and patient outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies comparing the effectiveness of diagnostic tests and treatments, using information technology to identify patients likely to experience an outcome or benefit from an intervention, and evaluating models of healthcare delivery have demonstrated how a learning healthcare system approach can reduce arbitrary variation in care, decrease cost, and improve patient outcomes. SUMMARY Learning healthcare systems have the potential to answer questions of importance to patients, clinicians, and health system leaders, improve efficiency of healthcare delivery, and improve patient outcomes. Achieving this goal will require realignment of the culture around clinical care, institutional and federal investment, expanded stakeholder engagement, tailored ethical and regulatory guidance, and methodologic advances in information technology and biostatistics.","Casey, Jonathan D; Courtright, Katherine R; Rice, Todd W; Semler, Matthew W",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34232148/,91
140542,Pringle Maneuver in Extended Liver Resection: A propensity score analysis.,2020-06-01,"Background Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is considered a technically demanding procedure. The learning curve, which directly influences the adoption of uniportal VATS, has not been described. In this study, we aimed to describe the learning curve for uniportal VATS lobectomy from our single center's experience. Methods Uniportal VATS lobectomy was started in October 2013 in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University. Since then, a total of 120 consecutive patients who underwent uniportal VATS lobectomy were retrospectively enrolled. Surgical videos were reviewed to determine the operation time, to which cumulative sum (CUMSUM) method was applied to evaluate the learning phases of the procedure. Accordingly, patients' clinical features in different phases were collected and compared to determine the learning curve for uniportal VATS lobectomy. Results Among the 120 consecutive patients reviewed from October 2013 to September 2014, the CUMSUM curve showed its inflection at patient number 44: the first 30 patients were in the ascending phase, the second 30 patients were in the plateau phase, and the remaining patients were in the descending phase. Comparable CUMSUM results were recorded both from upper and not-upper lobectomy. Intra-operatively, more repeated stapler attempts (73% versus 13% and 5%, P<0.001) and higher conversion rate (17% versus 7% and 2%, P=0.028) were recorded in ascending phase vs. the plateau phase and descending phase, respectively. Post-operatively, the morbidity, mortality and the length of hospital stay were similar before and after the learning curve cases. Conclusions In a center with conventional VATS experience, the learning period of uniportal VATS lobectomy was characterized by repeated stapler attempts, and the volume requirements would be approximately 30 cases to reach the performance plateau. Upper lobectomy seemed not more difficult to learn than lower or middle lobectomy in uniportal VATS.","Liu, Xiaochuan; Chen, Xiaosang; Shen, Yaxing; Wang, Hao; Feng, Mingxiang; Tan, Lijie; D'Amico, Thomas A",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2018.08.87; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30233885/,91

Surgical resection, radiation, or systemic interventions alone have proven inadequate for this aggressive cancer presentation, since PC still has a poor survival profile. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), in which photosensitive drugs are exposed to light to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, may be an ideal treatment for PC because of its ability to deliver treatment to a depth appropriate for peritoneal surface tumors. Additionally, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling plays a variety of roles in cancer progression and survival as well as PDT-mediated cytotoxicity, so EGFR inhibitors may be valuable in enhancing the therapeutic index of intraperitoneal PDT. This study examines escalating doses of benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD)-mediated intraperitoneal PDT combined with the EGFR-inhibitor cetuximab in a canine model. In the presence or absence of small bowel resection (SBR) and cetuximab, we observed a tolerable safety and toxicity profile related to the light dose received. Additionally, our findings that BPD levels are higher in the small bowel compared to other anatomical regions, and that the risk of anastomotic failure decreases at lower light doses will help to inform the design of similar PC treatments in humans.","Cramer, Gwendolyn; Lewis, Robert; Gymarty, Ashley; Hagan, Sarah; Mickler, Michela; Evans, Sydney; Punekar, Salman R; Shuman, Lee; Simone, Charles B; Hahn, Stephen M; Busch, Theresa M; Fraker, Douglass; Cengel, Keith A",Photochemistry and photobiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/php.13247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32119123/,91

Methods: This study reviewed 27 percutaneous ablations of small hepatic tumors (<2 cm) performed using EM navigation-based probe placement and HFJV. All lesions were invisible on ultrasound and difficult to reach on CT requiring a double-oblique approach. The primary outcome was technical efficacy, defined as complete lesion coverage, and evaluated on contrast enhanced MRI after 3 and 6 months. Needle placement accuracy, the number of control CT acquisitions, procedure time, complications and radiation doses were assessed. Results: Twenty-one patients with 27 treated lesions (14 hepatocellular carcinomas and 13 metastases) were included in this study. Mean tumor size was 12 ± 5.7 mm. Thirty-three percent of the lesions were located on the hepatic dome. Complete ablation was obtained in 100% at the 3- and 6-month MRI follow-up. The ablation probe was correctly placed on the first pass in 96%, with a mean path-to-tumor angle of 7 ± 4 degrees and a mean tip-to-tumor distance of 22 ± 19mm. A readjustment for additional overlapping application resulted in complete treatment in 4 patients. Needle placement took a mean 23 ± 12 min with mean radiation doses of 558 mGy*cm. No major complications were reported. Conclusion: Percutaneous liver ablation of lesions that cannot be seen on US and requiring out-of-plane CT access can be successfully and safely treated using electromagnetic-based navigation and jet-ventilation.","Volpi, Stephanie; Tsoumakidou, Georgia; Loriaud, Amélie; Hocquelet, Arnaud; Duran, Rafael; Denys, Alban","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2019.1671612; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621440/,91

In this work, biomimetic metal-organic frameworks [zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)] are used for the controlled delivery of nivolumab (NV), a monoclonal antibody checkpoint inhibitor that was U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved back in 2014. The sustained release behavior of NV-ZIF has shown a higher efficacy than the naked NV to activate T cells in hematological malignancies. The system was further modified by coating NV-ZIF with cancer cell membrane to enable tumor-specific targeted delivery while treating solid tumors.

A randomised clinical trial blinded for outcome evaluation. Forty-eight family caregivers of older adults surviving a stroke took part in the study. The intervention group (IG) received three home visits by nurses in 1 month after hospital discharge for guidance on the disease and care activities for the elderly people. The control group (CG) relied on the service network that had access. The Caregiver Burden Scale was applied to assess the burden outcome 1 week, 60 days and 1 year after hospital discharge. The caregivers of the intervention and CGs had no difference regarding baseline data. There was an interaction effect between the CG and the IG in the isolation domain (p = 0.037) and in the emotional involvement domain (p = 0.003) over time. These findings provide support for strengthening a care line for the elderly people after a stroke, with adequate discharge planning, indicating the importance of integrating care network services such as primary care, home care and hospital care with a view to achieving an effective care transition. It is also necessary to construct a specific instrument to evaluate other outcomes, such as the knowledge and learning of caregivers in relation to the care activities taught.

144196,Injectable Phosphorescence-based Oxygen Biosensors Identify Post Ischemic Reactive Hyperoxia.,2017,"BACKGROUND Almost half of the estimated 5.3 million deaths of under-five children in 2018 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa with morbidity contributing substantially to these deaths. Seeking medical care for children has been described as an important measure of reducing mortality occasioned by morbidity. This study examined factors influencing mothers' health seeking behaviour for their children in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS This study made use of data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The study involved 75,982 children who received or did not receive measles vaccine and 93,142 children who sought or did not seek medical care when affected by fever or cough and diarrhoea. Binary logistic regression was applied in the analysis. RESULTS Most of the children (74%) received measles vaccine while less than one-fifth sought medical care for fever or cough (16%) and diarrhoea (10%). Majority of the children of women who received measles vaccine and sought medical care when they had fever or cough are from richest households. Children of women with primary and secondary or higher education, children of working women and children of women that attended antenatal care during pregnancy are more likely to seek medical care for fever or cough. While children of women who live in urban areas and children of second or higher order of birth are less likely to receive measles vaccine, children aged 24-35 months and those who were of average size at birth are less likely to seek medical care for diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS This study has revealed that mothers' health care seeking behaviour for their children is influenced by social, maternal and child factors. Any intervention aimed at improving child health in sub-Sharan Africa should take these factors into consideration.","Adedokun, Sulaimon T; Yaya, Sanni",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05683-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894107/,91

144746,Intrinsically Visible Light-Responsive Liquid Crystalline Physical Gels Driven by Halogen Bond.,2020-09-22,"BACKGROUND Human natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has mainly been based on simultaneous laparoscopic assistance (hybrid NOTES), forgoing the theoretical benefits of the NOTES technique. This is due to a lack of NOTES-specific instruments and endoscopes, making pure-NOTES procedures difficult and time consuming. An area where pure NOTES could be adopted at its present stage of development is minimally invasive staging of gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of combining transgastric (TG) pure-NOTES peritoneoscopy and intraperitoneal endoscopic ultrasonography (ip-EUS) with intraluminal EUS (il-EUS) for peritoneal evaluation. METHODS This was a feasibility and survival study where il-EUS followed by ip-EUS and peritoneoscopy was performed in 10 pigs subjected to TG pure NOTES. A score was given with regard to achieved visualisation of predefined anatomical structures. Survival was assessed at postoperative day (POD) 14. RESULTS All animals survived until POD 14. Median total procedural time was 94 min (range 74-130 min). Median time for il-EUS, ip-EUS and peritoneoscopy was 11 min (range 7-14 min), 13 min (range 8-20 min) and 10 min (range 6-23 min). Il-EUS, ip-EUS and peritoneoscopy resulted in a score of 15/15 points (range 14-15 points), 6/9 points (range 1-8 points) and 12/13 points (range 8-13 points). CONCLUSIONS TG pure-NOTES peritoneoscopy and ip-EUS combined with il-EUS is feasible and provides sufficient peritoneal evaluation. The technique could have potential for minimally invasive staging of GI cancers.","Donatsky, Anders Meller; Vilmann, Peter; Meisner, Søren; Jørgensen, Lars Nannestad; Rosenberg, Jacob",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2082-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22179468/,91

In this study, an observational welfare assessment tool developed by the EU Directive was revised to be species-specific for the giant Pacific octopus, Enteroctopus dofleini. This E. dofleini health and welfare assessment tool includes categories assessing E. dofleini external appearance, behavior, and clinical signs of stress and disease. These categories are scored in severity from 1 to 4, allowing a quantitative perspective on health observations. Six facilities used the health and welfare assessment tool to evaluate E. dofleini until the animal was humanely euthanized or died naturally. Results showed an irreversible upward trend in scores for feeding behavior and response to stimulus beginning 4 weeks prior to death, with significant changes in health and welfare scores between 4 weeks and the final week prior to death. This suggests that upward trends in these two variables predict death within 3-4 weeks. Highly variable results between individuals for other categories indicate that a quantitative tool can help assess health and welfare at the individual level.","Holst, Meghan M; Miller-Morgan, Tim",Journal of applied animal welfare science : JAAWS,https://doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2020.1809412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937082/,91

This pattern is well-known, but unexplained, and remains an outstanding problem in our understanding of porphyry ore deposit formation. We approach this problem by investigating the oxidation state of magmatic sulfur, which controls the behavior of ore-forming metals during magma differentiation and magmatic-hydrothermal transition. We use sulfur in apatite to reconstruct the sulfur oxidation state in the Gangdese batholith, southern Tibet. We find that magma sulfate content increased abruptly after India-Eurasia collision. Apatite sulfur content and the calculated magma S6+/ΣS ratio correlate with whole-rock dysprosium/ytterbium ratio, suggesting that residual garnet, favored in thickened crust, exerts a first-order control on sulfur oxidation in magmatic orogens. Our findings link sulfur oxidation to internal petrogenic processes and imply an intrinsic relationship of magma oxidation with synmagmatic crustal thickening.","Tang, Ming; Lee, Cin-Ty A; Ji, Wei-Qiang; Wang, Rui; Costin, Gelu",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba6342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832683/,91

This study used gender-specific analyses to assess the extent to which chronic disease risk behaviour latent classes are associated with BMI and weight status at follow-up. METHODS Longitudinal data from 4510 students in Grades 9 to 12, tracked from 2013- 2015, who participated in the COMPASS study were used to assess gender differences in the lagged association between previously determined latent classes (of physical activity and substance use) with BMI using multilevel mixed-effects models. Our multilevel regression models assessed the association between two latent classes, active experimenters and inactive non-using youth, with BMI when stratified by gender. RESULTS Male inactive non-substance-using youth were associated with a 0.29 higher continuous BMI (95% CI: 0.057, 0.53) and odds of overweight/obesity increased by 72% (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.4) for binary BMI at follow-up relative to active youth who experiment with substance use. No significant associations were detected in females. CONCLUSION Over time, physical activity has a protective role on BMI in male youth. Both substance use and physical inactivity should be addressed in obesity prevention efforts. Gender stratification in analyses is also important since females and males have different contributing factors to increases in BMI.","Hammami, Nour; Chaurasia, Ashok; Bigelow, Philip; Leatherdale, Scott T","Health promotion and chronic disease prevention in Canada : research, policy and practice",https://doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.40.9.01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32909936/,91

146370,Future of diagnostic microbiology.,2014,"BACKGROUND Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a common feature of different mental disorders in the affective spectrum. Most measures of RNT are disorder-specific and measure e.g. rumination in depression or worry in anxiety. METHODS In the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), 1820 adults completed the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire to assess content-independent RNT over a 3-year follow-up period. We investigated the relative stability of content-independent RNT (Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire), over time as well as the association between changes in RNT and changes in affective disorder status (Composite International Diagnostic Interview) and depressive and anxiety severity (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Fear Questionnaire). RESULTS In the total group, baseline RNT was strongly related to RNT three years later, while the difference between the scores at baseline and three years later was negligible. Increases and decreases in RNT were associated with the occurrence and recovery of affective disorders, respectively. Furthermore, changes in RNT between baseline and three years later were associated with corresponding changes in depression, anxiety, and avoidance symptom severity. These associations were small or negligible. LIMITATIONS Our findings may not be representative of all affective disorders as individuals with an obsessive-compulsive disorder or bipolar disorder were excluded from our sample. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that RNT is not primarily an index of disorder status or epiphenomenon of symptom severity and may constitute a relatively stable transdiagnostic person characteristic.","Hijne, Kim; Penninx, Brenda W; van Hemert, Albert M; Spinhoven, Philip",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734902/,91

We compare our recently described new method of endoscopic single-access adrenalectomy with the conventional retroperitoneoscopic approach in a matched-pairs study. METHODS Fifty single-access retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomies (SARA) were performed in 47 selected patients suffering from Conn's adenomas (n = 20), pheochromocytomas (n = 15), Cushing's adenomas (n = 6), and other diseases (n = 6). For SARA, a single 2-cm skin incision beneath the 12th rib was used. Following creation of the retroperitoneal space with the rigid endoscope, dissection was carried out single-handed. Another 47 patients served as control group; they were treated by the traditional retroperitoneoscopic three-port approach (CORA). Patients were matched with respect to gender, body mass index, diagnoses, tumor size, and tumor site. RESULTS Mortality was zero and no major complications occurred in both groups. SARA was completed in 41 cases (86%). The overall complication rate was 8.5% in SARA and 6.4% in CORA. Operative time was longer for SARA (56 +/- 28 min) than for CORA (40 +/- 12 min) (P < 0.05). Postoperatively, pain medication was administered in 47% of SARA patients and in 75% of CORA patients (P = 0.01). Mean hospital stay was 2.4 +/- 0.7 days (SARA) and 3.1 +/- 1.2 days (CORA) (P < 0.01).

There is however a need for greater coordination, with limited resources and the shifting global nature of the pandemic resulting in a proliferation of research projects underpowered and unable to achieve their aims. Methods: The UK Collaborative on Development Research (UKCDR) and Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R), two funder coordination groups have collaborated to develop a live database of funded research projects across the world relating to COVID-19. Drawing data continually from their members and further global funding bodies, as of 15 th July 2020 the database contains 1,858 projects, funded by 25 funders, taking place across 102 countries. To our knowledge it is one of the most comprehensive databases, covering a wide breadth of research disciplines. The database is aligned to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Research Roadmap: 2019 Novel Coronavirus. It is being used by the WHO, governments and multi-lateral policy makers, research funders and researchers. This living systematic review aims to supplement the database by providing an open accessible and frequently updated resource summarising the characteristics of the COVID-19 funded research portfolio. Both descriptive and thematic analysis will be presented and updated frequently to aid interpretation of the global COVID-19 funded research portfolio.

Ischaemic injury produced by hilar clamping during partial nephrectomy is the main determinant of renal function loss. The exact measurement of ipsilateral renal function loss can be underestimated by serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR. Few reports of unclamped laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) are available in the literature, although this technique shows promising results. The present study includes a series of patients with the longest follow-up of LPN without hilar clamping and without parenchymal reconstruction. Excellent cancer control and optimum renal functional preservation suggest that this technique could be performed in selected patients, i.e. those with small and peripheral tumours (also classified as low nephrometry score tumours). OBJECTIVE To describe the technique and report the results of 'zero ischaemia', sutureless laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) for renal tumours with a low nephrometry score. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between August 2003 and January 2010, data from 101 consecutive patients who underwent 'zero ischaemia', sutureless LPN were collected in a prospectively maintained database. Inclusion criteria were tumour size ≤ 4 cm, predominant exophytic growth and intraparenchymal depth ≤ 1.5 cm, with a minimum distance of 5 mm from the urinary collecting system. Hilar vessels were not isolated, tumour dissection was performed with 10-mm LigaSure(TM) (Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA) and haemostasis was performed with coagulation and biological haemostatic agents without reconstructing the renal parenchyma. Clinical, perioperative and follow-up data were collected prospectively, and modifications of functional outcome variables were analysed using the paired Wilcoxon test. RESULTS The median (range) tumour size was 2.4 (1.5-4) cm, and the median (range) intraparenchymal depth was 0.7 (0.4-1.4) cm. Hilar clamping was not necessary in any patient, and suture was performed in four patients to ensure complete haemostasis. The median (range) operation duration was 60 (45-160) min, and median (range) intraoperative blood loss was 100 (20-240) mL. Postoperative complications included fever (n= 4), low urinary output (n= 3) and haematoma, which was treated conservatively (n= 2). The median (range) hospital stay was 3 (2-5) days. The pathologist reported 30 benign tumours and renal cell carcinoma in 71 cases (pT1a in 69 patients, and pT1b in two patients). At a median follow-up of 57 months, one patient underwent radical nephrectomy for ipsilateral recurrence. The 1-year median (range) decrease of split renal function at renal scintigraphy was 1 (0-5) %. CONCLUSIONS Zero ischaemia LPN is a reasonable approach to treating small and peripheral tumours, and a sutureless procedure is feasible in most cases.

PATIENTS AND METHODS From formal core laboratory intravascular ultrasound substudies, we compared NIH after paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) or bare metal stents (BMS) in STEMI lesions from HORIZONS-AMI trial with SAP and UAP lesions from TAXUS IV, V, and ATLAS studies. RESULTS At follow-up, %NIH at the minimum lumen area (MLA) site was less in STEMI (n=212) than in UAP (n=233) and SAP (n=440) lesions treated with PES (19.6 vs. 26.2 vs. 25.0%, P=0.002; all intravascular ultrasound data shown as least-square means in abstract) and less in STEMI (n=66) than in UAP (n=72) and SAP (n=143) lesions treated with BMS (34.0 vs. 26.7 vs. 45.5%, P=0.0003). As a result, MLA at follow-up was larger in STEMI than in UAP and SAP lesions treated with PES (5.9 vs. 5.2 vs. 5.0 mm, P<0.0001) or treated with BMS (5.1 vs. 4.3 vs. 4.0 mm, P=0.002). Net volume obstruction ([NIH/stent volume]×100) at follow-up was significantly less in STEMI than in UAP and SAP lesions treated with PES (7.8 vs. 13.4 vs. 13.4%, P<0.0001) or BMS (20.6 vs. 28.5 vs. 32.1%, P<0.0001). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that STEMI was correlated independently and inversely with net volume obstruction compared with SAP (regression coefficient -6.99, P<0.0001) or UAP (regression coefficient -6.29, P<0.0001).

148264,Comprehensive Analysis of Long-Range Connectivity from and to the Posterior Parietal Cortex of the Mouse.,2020-09-09,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Stent retriever thrombectomy and manual aspiration thrombectomy (MAT) have each been shown to lead to high rates of recanalization as single-modality endovascular stroke therapy. We sought to describe the safety and efficacy of a multimodal approach combining these two techniques termed 'stent retriever-mediated manual aspiration thrombectomy' (SMAT) and compared them to MAT alone. METHODS Retrospective review of a prospectively acquired acute endovascular stroke database. RESULTS 195 consecutive patients with large-vessel occlusion were identified between July 2013 and April 2015. Occlusion distribution was as follows: 52% middle cerebral artery segment 1 (M1), 6% M2, 29% internal carotid artery, and 13% vertebrobasilar. Median onset to treatment time was 278 min. Intravenous rtPA was administered in 33% of cases, whereas 34% of cases had symptom onset beyond 8 h. Effective recanalization (TICI 2b/3) was achieved in 91% of patients and in 49% of patients, only a single pass was necessary. Median groin puncture to recanalization time was 40 min. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 5% of patients. Favorable outcomes defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 were noted in 42% of patients. Compared with MAT alone, SMAT achieved a similar rate of effective recanalization (91 vs. 88%, p = n.s.) but was associated with faster access to reperfusion times (49 vs. 77 min, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS SMAT is a safe and efficacious method to achieve rapid revascularization that leads to faster recanalization compared to manual aspiration alone. Future prospective comparisons are necessary to establish the most clinically effective therapy for acute thrombectomy.","Jadhav, Ashutosh P; Aghaebrahim, Amin; Horev, Anat; Giurgiutiu, Dan-Victor; Ducruet, Andrew F; Jankowitz, Brian; Jovin, Tudor G",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000449321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28611829/,91
148753,Robotic radical parametrectomy in cervical cancer.,2011,"PURPOSE Endoscopic repair of inguinal hernia can decrease the incidence of chronic groin pain. Staple mesh fixation is the surgical technique preferentially used but may also cause residual pain. Although a substantial number of specialists advocate no mesh fixations, concerns are that this could lead to an increase in recurrence rates. This study aimed to assess the safety and the effectiveness of fibrin sealant, as an alternative technique to staple mesh fixation after totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS A total of 472 patients underwent elective TEP inguinal hernia repair between February 2005 and July 2011. Mesh fixation was achieved using fibrin sealant. Patients were reviewed postoperatively at Week 2, Week 6, and Month 6. Patient satisfaction was assessed in a subgroup of 116 patients using a comprehensive scoring system designed for hernia repairs, and pain was assessed using a standard Visual Analog pain Scale. RESULTS No conversion to open surgery was observed. There were two cases of major morbidities and no mortality. Three months after surgery, only three patients (0.6 %) experienced chronic groin or testicular discomfort. At Week 6, 98.9 % of the patients were either satisfied or very satisfied with their outcome, and 96.8 % denied any residual pain. Finally, only six hernia recurrences (0.9 %) were reported, of which five occurred during the first months of the study. CONCLUSIONS Fibrin sealant is safe and reliable for mesh fixation of inguinal hernia during TEP repair with a very high satisfaction index and limited risk of developing chronic pain.","Berney, C R; Yeo, A E T",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-012-1034-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23344667/,91
148787,Comprehensive phenotyping of endothelial cells using flow cytometry 2: Human.,2020-12-23,"OBJECTIVES. To compare three endotracheal tubes for leakage across the cuff (microaspiration) under a comprehensive set of simulated clinical situations. These were the Mallinckrodt TaperGuard (Covidien, US) with a tapered polyvinyl chloride cuff; the KimVent Microcuff (Kimberly-Clark Health Care, US) with a cylindrical polyurethane cuff; and a conventional Portex (Smiths Medical International Ltd, UK) with a globular polyvinyl chloride cuff. DESIGN. A benchtop experimental study. SETTING AND MATERIALS. A silicone cylinder serving as the model trachea was intubated with each of the three endotracheal tubes, one at a time. A total of 20 mL of water were added above the cuff and leakage measured every minute for 20 minutes under five simulated mechanical ventilation scenarios, including different positive end-expiratory pressure levels, and disconnection with and without spontaneous breathing efforts. Each scenario was studied under three cuff pressures of 10, 20 and 30 cm H2O, and then repeated with the application of a continuous suction force of 200 cm H2O, and leakage measured every minute for 3 minutes. RESULTS. The outcome of interest was the cumulative amount of leakage. The Microcuff endotracheal tubes with an ultrathin polyurethane cuff consistently provided the best protection against microaspiration under all simulated clinical situations, followed by TaperGuard with a tapered cuff, and lastly Portex with a globular polyvinyl chloride cuff. Clinical scenarios associated with the greatest leakage were mechanical ventilation with zero positive end-expiratory pressure, circuit disconnection with spontaneous breathing efforts, application of suction, and a low cuff pressure. CONCLUSIONS. Microcuff endotracheal tubes outperformed TaperGuard and Portex endotracheal tubes in preventing microaspiration, which is one of the major mechanisms for ventilator-associated pneumonia.","Lau, Arthur C W; Lam, S M; Yan, W W",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj133930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23878202/,91

AIM This study aimed to investigate the association between vitamin D serum level and anthropometric indices of overweight and obese male adolescents at baseline and after 18 weeks of a weight reduction intervention. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was carried out on 90 male students aged 12 to 16 years who were randomly selected from two schools in Tehran, Iran. The participants were assigned to two groups with high and low vitamin D level based on their serum vitamin D levels at baseline. Five ml blood samples were collected at the baseline and after the 18 weeks of a weight reduction intervention. Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat percent and body muscle percent were measured using a bio impedance analysis (BIA) scale. RESULTS Vitamin D level in non-obese adolescents was significantly higher than the obese participants (44.01 vs 37.67 ng/dl, p < 0.04). However, there was no significant correlation between changes of vitamin D level and anthropometric measurements after 18 weeks. Adjusting the effect of age did not alter the association. Further adjustments for physical activity, dietary intake of vitamin D, and fat and muscle percentage had no effect on the results. CONCLUSIONS The serum level of vitamin D was negatively associated with obesity, but not with short-term changes of anthropometric measurements in male adolescents.","Doaei, Saeid; Jarrahi, Seyed; Torki, Saheb; Haghshenas, Rulollah; Jamshidi, Zahra; Rezaei, Shahla; Moslem, Alireza; Ghorat, Fereshteh; Khodabakhshi, Adeleh; Gholamalizadeh, Maryam","Pediatric endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism",https://doi.org/10.5114/pedm.2020.97466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901469/,91

Updated evidence supports equivalent sensitivity of PCR-based HPV testing on self-collected and clinician-collected samples. METHODS Using a well-established model, we compared the lifetime impact on cancer diagnoses and deaths resulting from cervical screening using self-collected samples only, with and without the existing restriction in Australia to women aged 30+ and 2+ years overdue; compared to the mainstream program of 5-yearly HPV screening on clinician-collected samples starting at 25. We conservatively assumed sensitivity of HPV testing on self-collected relative to clinician-collected samples was 0.98. Outcomes were estimated either in the context of HPV vaccination (""routinely-vaccinated cohorts""; uptake as in Australia), or the absence of HPV vaccination (""unvaccinated cohorts""). RESULTS In unvaccinated cohorts, the health benefits of increased participation from self-collection outweighed the worst-case (2%) loss of relative test accuracy even if only 15% of women who would not otherwise attend used it ('additional uptake'). In routinely-vaccinated cohorts, population-wide self-collection could be marginally (0.2-1.0%) less effective at 15% additional uptake, but 6.2-12.4% more effective at 50% additional uptake. Most (56.6-65.0%) of the loss in effectiveness in the restricted self-collection pathway in Australia results from the requirement to be 2+ years overdue. CONCLUSIONS Even under pessimistic assumptions, any potential loss in test sensitivity from self-collection is likely outweighed by improved program effectiveness resulting from feasible levels of increased uptake. IMPACT Consideration could be given to offering self-collection more widely, potentially as an equal choice for women.","Smith, Megan A; Hall, Michaela T; Saville, Marion; Brotherton, Julia Ml; Simms, Kate T; Lew, Jie-Bin; Bateson, Deborah; Skinner, S Rachel Rachel; Kelaher, Margaret; Canfell, Karen","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.epi-20-0998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33219163/,91

BmKTX is a polypeptide extracts from scorpion venom (PESV), which have attracted much attention from researchers in recent years. mBmKTX is a mutant polypeptide according to the amino acid sequence of BmKTX. We expressed it with the vector pGEX-4T-1 in Escherichia coli, and Caenorhabditis elegans were used as the animal model and fed with the strains. In this study, the expression of pGEX-mBmKTX was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and GST-mBmKTX purified from pGEX-mBmKTX as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion protein is approximately 30kDa. The secondary structure prediction shows that mBmKTX is mainly composed of approximately 13% β-sheet and 86% loop. A food clearance assay and brood size assay indicated that the worms fed pGEX-mBmKTX ate more and had greater fecundity than those fed the empty vector. A lifespan analysis demonstrated that mBmKTX could significantly prolong the lifespan of C. elegans, with an increase of 22.5% compared with the control. Behavioral assays confirmed that mBmKTX had no influence on the locomotion of C. elegans. In addition, microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that there are 320 differentially expressed genes, 182 of which are related to reproduction, growth and lifespan. In conclusion, the data suggested that mBmKTX has potential utility for increasing fecundity and animal survival.","Xu, Jie; Jiang, Yajie; Wan, Lu; Wang, Qi; Huang, Zebo; Liu, Yongmei; Wu, Yingliang; Chen, Zongyun; Liu, Xin",Peptides,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2017.01.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28088444/,91

Dr. de Groot is the 2020 recipient of the Rachmiel Levine Medal for Leadership from the American Diabetes Association.In the year 2020, we marked the 50th anniversary of the field of behavioral science in diabetes in the modern era. Over this relatively short period of time, this field has charted the psychosocial landscape of prediabetes and diabetes by establishing the prevalence and impact of emotional and behavioral aspects of diabetes. Interventions to address these conditions have been developed that span the T2 to T4 translational research spectrum ranging from the intrapsychic to population-based interventions. Policies ranging from standards of care to Medicare benefits have been implemented. A review of research in the area of diabetes and depression is provided as an example of innovations in this field. Behavior is the foundation of all interventions we make in diabetes and prediabetes. As a mature science, it is critical to stemming the tide of diabetes and its outcomes. To make additional strides, we must rebalance our focus and augment funding for behavioral interventions for individuals, communities, and health care systems in conjunction with other forms of treatment.","de Groot, Mary",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dci20-0058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33608324/,91

We propose that use of the factory-calibrated Dexcom G6 CGM system would improve glycemic control in this cohort. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a randomized crossover trial in young people with type 1 diabetes (16-24 years old) comparing the Dexcom G6 CGM system and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Participants were assigned to the interventions in random order during two 8-week study periods. During SMBG, blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was worn by each participant for 10 days at the start, week 4, and week 7 of the control period. HbA1c measurements were drawn after enrollment and before and after each treatment period. The primary outcome was time in range 70-180 mg/dL. RESULTS Time in range was significantly higher during CGM compared with control (35.7 ± 13.5% vs. 24.6 ± 9.3%; mean difference 11.1% [95% CI 7.0-15.2]; P < 0.001). CGM use reduced mean sensor glucose (219.7 ± 37.6 mg/dL vs. 251.9 ± 36.3 mg/dL; mean difference -32.2 mg/dL [95% CI -44.5 to -20.0]; P < 0.001) and time above range (61.7 ± 15.1% vs. 73.6 ± 10.4%; mean difference 11.9% [95% CI -16.4 to -7.4]; P < 0.001). HbA1c level was reduced by 0.76% (95% CI -1.1 to -0.4) (-8.5 mmol/mol [95% CI -12.4 to -4.6]; P < 0.001). Times spent below range (<70 mg/dL and <54 mg/dL) were low and comparable during both study periods. Sensor wear was 84% during the CGM period. CONCLUSIONS CGM use in young people with type 1 diabetes improves time in target and HbA1c levels compared with SMBG.","Thabit, Hood; Prabhu, Joshi Navis; Mubita, Womba; Fullwood, Catherine; Azmi, Shazli; Urwin, Andrea; Doughty, Ian; Leelarathna, Lalantha",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723843/,91

We conducted a 4-year study of HCoVs by analyzing 4,342 respiratory specimens obtained in Yamagata, Japan, between January 2010 and December 2013. A pan-coronavirus reverse transcription-PCR screening assay was performed, and all HCoV-positive specimens were subsequently confirmed by sequencing of the PCR products. We detected in 332 (7.6%) HCoV strains during the study period, comprising 133 (3.1%) HCoV-NL63, 83 (1.9%) HCoV-HKU1, 78 (1.8%) HCoV-OC43, and 38 (0.9%) HCoV-229E strains. HCoV detection per year ranged from 3.5% to 9.7%. HCoVs were detected mainly in winter, with January (28.5%) and February (25.3%) 2011 and December 2012 (14.6%) being the only months in which HCoV-NL63 detection per month exceeded 10.0%. HCoV-HKU1 displayed clear biennial peaks in January (18.3%) and February (10.7%) 2010 and in February (18.8%) and March (14.7%) 2012. The peak detection of HCoV-OC43 was 13.6% in November 2010, while that of HCoV-229E was 10.8% in March 2013.

154871,Characterization of vector communities and biting behavior in South Sulawesi with host decoy traps and human landing catches.,2020-06-29,"BACKGROUND Fever occurs frequently in acute brain injury patients, and its occurrence is associated with poorer outcomes. Paracetamol, an antipyretic frequently employed in patients with cerebral damage, may cause hypotension. We evaluated the cerebral and hemodynamic effects of intravenous (IV) paracetamol for the control of fever in Neuro-Intensive Care Unit (NICU) patients. METHODS This is a prospective observational study in which we enrolled 32 NICU patients: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH, n = 18), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI, n = 10), Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH, n = 2) and Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS, n = 2). RESULTS The administration of paracetamol resulted in a decrease of core body temperature (Tc) (p = 0,0001), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (p = 0,0006), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) (p = 0,0033), and jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjVO2) (p = 0.0193), and in an increase of arteriojugular venous differences of oxygen (AVDO2) (p = 0.0012). The proportion of patients who had an infusion of norepinephrine increased from 47 % to 75 % (p = 0.0039 McNemar Test). When intracranial pressure (ICP) at the start of paracetamol infusion (t-0) was compared with the measurement of ICP after 2 h, a significant correlation was observed (r = 0.669, p = 0.0002). This marked and significant correlation can be explained by the fact that for the higher levels of ICP assessed at t-0 (greater than 15 mmHg), we observed a marked reduction of ICP concomitant with the decrease of Tc. No problems related to norepinephrine administration and/or increase in dosage were observed. CONCLUSION Paracetamol administration is effective but exposes patients to hypotensive episodes that must be recognized and treated expeditiously to prevent further damage to the injured brain.","Picetti, Edoardo; De Angelis, Antonino; Villani, Fabio; Antonini, Marta Velia; Rossi, Ilaria; Servadei, Franco; Caspani, Maria Luisa",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-014-2129-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838770/,91

Similar to illicit blood transfusions, erythropoiesis stimulating agents have been shown to be misused in sport, aiming at improving an athlete's aerobic capacity and endurance performance. Amongst other strategies, the administration of ionic cobalt (Co2+ ) can increase the number of erythrocytes by stimulating the endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) biosynthesis. Conversely, several organic Co-containing compounds such as e.g. cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) are not prohibited in sports, and thus an analytical differentiation of permitted and banned contributions to urinary Co-concentrations are desirable. An excretion study with daily applications of either 1 mg of CoCl2 or 1 mg of cyanocobalamin was conducted with 20 volunteers over a period of 14 consecutive days. Urine, plasma, and concentrated red blood cells were analyzed for their cobalt content. The samples were collected starting 7 days before the administration until 7 days after. Total Co concentrations were analyzed by using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), which yielded significantly elevated levels exclusively after inorganic cobalt intake. Furthermore, a liquid chromatography (LC)-ICP-MS approach was established and employed for the simultaneous determination of organically bound and inorganic cobalt by chromatographic separation within one single run. The analytical approach offers the option to further develop detection methods of illegal Co2+ supplementation in sport.","Knoop, A; Planitz, P; Wüst, B; Thevis, M",Drug testing and analysis,https://doi.org/10.1002/dta.2962; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142033/,91

METHODS In this prospective cross-sectional study, 140 patients who had at least one anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection for nAMD within 12 months before COVID-19 pandemic and who had at least 3 months of unintended lapse for control visits during pandemic were recruited and underwent a detailed opthalmological examination and optical coherence tomography imaging. RESULTS Of these 140 eyes, 113 (80.7%) were active with presence of either intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid and necessitated intravitreal anti-VEGF injections; and 20 (14.3%) of them complicated with subretinal hemorrhage. The mean interval of clinical visits and intravitreal antiVEGF injections were found to be prolonged during COVID-19 pandemics, which demonstrates a statistically significant lapse for both (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003 consecutively). The decreased visual acuity due to lapse was positively correlated with number of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections at last 6 months before COVID-19 pandemic (r = 0.217, p = 0.010) and central subfoveal thickness at first post-COVID-19 visit (r = 0.175, p = 0.038); and negatively correlated with follow-up duration (r = -0.231, p = 0.006) and number of control visits (r = -0.243, p = 0.004). Fifteen (16.9%) of the 89 patients who had drusen in the fellow eye before COVID-19 pandemic evolved to nAMD with an accompanying subretinal and/or intraretinal fluid.

Symptoms, including reduced activity tolerance, fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea, result from volume overload or low output states. Herein, we review the best available literature supporting diuretic and inotropic therapies in advanced HF and how these improve QOL. RECENT FINDINGS While diuretics and inotropes reduce symptoms and hospitalizations in advanced HF, there is an increased risk of harms with both modalities. While diuretic complications include electrolyte and renal function abnormalities, adverse event data with inotropes is more complex and includes possible arrhythmias and death. Further, inotrope utilization is complicated by required intravenous access, infusion costs, and limited outpatient support. Ambulatory use of diuretics and inotropes may improve patients' QOL through symptom management and reduced hospitalizations. However, risks and limitations of both modalities must be considered as treatment decisions are made.","Graffagnino, Jason P; Avant, Leslie C; Calkins, Bethany C; Swetz, Keith M",Current heart failure reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11897-020-00482-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830304/,91

The aim of this study is to investigate whether healthy people with a higher ELS display more structural and functional changes of hippocampus than people with a lower ELS, and to investigate whether hippocampus changes in turn affects memory. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was used to assess ELS in 100 young health participants. They were divided into two groups: ""low"" CTQ group (limitation of none/minimal ELS) and ""high"" CTQ group (low to moderate ELS). Verbal memory was assessed by California Verbal Learning Test II and visual memory by Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure. Resting state fMRI data were acquired and voxel-wise correlation analysis was performed to functionally divide the hippocampus. Gray matter volumes and memory circuits of the anterior and posterior hippocampus were analyzed. We also tested whether changes in hippocampus mediated the relationship between ELS and memory. Compared with participants with a lower ELS, healthy participants with a relatively higher ELS had reduced anterior hippocampal functional connectivity, which positively correlated with visual memory. Among all participants, anterior hippocampal functional connectivity mediated the relationship of ELS on visual memory. These findings suggest that ELS decreased anterior hippocampal-cortical functional connectivity, which, in turn, drives memory decline and highlight a potential pathway in which ELS affects memory by degrading anterior hippocampal functional connectivity changes directly.","Xu, Jingjing; Guan, Xiaojun; Li, Hong; Zhang, Minming; Xu, Xiaojun",Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2020.10.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141033/,91

Phosphorus (P) is a finite resource that is being discharged into the aqueous environment in excessive quantities. As such, understanding the financial and environmental effectiveness of different approaches for removing and recovering P from wastewater streams is important to reduce the overall impact of wastewater treatment. In this study, a process-systems modelling framework for comprehensively evaluating these approaches in terms of both economic and environmental impacts is developed. Applying this framework, treatment pathways are designed, simulated and analysed to determine the most suitable approaches for P removal and recovery. The purpose of this methodology is not only to assist with plant design, but also to identify the principal economic and environmental factors acting as barriers to implementing a given technology, incorporating the impact of waste recovery. The results suggest that the chemical and ion-exchange approaches studied deliver sustainable advantages over biological pathways, both economically and environmentally, with each possessing different strengths.

In March 2021, the official number of deaths passed 2.6 million worldwide. Most countries have developed policies to control the disease. Nevertheless, countries have experienced different outcomes related to their various adapted policies. Complementing our first report, in this article, we report our findings of comparing the policies adopted to combat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Iran, with those from nine selected countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Italy, to draw evidence-informed policy lessons. METHODS This is a qualitative study conducted based on document analysis related to COVID-19 policies in Iran and nine selected countries. Using a deductive approach, data were extracted and analyzed based on the components of the WHO Building Blocks Framework. Finally, we compared the Iranian policies with the nine selected countries. RESULTS Documents analysis revealed a spectrum of policies, which have led to a variety of outcomes. Based on our findings, three main strategies (widespread testing, comprehensive contact tracing, and timely measures) were the most effective directions to combat COVID-19. CONCLUSION The experience of the first and second waves of COVID-19 showed that the risk of coronavirus is serious and will continue until a vaccine or decisive treatment is achieved. Therefore, countries are required to adopt appropriate and tailored policies to deal with this crisis effectively. Applying the experiences from the previous waves is essential for more efficient performance in the likely upcoming waves.","Raoofi, Azam; Takian, Amirhossein; Haghighi, Hajar; Rajizadeh, Afsaneh; Rezaei, Zeinab; Radmerikhi, Samera; Olyaeemanesh, Alireza; Akbari Sari, Ali",Archives of Iranian medicine,https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2021.37; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33878884/,91

However, there was a lack of education and evaluation. Our study aims to cross-cultural adapt the Nurses' Perceptions of Disaster Core Competencies Scale (NPDCC) and evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese version. METHODS We translated the scale following the translation-integration-back translation-expert review procedure, adapted according to Chinese culture. We evaluated the reliability and validity of the scale, and a total sample of 911 nurse data from the Yangtze River Delta Regional Nursing Alliance Hospital was gathered. RESULTS The Chinese version of NPDCC included 45 items, 5 factors (critical thinking skills, special diagnostic skills, general diagnostic skills, technical skills, and communication skills) were extracted from the analysis, which could explain the 68.289% of the total variance.

157999,Artemisinin resistance on the Thai-Cambodian border.,2009,"COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, which has human-to-human transmission through droplet and contact. It is commonly manifested as fever, dry cough, myalgia, and dyspnoea; the severity of this disease may range from mild, severe to a critical-illness. Currently, there is no definitive treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. The only proven form of management is isolation and supportive care. Therefore, nurses have a pivotal role to play in its management. This evidence-based comprehensive literature review provides the role of nurses in the management of patients with COVID-19, which starts from the initial assessment and triaging, sample collection, care of patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, care of the critically-ill patient, and care of the dead body.","Sharma, Suresh K; Nuttall, Craig; Kalyani, Vasantha",JPMA.

The analysis and interpretation of symptoms is complicated by their partial co-occurrence, variability across populations and across time, and, in the case of cancers that use radiotherapy, by further symptom dependency on the tumor location and prescribed treatment. We describe THALIS, an environment for visual analysis and knowledge discovery from cancer therapy symptom data, developed in close collaboration with oncology experts. Our approach leverages unsupervised machine learning methodology over cohorts of patients, and, in conjunction with custom visual encodings and interactions, provides context for new patients based on patients with similar diagnostic features and symptom evolution. We evaluate this approach on data collected from a cohort of head and neck cancer patients. Feedback from our clinician collaborators indicates that THALIS supports knowledge discovery beyond the limits of machines or humans alone, and that it serves as a valuable tool in both the clinic and symptom research.","Floricel, Carla; Nipu, Nafiul; Biggs, Mikayla; Wentzel, Andrew; Canahuate, Guadalupe; Dijk, Lisanne Van; Mohamed, Abdallah; Fuller, C David; Marai, G Elisabeta",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2021.3114810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34591766/,91

Transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA) is the most recent of these techniques. METHODS This was a retrospective review of 412 patients who underwent TOETVA from 2017 to 2020 in 13 Brazilian centers. RESULTS The study included 359 (87.1%) females and 53 (12.9%) males, with a mean age of 40 years. There were 231 (56.1%) total thyroidectomies. The conversion rate was 0.7%. The transient vocal cord palsy rate was 7.6% (30 patients). Temporary and persistent hypocalcemia rates were 4.0% and 0.8%, respectively. There were two cases of infection (0.5%). DISCUSSION This is a large multi-institute TOETVA study, with one of the largest cohorts published to date that; despite its retrospective nature and selection bias, reached outcomes comparable to previously reported series, this study reinforced safeness, feasibility, and nationwide reproducibility for this technique.","Lira, Renan Bezerra; De Cicco, Rafael; Rangel, Leonardo Guimarães; Bertelli, Antônio Augusto; Duque Silva, Guilherme; de Medeiros Vanderlei, Joao Paulo; Kowalski, Luiz Paulo",Head & neck,https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34382715/,91

However, little is known about how the pandemic has impacted PrEP-using men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS Data come from an online cohort of PrEP-using MSM in the Southern United States from October 2019 to July 2020. Participants were administered ten surveys in total, including one ad hoc survey specifically on COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of this ad hoc survey (n=56) and present changes in sexual behaviors and utilization of and access to sexual health services. Using linear mixed-effects regression models, we also analyzed data from the larger cohort and document how sexual behaviors and PrEP use varied longitudinally across several months. RESULTS A fifth of participants discontinued or changed how often they take PrEP because of COVID-19. A quarter of the cohort documented challenges when attempting to access PrEP, HIV testing, or STD testing. For all sexual behaviors examined longitudinally-number of male sexual partners, anal sex acts, condomless anal sex, oral sex (all measured in the past 2 weeks)-there was a decrease from February to April followed by an increase from April to June. DISCUSSION Our findings suggest reduced access to and utilization of STD and HIV services coupled with a continuation of behaviors which confer STD/HIV risk.

The continued use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) which are part of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in COVID-19 patients with hypertension has become controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis by searching Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus and Embase up to 13 May 2020. Data analyses were performed by the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.3 software. Finally, we included 9 studies comprising 3936 patients with hypertension and COVID-19 infection. Compared with non-ACEI/ARB treatment, ACEI/ARB treatment was not associated with disease severity (OR 0.71, 95 % CI 0.46-1.08, P 0.11, I2 59%) but was related to lower mortality of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension (OR 0.57, 95 % CI 0.38-0.84, P 0.004, I2 0). In summary, ACEI/ARB therapy did not aggravate disease severity of COVID-19. Besides, ACEI/ARB therapy can decrease the mortality of COVID-19. Current evidence suggested that RAAS inhibitors should be continued in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Future well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.","Guo, Xiaoming; Zhu, Yueli; Hong, Yuan",Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.120.15572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32458694/,91

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the temperature drop in an endotracheal tube (ETT) during HFV. METHODS We examined the airway temperature in a neonatal HFV system using Babylog® 8000 plus. We measured the temperature change of inspired gases in the ETT under various oscillatory frequencies and oscillatory volumes with a fixed base flow. The temperatures in the ETT during HFV were compared with the temperatures during conventional intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). RESULTS As the oscillatory frequency was increased and the oscillatory volume (VThf) decreased, the difference in temperature between the Y piece and the inlet of an artificial lung in the ETT (ETT outside of body) increased. However, as the oscillatory frequency increased, there was no difference in the ETT temperature under constant oscillatory volume. In contrast, as the oscillatory volume was decreased, the difference in temperature in the ETT was greater under constant oscillatory frequency. Moreover, the temperature drop in the ETT with HFV was lower than that in the IPPV temperature with a similar respiratory volume. CONCLUSIONS The temperature change in the ETT was not dependent on the oscillatory frequency when the oscillatory volume was fixed; however, the temperature was dependent on the oscillatory volume when the oscillatory frequency was fixed.","Nagaya, Ken; Tsuchida, Etsushi; Nohara, Fumikatsu; Okamoto, Toshio; Azuma, Hiroshi",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.22973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574439/,91

Schooling and education, which are crucial for children's future livelihoods, are areas in which children living with HIV often experience exclusion within South African communities. Educators and healthcare professionals, through collaborative efforts, could influence schooling by improving access and care for children living with HIV. Objectives To explore the perceptions of educators and healthcare workers on schooling for children living with HIV in a semi-rural community in South Africa. Methods Semi-structured interviews were held, with eight healthcare workers and eight educators, adopting an explorative qualitative approach. Data from the interviews were transcribed and analysed using content analysis. Results Four overarching themes were identified: the influence of living with HIV on school readiness and progression; stakeholder support practices to enhance bonding and bridging; obstacles to support; and future directives to foster success at school for children living with HIV. Conclusion Educators and healthcare workers felt that social determinants, including poverty and stigma, as well as comorbidities of the virus, influenced the school readiness of children living with HIV. Bonding with children and partnering with caregivers was seen as crucial for fostering successful schooling. Clinical implications Additionally, interdisciplinary collaboration between healthcare workers and educators was seen as important for a holistic approach to caring for children living with HIV. Early identification of disabilities was also believed to be important in addressing the social barriers hindering schooling.","Maddocks, Stacy; Perumal, Kesni; Chetty, Verusia",The South African journal of physiotherapy,https://doi.org/10.4102/sajp.v76i1.1405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832709/,91

160221,SREBP2 gene therapy targeting striatal astrocytes ameliorates Huntington's disease phenotypes.,2021-05-11,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered changes across health care systems, with many sectors seeing significant drops in patient visits. Rapid transition to telemental health (TMH) allowed for the continued delivery of mental health care. Although several guidelines and best practices are available for the methodical development of a TMH service, there are few documented procedures on rapidly converting to fully virtualized services. We discuss how two outpatient mental health clinics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus rapidly virtualized clinical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: All current clinical appointments were converted to virtual, and all new clinical intakes were scheduled as virtual visits starting March 16, 2020. Virtualization included a modified needs assessment, updated clinic procedures, focused patient and staff training on TMH, and increased frequency of team meetings. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of clinic log and electronic health record data to examine the number of appointments and no-shows before and after COVID-19 virtualization. Results: Virtualization was operational within two business days. Scheduled appointments decreased 10.6% immediately postvirtualization, followed by an increase of 17.8% across the 6 months postvirtualization. No-show rates dropped from 11.9% pre- to 6.8% postvirtualization, leading to a 26.2% increase in completed visits. Discussion: Rapid virtualization of mental health services can occur effectively. Wider use and acceptance of TMH, especially to patient-homes, is likely in the foreseeable future as health care providers and systems reconceptualize service delivery. Future research must include analyzing the impact such changes make on clinical outcomes and patient visit volumes.","Mishkind, Matthew C; Shore, Jay H; Bishop, Kammy; D'Amato, Kaitlin; Brame, Azure; Thomas, Marshall; Schneck, Christopher D",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393857/,91

The visual representation methods provide us with detailed insights into protein-ligand interactions, and hence can play a major role in elucidating the structure or reactivity of a biomolecular system. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW Three newly developed computation and visualization methods for studying the physical and chemical properties of molecules are introduced, including their electrostatic potential, lipophilicity potential and excess chemical potential. The newest application examples of visual representations in structure-based rational drug are presented. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN The 3D electrostatic potentials, calculated using the empirical method (EM-ESP), in which the classical Coulomb equation and traditional atomic partial changes are discarded, are highly consistent with the results by the higher level quantum chemical method. The 3D lipophilicity potentials, computed by the heuristic molecular lipophilicity potential method based on the principles of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, are more accurate and reliable than those by using the traditional empirical methods. The 3D excess chemical potentials, derived by the reference interaction site model-hypernetted chain theory, provide a new tool for computational chemistry and molecular modeling. TAKE HOME MESSAGE For structure-based drug design, the visual representations of molecular properties will play a significant role in practical applications. It is anticipated that the new advances in computational chemistry will stimulate the development of molecular modeling methods, further enriching the visual representation techniques for rational drug design, as well as other relevant fields in life science.","Du, Qi-Shi; Huang, Ri-Bo; Chou, Kuo-Chen",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1517/17460441.2010.484837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22823164/,91

161934,"Transcutaneous immunization: an overview of advantages, disease targets, vaccines, and delivery technologies.",2010,"BACKGROUND Current electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived measures provide information on cortical activity and hypnosis but are less accurate regarding subcortical activity, which is expected to vary with the degree of antinociception. Recently, the neurophysiologically based EEG measures of cortical input (CI) and cortical state (CS) have been shown to be prospective indicators of analgesia/antinociception and hypnosis, respectively. In this study, we compared CI and an alternate measure of CS, the composite cortical state (CCS), with the Bispectral Index (BIS) and another recently developed measure of antinociception, the composite variability index (CVI). CVI is an EEG-derived measure based on a weighted combination of BIS and estimated electromyographic activity. By assessing the relationship between these indices for equivalent levels of hypnosis (as quantified using the BIS) and the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance (as determined by the predicted effect-site concentration of remifentanil), we sought to evaluate whether combining hypnotic and analgesic measures could better predict movement in response to a noxious stimulus than when used alone. METHODS Time series of BIS and CVI indices and the raw EEG from a previously published study were reanalyzed. In our current study, the data from 80 patients, each randomly allocated to a target hypnotic level (BIS 50 or BIS 70) and a target remifentanil level (Remi-0, -2, -4 or -6 ng/mL), were included in the analysis. CCS, CI, BIS, and CVI were calculated or quantified at baseline and at a number of intervals after the application of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale and a subsequent tetanic stimulus. The dependency of the putative measures of antinociception CI and CVI on effect-site concentration of remifentanil was then quantified, together with their relationship to the hypnotic measures CCS and BIS. Finally, statistical clustering methods were used to evaluate the extent to which simple combinations of antinociceptive and hypnotic measures could better detect and predict response to stimulation. RESULTS Before stimulation, both CI and CVI differentiated patients who received remifentanil from those who were randomly allocated to the Remi-0 group (CI: Cohen's d = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.83; CVI: Cohen's d = 0.72, 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.88). Strong correlations between BIS and CCS were found (at different periods: 0.55 < R2 < 0.68, P < 0.001). Application of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation stimulus was associated with changes in CI and CCS, whereas, subsequent to the application of both stimuli, changes in all measures were seen. Pairwise combinations of CI and CCS showed higher sensitivity in detecting response to stimulation than CVI and BIS combined (sensitivity [99% confidence interval], 75.8% [52.7%-98.8%] vs 42% [15.4%-68.5%], P = 0.006), with specificity for CI and CCS approaching significance (52% [34.7%-69.3%] vs 24% [9.1%-38.9%], P = 0.0159). CONCLUSIONS Combining electroencephalographically derived hypnotic and analgesic quantifiers may enable better prediction of patients who are likely to respond to tetanic stimulation.","Shoushtarian, Mehrnaz; Sahinovic, Marko M; Absalom, Anthony R; Kalmar, Alain F; Vereecke, Hugo E M; Liley, David T J; Struys, Michel M R F",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000001029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26505573/,91

In the pivotal RE-LY study, dabigatran 110 mg BID was demonstrated to be associated with a stroke rate similar to that observed with warfarin (INR target 2.0 to 3.0), but with a lower rate of major haemorrhage. Dabigatran administered at a dose of 150 mg BID was significantly more effective in stroke prevention than warfarin and showed a similar rate of major hemorrhages. Of note, both dosages resulted in an approximately 60-70% relative risk reduction of haemorrhagic stroke. The dosage of 110 mg BID should be preferably used in patients aged 75-80 years or older as the rate of extracranial bleeding events tends to increase with dabigatran 150 mg BID above this age limit. In RE-LY, myocardial infarcts occurred at a very low incidence.

From an epidemiological point of view, most consider pneumonia, influenza, bronchitis (including acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [AECOPD]), and bronchiolitis to be the most important LRTIs. Areas covered: This review will describe the epidemiology of LRTIs in adults focusing on community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, and AECOPD, utilizing data from the more recent literature. Expert commentary: LRTIs remain exceedingly common, although there have been significant changes in their epidemiology over recent years, both with regard to their frequency and the infecting pathogens. Part of the change in the epidemiology may relate to changing population demographics, the varying prevalence of smoking, and the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children and patterns of vaccine usage. Furthermore, antigenic variations in the influenza viruses dictate the frequency and characteristics of the influenza epidemics and pandemics.","Feldman, Charles; Shaddock, Erica",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2019.1555040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518278/,91
163102,A lung transcriptomic analysis for exploring host response in COVID-19,2020,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common source of genetic variation between individuals and have implications in human disease, pathogen drug resistance, and agriculture. SNPs are typically detected using DNA sequencing, which requires advanced sample preparation and instrumentation, and thus cannot be deployed for on-site testing or in low-resource settings. In this work we have developed a simple and robust assay to rapidly detect SNPs in nucleic acid samples. Our approach combines LAMP-based target amplification with fluorescent probes to detect SNPs with high specificity in a one-pot reaction format. A competitive “sink” strand preferentially binds to off-target products and shifts the free energy landscape to favor specific activation by SNP products. We demonstrated the broad utility and reliability of our SNP-LAMP method by detecting three distinct SNPs across the human genome. We also designed an assay to rapidly detect highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. This work demonstrates that competitive SNP-LAMP is a powerful and universal method that could be applied in point-of-care settings to detect any target SNP with high specificity and sensitivity.","Hyman, Leland B.; Christopher, Clare R.; Romero, Philip A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.29.437576,91

We evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 SAR in Massachusetts schools during 2020-21 and factors associated with transmission risk. Methods: In a convenience sample of 25 Massachusetts public K-12 school districts, de-identified information about SARS-CoV-2 cases and their school-based contacts was reported using a standardized contact-tracing tool. Index cases were included if they were in school while infectious. SAR was defined as the proportion of in-school contacts acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and designated as possible or probable in-school transmission by school-based teams. We compared exposure-specific SAR using unadjusted risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); p-values were calculated using Fishers exact tests. Results Eight districts (70 schools with >33,000 enrolled students) participated. There were 435 index cases and 1,771 school-based contacts (Table 1). Most contacts (1327/1771 [75%]) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and 39/1327 (2.9%) contacts tested positive. Of 39 positive contacts, 10 (25.6%) had clear out-of-school exposures and were deemed not in-school transmissions, so were excluded from further calculations. Twenty-nine (74.4%) contacts were deemed possible or probable in-school transmissions, resulting in an in-school SAR of 2.2%. Of the 29 in-school transmissions, 6 (20.7%) were staff-to-staff, 7 (24.1%) were staff-to-student, 3 (10.3%) were student-to-staff, and 13 (44.8%) were student-to-student; 6 (20.7%) occurred from index cases attending work/school while symptomatic. The unadjusted SAR (Table 2) was significantly higher if the index case was a staff member versus a student (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.06-4.49; p=0.030), if the index case was identified via in-school contact tracing versus via school-based asymptomatic testing (RR 8.44, 95% CI 1.98-36.06; p=0.001), if the exposure occurred at lunch versus elsewhere (RR 5.74, 95% CI 2.11-15.63; p<0.001; all lunch transmissions were staff-to-staff), and if both parties were unmasked versus both masked (RR 6.98, 95% CI 3.09-15.77; p<0.001). For students, SAR did not differ by grade level. Conclusions Secondary attack rates for SARS-CoV-2 were low in public school settings with comprehensive mitigation measures in place before the emergence of the delta variant; lack of masking and staff-to-staff dining were associated with increased risk.","Nelson, S.

165550,Microbial and autoantibody immunogenic repertoires in TIF1γ autoantibody positive dermatomyositis,2020-03-26,"In continuation of the annual national surveys of winter wheat, which began in 1970, samples from between 250 and 350 randomly selected wheat crops in England and Wales between 1999 to 2019 were visually assessed for disease symptoms during the milky ripe development stages (GS 73–75). Septoria tritici blotch was the most prevalent and severe foliar disease each year, although annual levels fluctuated considerably and there was no overall significant change over the two decades. Incidence of brown rust, yellow rust, take‐all, and barley yellow dwarf virus also showed no significant overall change during the survey period, whereas glume blotch, powdery mildew, eyespot, and sharp eyespot all showed significant decline. Fusarium ear blight has significantly increased in both incidence and severity, causing a serious epidemic in 2012, when 96% of crops were affected. Tan spot has been the third most prevalent foliar disease since 2009 although severity is still very low. Regional disease levels were consistent over the two decades, providing reliable baselines to measure changes in seasonal disease severity. There were significant changes in agronomic practice with a rise to predominance of minimum tillage over the use of ploughing, decreases in overall disease susceptibility of cultivars grown, a major increase in the use of oilseed rape in the rotation and a long‐term trend towards earlier sowing. Fungicide use increased considerably, with over 98% crops sprayed and an average of 3.5 applications made per crop each year since 2014. Implications of changes over the last 21 years are discussed.

Cuzner,1985-11-30,"The present study aimed to investigate Indonesian second language (L2) learners’ level of resilience and the relationship between their resilience and their self-directed learning (SDL) in an online learning setting at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study used a survey method by distributing Google Form questionnaires. The participants were 187 university student participants taking English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classes online in their respective departments. It was conducted to fill the void in resilience literature in the Indonesian L2 context and to find out the Indonesian learners’ resilience in the online learning setting as well as to know whether learners’ resilience was associated with their SDL, a critical element to succeed in online learning. The study found that learners possessed a high level of resilience. Learners were found to have a high level of realistic optimism and self-discipline, prominent characteristics of resilience. However, they reported a slightly lower level of capability in handling multiple tasks at the same time. The study further found that learners’ resilience was significantly, moderately, and positively correlated with their SDL. Based on the findings, possible contributions and implications are stated alongside the limitations of the study and possible directions for future research.","Subekti, Adaninggar Septi; en,",JEELS (Journal Of English Education And Linguistics Studies),https://doi.org/10.30762/jeels.v8i1.2662,91

Being part of this environment, enterprises generate information resources to develop their desired image, which may vary according to the factors characterizing the information environment. Information capital is a comprehensive characteristic of an enterprise and determines its effectiveness and sustainability. The purpose of this study is to develop a toolkit that allows one to assess the information capital of an enterprise, reflecting its perception within the digital information environment. It is necessary to develop the methodology for the formation of such tools. As a result, a fuzzy-plural approach has been developed to evaluate the index of external information capital. This model allows us to assess the external information capital and to simulate its changes caused by various kinds of information events. The study of key elements, for example, the stability and tonality indices, index of target perception made it possible to systematize chaotic changes in the external environment and describe them using the Chen–Lee attractor model. The results of this study can be useful for researchers in the field of digital information analysis, in particular for the comparative analysis of enterprises and the assessment of their information capital. © 2021 by the authors.

These models have elucidated important epidemiological transmission parameters, in addition to making short-term projections. Methods We constructed a compartmental mathematical model for the transmission, detection and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections for regions where Anglo American has mining operations. We fitted the model to publicly available data and used it to make short-term projections. Finally, we evaluated how the model performed by comparing short-term projections to actual confirmed cases, retrospectively. Findings The average forecast errors for four-week-ahead projections ranged between 1% and 8% in all the countries and regions considered in this study. All but one region had more than 75% of the true values falling within the range of four-week-ahead projections. The quality of the projections improved with time as expected due to increased historical data. Conclusion Our model produced four-week forecasts with a sufficiently high level of accuracy to guide operational and strategic planning for business continuity and COVID-19 responses in Anglo American mining sites.","Delva, W.; Dominic, E.; Beauclair, R.; Ouifki, R.; Kroon, M.; Volmink, H.; Dorkin, E.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.06.21263151v1?rss=1,91

The educational process was transferred to an on-line environment, in person contact becoming nonexistent outside the group of people from one’s household. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the mental health status in medical undergraduates in Romania during lockdown. A questionnaire was used in April 2020 to collect information regarding the life of students during social isolations and to assess the mental health of students using a self-reported 1-7 scale on 21 relevant endpoints. After data quality control, the remaining 1978 data entries were analysed in SPSS 20. We identified multiple factors that may contribute to the mental health of undergraduate students, such as: partner status and offline contact, personality traits, social media and streaming platforms usage. There were differences regarding the mental health status indicated by endpoints between: genders, living environment, owning a pet, etc. This study describes how mental health, a neglected subject in the Romanian public health arena, is influenced by various factors during lockdowns. Further research should be conducted and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent the degradation of mental health in medical students under pandemic circumstances. © 2020 Bucharest College of Physicians.

This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between persistent lymphopenia and ARDS. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 125 patients with COVID-19 admitted to government-designated treatment center between 14 January 2020, and 20 March 2020 was conducted. We recorded all complete blood cell counts during the day 0th, 3rd, and 7th following the diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients were grouped based on the depression of the lymphocyte cell count, their return, or their failure to normal. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ARDS, and secondary outcomes included developing vital organ dysfunction and hospital lengths of stay. Results: 17.6% (22/125) patients developed ARDS. The lymphocyte counts with ARDS and non-ARDS were 0.94 × 109/L, 1.20 × 109/L at admission, respectively (p = 0.02). On the 3rd and 7th day, the median of lymphocyte count in ARDS was significantly lower than that of non-ARDS. Multivariable logistic regression, which was adjusting for potentially confounding factors (including age, comorbidities, and APACHE II score), showed that persistent lymphopenia within the 7th day was independently associated with ARDS (OR, 3.94 [95% CI, 1.26–12.33, p = 0.018). Further, patients with persistent lymphopenia had longer hospital lengths of stay (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The results showed persistent lymphopenia predicted ARDS after COVID-19. Further studies are needed to investigate whether immunostimulation of lymphocytes within 1 week can reduce ARDS occurrence in patients with COVID-19.

169129,Genomic surveillance at scale is required to detect newly emerging strains at an early timepoint,2021,"Background: Osteoarthritis of the knee (KOA) is a very common rheumatic disease, and its global burden is gradually increasing (1). The benefits of exercise in patients with KOA are supported by high-level evidence and take their place in primary care therapy (2). Today, coronavirus disease 2019 has developed as a pandemic all over the world, creating difficulties in healthcare and highlighting home-based rehabilitation (HBR) (3). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for evaluating the effects of clinical interventions, but poorly reported results can have negative consequences. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) evaluates the methodological quality of RCTs (4). The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement has been developed to improve the reporting quality of RCTs (5).There are no studies examining the quality of RCTs related to HBR in patients with KOA. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the reporting quality of HBR trials for KOA, and explore the factors associated with the reporting. Methods: Two independent researchers investigated HBR RCTs in patients with KOA published between 1999 and 2020 were sourced from PubMed, the Cochrane Reviews and Web of Science. Each researcher evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies using the PEDro scoring and reporting aspects using 9 items from CONSORT. The relationship between adherence to the CONSORT criteria and the PEDro score were evaluated. Results: Twenty-five RCTs met our eligibility criteria. The mean PEDro score of studies is 5.76 ± 1.48. Only one study found high quality (PEDro score: ≥ 9). The PEDro scores were: randomization type (96%, 24/25) and baseline comparability (92%, 23/25);all studies described group comparisons and variablity measures. In contrast, concealed allocation (18%, 7/25), blinding of participants (16%, 4/25) and therapists (0%) were not included in most studies. The CONSORT criteria were: flow diagram (92%, 23/25), sample size, subgroup analysis and sources of funding (56%, 11/25 for all three), while the majority of studies the trial registration number (16%, 4/25) was not available. A high level of correlation was found between meeting the CONSORT criteria and PEDro scores (r=0.820, p<0.001). Conclusion: The majority of RCTs based on HBR for KOA are low-to-modarate quality studies based on the PEDro score. Adherence to the CONSORT criteria is linked to high quality scores. If the studies are planned and written in accordance with the CONSORT criteria, we think that better quality studies will emerge.","Meran, M.; Unver, B.; Çaǧlar, E.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.476,91

By analyzing policy responses from the government and colleges and examining prominent discourses on higher education, it provides a context for discussing the implications of COVID-19 on education policy and what the post-pandemic era would bring. To this end, we utilized BIgKinds, a big data research solution for news articles offered by the Korea Press Foundation, to select a total of 2636 media reports and conducted Topic Modelling based on LDA algorithms using NetMiner. The analyses are split into three distinct periods of COVID-19 spread in the country. Some notable topics from the first phase are remote class, tuition refund, returning Chinese international students, and normalization of college education. Preparations for the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT), contact and contactless classes, preparations for early admissions, and supporting job market candidates are extracted for the second phase. For the third phase, the extracted topics include CSAT and college-specific exams, quarantine on campus, social relations on campus, and support for job market candidates. The results confirmed widespread public attention to the relevant issues but also showed empirically that the measures taken by the government and college administrations to combat COVID-19 had limited visibility among media reports. It is important to note that timely and appropriate responses from the government and colleges have enabled continuation of higher education in some capacity during the pandemic. In addition to the media’s role in reporting issues of public interest, there is also a need for continued research and discussion on higher education amid COVID-19 to help effect actual results from various policy efforts.","Ko, Jangwan Paek Seungsu Park Seoyoon Park Jiwoo",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137347,91

To understand and monitor properly the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic, population based seroprevalence studies are a valid tool for the infection rates and effective prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2. Aim: In this prospective study, we assessed the changes in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rates among non-vaccinated blood donors in South-Eastern Italy over May 2020 to March 2021. Methods: 8,183 healthy blood donors referring to the Transfusion Center at the University Hospital Riuniti of Foggia (Italy) for blood donation in the period May 2020-March 2021 were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS 3600. None of the considered subjects had a diagnosed symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Results: Overall, 516 resulted positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (6.3%, 95% CI, 0.03-0.15%), 387 (4.7%) were male and 129 (1.7%) female. A statistically significant increase in the seropositive population was found from May 2020 to March 2021 (Fisher's p<0.001). The difference of the seroprevalence was significant in terms of age but not sex (2-sided p<0.05 for age; 2-sided p>0.05 for sex) in both groups. Conclusion: Our study shows a significant increase in the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors and suggests a potential role of asymptomatic individuals in continuing the spread of the pandemic. These results may contribute to establishing containment measures and priorities in vaccine campaigns.","Antonucci, p.; fiore, j.

174734,Novel personalized cancer vaccine platform based on Bacillus Calmette-Guèrin,2021-03-05,"Background: The impact of COVID-19 has disproportionately affected every aspect of cancer care and research-from introducing new risks for patients to disrupting the delivery of treatment and continuity of research. Variation in risk of adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients by cancer type has been reported from relatively small cohorts. Gaps in understanding effects of COVID-19 on cancer patients can be addressed through the study of a well-constructed representative cohort. The NCATS' National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) is a centralized data resource representing the largest multi-center cohort of COVID-19 cases and controls nationwide. We aimed to construct and characterize the cohort of cancer patients within N3C and identify risk factors for all-cause mortality from COVID-19. Methods: From the harmonized N3C clinical dataset, we used 3,295,963 patients from 39 medical US centers to construct a cancer patient cohort. We restricted analyses to adults ≥18 yo with a COVID-19 positive PCR or antigen test or ICD-10-CM diagnostic code for COVID-19 between 1/1/2020 and 2/14/2021. We followed N3C definitions where each lab-confirmed positive patient has one single index encounter. A modified WHO Clinical Progression Scale was used to determine clinical severity. All analyses were performed in the N3C Data Enclave on the Palantir platform. Results: A total of 372,883 adult patients with cancer were identified from the N3C cohort;54,642 (14.7%) were COVID-19 positive. Most common represented cancers were skin (11.5%), breast (10.2%), prostate (8%), and lung cancer (5.6%). Mean age of COVID-19 positive patients was 61.6 years (SD 16.7), 47.3% over 65yo, 53.7% females, 67.2% non-Hispanic White, 21.0% Black, and 7.7% Hispanic or Latino. A total of 14.6% were current or former smokers, 22.3% had a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score of 0, 4.6% score of 1 and 28.1% score of 2. Among hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients, average length of stay in the hospital was 6 days (SD 23.1 days), 7.0% patients had died while in their initial COVID-19 hospitalization, 4.5% required invasive ventilation, and 0.1% extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Survival probability was 86.4% at 10 days and 63.6% at 30 days. Older age over 65yo (Hazard ratio (HR) = 6.1, 95%CI: 4.3, 8.7), male gender (HR = 1.2, 95%CI: 1.1, 1.2), a CCI score of 2 or more (HR = 1.15, 95%CI: 1.1, 1.2), and acute kidney injury during hospitalization (HR = 1.3, 95%CI: 1.2, 1.4) were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Conclusions: Using the N3C cohort we assembled the largest nationally representative cohort on patients with cancer and COVID-19 to date. We identified demographic and clinical factors associated with increased all-cause mortality in cancer patients. Full characterization of the cohort will provide further insights on the effects of COVID-19 on cancer outcomes and the ability to continue specific cancer treatments.","Sharafeldin, N.; Su, J.; Madhira, V.; Song, Q.; Lee, E.; Kuhrt, N.; Liu, F.; Bergquist, T.; Guinney, J.; Bates, B.; Topaloglu, U.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15_suppl.1500,91

This study aimed to examine the differences in dietary behaviors during the pandemic across job types and industries. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Novel-coronavirus and Work Project. Job type and industry were classified into 3 and 22 groups, respectively. Dietary behaviors were assessed using self-reported questionnaires regarding eating breakfast, frequency of meals, and eating fast foods. Changes in eating breakfast during the pandemic were also evaluated. Logistic regression analysis nested in the workplace prefecture was carried out and adjusted for gender, age, body mass index, presence of family members, educational background, and household income. Results: Workers involved in jobs that require communicating with people were more likely to skip breakfast (OR 1.17, 95%CI 1.10-1.24) and had a lower frequency of meals (OR 1.25, 95%CI 1.17-1.34) than workers engaged in desk work. Manual workers were more likely to eat fast food or meals (OR 1.10, 95%CI 1.03-1.17) than workers engaged in desk work. Workers engaged in newspaper, magazine, television, radio, advertising, and other mass media industries were more likely to skip breakfast (OR 2.43, 95%CI 1.82-3.24) and have a lower frequency of meals (OR 3.90, 95%CI 2.87-5.28) than workers in public offices and organizations.

In the field of ENT surgery, one such activity is tracheotomy. The aim of this study was to clarify the aerosol exposure during tracheotomy. Material and method To simulate the air flow during a tracheotomy an airway model filled with artificial fog was developed. With the help of a projector the dispersion of the fog was visualized and video documented for further evaluation. The evaluation was performed with and without a laminar airflow system. Results Without LAF the aerosol was only slowed down by gravity. Approximately 50% of the aerosol volume reached the face of the surgeon. With LAF the aerosol rose about 40 cm upwards for about 1.6 seconds. During this ascent was noticeably slowed down. Afterwards, the flow was reversed to a large extent and began sinking. Nevertheless, approx. 4.8 ± 3.4% of the aerosol volume reached the surgeon's face. Discussion Although the LAF systems mandatory in German operating theatres considerably reduce the amount of aerosol that reaches the surgeon's face, a relevant measurable proportion still was detected in front of the surgeon's face mask. Wherever possible the protective measures in the context of a surgical tracheotomy should include performing the tracheotomy under a laminar air flow.","Loth, A. G.; Leinung, M.; Guderian, D.

178322,Survey of contaminated percutaneous injuries in anesthesiologists,2021-01-25,"Bourbon virus (BRBV) was first isolated from a patient hospitalized at the University of Kansas Hospital in 2014. Since then, several deaths have been reported to be caused by BRBV infection in the Midwest and Southern United States. BRBV is a tick-borne virus that is widely carried by lone star ticks. It belongs to genus Thogotovirus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. Currently, there are no treatments or vaccines available for BRBV or thogotovirus infection caused diseases. In this study, we reconstituted a replicon reporter system, composed of plasmids expressing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) complex (PA, PB1 and PB2), nucleocapsid (NP) protein, and a reporter gene flanked by the 3’ and 5’ UTR of the envelope glycoprotein (GP) genome segment. By using the luciferase reporter, we screened a few small molecule compounds of anti-endonuclease that inhibited the nicking activity by parvovirus B19 (B19V) NS1, as well as FDA-approved drugs targeting the RdRP of influenza virus. Our results demonstrated that myricetin, and an anti-B19V NS1 nicking inhibitor, efficiently inhibited the RdRP activity of BRBV and virus replication. The IC50 and EC50 of myricetin are 2.22 μM and 4.6 μM, respectively, in cells. Myricetin had minimal cytotoxicity in cells, and therefore the therapeutic index of the compound is high. In conclusion, the BRBV replicon system is a useful tool to study viral RNA replication and to develop antivirals, and myricetin may hold promise in treatment of BRBV infected patients.","Hao, Siyuan; Ning, Kang; Wang, Xiaomei; Wang, Jianke; Cheng, Fang; Ganaie, Safder S.; Tavis, John E.; Qiu, Jianming",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.058693,91

It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is detected only in a third (32.9%) of hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms, in 4.3% of cases - in combination with seasonal CoV-OC43 / CoV-229E, in 11.6% - with other respiratory viruses. The most frequent source of infection with the SARS-Cov-2 were family members. Children with a moderate form of the disease predominated among the patients. The leading symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, catarrhal symptoms, as well as gastrointestinal manifestations and anosmia. A feature of the new coronavirus infection in newborns and children of the first month of life was the absence of fever and intoxication, the lack of expression of catarrhal manifestations when the colon is involved in the pathological process (colitis, rarely - hemocolitis).

The resulting simple analytical relationships allow for the assessment of factors determining the intensity of the spread of infection, including the changing requirements for quarantine severity. The prediction method presented makes it possible to calculate both the total number of infected persons and the maximum rate of spread of infection. Following the publication of this work in May 2020, in October this year there was a new surge in the virus epidemic, the intensity of which depends on the population's compliance with the rules of hygiene and social distance. Comparison of the results of the model calculations with the statistics for Berlin shows that they are of satisfactory quality. In particular, it shows that with an epidemic growth rate of around 1,000 people/day, unless additional quarantine measures are taken, the total number of infections can be expected to approach 100,000 within approximately six months. It is shown that the intensity of the virus's spread depends on the socio-demographic composition of the population in different districts of Berlin and age structure. The possible impact of behavioural factors dependent on the psychological state of people on the spread of the epidemic, which can be assessed by analysing changes in heart rate, is discussed.","Below, D.; Mairanowski, J.; Mairanowski, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.14.20231837v1?rss=1,91

The study assessed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on diet diversity, calorie consumption and intake of essential nutrients based on the gender of the households. Design/methodology/approach: Mixed-design ANOVA and logistic regression were used to analyze the collected data from 260 female- and 463 male-headed households through an online survey in Pakistan. Findings: The outcomes revealed that the diet diversity of female households was affected more due to the COVID-19 compared to male households. The decline in daily nutrients' (protein, phosphorus, zinc, iron and iodine) intake during the COVID-19 was also greater for female-headed households than male-headed households. The share of all food groups in daily calorie and nutrient provision decreased significantly during the COVID-19 for both types of households. The share of meat and meat products declined more for female-headed households compared to male-headed households. The share of perishable commodities in calorie provision to female and male households decreased 2% during the COVID-19 compared to the normal period. Small- and medium-sized female and male households were less likely to experience worsened diet diversity than large-sized households during the COVID-19. Low-income compared to medium- and high-income female and male households were more likely to report declined food diversity during the COVID-19. Research limitations/implications: The data used in this study were collected through an online survey due to public health measures imposed in the country. Originality/value: Despite the emergence of literature on the implications of the pandemic on food security, the studies related to the gender-based impacts of COVID-19 on diet diversity and nutritional intakes of necessary nutrients are still non-existent.

Methods: Patients admitted to a single tertiary center for HF between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016 without atrial fibrillation and with at least one baseline ECG were included. Automated ECG measurements were performed. The primary outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular (CAD) mortality, and the secondary outcomes were stroke, and ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (VA/SCD). The prognostic values of the heart rate, PR segment, QRS duration, PT interval, QT interval, and QTc were assessed. Gender-specific optimal cutoffs of the above measurements were identified with the maximally selected rank statistics approach. Results: In total, 2718 patients (median age 77 years; 1302 males) were included with a median follow-up of 4.8 years; the females were significantly older (p<0.0001). Females had higher rates of all-cause (p=0.04) and CAD mortality (p=0.02), while males had higher rates of VA/SCD (p=0.02). Higher heart rate, longer PT interval, wider QRS, and longer QT interval and QTc predicted all-cause mortality in males, while only shorter PR segment, longer QRS duration and QTc predicted the same in females. Longer QRS duration, QT interval, and QTc predicted CAD mortality in males, while longer PT interval, wider QRS and longer QTc predicted the same in females. ECG measurements also predicted the secondary outcomes to different extents depending on genders. Conclusions: Selected ECG measurements have significant gender-specific prognostic value in patients admitted for heart failure.","Zhou, J.; Hothi, S.; Chan, J. S. K.; Lee, S.; Wong, W. T.; Leung, K.

It has been clinically tested and validated in intubated Covid-19 patients. Once the pandemic hit Chilean soil in March 2020, it was quite clear that the number of mechanical ventilators available would not be enough. As in other parts of the world many initiatives sprung, most of them naively simple. Chilean medical societies joined engineering specialists and agreed early on in an organized and regulated open process for validating emergency mechanical ventilators, thus allowing for rapid development but with the required functionality, reliability, and safety features. VEMERS UC was one of a few that completed successfully all stages of the validating process, the final test being on five critically ill intubated Covid-19 patients for eight hours each. VEMERS UC is based on an electropneumatic circuit architecture, and its components are all low cost, off-the-shelf pneumatic, and electronic products easily obtained in industrial markets. It works in continuous mandatory volume control mode. The novel technical features of VEMERS UC are discussed here as well as the results obtained in each stage of the validating process. The validating process carried out in Chile is noteworthy by itself, and it could be used as an example in other developing countries. Furthermore, VEMERS UC can be used as a guiding design reference in other countries as well, since this design has already been thoroughly tested in human patients and has proven to work successfully.","Chiang, L.

Dysregulation of immune response and inflammatory signaling is known to play an important role in lung tumorigenesis, but the causal drivers of this process have yet to be elucidated. To identify circulating inflammatory and immune-related proteins that influence risk for lung cancer we related genetically predicted plasma levels for 85 inflammation and immune proteins with susceptibility to lung cancer. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses in 29,266 cases and 56,450 controls identified a candidate causal marker, IL-18, which conferred lower risk of lung cancer (OR per standard deviation increase: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.79-0.92]), in particular for adenocarcinoma (OR: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.72-0.89]). We subsequently validated this association using polygenic IL-18 predictions in the UK Biobank (HR highest vs. lowest quartile: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.72-0.95]) and using pre-diagnostic blood concentrations of IL-18 in 732 cases and 732 controls after controlling for the inhibitory role of IL-18BP (OR highest vs. lowest quartile: 0.63 [95% CI: 0.41-0.91]). Genetic colocalization suggested that IL-18 may act on lung cancer risk locally via lung tissue expression, and joint MR and tumor microenvironment analyses highlight CD8 T cells and NK cells as potential mediators. In addition to risk, IL-18 expression in adenocarcinoma tumor tissue was found to be associated with all-cause mortality in 480 TCGA samples after controlling for IL-18BP (HR per SD: 0.87 [95% CI: 0.78, 0.98]), which is in line with recent studies showing anti-tumor effects of IL-18. Our comprehensive genomic triangulation study thus highlights the potential for IL-18 as an aetiological biomarker and targetable for immune-oncology therapies.","Smith-Byrne, K.; Chen, Y.; Kachuri, L.; Kapoor, P.

182805,Tear lipocalin is the major endonuclease in tears,2008-01-29,"Purpose This essay makes the point that the corona crisis should motivate business schools and scholars to reflect on their interpretation of responsible management education (RME). It suggests both a conceptual and a practice renewal of RME, by respectively highlighting the relevance of the constructs organizational climate (OC) and professorial roles (PR) and calling for an enactment of business schools' employer responsibility. It also argues that beyond mere techno-pedagogical and strategic developments, business schools' post-pandemic challenges should encompass a narrative change. Design/methodology/approach Review of recent studies on the neo-liberalization of business schools and the implications of the latter on management educators and management education. Findings The corona crisis carries the risk of putting center stage and amplifying the entrepreneurial narrative in business schools. Such a narrative is deeply rooted in neoliberal assumptions. However, the corona crisis is also an opportunity to renew RME and to favour critical studies, encourage moral imagination and embark collectively on systemic activism. Originality/value Like other recent work, this paper reflects on what RME should mean and how business schools should set and fulfill their RME agenda in the aftermath of the corona crisis. To complement those former work, this paper proposes that the constructs of OC and PR be invited into the conceptualization of RME and insists that business schools acknowledge their employer responsibility.","Ramboarisata, L.",Journal of Global Responsibility,https://doi.org/10.1108/jgr-12-2020-0110,91

Traumatic SAH (tSAH) has been described as an adverse prognostic factor leading to progressive neurological deterioration and increased morbidity and mortality. However, a limited number of studies evaluate recent trends in the diagnostic and management of SAH in the context of trauma. The objective of this scoping review was to understand the extent and type of evidence concerning the diagnostic criteria and management of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. This scoping review was conducted following the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. The review included adults who suffered SAH secondary to trauma. Data extracted from each study included study aim, country, methodology, population characteristics, outcome measures, a summary of findings, and future directives. Thirty studies met inclusion criteria. Studies were grouped into five categories by topic: tSAH associated with mild TBI (n=13), and severe TBI (n=3); clinical management and diagnosis (n=9); imaging (n=3); and 5) aneurysmal tSAH (n=1). Of the 30 studies, two came from a low-and middle-income country (LMIC); excluding China, nearly a high-income country. Patients with tSAH associated with mTBI have a very low risk of clinical deterioration and surgical intervention and should be managed conservatively when considering ICU admission. The Helsinki and Stockholm CT scoring systems, in addition to the AIS, Cr, age decision tree, may be valuable tools to use when predicting outcome and mortality.","Griswold, D.; Fernandez, L.; Rubiano, A.

183303,An Overview of Health Disparities in Asthma,2021-09-30,"The ESPRESSO spectrograph is a new powerful tool to detect and characterize extrasolar planets. Its design allows unprecedented radial velocity precision (down to a few tens of cm/s) and long-term thermo-mechanical stability. We present the first standalone detection of an extrasolar planet by blind radial velocity search using ESPRESSO and aim at showing the power of the instrument in characterizing planetary signals at different periodicities in long time spans. We use 41 ESPRESSO measurements of HD\,22496 within a time span of 895 days with a median photon noise of 18 cm/s. A radial velocity analysis is performed to test the presence of planets in the system and to account for the stellar activity of this K5-K7 main sequence star. For benchmarking and comparison, we attempt the detection with 43 archive HARPS measurements and compare the results yielded by the two datasets. We also use four TESS sectors to search for transits. We find radial velocity variations compatible with a close-in planet with an orbital period of $P=5.09071\pm0.00026$ days when simultaneously accounting for the effects of stellar activity at longer time scales ($P_{\rm rot}=34.99^{+0.58}_{-0.53}$ days). We characterize the physical and orbital properties of the planet and find a minimum mass of $5.57^{+0.73}_{-0.68}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\oplus}$, right in the dichotomic regime between rocky and gaseous planets. Although not transiting according to TESS data, if aligned with the stellar spin axis, the absolute mass of the planet must be below 16 $\mathrm{M}_{\oplus}$. We find no significant evidence for additional signals with semi-amplitudes above 56 cm/s at 95% confidence. With a modest set of radial velocity measurements, ESPRESSO is capable of detecting and characterizing low-mass planets and constrain the presence of planets in the habitable zone of K-dwarfs down to the rocky-mass regime.","Lillo-Box, J.; Faria, J.

183304,The Sick Bias,2021-09-30,"Introduction: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) caused a pandemic that led to death of more than 3 million people globally. COVID-19 may yield a variety of clinical pictures, differing from pneumonitis to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) along with vascular damage in the lung tissue, which is named as endotheliitis, To date, no specific treatment was approved by any authority for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Here, we presented our experience on COVID-19 with evaluating 11,190 COVID-19 patients by presenting the manifestations of endotheliitis in skin, lung, and brain tissues according to different phases of COVID-19. In our perspective, distinctive manifestations in each COVID-19 patient, including non-respiratory conditions in the acute phase and the emerging risk of long-lasting complications, suggest that COVID-19 has an endotheliitis-centred thrombo-inflammatory pathophysiology. Accordingly, our treatment strategy was adopted to prevent both respiratory and vascular distresses, which are categorized according to extent of endotheliitis. (Group A: no or mild pulmonary involvement, Group B: moderate pulmonary involvement with clinical risk of deterioration, Group C: severe pulmonary involvement and respiratory failure). Potential pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to endotheliitis includes cytokine storm and toxic plasma, thromboinflammation and systemic microangiopathy. Results: A total of 11.190 COVID-19 patients that were diagnosed and treated in Samsun VM Medicalpark Hospital, Turkey, between March 2020 and April 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. The mean age was 59.2 years and male to female ratio was 5507/5683. Among these patients, 1896 (16.9%) individuals were hospitalized. While 1220 (64.3%) of the inpatients were hospitalized within the first 10 days after the diagnosis, 676 (35.7%) of them were hospitalized 10 days after their diagnosis. The number of patients who did not respond to group A and B treatments and developed hypoxemic respiratory failure (Group C) was 520 (27.4%). Among hospitalized patients, 146 (7.7%) individuals needed ventilator support (non-invasive/invasive mechanical ventilation) and were followed in the intensive care unit, and 43 (2.2%) patients died. In conclusion; Endotheliitis can also explain the mechanism behind the respiratory failure in COVID-19, and the difference of COVID-19 related ARDS from ARDS seen in other critical conditions. Hence, daily evaluation of momentary changes in clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of patients and deciding appropriate pathophysiological treatment would help to reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19.","Dirican, A.; Ildir, S.; Uzar, T.; Karaman, I.; OZKAYA, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.05.21259790v1?rss=1,91

Instead of tracing users' locations, the presence of individuals is detected by analysing the voices, and people's faces are detected by the camera. To do this, two different Android applications were implemented. The first one uses the camera to detect people's faces whenever the user answers or performs a phone call. Firebase Platform will be used to detect faces captured by the camera and determine its size and estimate their distance to the phone terminal. The second application uses voice biometrics to differentiate the users' voice from unknown speakers and creates a neural network model based on 5 samples of the user's voice. This feature will only be activated whenever the user is surfing the Internet or using other applications to prevent undesired contacts. Currently, the patient's tracking is performed by geolocation or by using Bluetooth connection. Although face detection and voice recognition are existing methods, this paper aims to use them and integrate both in a single device.

184669,"Opportunistic fungi and fungal infections: the challenge of a single, general antifungal vaccine.",2006,"With the approval of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (trade name Trikafta), the vast majority of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) are eligible for CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy. Remaining individuals have premature termination codons or rare CFTR variants with limited treatment options. Although clinical modulator response can be reliably predicted using primary airway epithelial cells, primary cells carrying rare CFTR variants are scarce. To overcome this obstacle, these cells can be expanded by overexpression of mouse Bmi-1 and human TERT (hTERT). We therefore used this approach to develop two non-CF and three CF (F508del/F508del, F508del/S492F, W1282X/W1282X) nasal cell lines and two W1282X/W1282X bronchial cell lines. Bmi-1/hTERT cell lines recapitulated primary cell morphology and ion transport function. The F508del/F508del and F508del/S492F cell lines robustly responded to Trikafta, which was mirrored in the parent primary cells and the cell donors’ clinical response. CC-90009, a novel cereblon E3 ligase modulator targeting the GSPT1 protein, rescued ~20% of wildtype CFTR function in our panel of W1282X/W1282X cell lines and primary cells. Intriguingly, CC-90009 also diminished epithelial sodium channel function. These studies demonstrate that Bmi-1/hTERT cell lines faithfully mirror primary cell responses to CFTR modulators and illustrate novel therapeutic approaches for the W1282X CFTR variant.","Lee, Rhianna E.; Lewis, Catherine A.; He, Lihua; Gallant, Samuel C.; Mascenik, Teresa M.; Dang, Hong; Morton, Lisa C.; Minges, John T.; Theile, Jonathan W.; Castle, Neil A.; Knowles, Michael R.; Kimple, Adam J.; Randell, Scott H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.462149,91

Methods: In 2019, haemoglobin results of women requiring elective caesarean section were audited during pregnancy and after surgery. Subsequently, changes were made to the Anaemia in Pregnancy Guideline: treatment flow charts were simplified and the Ferinject dose was maximised to 1000 mg. Re-audit took place in 2020. Results: Data were collected for 100 women in 2019, and 135 women in 2020. In both years anaemia prevalence at booking was low (2.2% and 0.7%, respectively). In 2019, 8 women missed booking blood tests compared to only 3 in 2020: an improvement despite the challenges of Covid-19. All anaemic patients were prescribed oral iron. In both years anaemia prevalence increased at 28 weeks. In 2019 all women were again prescribed oral iron, but only 77.8% were followed up. 3 women remained anaemic despite oral iron therapy, but only 2 were offered Ferinject 500 mg. In 2020 only 2.2% missed followed up. Ferinject 1000 mg was administered to 3 women who did not respond to oral iron, or developed anaemia later in pregnancy. In both years one third of anaemic women developed anaemia in the third trimester despite having appropriate haemoglobin levels at 28 weeks (33% in 2019 and 34% in 2020). Post-operatively 16.3% of women were anaemic in 2019 reducing to 11.1% in 2020. [Formula presented] Figure: Antenatal and post-caesarean anaemia prevalence Discussion: Despite improvements between 2019 and 2020, anaemia still persists unacceptably in the elective caesarean section population despite readily available treatment. A third of women developed anaemia later in pregnancy despite following guidelines. This supports targeting a higher haemoglobin (120g/L) throughout pregnancy to mitigate for anaemia worsening towards term.","Davies, J.

We report on an innovative model for maintaining high-volume, low-barrier STI services during the pandemic.ApproachThe Quick Test Clinic was established in June, 2020 by Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington (KFL&A) Public Health to facilitate nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for gonorrhea (GC) and chlamydia (CT). Operating two half-days per week, the clinic invited clients to complete an intake form and submit a self-collected urine or swab specimen [rectal, meatal, vaginal, pharyngeal] without seeing a healthcare provider. Results were communicated by telephone, and persons with documented infection were promptly treated.Outcomes/ImpactDuring the first six months of operation (19 June 2020 – 18 Jan 2021), the clinic provided 383 STI screenings to 347 unique individuals (mean age 27.9 years [IQR 21.0–32.0]) and a total of 864 self-collected specimens were tested. GC was detected in 13/184 (7.0%) males vs. 4/163 (2.5%) females (p = 0.47). CT was detected in 30/184 males (16.3%) vs. 17/163 (10.4%) females (p =0.11). A total of 4 persons were co-infected with GC and CT. Overall positivity with either GC or CT was 5.8%. Sample site positivity was highest for self-collected rectal specimens (6/46, 13.0%), followed by genital (55/664, 8.3%) and pharyngeal (5/88, 5.7%) specimens.Innovation and SignificanceFindings demonstrate the ongoing need for sexual health services during the COVID crisis, and the feasibility of no-exam, drop-off testing of self-collected specimens. Gonococcal and chlamydial positivity rates exceeded that of standard pre-COVID clinic operations, supporting wider expansion of the Quick Test Clinic model.

This situation has raised fundamental questions about the role of the school in contemporary societies and whether it still fulfils a particular function as a social institution. This article forwards a theoretical discussion on these issues from a critical sociological approach and, especially, from the perspective of social justice. It argues that the two main functions of schools, namely, socialisation and selection, cannot be fully achieved by distance schooling. Moreover, it contends that the lockdown of schools reinforced the crisis of meaning within the school system by hindering its ability to ensure learning for all students. Overall, the article presents a reflection on the meaning of the school institution in the 21st century, representing a key contribution to contemporary debates on the sociology of education.

187237,Sequencing arrays for screening multiple genes associated with early-onset human retinal degenerations on a high-throughput platform.,2005,"Inguinal hernias are a protrusion of the peritoneum through a weakening in the groin in which abdominal content (intestines or fat) can herniate and cause a bulge. Inguinal hernias can be painful and require surgery. Worldwide, approximately 20 million patients are operated each year, with 10,000 in Denmark. The repair of inguinal hernias causes pain and 16% of patients experience chronic pain six months after the standard, open, mesh-based Lichtenstein technique. Therefore, surgeons are trying to improve the techniques by finding new ways of operating. The Onstep method was a new method for the repair of inguinal hernias, presented along with excellent results regarding pain, recurrence and complications. However, the technique had not been tested outside the department of the inventors. The overall aim was to clarify whether the Onstep technique should be implemented on a larger scale outside the departments of the inventors. Six papers are included in this thesis: a systematic review, a protocol article, three reports on the Onstep versus Lichtenstein trial, and finally a focus group interview. The systematic review identified nine different methods of placing a preperitoneal mesh through and open anterior approach. In general, the techniques seem to provide good results regarding pain and discomfort, but more studies are needed. The protocol article describes the randomized, double blinded Onstep versus Lichtenstein study, with focus on the statistical analysis and sample size calculations. Four separate sample size calculations were conducted, making several primary outcomes possible. The three reports of the Onstep versus Lichtenstein study reported on early postoperative outcomes, on chronic pain, and lastly on sexual dysfunction. The overall findings from the trial demonstrated that there were no differences between the Onstep and the Lichtenstein technique regarding early and chronic pain (30 days, six months, and 12 months). However, for the group of patients operated with the Onstep technique, fewer patients experienced pain during sexual activity. The focus group interview was done with experienced surgeons teaching the Onstep technique. They described their experience, thoughts, and concerns regarding teaching the technique. The results from the focus group interview can be used to guide future trainings sessions. In this thesis the Onstep technique has been investigated in comparison with the Lichtenstein technique, but the results have not been as promising as the initial studies from the inventors. However, implementation of the Onstep technique outside the departments of the inventors is unlikely to result in increased risk of complications. Furthermore, the Onstep technique could possibly benefit patients by reducing the risk of pain during sexual activity.","Andresen, Kristoffer",Danish medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29510815/,91

187704,Therapeutic effects of glycyrrhizic acid.,2013,"PURPOSE Experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR) is an animal model of progressive retinal disease that is first manifest as an acute retinal inflammation followed by chronic, immune-associated retinal degeneration in genetically susceptible, BALB/c mice. In retinal degeneration-resistant CD-1 mice, only the acute infection is seen. In the present study, interferon (IFN)-gamma production during ECOR was studied and its role evaluated in the clearance of infectious virus from the retina. METHODS BALB/c, CD-1, and IFN-gamma-deficient (IFN-gamma gko) mice were inoculated with the JHM strain of murine coronavirus by the intravitreal route. Mouse eyes were evaluated for infiltrating cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression by immunocytochemical staining. Isolated retinas were analyzed for IFN-gamma mRNA by RT-PCR, and sera were evaluated for IFN-gamma protein by ELISA assays. RESULTS Virus infection in BALB/c mice was associated with an increase in the incidence and levels of systemic IFN-gamma. Moreover, IFN-gamma mRNA was detected within the retinas of infected animals during the acute phase of the disease but was not detected in normal or mock-injected animals. IFN-gamma mRNA was detected at the time of T-cell infiltration, and earlier studies have shown that this is temporally related to granzyme B gene expression and the clearance of infectious virus from the retina. Retinal IFN-gamma mRNA was also associated with the upregulation of MHC class I and II molecules within the retina. When this infection occurred in IFN-gamma gko mice, the virus was unchecked, and the infection led to death. CONCLUSIONS These studies indicate that generation of IFN-gamma by cells infiltrating the retina is an essential part of an immune mechanism responsible for noncytolytic clearance of infectious virus from the retina.","Hooks, John J; Wang, Yun; Detrick, Barbara",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12882788/,91
188308,Immunization against viral respiratory disease: a review.,2004,"Two surveys conducted in Taiwan during the spring 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic reveal a high degree of concern about the threat posed by SARS to Taiwan and its residents, although respondents believe they are knowledgeable about the risk of SARS and that it is susceptible to individual control. Willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce the risk of infection and death from SARS is elicited using contingent valuation methods. Estimated WTP is high, implying values per statistical life of US dollars 3 to 12 million. While consistent with estimates for high-income countries, these values are substantially larger than previous estimates for Taiwan and may be attributable to the high degree of concern about SARS at the time the data were collected.","Liu, Jin-Tan; Hammitt, James K; Wang, Jung-Der; Tsou, Meng-Wen",Health economics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15386665/,91

We investigated the prevalence of HCoVs among Brazilian outpatients and hospitalised patients with respiratory illnesses during 2009 and 2010. To identify the HCoVs, pancoronavirus and species-specific reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays were performed. Five of 394 samples were positive for HCoVs (1.2%): 1/182 (0.5%) outpatients and 4/212 (1.8%) hospitalised patients. The OC43 and NL63 HCoVs were identified. Two patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. Underlying chronic disease was reported in cases and one diabetic adult died. HCoVs can cause lower respiratory infections and hospitalisation. Patients with pre-existing conditions and respiratory infections should be evaluated for HCoV infections.","Cabeça, Tatiane Karen; Carraro, Emerson; Watanabe, Aripuanã; Granato, Celso; Bellei, Nancy",Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22850964/,91

Thus, monitoring is necessary to prevent respiratory malplacement of the tube. We investigated the utility of capnographic monitoring to prevent respiratory complications due to feeding tube mispositioning in critically ill patients. METHODS This study was a pre and post-interventional study, including 445 feeding tube placements events studied retrospectively in the medical and surgical intensive care units of the Samsung Medical Center. We compared outcomes between time periods before and after capnographic monitoring and documented any respiratory complications. RESULTS Feeding tubes were inserted in 275 cases without capnographic monitoring. Capnographic monitoring was performed in 170 cases. Sixteen patients (4%) had respiratory complications of all tube placements. Feeding tube was inserted into the trachea in 11 (2%) patients and for a pneumothorax in five (1%) patients. Fourteen cases of respiratory complications were detected in the control group (14/275, 5%, 10 tracheal insertions and four pneumothoraxes). Two respiratory complications were detected in the capnographic monitoring group (2/170, 1%, one tracheal insertion and one pneumothorax). Respiratory complications were detected less frequently in the capnographic monitoring group than that in the control group (P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS Capnographic monitoring is simple, easy to learn, and may be useful to prevent respiratory complications when placing a feeding tube in a critically ill patient.","Ryu, Jeong-Am; Choi, Kyoungjin; Yang, Jeong Hoon; Lee, Dae-Sang; Suh, Gee Young; Jeon, Kyeongman; Cho, Joongbum; Chung, Chi Ryang; Sohn, Insuk; Kim, Kiyoun; Park, Chi-Min",BMC anesthesiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27938349/,91

The first seven cases occurred in one family; these were followed by 45 cases in three public hospitals. The objectives of this investigation were to describe the epidemiological characteristic of the cluster and identify potential risk factors and control measures to be instituted to prevent further occurrence of MERS. We obtained the medical records of all confirmed cases, interviewed the members of the affected household and reviewed the actions taken by the health authorities. All the cases were connected. The index case was a 62-year-old man with a history of close contact with dromedary camels; three of the seven infected family members and 18 people in hospitals died (case-fatality rate, 40.4%). The median incubation period was about 6 days. The cluster of cases appeared to be due to high exposure to MERS, delayed diagnosis, inadequate risk communication and inadequate compliance of hospital health workers and visitors with infection prevention and control measures.","El Bushra, H E; Abdalla, M N; Al Arbash, H; Alshayeb, Z; Al-Ali, S; Latif, Z Al-Abdel; Al-Bahkit, H; Abdalla, O; Mohammed, M; Al-Abdely, H; Chahed, M; Lohiniva, A L; Saeed, A Bin",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27714741/,91

The present study was designed to evaluate the oral immunoadjuvant effects of the synbiotic in layer chickens. Using a PCR assay, L. casei subsp. casei was detected specifically in the intestinal chyme of chickens (10 d of age, Julia strain) fed ad libitum on a diet supplemented with 75 mg dextran/kg (dextran-supplemented diet, DSD) and administered orally with 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) L. casei subsp. casei in 0.1 ml PBS with the aid of an intubation needle at 1, 2 and 3 d of age. Furthermore, oral administration of 10(7) CFU L. casei subsp. casei at 1-3 d of age significantly enhanced the production of anti-BSA antibody in DSD-fed chickens (60 d of age) administered orally with 1 mg BSA at 32 and 33 d of age and subcutaneously with 5 microg BSA at 33 d of age. In addition, among bacterial numbers tested, 10(6) CFU L. casei subsp. casei together with dextran induced an effective increase in humoral immune response to mixed inactivated vaccines against Newcastle disease and avian infectious bronchitis, and the treatment may be advantageous in protecting against these infectious diseases in chickens in actual application. These results suggest that dietary supplementation of L. casei subsp. casei with dextran leads to immunomodulation of humoral immune responses.","Ogawa, Tomohiko; Asai, Yasuyuki; Sakamoto, Hiromi; Yasuda, Kenji",The British journal of nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469163/,91

Isolated E2 consisted of rosettes of peplomers, whereas E1, the membrane glycoprotein, was irregular and amorphous. Under certain conditions significant interactions occurred between components of Nonidet P-40-disrupted virions. Incubation of the Nonidet P-40-disrupted virus at 37 degrees C resulted in formation of a complex between one of the viral glycoproteins, E1, and the viral nucleocapsid. This was caused by a temperature-dependent conformational change in E1, resulting in aggregation of E1 and interaction with the viral RNA in the nucleocapsid. E1 also bound rRNA. The E1-nucleocapsid complexes can be distinguished on sucrose and Renografin density gradients from native viral nucleocapsids. The separation of the membrane glycoprotein E1 from the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 permitted preparation of antisera against these isolated proteins. A model is proposed for the arrangement of the three major structural proteins in the coronavirus A59 virion in relation to the viral envelope and RNA.","Sturman, L S; Holmes, K V; Behnke, J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6245243/,91

This study aimed to determine the virus profile in children with ARI presenting with different severities. METHODS Clinical specimens collected from children with ARI in Beijing from September 2010 to March 2011 were investigated for 18 respiratory viruses using an xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Fast (RVP Fast) assay. The Pearson chi-square analysis was used to identify statistical significance. RESULTS Of 270 cases from three groups of ARI patients, including Out-patients, In-patients and patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), viruses were detected in 176 (65.2%) specimens with the RVP Fast assay. The viral detection rate from the Out-patients group (50.0%) was significantly lower than that from the In-patients (71.1%) and ICU-patients (74.4%) groups. The virus distribution was different between the Out-patients group and the other hospitalized groups, while the virus detection rate and distribution characteristics were similar between the In-patients and ICU-patients groups. The co-infection rates of the Out-patients group, the In-patients group, and the ICU-patients group were 15.6%, 50.0% and 35.8%, respectively. In addition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus (ADV), human rhinovirus (HRV) was frequently detected from children with serious illnesses, followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV) and coronaviruses. Parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3) was detected in children with lower respiratory illness, but rarely from those with serious illnesses in the ICU-patient group. CONCLUSION In addition to so-called common respiratory viruses, virus detection in children with ARI should include those thought to be uncommon respiratory viruses, especially when there are severe ARI-related clinical illnesses.","Zhu, Runan; Song, Qinwei; Qian, Yuan; Zhao, Linqing; Deng, Jie; Wang, Fang; Sun, Yu",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25382323/,91

SARS-CoV mediates receptor binding and entry by its spike (S) glycoprotein, and infection is sensitive to lysosomotropic agents that perturb endosomal pH. We demonstrate here that the lysosomotropic-agent-mediated block to SARS-CoV infection is overcome by protease treatment of target-cell-associated virus. In addition, SARS-CoV infection was blocked by specific inhibitors of the pH-sensitive endosomal protease cathepsin L. A cell-free membrane-fusion system demonstrates that engagement of receptor followed by proteolysis is required for SARS-CoV membrane fusion and indicates that cathepsin L is sufficient to activate membrane fusion by SARS-CoV S. These results suggest that SARS-CoV infection results from a unique, three-step process: receptor binding and induced conformational changes in S glycoprotein followed by cathepsin L proteolysis within endosomes. The requirement for cathepsin L proteolysis identifies a previously uncharacterized class of inhibitor for SARS-CoV infection.","Simmons, Graham; Gosalia, Dhaval N; Rennekamp, Andrew J; Reeves, Jacqueline D; Diamond, Scott L; Bates, Paul",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16081529/,91

Because of many overlapping risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and severe COVID-19 infection, many experts believe that vitamin D supplementation could play an important role in prevention and treatment of the new coronavirus disease. Based on available data on the immunological action of vitamin D, it is possible that vitamin D could modulate the bodys response to SARS-CoV-2 infection both in the early viraemic phase and in later hyperinflammatory phase typical for the severe course of the disease. The first available data from epidemiological studies suggest that low serum vitamin D levels are associated with increased susceptibility to the new coronavirus infection as well as with severe course of the disease.","Smaha, Juraj; Kužma, Martin; Jackuliak, Peter; Payer, Juraj",Vnitrni lekarstvi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740849/,91

194576,Identification of Dengue-specific B-Cell Epitopes by Phage-display Random Peptide Library.,2009,"Due to the limited ultrastructural information about the coronavirion, little is known about the interactions acting at the interface between nucleocapsid and viral envelope. Knowing that subtle mutations in the carboxy-terminal endodomain of the M protein are already lethal, we have now probed the equivalent domain of the spike (S) protein by extending it terminally with a foreign sequence of 27 kDa: the green fluorescent protein (GFP). When expressed individually in murine cells, the S-GFP chimeric protein induced the formation of fluorescent syncytia, indicating that it was synthesized and folded properly, trimerized, and transported to the plasma membrane, where it exhibited the two key S protein functions, i.e., interaction with virus receptor molecules and membrane fusion. Incorporation into virus-like particles demonstrated the assembly competence of the chimeric spike protein. The wild-type S gene of mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) was subsequently replaced by the chimeric construct through targeted recombination. A viable MHV-SGFP was obtained, infection by which could be visualized by the fluorescence induced. The efficiency of incorporation of the chimeric protein into particles was, however, reduced relative to that in wild-type particles which may explain, at least in part, the reduced infectivity produced by MHV-SGFP infection. We conclude that the incorporation of spikes carrying the large GFP moiety is apparently impaired by geometrical constraints and selected against during the assembly of virions. Probably due to this disadvantage, deletion mutants, having lost the foreign sequences, rapidly evolved and outcompeted the chimeric viruses during virus propagation. The fluorescent MHV-SGFP will now be a convenient tool to study coronaviral cell entry.","Bosch, Berend Jan; de Haan, Cornelis A M; Rottier, Peter J M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15220410/,91

Starting from purified virions, core structures have been reproducibly isolated as independent entities. The cores were stabilized at basic pH and by the presence of divalent cations, with Mg(2+) ions more effectively contributing to core stability. Core structures showed high resistance to different concentrations of detergents, reducing agents, and urea and low concentrations of monovalent ions (<200 mM). Cores were composed of the nucleoprotein, RNA, and the C domain of the membrane (M) protein. At high salt concentrations (200 to 300 mM), the M protein was no longer associated with the nucleocapsid, which resulted in destruction of the core structure. A specific ionic interaction between the M protein carboxy terminus and the nucleocapsid was demonstrated using three complementary approaches: (i) a binding assay performed between a collection of M protein amino acid substitution or deletion mutants and purified nucleocapsids that led to the identification of a 16-amino-acid (aa) domain (aa 237 to 252) as being responsible for binding the M protein to the nucleocapsid; (ii) the specific inhibition of this binding by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) binding to a carboxy-terminal M protein domain close to the indicated peptide but not by MAbs specific for the M protein amino terminus; and (iii) a 26-residue peptide, including the predicted sequence (aa 237 to 252), which specifically inhibited the binding. Direct binding of the M protein to the nucleoprotein was predicted, since degradation of the exposed RNA by RNase treatment did not affect the binding. It is proposed that the M protein is embedded within the virus membrane and that the C region, exposed to the interior face of the virion in a population of these molecules, interacts with the nucleocapsid to which it is anchored, forming the core. Only the C region of the M protein is part of the core.","Escors, D; Ortego, J; Laude, H; Enjuanes, L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11152504/,91

In this study, we present the clinical features and treatment outcomes of twenty-seven COVID-19 positive patients with leukemia across seven different centers in Istanbul. From March 1st to December 31st 2020, 116 patients were diagnosed with acute leukemia. Thirty-two cases with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 82 cases with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 2 cases with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) were identified. Of the 27 patients with the COVID-19 infection, seven patients had ALL, 19 patients had AML and one patient had MPAL. The mortality rate was 37% among the patients with AML, whereas there were no deaths in the ALL group. The mortality rate of AML patients with the COVID-19 infection was higher compared to cases without the infection (P<0.05). We could not detect any significant difference in the ALL cohort. This study, which includes one of the largest acute leukemia series in literature proved that acute myeloid leukemia patients with the COVID-19 infection have worse outcomes than patients without the infection. The high mortality among patients with acute leukemias hospitalized with COVID-19 highlight the need for aggressive infection prevention, increased surveillance and protective isolation and even modification of the therapy, in case of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity.","Buyuktas, Deram; Acar, Kadir; Sucak, Gulsan; Toptas, Tayfur; Kapucu, Irem; Bekoz, Huseyin; Erdem, Simge; Nalcaci, Meliha; Atalay, Figen; Akay, Meltem Olga; Ferhanoglu, Burhan",American journal of blood research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540352/,91

Virus isolation using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and/or embryonated chicken eggs was also successful for 3 of the 14 PCR-positive samples. Eleven patients (78.6%) were aged <3 years. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin-esterase gene showed that the InfC detected in Mie Prefecture belonged to the C/Sao Paulo/82-related lineage. To determine the seroprevalence of InfC, a total of 575 serum samples from patients aged 1 month to 69 years in Mie Prefecture were screened by hemagglutination inhibition test using the C/Mie/199/2012 (C/Sao Paulo/82-related lineage) strain as the antigen. The samples with an antibody titer of ≥1:16 were designated as antibody-positive. The results showed that 53.7% of the 296 serum samples collected in 2011 and 85.3% of the 279 samples collected in 2012 were positive for antibodies against InfC, suggesting that an outbreak of InfC infection occurred in Mie Prefecture in 2012. Therefore, continuous and proactive monitoring is important to determine the number of InfC-infections and to better understand the epidemiology.","Yano, Takuya; Maeda, Chie; Akachi, Shigehiro; Matsuno, Yukari; Yamadera, Motoko; Kobayashi, Takashi; Nagai, Yuhki; Iwade, Yoshito; Kusuhara, Hajime; Katayama, Masahiko; Fukuta, Miwa; Nakagawa, Yumiko; Naraya, Sagako; Takahashi, Hiroaki; Hiraoka, Minoru; Yamauchi, Akinori; Nishinaka, Takamichi; Amano, Hideomi; Yamaguchi, Tetsuo; Ochiai, Hitoshi; Ihara, Toshiaki; Matsuzaki, Yoko",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647258/,91

As a first approach in investigating whether the corresponding human homologues play a similar role, we expressed human Lsm1p (hLsm1p) and RCK/p54 in yeast. Expression of RCK/p54 but not hLsm1p restored the defect in BMV RNA translation and replication observed in the dhh1Delta and lsm1Delta strains, respectively. This functional conservation, together with the common replication strategies of positive-stranded RNA viruses, suggests that RCK/p54 may also play a role in the replication of positive-stranded RNA viruses that infect humans.","Alves-Rodrigues, Isabel; Mas, Antonio; Díez, Juana",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17301158/,91

196097,Rapid Virtual Stenting for Intracranial Aneurysms.,2016,"BACKGROUND Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation <90%) lasting 2 or more minutes occurs in 6.8% of adult patients undergoing noncardiac anesthesia in operating room settings. Alarm management functionality can be added to decision support systems (DSS) to send text alerts about vital signs outside specified thresholds, using data in anesthesia information management systems. We considered enhancing our DSS to send hypoxemia alerts to the text pagers of supervising anesthesiologists. As part of a voluntary application for an investigative device exemption from our IRB to implement such functionality, we evaluated the maximum potential utility of such an alert system. METHODS Pulse oximetry values (Spo(2)) were extracted from our anesthesia information management systems for all cases performed in our main operating rooms and ambulatory surgical center between September 1, 2011, and February 4, 2012 (n = 16,870). Hypoxemic episodes (Spo(2) < 90%) were characterized as either (a) lasting one or more minutes or (b) lasting 2 or more minutes. A single simulated ""alert"" was modeled as having been sent at the timestamp of the first (a) or the second (b) hypoxemic value. The hypoxemic episode was considered resolved at 1, 3, or 5 minutes after the time of the alert if the Spo(2) value was no longer below the 90% threshold. Two-sided 99% conservative confidence limits were calculated for the percentage of unresolved alerts at the 3 evaluation intervals and compared with 70%, the lower limit of an acceptable true alarm rate for clinical utility. RESULTS There was at least 1 hypoxemic episode lasting 1 minute or longer in 23% of cases, and at least 1 episode lasting 2 minutes or longer in 8% of cases. Only 7% (99% confidence interval [CI] 6% to 8%) of the 1-minute hypoxemic episodes were unresolved after 3 minutes, and only 8% (99% CI 6%to 9%) of 2-minute episodes after 5 minutes (both P < 10(-6) in comparison with 70% minimum reliability rate). CONCLUSIONS Low utility should be expected for a DSS sending hypoxemia alerts to supervising anesthesiologists, because nearly all hypoxemic episodes will have been resolved before arrival of the anesthesiologist in the operating room. These results suggest that the principal research focus should be on developing more sophisticated alerts and processes within rooms for the anesthesia care provider to initiate treatment promptly, to interpret or correct artifacts, and to make it easier to call for assistance via a rapid communication system.","Epstein, Richard H; Dexter, Franklin",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22696609/,91
196320,An EUA for casirivimab and imdevimab for COVID-19.,2020-12-28,"The effect of acute or chronic immunoneutralization of somatostatin (SRIF) on plasma GH, thyrotrophin (TSH) and thyroid hormones was examined. Acute responses to SRIF immunoneutralization were examined using 30 intact male lambs (19.8 +/- 0.6 kg) assigned to one of five treatment groups such that control (C) lambs received no anti-SRIF immunoglobulin and SRIF-immunized (SI) lambs received 2 mg (SI2), 10 mg (SI10), 20 mg (SI20) or 100 mg (SI100) anti-SRIF immunoglobulin/kg body weight (BW). Control immunoglobulin was administered such that all lambs received 100 mg total immunoglobulin protein/kg BW. Effects of chronic SRIF immunoneutralization were examined using C and SI100 lambs which received additional (40 mg/kg BW) control and anti-SRIF immunoglobulin respectively, 4 and 8 days following the initial dose. Blood samples were collected from all lambs, at 10-min intervals, for 5 h immediately following initial immunoglobulin infusion and, from C and SI100 lambs, at 10-min intervals, for 5 h at 11 days following initial immunoglobulin infusion. At the end of each 5-h sampling period, pituitary and thyroid function was examined by i.v. challenge with thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH; 0.33 microgram/kg BW). Basal plasma GH and thyroxine (T4) and the GH, TSH, T4 and tri-iodothyronine (T3) responses to TRH were not influenced by acute or chronic immunoneutralization of SRIF. Acute, but not chronic, immunoneutralization of SRIF elevated basal plasma T3 in SI100 lambs only. The results suggest that SRIF, under physiological conditions, does not influence GH or thyroid hormone secretion in sheep but may influence thyroid hormone metabolism acutely.","Van Kessel, A G; Laarveld, B",The Journal of endocrinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8096234/,91
196943,Similar Lung Function Impairment In Auto Mechanics Operating In Stand-alone Auto Repair and Auto Repair Shops Shared with Spray Painters.,2020-06-30,"The Health Effects Institute and its partners conceived and funded a program to characterize the emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines compliant with the 2007 and 2010 on-road emissions standards in the United States and to evaluate indicators of lung toxicity in rats and mice exposed repeatedly to diesel exhaust (DE*) from 2007-compliant engines. The preliminary hypothesis of this Advanced Collaborative Emissions Study (ACES) was that 2007-compliant on-road diesel emissions "". . . will not cause an increase in tumor formation or substantial toxic effects in rats and mice at the highest concentration of exhaust that can be used . . . although some biological effects may occur."" This hypothesis is being tested at the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute (LRRI) by exposing rats by chronic inhalation as a carcinogenicity bioassay, measuring indicators of pulmonary toxicity in rats after 1, 3, 12, and 24-30 months of exposure (final time point depends on the survival of animals), and measuring similar indicators of pulmonary toxicity in mice after 1 and 3 months of exposure. This report provides results of exposures through 3 months in rats and mice. Emissions from a 2007-compliant, 500-horsepower-class engine and aftertreatment system operated on a variable-duty cycle were used to generate the animal inhalation test atmospheres. Four treatment groups were exposed to one of three concentrations (dilutions) of exhaust combined with crankcase emissions, or to clean air as a negative control. Dilutions of exhaust were set to yield average integrated concentrations of 4.2, 0.8, and 0.1 ppm nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Exposure atmospheres were analyzed by daily measurements of key components and periodic detailed physical-chemical characterizations. Exposures were conducted 16 hr/dy (overnight), 5 dy/wk. Rats were evaluated for hematology, serum chemistry, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung cell proliferation, and histopathology after 1 month of exposure, and the same indicators plus pulmonary function after 3 months. Mice were evaluated for BAL, lung cell proliferation, and respiratory tract histopathology after 1 month of exposure, and the same indicators plus hematology and serum chemistry after 3 months. Samples from both species were collected for ancillary studies performed by investigators who were not at LRRI and were funded separately. Exposures were accomplished as planned, with average integrated exposure concentrations within 20% of the target dilutions. The major components were the gaseous inorganic compounds, nitrogen monoxide (NO), NO2, and carbon monoxide (CO). Minor components included low concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM) and volatile and semivolatile organic compounds (VOCs and SVOCs). There were no exposure-related differences in mortality or clinically evident morbidity. Among the more than 100 biologic response variables evaluated, the majority showed no significant difference from control as a result of exposure to DE. There was evidence of early lung changes in the rats, accompanied by a number of statistically significant increases in inflammatory and oxidative stress indicators, and some evidence of subtle changes in pulmonary function. In general, statistically significant effects were observed only at the highest exposure level. The mice did not have the same responses as the rats, but did have small but statistically significant increases in lavage neutrophils and the cytokine IL-6 at 1 month (but not at 3 months). These findings suggest that the rats were more sensitive than mice to the subchronic exposures.","Mcdonald, Jacob D; Doyle-Eisele, Melanie; Gigliotti, Andrew; Miller, Rodney A; Seilkop, Steve; Mauderly, Joe L; Seagrave, JeanClare; Chow, Judith; Zielinska, Barbara",Research report,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23156840/,91
197167,Diagnosis and management of acute bronchitis.,2002,"Simultaneous testing for detection of infectious pathogens that cause similar symptoms (e.g., acute respiratory infections) is invaluable for patient treatment, outbreak prevention, and efficient use of antibiotic and antiviral agents. In addition, such testing may provide information regarding possible coinfections or induced secondary infections, such as virally induced bacterial infections. Furthermore, in many cases, detection of a pathogen requires more than genus/species-level resolution, since harmful agents (e.g., avian influenza virus) are grouped with other, relatively benign common agents, and for every pathogen, finer resolution is useful to allow tracking of the location and nature of mutations leading to strain variations. In this study, a previously developed resequencing microarray that has been demonstrated to have these capabilities was further developed to provide individual detection sensitivity ranging from 10(1) to 10(3) genomic copies for more than 26 respiratory pathogens while still retaining the ability to detect and differentiate between close genetic neighbors. In addition, the study demonstrated that this system allows unambiguous and reproducible sequence-based strain identification of the mixed pathogens. Successful proof-of-concept experiments using clinical specimens show that this approach is potentially very useful for both diagnostics and epidemic surveillance.","Lin, Baochuan; Blaney, Kate M; Malanoski, Anthony P; Ligler, Adam G; Schnur, Joel M; Metzgar, David; Russell, Kevin L; Stenger, David A",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17135438/,91
197497,[Amendment to the infectious disease control law].,2004,"OBJECTIVE To analyze the 7a7b genes of the feline coronavirus (FCoV) of cheetahs, which are believed to play a role in virulence of this virus. SAMPLE POPULATION Biologic samples collected during a 4-year period from 5 cheetahs at the same institution and at 1 time point from 4 cheetahs at different institutions. PROCEDURES Samples were first screened for FCoV via a reverse transcription-PCR procedure involving primers that encompassed the 3'-untranslated region. Samples that yielded positive assay results were analyzed by use of primers that targeted the 7a7b open reading frames. The nucleotide sequences of the 7a7b amplification products were determined and analyzed. RESULTS In most isolates, substantial deletional mutations in the 7a gene were detected that would result in aberrant or no expression of the 7a product because of altered reading frames. Although the 7b gene was also found to contain mutations, these were primarily point mutations resulting in minor amino acid changes. The coronavirus associated with 1 cheetah with feline infectious peritonitis had intact 7a and 7b genes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The data suggest that mutations arise readily in the 7a region and may remain stable in FCoV of cheetahs. In contrast, an intact 7b gene may be necessary for in vivo virus infection and replication. Persistent infection with FCoV in a cheetah population results in continued virus circulation and may lead to a quasispecies of virus variants.","Kennedy, Melissa A; Moore, Emily; Wilkes, Rebecca P; Citino, Scott B; Kania, Stephen A",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16579755/,91
197863,A new mesh design for plug and patch groin hernia repair: Parietene PP.,2008,"There is increasing interest in diesel fuels derived from plant oils or animal fats (""biodiesel""), but little information on the toxicity of biodiesel emissions other than bacterial mutagenicity. F344 rats were exposed by inhalation 6 h/day, 5 days/wk for 13 wk to 1 of 3 dilutions of emissions from a diesel engine burning 100% soybean oil-derived fuel, or to clean air as controls. Whole emissions were diluted to nominal NO(x) concentrations of 5, 25, or 50 ppm, corresponding to approximately 0.04, 0.2, and 0.5 mg particles/m(3), respectively. Biologically significant, exposure-related effects were limited to the lung, were greater in females than in males, and were observed primarily at the highest exposure level. There was a dose-related increase in the numbers of alveolar macrophages and the numbers of particles in the macrophages, as expected from repeated exposure, but no neutrophil response even at the highest exposure level. The macrophage response was reduced 28 days after cessation of the exposure. Among the high-level females, the group mean lung weight/body weight ratio was increased, and minimal, multifocal bronchiolar metaplasia of alveolar ducts was observed in 4 of 30 rats. Lung weights were not significantly increased, and metaplasia of the alveolar ducts was not observed in males. An increase in particle-laden macrophages was the only exposure-related finding in lungs at the intermediate and low levels, with fewer macrophages and fewer particles per macrophage at the low level. Alveolar histiocytosis was observed in a few rats in both exposed and control groups. There were statistically significant, but minor and not consistently exposure-related, differences in body weight, nonpulmonary organ weights, serum chemistry, and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the brain. There were no significant exposure-related effects on survival, clinical signs, feed consumption, ocular toxicity, hematology, neurohistology, micronuclei in bone marrow, sister chromatid exchanges in peripheral blood lymphocytes, fertility, reproductive toxicity, or teratology.

198267,The Duration of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Can Be Reduced Using the HeartShield Device in Patients With Deep Sternal Wound Infection.,2014,"OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has created many challenges that need immediate attention. Various epidemiological and deep learning models have been developed to predict the COVID-19 outbreak, but all have limitations that affect the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. Our method aims at addressing these limitations and making earlier and more accurate pandemic outbreak predictions by (1) using patients' EHR data from different counties and states that encode local disease status and medical resource utilization condition; (2) considering demographic similarity and geographical proximity between locations; and (3) integrating pandemic transmission dynamics into deep learning models. MATERIALS AND METHODS We proposed a spatio-temporal attention network (STAN) for pandemic prediction. It uses an attention-based graph convolutional network to capture geographical and temporal trends and predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a physical law-based loss term for enhancing long-term prediction. STAN was tested using both massive real-world patient data and open source COVID-19 statistics provided by Johns Hopkins university across all U.S. counties. RESULTS STAN outperforms epidemiological modeling methods such as SIR and SEIR and deep learning models on both long-term and short-term predictions, achieving up to 87% lower mean squared error compared to the best baseline prediction model. CONCLUSIONS By using information from real-world patient data and geographical data, STAN can better capture the disease status and medical resource utilization information and thus provides more accurate pandemic modeling. With pandemic transmission law based regularization, STAN also achieves good long-term prediction performance.","Gao, Junyi; Sharma, Rakshith; Qian, Cheng; Glass, Lucas M; Spaeder, Jeffrey; Romberg, Justin; Sun, Jimeng; Xiao, Cao",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330741/,91

A biopsychosocial-spiritual approach to health management may be beneficial. Primary Study Objective To assess the effect of gentle yoga and mindfulness meditation on spiritual well-being in cancer survivors. Methods/Design This is a mixed methods, quasi-experimental pilot study providing 10 weeks of gentle yoga and mindfulness meditation twice per week to cancer survivors. Setting The intervention was provided at a South Florida university in the summer months. Participants Ten cancer survivors self-selected to participate in the 10-week study; 2 participants did not complete the post-test data collection. Intervention Each class opened and closed with 5 to 6 minutes of nonmoving mindfulness meditation. The mindfulness meditation techniques included body scan, breath awareness, visualization, affirmation, and compassion meditations. The gentle yoga practice was a series of beginner yoga postures and stretches. The mindfulness meditation techniques of breath and body awareness during yoga created what is referred to as a ""moving meditation"" with yoga postures encompassing the movement portion. Primary Outcome Measures The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well-Being 12 Item Scale (FACIT-Sp-12) and 2 open-ended questions. Results The FACIT-Sp-12 pre- and post-test data were analyzed using a paired samples t test. There was a significant improvement in overall spiritual well-being from pretest (μ = 34.25, SD = 7.28) to post-test (μ = 39.50, SD = 7.91); t (7) = -4.02, P = 0.003. Qualitative data: the participants reported improvements in various aspects of spirituality, fitness, emotional well-being, stress management, sleep, and a sense of social connectedness. Conclusion The biopsychosocial-spiritual approach to health care may play a vital role in addressing the well-being of the whole person. Gentle yoga and mindfulness meditation can result in improvement in measures of spiritual well-being among cancer survivors and may be further utilized as an accessible intervention for those who are suffering throughout all segments of society.","Bryan, Stephanie; Zipp, Genevieve; Breitkreuz, Denise",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33128538/,91

A cidofovir-resistant (CDV-R) mutant of the virus was developed by 15 Vero cell culture passages in order to determine cross-resistance to other inhibitors, growth characteristics, virulence in infected mice, and suitability of the animal model for studying antiviral therapies. Comparisons were made to the original WT virus and to a WT virus passaged 15 times in culture (WTp15 virus). Cidofovir inhibited WT, WTp15, and CDV-R viruses by 50% at 61, 56 and 790 microM, respectively, in plaque reduction assays, with similar inhibition seen in virus yield studies. Cross-resistance occurred with compounds related to cidofovir, but not with unrelated nucleosides. The resistant virus produced 300-fold fewer infectious particles (PFU) than WT and WTp15 viruses in mouse C1271 cells, yet replicated similarly in Vero (monkey) cells. The CDV-R virus was completely attenuated for virulence at 10(7) PFU per mouse in normal BALB/c mice and in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. The WTp15 virus was 100-fold less virulent than WT virus in BALB/c mice. Thus, the lack of virulence of the resistant virus in the animal model is explained partly by its reduced ability to replicate in mouse cells and by attenuation occurring as a result of extensive cell culturing (inferred from what occurred with the WTp15 virus). Lung and snout virus titre reduction parameters were used to assess antiviral activity of compounds in BALB/c mice infected intranasally with the CDV-R virus. Cidofovir, HDP-cidofovir and arabinofuranosyladenine treatments reduced lung virus titres or = eight-fold. The animal model appears to have limited utility in drug efficacy testing.","Smee, Donald F; Wandersee, Miles K; Bailey, Kevin W; Hostetler, Karl Y; Holy, Antonin; Sidwell, Robert W",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16004083/,91
198863,Kawasaki disease: four case reports of cardiopathy with an institutional and literature review.,2007,"Previously, we characterized two host protein binding elements located within the 3'-terminal 166 nucleotides of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome and assessed their functions in defective-interfering (DI) RNA replication. To determine the role of RNA secondary structures within these two host protein binding elements in viral replication, we explored the secondary structure of the 3'-terminal 166 nucleotides of the MHV strain JHM genome using limited RNase digestion assays. Our data indicate that multiple stem-loop and hairpin-loop structures exist within this region. Mutant and wild-type DIssEs were employed to test the function of secondary structure elements in DI RNA replication. Three stem structures were chosen as targets for the introduction of transversion mutations designed to destroy base pairing structures. Mutations predicted to destroy the base pairing of nucleotides 142 to 136 with nucleotides 68 to 74 exhibited a deleterious effect on DIssE replication. Destruction of base pairing between positions 96 to 99 and 116 to 113 also decreased DI RNA replication. Mutations interfering with the pairing of nucleotides 67 to 63 with nucleotides 52 to 56 had only minor effects on DIssE replication. The introduction of second complementary mutations which restored the predicted base pairing of positions 142 to 136 with 68 to 74 and nucleotides 96 to 99 with 116 to 113 largely ameliorated defects in replication ability, restoring DI RNA replication to levels comparable to that of wild-type DIssE RNA, suggesting that these secondary structures are important for efficient MHV replication. We also identified a conserved 23-nucleotide stem-loop structure involving nucleotides 142 to 132 and nucleotides 68 to 79. The upstream side of this conserved stem-loop is contained within a host protein binding element (nucleotides 166 to 129).","Liu, Q; Johnson, R F; Leibowitz, J L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11711601/,91

The level of BCV-neutralizing antibodies found in the calves varied among ranches in 2 different studies in a retained-ownership program (ROP), from the ranch to the feedlot. Calves with low levels of BCV-neutralizing antibodies (16 or less) were more likely to be treated for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) than those with higher titers. In 3 studies of commingled, mixed-source calves, BCV was recovered from calves at entry to the feedlot and the infections were cleared by day 8. The BCV was identified in lung samples [bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) collection] as well as in nasal swabs. Calves with low levels of BCV-neutralizing antibodies at entry were most likely to be shedding BCV. Bovine coronavirus was isolated from both healthy and sick calves, but not from sick calves after 4 d arrival at the feedlot. Bovine coronavirus (BCV) should be considered along with other bovine respiratory viruses in the diagnosis of etiologies in bovine respiratory disease, especially for animals that become sick shortly after arrival.

This article is a first look at the amount of conversation taking place on social media, specifically Twitter, with respect to COVID-19, the themes of discussion, where the discussion is emerging from, myths shared about the virus, and how much of it is connected to other high and low quality information on the Internet through shared URL links. Our preliminary findings suggest that a meaningful spatio-temporal relationship exists between information flow and new cases of COVID-19, and while discussions about myths and links to poor quality information exist, their presence is less dominant than other crisis specific themes. This research is a first step toward understanding social media conversation about COVID-19.","Singh, Lisa; Bansal, Shweta; Bode, Leticia; Budak, Ceren; Chi, Guangqing; Kawintiranon, Kornraphop; Padden, Colton; Vanarsdall, Rebecca; Vraga, Emily; Wang, Yanchen",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32550244/,91

One such option is vitamin D, in the form of vitamin D3(cholecalciferol) supplementation, due to its potential antiviral properties. It has become apparent that older individuals have a greater risk of developing severe COVID-19, and compared to younger adults, the elderly have lower levels of vitamin D due to a variety of biological and behavioral factors. Older adults are also more likely to be diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD), with advanced age being the single greatest risk factor. In addition to its immune-system-modulating effects, it has been suggested that vitamin D supplementation plays a role in slowing PD progression and improving PD-related quality of life. We completed a review of the literature to determine the relationship between vitamin D, PD, and COVID-19. We concluded that the daily supplementation of 2000-5000 IU/day of vitamin D3in older adults with PD has the potential to slow the progression of PD while also potentially offering additional protection against COVID-19.","Hribar, Casey A.; Cobbold, Peter H.; Church, Frank C.",Brain Sci.,,91

In this paper, we investigated the characteristics of the trend of daily count of COVID-19 deaths in Ghana using zero-inflated models. We envisaged that the trend of COVID-19 deaths per day in Ghana portrays a general increase from the onset of the pandemic in the country to about day 160 after which there is a general decrease onward. We fitted a zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model and zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model to the data in the partial-likelihood framework. The zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model outperformed the zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model. On the other hand, the dynamic zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model performed better than the dynamic negative binomial autoregressive model. The predicted new death based on the zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model indicated that Ghana's COVID-19 death per day will rise sharply few days after 30th November 2020 and drastically fall just as in the observed data.","Tawiah, Kassim; Iddrisu, Wahab Abdul; Asampana Asosega, Killian",J Environ Public Health,,91

205725,Artificial Intelligence and Precision Medicine: A Perspective,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures employed by the government have forced neurologists across the world to look upon telemedicine as the only feasible and practical option to continue providing health care towards children with epilepsy in home isolation. Children with epilepsy are challenging for teleconsultation as direct information from the patient is missing, regarding seizures and adverse effects, especially behavioral and psychological side effects. METHODS: Clinical and epilepsy-related details of telephonic consultations for children 1 month-18 years, performed between 26th March and 17th May 2020 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Uttarakhand (a state of India known for hilly terrains with low per capita income) were recorded. Suitable changes in the dose/commercial brand of antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen were performed, along with the addition of new AED and referral to local practitioners for immediate hospitalization, when urgent health care issues were detected. Voice call, text message, picture/video message, and all other possible measures were employed to accumulate maximum clinical information in real-time. RESULTS: A total of 153 children(95 males [62 %], 9.45â¯±â¯3.24 years, 140 lower/middle socioeconomic status) were enrolled after screening 237 children with various neurological disorders, whose caregivers contacted for teleconsultation. A total of 278 telephone consultations performed for these 153 children (1-5 telephone calls per patient). Hundred-thirteen children were identified to have a total of 152 significant clinical events (breakthrough seizure/uncontrolled epilepsy (108), AED related (13), and unrelated systemic adverse effects (24), worsening of associated co-morbidities (7). In rest of the patients, the query of the caregiver included unavailability of AED/prescribed commercial brand in the locality, query related to the dose of drugs, proxy for a scheduled routine visit (no active issues), and concern regarding COVID-19 related symptoms and effect of COVID-19 and lockdown in children with epilepsy. Ninety-three (60 %) patients required hiking up of AED dose, whereas 29 (17 %) patients required the addition of a new AED/commercial brand. Five children were advised immediate admission to a nearby hospital. Overall, 147 (96 %) caregivers were satisfied with the quality of medical advice. CONCLUSION: Teleconsultation is one of the few feasible options with good effectiveness for providing medical advice to children with epilepsy during pandemic times.","Panda, Prateek Kumar; Dawman, Lesa; Panda, Pragnya; Sharawat, Indar Kumar",Seizure,,91

206823,Role of Changes in State of Bound Water and Tissue Stiffness in Development of Age-Related Diseases,2020,"BACKGROUND: The benefits of school reopening must be weighed against the morbidity and mortality risks and the impact of enhancing spread of COVID-19. We investigated the effects of school reopening and easing of social distancing restrictions on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Israel, between March-July 2020. METHODS: We examined the nationwide agewise weekly incidence, prevalence, SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, their positivity, COVID-19 hospitalizations and associated mortality. Temporal differences in these parameters following school reopening, school ending, and following easing of restrictions such as permission of large scale gatherings, were examined. RESULTS: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections gradually increased following school reopening in all age groups, with a significantly higher increase in adults compared to children. Higher relative ratios (RRs) of sample positivity rates 21-27 days following school reopening relative to positivity rates prior to openings were found for the age groups 40-59 (RR: 4.72, 95% CI: 3.26 - 6.83) and 20-39 years (RR: 3.37 [2.51 - 4.53]), but not for children aged 0-9 (RR: 1.46 [0.85 - 2.51]) and 10-19 years (RR: 0.93 [0.65 - 1.34]).No increase was observed in COVID-19 associated hospitalizations and deaths following school reopening. In contrast, permission of large-scale gatherings was accompanied by increases in incidence and positivity rates of samples for all age groups, and increased hospitalizations and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis does not support a major role of school reopening in the resurgence of the COVID-19 curve in Israel. Easing restrictions on large scale gatherings was the major influence on this resurgence.","Somekh, Ido; Shohat, Tamy; Boker, Lital Keinan; Simões, Eric A F; Somekh, Eli",Clin. infect. dis,,91
206857,Human Endogenous Retrovirus K in Cancer: A Potential Biomarker and Immunotherapeutic Target,2020,"Importance: Curbing COVID-19 transmission is currently the greatest global public health challenge. Consumer digital tools used to collect data, such as the Apple-Google digital contact tracing program, offer opportunities to reduce COVID-19 transmission but introduce privacy concerns. Objective: To assess uses of consumer digital information for COVID-19 control that US adults find acceptable and the factors associated with higher or lower approval of use of this information. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional survey study obtained data from a nationally representative sample of 6284 US adults recruited by email from the web-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel in July 2020. Respondents evaluated scenarios reflecting uses of digital data for COVID-19 control (case identification, digital contact tracing, policy setting, and enforcement of quarantines). Main Outcomes and Measures: Levels of support for use of personal digital data in 9 scenarios to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 infection, rated on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Multivariable linear regression models were fitted for each scenario and included factors hypothesized to be associated with views about digital data use for COVID-19 mitigation measures. Black and Hispanic survey respondents were oversampled; thus, poststratification weights were used so that results are representative of the general US population. Results: Of 6284 individuals invited to participate in the study, 3547 responded, for a completion rate of 56%. A total of 1762 participants (52%) were female, 715 (21%) identified as Black, 790 (23%) identified as Hispanic, and 1224 (36%) were 60 years or older; mean (SD) age was 51.7 (16.6) years. Approval of scenarios was low, ranging from 28% to 43% (52%-67% when neutral responses were included). Differences were found based on digital data source (smartphone vs social media: coefficient, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.23-0.35]; P < .001; smart thermometer vs social media: coefficient, 0.09 [95% CI, 0.03-0.16]; P = .004). County COVID-19 rates (coefficient, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.16 to 0.13 for quartile 4 compared with quartile 1) and prior family diagnosis of COVID-19 (coefficient, 0.00; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.25) were not associated with support. Compared with self-described liberal individuals, conservative (coefficient, -0.81; 95% CI, -0.96 to -0.66; P < .001) and moderate (coefficient, -0.52; 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.38; P < .001) individuals were less likely to support the scenarios. Similarly, large political differences were observed in support of the Apple-Google digital contact tracing program, with less support from conservative (coefficient, -0.99; 95% CI, -1.11 to -0.87; P < .001) and moderate (coefficient, -0.59; 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.48; P < .001) individuals compared with liberal individuals. Respondents from racial/ethnic minority groups were more supportive of the scenarios than were White, non-Hispanic respondents. For example, compared with White respondents, Black respondents were more supportive of the Apple-Google contact tracing program (coefficient, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.32; P = .002). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, many were averse to their information being used on digital platforms to mitigate transmission of COVID-19. These findings suggest that in current and future pandemics, public health departments should use multiple strategies to gain public trust and accelerate adoption of tools such as digital contact tracing applications.","Grande, David; Mitra, Nandita; Marti, Xochitl Luna; Merchant, Raina; Asch, David; Dolan, Abby; Sharma, Meghana; Cannuscio, Carolyn",JAMA Netw Open,,91

In this article, we have fished and compiled the needed information on the drug, that will help readers and prospective investigators in having a quick overview. Though the primordial biological action of the drug is allosteric modulation of helminthic ion channel receptor, its in vitro activity against both RNA and DNA viruses is known for almost a decade. In the past two years, efficacy study in animal models of pseudorabies and zika virus was found to be favourable and unfavourable respectively. Only one clinical study evaluated the drug in dengue virus infection without any clinical efficacy. However, the proposed mechanism of drug action, by inhibiting the importin family of nucleus-cytoplasmic transporters along with favourable pharmacokinetics, warrants exploration of its role in COVID 19 through safely conducted clinical trials. Being an available and affordable drug, enlisted in WHO List of Essential Medicine, and a long track record of clinical safety, the drug is already in clinical trials the world over.

However, ACE-2 plays a common role in the pathogenesis of adipocyte hypertrophy and COVID 19. AREAS COVERED: In this 'Perspective,' the author would like to emphasize the use of adipose tissue-derived stromal cells in COVID 19 and the issues that clinicians should pay attention to in fat graft applications in terms of adipose tissue-RAS relationship. The new normal for adipose tissue in COVID 19 will be highlighted. EXPERT OPINION: ADSCs may potentially be used in COVID-19. However, it has been speculated that ACE2 receptors are responsible for the pathogenesis of adipose tissue overgrowth and may be a potential danger in terms of the relationship between ACE2 receptors and COVID19. We speculate that reducing the size of overgrown fat tissue by ultra-sharp blades and using near-normal adipocytes will create a 'new normal.'","Copcu, H Eray",Expert Opin Biol Ther,,91

Exploring the structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, we argue that the high mutability characteristic of RNA viruses coupled with the remarkable flexibility and dynamics of viral proteins result in a substantial involvement of allosteric mechanisms. While allosteric effects of mutations should be considered in predictions and diagnostics of new VOCs, allosteric drugs advantageously avoid escaping mutations via non-competitive inhibition originating from many alternative distal locations. The exhaustive allosteric signalling and probing maps provide a comprehensive picture of allostery in the Spike protein, making it possible to locate sites of potential mutations that could work as new VOCs ""drivers"", and to determine binding patches that may be targeted by newly developed allosteric drugs.","Tan, Zhen Wah; Tee, Wei-Ven; Samsudin, Firdaus; Guarnera, Enrico; Bond, Peter J; Berezovsky, Igor N.",,,91

With no vaccine in sight, the spread of the virus is likely to continue unabated. This article aims to analyze the time series data for top five countries affected by the COVID-19 for forecasting the spread of the epidemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Daily time series data from 15th February to June 30, 2020 of total infected cases from the top five countries namely US, Brazil, India, Russia and Spain were collected from the online database. ARIMA model specifications were estimated using Hannan and Rissanen algorithm. Out of sample forecast for the next 77 days was computed using the ARIMA models. RESULTS: Forecast for the first 18 days of July was compared with the actual data and the forecast accuracy was using MAD and MAPE were found within acceptable agreement. The graphic plots of forecast data suggest that While Russia and Spain have reached the inflexion point in the spread of epidemic, the US, Brazil and India are still experiencing an exponential curve. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that India and Brazil will hit 1.38 million and 2.47 million mark while the US will reach the 4.29 million mark by 31st July. With no effective cure available at the moment, this forecast will help the governments to be better prepared to combat the epidemic by ramping up their healthcare facilities.","Sahai, Alok Kumar; Rath, Namita; Sood, Vishal; Singh, Manvendra Pratap",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,91

METHODS: An electronic survey including both closed and open-ended questions was distributed to physical therapists employed in a range of health care settings across the United States. RESULTS: Physical therapy utilization and process of care varied across settings. Feasibility of performing an assessment was the main driver for selection of outcome measures. Interventions were mainly geared toward improving respiratory function and deconditioning. Prone patient positioning, now commonplace, was used infrequently by therapists in acute care prior to COVID-19. Similarly, outpatient and home care settings noted an increase in the use of respiratory driven interventions such as incentive spirometry and breathing exercises. Qualitative data analysis revealed both physical barriers (personal protective equipment [PPE]) and social barriers to care. Therapists noted challenges in discharge planning and patient/family education due to the impact of social isolation. They also noted difficulty maintaining productivity standards due to additional time spent in changing PPE and following safety measures. Participants dealt with rapid changes in their role, changing productivity standards, and needing to increase their knowledge in a short amount of time. CONCLUSION: Physical therapy utilization varied widely across settings. Despite some concern for personal health, respondents felt that the COVID-19 pandemic increased a sense of togetherness among team members and promoted greater appreciation for life and work. IMPACT: This exploration of the process of care and current clinical practices across settings provides important knowledge about the role of physical therapists and physical therapist assistants in the care of patients with COVID-19. Gaining an understanding of the psychosocial impact of the pandemic among therapists could assist in creating solutions to better support clinicians' well-being.","Tiwari, Devashish; Naidoo, Keshrie; Chatiwala, Naseem; Bartlo, Pamela L; Triola, Allison; Ong, Brandon; Gore, Shweta",Phys. ther,,91

220260,The effect of the definition of 'pandemic' on quantitative assessments of infectious disease outbreak risk,2021,"At the start of March, 2020, during the Coronavirus pandemic, the Italian Psychoanalytical Society (SPI) volunteers organized an emergency helpline. This consisted of a limited series of consultations by telephone or online, with four free sessions which would not lead to a course of psychotherapy. All the operators carrying out this work gathered regularly in peer-supervision groups where they compared their work and fulfilled a holding function for each other. The reasons for the requests varied from the reappearance of a previous psychiatric situation, to the sense of loneliness, anxiety, panic, feeling of persecution, somatizations, and hypochondriacal experiences, and on another level the dysregulation of the familial environment, marital difficulties, and parenting problems. Because of the intensity of the trauma, alongside the commonest defenses, other defenses have been activated, such as externalization, exporting, and shifting into the other of a psychic suffering that cannot be worked through. Emotional withdrawal, the avoidance of contact in the state of heightened alertness are other characteristics of these situations. The suffering that derives from these traumas will then be at the center of a crucible formed by the intrapsychic, the interpersonal, and the transpersonal. Today psychoanalysis is encountering enormous cultural and social changes, and this recent experiment of ours has shown us the importance of working to give a response in moments of crisis since needs that are not worked through today risk being transformed into serious psychopathological problems tomorrow.

A hospital in Zhuhai adopted several measures in Fever Clinic Management (FCM) to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. FCM has been proved to be effective in preventing nosocomial cross infection. Faced with the emergency, the hospital undertook creative operational steps in relation to the control and spread of COVID-19, with special focuses on physical and administrative layout of buildings, staff training and preventative procedures. The first operational step was to set up triaging stations at all entrances and then complete a standard and qualified fever clinic, which was isolated from the other buildings within our hospital complex. Secondly, the hospital established its human resource reservation for emergency response and the allocation of human resources to ensure strict and standardised training methods through the hospital for all medical staff and ancillary employees. Thirdly, the hospital divided the fever clinic into partitioned areas and adapted a three-level triaging system. The experiences shared in this paper would be of practical help for the facilities that are encountering or will encounter the challenges of COVID-19, i.e. to prevent nosocomial cross infection among patients and physicians.","Jiang, H; Liu, J W; Ren, N; He, R; Li, M Q; Dong, Q C",Epidemiol Infect,,91
227745,Fly ash supported Pd-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles exhibiting a synergistic catalytic effect for the reduction of nitrophenol,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic. It causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (COVID-19), which is fatal in many cases, and is characterized by a cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Great efforts are currently being made to block the signal transduction pathway of pro-inflammatory cytokines in order to control this ""cytokine storm"" and rescue severely affected patients. Consequently, possible treatments for cytokine-mediated hyperinflammation, preferably within approved safe therapies, are urgently being researched to reduce rising mortality. One approach to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine release is to activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (&#945;7nAchR). Nicotine, an exogenous &#945;7nAchR agonist, is clinically used in ulcerative colitis to counteract inflammation. We have found epidemiological evidence, based on recent clinical SARS-CoV-2 studies in China, that suggest that smokers are statistically less likely to be hospitalized. In conclusion, our hypothesis proposes that nicotine could constitute a novel potential CRS therapy in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients.","Gonzalez-Rubio, Jesus; Navarro-Lopez, Carmen; Lopez-Najera, Elena; Lopez-Najera, Ana; Jimenez-Diaz, Lydia; Navarro-Lopez, Juan D; Najera, Alberto",Front Immunol,,91
227760,Recent Patents and Advances on Nanotechnologies against Coronavirus,2020,"COVID-19 infection originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and crippled human health globally in no time. The public health emergency required urgent efforts to develop and test the efficacy and safety of vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergency use approval has been granted to COVID-19 vaccines before the completion of conventional phases of clinical trials. However, there is no comprehensive review of safety data reported from the vaccine trials, which is critical information to inform the policies in order to improve uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and mitigate the risk aversion perceived due to the COVID-vaccine side effects. This study aims to systematically review and synthesize the evidence on the safety data from the published COVID-19 vaccine trials. This study followed PRISMA guidelines. We searched three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar) for published studies between Dec 2019 and 2020. Eligible study designs were randomized trials and pre-and post-intervention evaluations. Descriptive findings of included studies were reported stratified by target population, setting, outcomes, and overall results. From PubMed, Embase, WHO database, and Google Scholar screened titles and abstracts, 11 studies were identified in this review. Most of the reactions reported were mild to moderate whereas a few with severe intensity. All reactions resolved within 3-4 days. The commonly reported local adverse events were pain at the site of injection, swelling, and redness. The systemic reactions included fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. Some trials also reported laboratory derangements like decreased hemoglobin, increased bilirubin, altered SGOT and SGPT. None of these alterations were clinically manifested and were self-limiting. Few clinical trials reported serious adverse events, but they were unrelated to vaccination. This systematic review indicates that COVID-19 vaccines can be safe with no serious adverse events. However, long-term post-marketing surveillance data, particularly in high-risk vulnerable populations (elderly and those with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children) is warranted to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.","Kaur, Rimple Jeet; Dutta, Siddhartha; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Charan, Jaykaran; Dhingra, Sameer; Mitra, Prasenjit; Singh, Kavita; Yadav, Dharmveer; Sharma, Praveen; Misra, Sanjeev",Indian J Clin Biochem,,91

The current COVID-19 pandemic makes no exception, and temperature has been suggested to play a role on the viability and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate viral fusion. Studying the effect of temperature on the receptor-Spike interaction, we observed a significant and stepwise increase in RBD-ACE2 affinity at low temperatures, resulting in slower dissociation kinetics. This translated into enhanced interaction of the full Spike to ACE2 receptor and higher viral attachment at low temperatures. Interestingly, the RBD N501Y mutation, present in emerging variants of concern (VOCs) that are fueling the pandemic worldwide, bypassed this requirement. This data suggests that the acquisition of N501Y reflects an adaptation to warmer climates, a hypothesis that remains to be tested.","Prevost, Jeremie; Richard, Jonathan; Gasser, Romain; Ding, Shilei; Fage, Clement; Anand, Sai Priya; Adam, Damien; Vergara, Natasha Gupta; Tauzin, Alexandra; Benlarbi, Mehdi; Gong, Shang Yu; Goyette, Guillaume; Prive, Anik; Moreira, Sandrine; Charest, Hugues; Roger, Michel; Mothes, Walther; Pazgier, Marzena; Brochiero, Emanuelle; Boivin, Guy; Abrams, Cameron F; Schon, Arne; Finzi, Andres",,,91

234507,Editorial: Growth and development in a time of coronavirus,2021,"Twelve months after the realization that SARS-CoV-2 caused a respiratory syndrome in Wuhan, China, with the constantly worsening COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis globally, and with international news of vaccine development, a new viral variant, referred to as ""SARS-CoV-2 VUI-202012/01"" or ""B.1.1.7"" has been reported in London and southeast England. The variant may have emerged in late September 2020 and carries some 17 mutations. Whether a single or a combination of different mutations would change the viral transmissibility, virulence, clinical and epidemiological presentations, or vaccine efficiency is unknown. Transmission by asymptomatic carriers of the new variant is also unknown. Mutation pressure by antiviral agents or vaccines have not yet been induced; however, additional mutations are expected following global vaccination and, later, after administration of validated treatments. Thus, preparedness for fast emergence of new variants is prudent. One can also expect less virulent but highly transmissible variants, which could facilitate herd immunity. Development of clinical and rapid laboratory tests is required to follow up the vaccinated individuals for a secondary infection potentially by the new variant. Importantly, restrictive countermeasures, personal hygiene, face-masking, spatial distancing, and travel bans remain pertinent in fighting the virus.","Rahimi, Farid; Talebi Bezmin Abadi, Amin",Arch. med. res,,91

234587,A war of attrition against antibiotic resistance: Current strategies try to keep antibiotic resistance at bay and further encourage research to produce genuinely novel antibacterials,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated an enforced 8-week induction period (18 May to 12 July 2020) for all new interns in Ireland. These unprecedented circumstances presented a unique opportunity to assess this induction period. AIM: To assess the impact of a prolonged induction period on the technical abilities of interns embarking on their clinical careers. METHOD: We distributed a 12-item questionnaire to new interns at our institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 1 of the questionnaire was designed to assess the rate of self-reported improvement in the successful and independent execution of practical 'intern' tasks. Section 2 of the questionnaire captured the subjective experience of interns during this time in relation to the effectiveness of an 8-week induction period with senior intern support available. Statistical analysis of categorical predictor and ordinal outcome variables was performed using the two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the proficiency at first attempt phlebotomy in week 8 compared with week 1 (p < 0.0001). There was a significant improvement in placing first-attempt peripheral IV lines in week 8 compared with week 1 (p < 0.001). Regarding the need for senior assistance, we demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in week 8 compared with week 1 (p = 0.046). There were 95.56% (n = 43) of interns that said they would recommend the induction period for future incoming interns. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has inadvertently identified a model of internship induction that benefits interns, their colleagues and their patients through the production of more technically capable interns.","Foley, Alexandra; Donaghy, Feargal; Sheridan, Gerard A; Stanley, Ciarán; Byrne, Ann-Maria; Hill, Arnold D K; Mullett, Hannan",Ir. j. med. sci,,91

In this study, we aimed to assess the validity, reliability, and survival outcomes of simple chest computed tomography (CT) score in the evaluation of the severity of lung involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared with the current chest CT score. Results: This retrospective analysis included 213 patients (121 men and 92 women;mean age, 46 ± 15.6 years;range, 1–85 years). The ROC curve was used to compare the validity of both scores. Interreader agreement (IRA) for both scores was calculated using Cohen’s kappa statistic. The survival analysis of both scores was investigated using the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. The simple score showed a comparable validity with the current score (AUC = 0.89 and 0.90, respectively;p = 0.61). The ROC analysis demonstrated that a simple score of &gt; 3 and a current score of &gt; 12 were potential predictors of death with sensitivity values of 81.8% and 86.4% and specificity values of 96.3% and 93.7%, respectively. The simple score showed a higher IRA compared with the current score (κ = 0.645 and 0.458, respectively). Both scores were comparable for predicting survival outcomes. Conclusion: The simple score was non-inferior for predicting survival outcome, compared with the current chest CT score. Furthermore, we suggest that the simple score should be used as it is simpler and more consistent.","Abdel-Tawab, M.; Basha, M. A. A.; Mohamed, I. A. I.; Ibrahim, H.

The link between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 appears to be twofold. First, some reports of data indicate that certain groups of patients are more at risk of COVID-19. This includes patients with cardiovascular risk factors or pre-existing cardiovascular conditions and older patients. In addition, these patients incur disproportionately worse outcome. Second, SARS-CoV2 infection can be complicated by life-threatening cardiovascular acute diseases. Despite the rapid evolution of data on this pandemic, this review aims to highlight the cardiovascular considerations related to COVID-19 whether as comorbidities including concerns and uncertainty regarding the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors on angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 or related to acute cardiovascular complications.","Boureau, Anne-Sophie; de Decker, Laure; Berrut, Gilles; Hanon, Olivier",Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil,,91
242326,Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology and Infectious Disease Research,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is very contagious and has rapidly spread globally. Due to various symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and the possibility of asymptomatic transmission, there is a pressing need for a fast and sensitive detection protocol to diagnose asymptomatic people. Various SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits are already available from many companies and national health agencies. However, publicly available information on these diagnostic kits is lacking. In response to the growing need and the lack of information, we developed and made available a low-cost, easy-access, real-time PCR-based protocol for the early detection of the virus in a previous study. During the development of the detection protocol, we found that unoptimized primer sets could inadvertently show false-positive results, raising the possibility that commercially available diagnostic kits might also contain primer sets that produce false-positive results. Here, we provide three-step guidelines for the design and optimization of specific primer sets. The three steps include (1) the selection of primer sets for target genes (RdRP, N, E, and S) in the genome of interest (SARS-CoV-2), (2) the in silico validation of primer and amplicon sequences, and (3) the optimization of PCR conditions (i.e., primer concentrations and annealing temperatures) for specific hybridization between the primers and target genes, and the elimination of spurious primer dimers. Furthermore, we have expanded the previously developed real-time PCR-based protocol to more conventional PCR-based protocols and applied a multiplex PCR-based protocol that allows the simultaneous testing of primer sets for RdRP, N, E, and S all in one reaction. Our newly optimized protocol should be helpful for the large-scale, high-fidelity screening of asymptomatic people, even without any high-specification equipment, for the further prevention of transmission, and to achieve early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.","Park, Myungsun; Won, Joungha; Choi, Byung Yoon; Lee, C Justin",Exp Mol Med,,91

However, according to several reports, RT-PCR showed a low sensitivity and multiple tests may be required to rule out false negative results. Recently, chest computed tomography (CT) has been an efficient tool to diagnose COVID-19 as it is directly affecting the lungs. In this paper, we investigate the application of pre-trained models in diagnosing patients who are positive for COVID-19 and differentiating it from normal patients, who tested negative for coronavirus. The study aims to compare the generalization capabilities of deep learning models with two thoracic radiologists in diagnosing COVID-19 chest CT images. A dataset of 3000 images was obtained from the Near East Hospital, Cyprus, and used to train and to test the three employed pre-trained models. In a test set of 250 images used to evaluate the deep neural networks and the radiologists, it was found that deep networks (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-201) can outperform the radiologists in terms of higher accuracy (97.8%), sensitivity (98.1%), specificity (97.3%), precision (98.4%), and F1-score (198.25%), in classifying COVID-19 images.","Helwan, Abdulkader; Ma039,; aitah, Mohammad Khaleel Sallam; Hamdan, Hani; Ozsahin, Dilber Uzun; Tuncyurek, Ozum",Comput Math Methods Med,,91

While public sector responses to these crises have faced much justified criticism, the commercial determinants of these crises have not been sufficiently examined. In this commentary we examine the nature of the contributions of such actors to the conditions that underpin these crises in the United States through their market and nonmarket activities. On the basis of this analysis, we make recommendations on the role of governance and civil society in relation to such commercial actors in a post-COVID-19 world.","Maani, Nason; VAN Schalkwyk, May Ci; Petticrew, Mark; Galea, Sandro",Milbank Q,,91

250789,Author Response,2020,"Herd immunity is the most critical and essential prophylactic intervention that delivers protection against infectious diseases at both the individual and community level. This process of natural vaccination is immensely pertinent to the current context of a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection around the globe. The conventional idea of herd immunity is based on efficient transmission of pathogens and developing natural immunity within a population. This is entirely encouraging while fighting against any disease in pandemic circumstances. A spatial community is occupied by people having variable resistance capacity against a pathogen. Protection efficacy against once very common diseases like smallpox, poliovirus or measles has been possible only because of either natural vaccination through contagious infections or expanded immunization programs among communities. This has led to achieving herd immunity in some cohorts. The microbiome plays an essential role in developing the body's immune cells for the emerging competent vaccination process, ensuring herd immunity. Frequency of interaction among microbiota, metabolic nutrients and individual immunity preserve the degree of vaccine effectiveness against several pathogens. Microbiome symbiosis regulates pathogen transmissibility and the success of vaccination among different age groups. Imbalance of nutrients perturbs microbiota and abrogates immunity. Thus, a particular population can become vulnerable to the infection. Intestinal dysbiosis leads to environmental enteropathy (EE). As a consequence, the generation of herd immunity can either be delayed or not start in a particular cohort. Moreover, disparities of the protective response of many vaccines in developing countries outside of developed countries are due to inconsistencies of healthy microbiota among the individuals. We suggested that pan-India poliovirus vaccination program, capable of inducing herd immunity among communities for the last 30 years, may also influence the inception of natural course of heterologous immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, this anamnestic recall is somewhat counterintuitive, as antibody generation against original antigens of SARS-CoV-2 will be subdued due to original antigenic sin.","Shelly, Asha; Gupta, Priya; Ahuja, Rahul; Srichandan, Sudeepa; Meena, Jairam; Majumdar, Tanmay",Viruses,,91

African countries now face difficult choices regarding easing of lockdowns and sustaining effective public health control measures and surveillance. Control of the COVID-19 pandemic will require efficient community screening, testing, contact tracing, and behavioral change interventions, adequate resources, and a well-supported, community-based team of trained, protected personnel. We discuss COVID-19 screening-testing-contact tracing approaches used in selected African countries and the need for shared, affordable, innovative methods to overcome challenges and minimize mortality rates. This crisis presents a unique opportunity to align COVID-19 services with those already in place for HIV, TB, Malaria, and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through mobilization of Africa's inter-professional healthcare workforce to contain the pandemic.

252474,Long-term evolution of the epithelial cell secretome in preclinical 3D models of the human bronchial epithelium,2021,"Various infectious diseases, including COVID-19, MERS, and tuberculosis, are global public health issues. Tuberculosis, which is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), is highly contagious and can be transmitted through inhalation of the bacteria. However, it has been assumed that the infectiousness of bacteria and viruses in dead bodies weakens as the time from death increases. In particular, there is little awareness of infection control measures concerning decomposed bodies or even the need for such measures. The deceased, in whom we discovered MTB 3 months following her death, was a woman in her 80s who died at home. We performed judicial autopsy, because police suspected homicide when her husband hanged himself. Obtained organs were used for microscopic examination by hematoxylin-eosin staining and Ziehl-Neelsen staining. In addition, real-time PCR and mycobacterial culture testing using Ogawa's medium were performed for the detection of MTB. We found that the MTB in the decomposed body remained viable and potentially infectious. To identify the bacterial strain further, we performed DNA-DNA hybridization and identified the strain as MTB complex. Potentially infectious live MTB survived in the dead body far longer than had been previously reported. Pathologists should consider microbial culture tests for all autopsied cases in which the decedent's medical history or macro-examination suggests possible infection, even when a long duration of time has passed since death. Pathologists and specialists who perform autopsies should recognize that all dead bodies are potentially infectious, including those in which long periods have elapsed since death.","Unuma, Kana; Watanabe, Ryo; Hirayama, Naho; Uemura, Koichi",J. forensic sci,,91

We investigated the association of ARB or ACEI use with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related outcomes in US Veterans with treated hypertension using an active comparator design, appropriate covariate adjustment, and negative control analyses. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this retrospective cohort study of Veterans with treated hypertension in the Veterans Health Administration (01/19/2020-08/28/2020), we compared users of (A) ARB/ACEI vs. non-ARB/ACEI (excluding Veterans with compelling indications to reduce confounding by indication) and (B) ARB vs. ACEI among (1) SARS-CoV-2+ outpatients and (2) COVID-19 hospitalized inpatients. The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalization or mortality (outpatients) and all-cause mortality (inpatients). We estimated hazard ratios (HR) using propensity score-weighted Cox regression. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between exposure groups after weighting. Among outpatients, there were 5.0 and 6.0 primary outcomes per 100 person-months for ARB/ACEI (n = 2,482) vs. non-ARB/ACEI (n = 2,487) users (HR 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-0.99, median follow-up 87 days). Among outpatients who were ARB (n = 4,877) vs. ACEI (n = 8,704) users, there were 13.2 and 14.8 primary outcomes per 100 person-months (HR 0.91, 95%CI 0.86-0.97, median follow-up 85 days). Among inpatients who were ARB/ACEI (n = 210) vs. non-ARB/ACEI (n = 275) users, there were 3.4 and 2.0 all-cause deaths per 100 person months (HR 1.25, 95%CI 0.30-5.13, median follow-up 30 days). Among inpatients, ARB (n = 1,164) and ACEI (n = 2,014) users had 21.0 vs. 17.7 all-cause deaths, per 100 person-months (HR 1.13, 95%CI 0.93-1.38, median follow-up 30 days). CONCLUSIONS: This observational analysis supports continued ARB or ACEI use for patients already using these medications before SARS-CoV-2 infection. The novel beneficial association observed among outpatients between users of ARBs vs. ACEIs on hospitalization or mortality should be confirmed with randomized trials.","Derington, Catherine G; Cohen, Jordana B; Mohanty, April F; Greene, Tom H; Cook, James; Ying, Jian; Wei, Guo; Herrick, Jennifer S; Stevens, Vanessa W; Jones, Barbara E; Wang, Libo; Zheutlin, Alexander R; South, Andrew M; Hanff, Thomas C; Smith, Steven M; Cooper-DeHoff, Rhonda M; King, Jordan B; Alexander, G Caleb; Berlowitz, Dan R; Ahmad, Faraz S; Penrod, M Jason; Hess, Rachel; Conroy, Molly B; Fang, James C; Rubin, Michael A; Beddhu, Srinivasan; Cheung, Alfred K; Xian, Weiming; Weintraub, William S; Bress, Adam P",PLoS One,,91

255610,Persistent Patterns of Behavior: Two Infectious Disease Outbreaks 350 Years Apart,2020,"Social distance regulations have been widely implemented to control the global COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals have thus been experiencing social pain through social distance regulations. Prior research has shown that social and physical pains share a common neural alarm system. Hence, COVID-19 social distancing should enhance sensitivity to physical pain. Two laboratory studies were conducted to test the spillover effect of COVID-19 social distancing on physical pain. The findings supported our hypothesis by showing that participants who were reminded of COVID-19 social distancing reported a higher level of pain perception in response to immersion in hot water (Experiment 1, N = 102) and expressed a lower pain threshold measured by a pressure algometer than did those of controls (Experiment 2, N = 140). This may be the first experimental evidence demonstrating that people primed with COVID-19 social distancing have increased sensitivity to physical pain. Our findings suggest that people might be more likely to experience physical pain under the impact of COVID-19 social distancing. The association between a heightened sense of social disconnection in a global pandemic and increased sensitivity to physical pain should receive more attention.","Lee, Chun-Chia Wu Hui-Ju Chiou Wen-Bin",British Journal of Social Psychology,,91

However, it is unknown whether lipid levels have improved and there are potential sequlae in recovered patients. OBJECTIVE: In this follow-up study, we evaluated serum lipidemia and various physiopathological laboratory values in recovered patients. METHODS: A 3-6 month follow-up study was performed between June 15 and September 3, 2020, to examine serum levels of laboratory values in 107 discharged COVID-19 patients (mild = 59; severe/critical = 48; diagnoses on admission). Sixty-one patients had a revisit chest CT scan. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze changes in laboratory values at admission and follow-up. RESULTS: LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). LDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in mild cases (p < 0.05). Coagulation and liver functional values were significantly improved at follow-up than at admission for patients (p < 0.05). Increases in HDL-c significantly correlated with increases in numbers of white blood cells (p < 0.001) during patients' recovery. With exclusion of the subjects taking traditional Chinese medicines or cholesterol-lowering drugs, LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly increased at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). Residue lesions were observed in CT images in 72% (44 of 61) of follow-up patients. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements of LDL-c, HDL-c, liver functions, and incomplete resolution of lung lesions were observed at 3-6 month follow-up for recovered patients, indicating that a long-term recovery process could be required and the development of sequelae such as pulmonary fibrosis could be expected in some patients.","Li, Guiling; Du, Li; Cao, Xiaoling; Wei, Xiuqi; Jiang, Yao; Lin, Yuqi; Nguyen, Vi; Tan, Wenbin; Wang, Hui",BMC Infect Dis,,91

257675,Differential transcriptome and metabolome analysis of Plumbago zeylanica L. reveal putative genes involved in plumbagin biosynthesis,2020,"Osteoclasts are crucial cellular components of bone and are the cause of various bone problems like osteoporosis. Various biological activities such as anti-tumorous, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and immunomodulatory function are influenced by Sclareol, as a natural diterpene compound. However, studies on the effect and mechanism of Sclareol on osteoporosis are rare. In the current research, the influence of Sclareol on osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis was targeted to be discovered in ovariectomy (OVX)-induced animal models and in vitro. The expression levels of osteoclast-related genes such as c-Fos, NFATc1, and CTSK were detected by RT-qPCR and western blotting to understand the inhibition of Sclareol on the creation of osteoclast. The influence of Sclareol on osteoblastogenesis and the expression of osteoblastogenic markers were also examined. Sclareol inhibited the osteoclastogenesis caused by receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#954;B ligand (RANKL) which promoted osteoblastogenesis through upregulating the expression of cysteine-rich protein 61 (CYR61/CCN1), which is a matricellular protein of the CCN family. The p-ERK and p-P38 protein expression levels were considerably downregulated by Sclareol. Furthermore, CCN1 overexpression partially mimicked the inhibitory effect of Sclareol, while the opposite results were obtained after CCN1 silencing. Additionally, Sclareol protected against loss of bones in an osteoporosis mouse model generated by OVX. The acquired results indicated that Sclareol represses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and promotes osteoblastogenesis via promoting the expression of CCN1 by constraining the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Our findings proposed that for the avoidance and treatment of osteoclast-linked disorders, Sclareol is a potentially effective drug. A proposed model for mediated regulation of osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis by Sclareol. The basic model of the process by which Sclareol prevents osteoclastogenesis and promotes osteoblastogenesis. Sclareol may increase the expression of CCN1 through inhibiting the MAPK pathway, thereby inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and attenuating bone resorption. Sclareol represses the expression of c-Fos, which stimulates the formation of osteoclast. In contrast, Sclareol promotes osteoblast differentiation by upregulating Runx2 expression, thereby improving the formation of bones. Consequently, Sclareol protects against loss of bones by regulating the stability of bone makeover via inhibition of bone formation and stimulation of bone resorption. Graphical Headlights 1. Sclareol represses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. 2. Sclareol promotes osteoblast differentiation. 3. Sclareol inhibits the MAPK pathway through induction of CCN1. 4.

Although the origin(s) of these viruses are still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious, some general patterns of their pathogenesis and epidemics are noticeable. Both viruses utilize the same receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-for invading human bodies. Both epidemics occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major holidays, and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a fashion. Thus, if bats were the natural hosts of SARS-CoVs, cold temperature and low humidity in these times might provide conducive environmental conditions for prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats. The widespread existence of these bat-carried or -released viruses might have an easier time in breaking through human defenses when harsh winter makes human bodies more vulnerable. Once succeeding in making some initial human infections, spreading of the disease was made convenient with increased social gathering and holiday travel. These natural and social factors influenced the general progression and trajectory of the SARS epidemiology. However, some unique factors might also contribute to the origination of SARS in Wuhan. These factors are discussed in different scenarios in order to promote more research for achieving final validation.","Sun, Zhong; Thilakavathy, Karuppiah; Kumar, S Suresh; He, Guozhong; Liu, Shi V",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,91

We investigated the safety and the effects of indacaterol on lung diffusion, lung mechanics, sleep respiratory behavior, cardiac rhythm, welfare, and exercise performance in HF patients treated with a selective (bisoprolol) or a non-selective (carvedilol) ß-blocker. Study procedures were performed before and after indacaterol and placebo treatments according to a cross-over, randomized, double-blind protocol in forty-four patients (27 on bisoprolol and 17 on carvedilol). No differences between indacaterol and placebo were observed in the whole population except for a significantly higher VE/VCO2 slope and lower maximal PETCO2 during exercise with indacaterol, entirely due to the difference in the bisoprolol group (VE/VCO2 31.8 ± 5.9 vs. 28.5 ± 5.6, p < 0.0001 and maximal PETCO2 36.7 ± 5.5 vs. 37.7 ± 5.8 mmHg, p < 0.02 with indacaterol and placebo, respectively).

Phylogenetic and likelihood-mapping analyses of these genome sequences were performed. On the basis of our results, the star-like signal and topology of 2019-nCoV may be indicative of potentially large ""first generation"" human-to-human virus transmission. We estimated that 2019-nCoV likely originated in Wuhan on 9 November 2019 (95% credible interval: 25 September 2019 and 19 December 2019), and that Wuhan is the major hub for the spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and elsewhere. Our results could be useful for designing effective prevention strategies for 2019-nCoV in China and beyond.","Li, Xingguang; Zai, Junjie; Wang, Xiaomei; Li, Yi",J Med Virol,,91
263639,Application of Laser Micro-Nano-Fabrication in Sensing Field,2021,"Background: Worldwide demand for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is increasing as more countries are impacted by COVID-19 and as testing remains central to contain the spread of the disease, both in countries where the disease is emerging and in countries that are past the first wave but exposed to re-emergence. Group testing has been proposed as a solution to expand testing capabilities but sensitivity concerns have limited its impact on the management of the pandemic. Digital PCR (RT-dPCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than RT-PCR and could help in this context. Methods: We implemented RT-dPCR based COVID-19 group testing on commercially available system and assay (Naica System from Stilla Technologies) and investigated the sensitivity of the method in real life conditions of a university hospital in Paris, France, in May 2020. We tested the protocol in a direct comparison with reference RT-PCR testing on 448 samples split into groups of 3 sizes for RT-dPCR analysis: 56 groups of 8 samples, 28 groups of 16 samples and 14 groups of 32 samples. Results: Individual RT-PCR testing identified 25 positive samples. Using groups of 8, testing by RT-dPCR identified 23 groups as positive, corresponding to 26 true positive samples including 2 samples not initially detected by individual RT-PCR but confirmed positive by further RT-PCR and RT-dPCR investigation. For groups of 16, 15 groups tested positive, corresponding to 25 true positive samples identified. 100% concordance is found for groups of 32 but with limited data points.","Martin, Alexandra; Storto, Alexandre; Andre, Barbara; Mallory, Allison; Dangla, Remi; Visseaux, Benoit; Gossner, Olivier",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02908v1.pdf,91

Hara tea leaves by UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS,2020,"A highly contagious coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused by a recently identified severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) initially detected in Wuhan, China has spread worldwide and become a major health crisis in the absence of specific vaccine or antiviral drugs. SARS-CoV-2 infection has resulted in overwhelming number of reported deaths. Unfortunately it is still spreading uncontrollably despite implementing stringent protective measures. Rapid development of effective therapeutic strategies for treatment and prevention of infection is crucially required. Although genomic characterization has assisted in unfolding various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 but development of specific antiviral drugs and vaccine against COVID-19 is still a worldwide challenge. Understanding the disease pathological course underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is imperative to identify the vital targets for drug development. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the host cell and primarily target type II alveolar cells. COVID-19 disease progression is associated with distressed immune functions and hyper active inflammatory system leading to development of cytokine storm which is a vital factor involved in disease advancement. The current review elucidates the disease pathology and summarizes the possible therapeutic options to battle against COVID-19 on the basis of current state of understanding about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic pathways and knowledge gained from previous SARS and MERS-CoV epidemics. Therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent infection as well as to suppress the disease progression to reduce severity and mortality rate is discussed. Drug candidates currently under consideration and undergoing clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment are highlighted.","Rohilla, Suman",Drug dev. res,,91

This study aimed to explore whether early coagulation tests can predict risk stratification and prognosis. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched electronically for relevant research studies published up to March 24, 2020, producing 24 articles for the final inclusion. The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) of coagulation parameters at admission were calculated to determine severe and composite endpoint conditions (ICU or death) in COVID-19 patients. Meta-analyses revealed that platelet count was not statistically related to disease severity and composite endpoint; elevated D-dimer correlated positively with disease severity (SMD 0.787 (0.277-1.298), P= 0.003, I2= 96.7%) but had no significant statistical relationship with composite endpoints. Similarly, patients with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) had an increased risk of ICU and increased risk of death (SMD 1.338 (0.551-2.125), P = 0.001, I2 = 92.7%). Besides, increased fibrin degradation products (FDP) and decreased antithrombin might also mean the disease is worsening. Therefore, early coagulation tests followed by dynamic monitoring is useful for recognizing coagulation disorders accompanied by COVID-19 and guiding timely therapy to improve prognosis.","Luo, Lili; Xu, Min; Du, Mengyi; Kou, Haiming; Liao, Danying; Cheng, Zhipeng; Mei, Heng; Hu, Yu",Aging (Albany NY),,91

AIM: This study evaluated the psychosocial and behavioural changes related to oral health in adolescents immediately before and during the pandemic period of COVID-19, enabling a longitudinal assessment of the perceived changes. DESIGN: This cohort study evaluated 290 adolescents from November 2019 to February 2020 (T1-before the pandemic in Brazil) and from June to July 2020 (T2) in southern Brazil. Sociodemographic, behavioural, and psychosocial variables were measured before and during the pandemic. Issues related to social distancing and job loss were also collected. The differences between the variables in T1 and T2, as well as the effect of social distancing, were assessed using a multilevel-adjusted logistic regression model for repeated measures. RESULTS: A total of 207 adolescents were re-evaluated at T2 (a response rate of 71.3%). During the pandemic, the frequency of toothbrushing, the use of dental services, and the self-perceived need for dental treatment significantly decreased. Sugar consumption, bruxism, and quality of sleep did not change significantly.

While some COVID-19 drugs are less relevant to dental practice, as antivirals and hydroxychloroquine, their association with long-term adverse effects requires adequate knowledge among dental practitioners. Conclusion: Many of COVID-19 pharmacotherapeutic agents are used to treat oral diseases particularly orofacial pain and inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, some of these drugs may induce adverse effects that complicate dental treatment. Thorough knowledge of COVID-19 therapy and its dental implications is essential for dental practitioners, and is expected to contribute to a better understanding and effective utilization of these therapeutic agents.","Dar-Odeh, Najla; Elsayed, Shadia; Babkair, Hamzah; Abu-Hammad, Shaden; Althagafi, Nebras; Bahabri, Rayan; Eldeen, Yasmin Salah; Aljohani, Wejdan; Abu-Hammad, Osama",,,91
294110,Tumor suppressor role of miR-876-5p in gastric cancer,2020,"Groundwater is an important resource for supporting domestic water use for people's livelihoods and for maintaining ecosystems. Borehole observations provide the first-hand data that characterise the fluctuation, depth, and aquifer conditions of the groundwater. Unfortunately, such observations are not available or are insufficient for scientific use in many regions. Taking the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) as an example of data-deficient regions, this study proposes a simple knowledge-based approach that uses the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) for the main data, with rainfall, hydrological, topographical and geological datasets as supports, by which to infer the spatio-temporal variability and storage potential of groundwater. The method is based on analysis and inversion of impact factors on groundwater, and the feasibility of such a method is proven by showing that the groundwater results from GLDAS CLSM can correctly indicate the seasonality, as well as the link to topographical and geological features. For example, both results from the water balance equation (WBE) and GLDAS CLSM indicate that there are two groundwater recharge seasons in the basin, e.g., March to May and September to November. Compared to the eastern side of the LVB, the western side has mountains blocking surface runoff, and thus, reasonably, has larger storage potential estimates in GLDAS CLSM. Due to the low degree of weathering of the basement rocks, it is expected that there is only small storage potential and variation of groundwater in the southeastern parts of the LVB. GLDAS CLSM also correctly reflects this behaviour. Additionally, the largest groundwater storage potential over the LVB is found in regions near the Kagera River and the western shoreline, since it associates with unconsolidated rocks and behaviours of large groundwater recharge from GLDAS CSLM during the wet year of 2006. The major limitation of this knowledge-based method is that the uncertainty in terms of magnitude on GLDAS CLSM groundwater changes cannot be assessed, in addition to the fact that the reliability of the results cannot be quantified in terms of specific numbers. Therefore, the results and interpretation of groundwater behaviours using such methods can only be a guide for 'where' and 'when' to find groundwater.","Hu, K X; Awange, J L; Kuhn, M; Nanteza, J",Sci Total Environ,,91
295112,Understanding Viral Infection Mechanisms and Patient Symptoms for the Development of COVID-19 Therapeutics,2021,"Despite a decreased share of gross domestic product, the role of a country’s food and beverage industry cannot be underestimated. Food security should be a crucial part of national policy in every country because, during critical situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it plays a key role in the protection of a country’s citizens. The food industry also plays a key role in employment and the sustainable development of all countries. We investigated the latest trends and focused on one specific branch of the food industry. Although the spirits industry does not have a major market share in the food industry, it is one of the branches with the highest added value, and it produces commodities with high export potential. This branch of the food industry in the Slovak Republic has a long tradition. Our primary aim was to examine the competitiveness of this sector in a single market of the EU as a key element of its sustainable development. The results obtained for the revealed comparative advantage suggest that there was a downturn in the number of competitive branches in the Slovak spirits industry during the study period of 2004–2018. Despite this negative trend, the remaining competitive branches of the Slovak spirits industry represent the majority of exports.","Bielik, Peter Turčeková Natália Adamičková Izabela",Sustainability,,91

We sought to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on pediatric interns' clinical exposure. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we quantified patient exposure among pediatric interns from a single large pediatric residency program at a freestanding children's hospital. Patient encounters and shifts per pediatric intern in the inpatient and emergency department settings were evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic, from March to June 2020, as compared with these 3 months in 2019. Patient encounters by diagnosis were also evaluated. RESULTS: The median number of patient encounters per intern per 2-week block declined on the pediatric hospital medicine service (37.5 vs 27.0; P < .001) and intensive care step-down unit (29.0 vs 18.8; P = .004) during the pandemic. No significant difference in emergency department encounters was observed (63.0 vs 40.5; P = .06). The median number of shifts worked per intern per 2-week block also decreased on the pediatric hospital medicine service (10.5 vs 9.5, P < .001). Across all settings, there were more encounters for screening for infectious disease and fewer encounters for respiratory illnesses. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric interns at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic were exposed to fewer patients and had reduced clinical schedules. Careful consideration is needed to track and supplement missed clinical experiences during the pandemic.","Geanacopoulos, Alexandra T; Sundheim, Kathryn M; Greco, Kimberly F; Michelson, Kenneth A; Parsons, Chase R; Hron, Jonathan D; Winn, Ariel S",Hosp. pediatr.

Also, with the ubiquitousness of mobile phone cameras, it is quite common to take pictures of the CT films, which unfortunately suffer from geometric deformation and illumination variation. In this work, we study the problem of recovering a CT film, which marks the first attempt in the literature, to the best of our knowledge. We start with building a large-scale head CT film database CTFilm20K, consisting of approximately 20,000 pictures, using the widely used computer graphics software Blender. We also record all accompanying information related to the geometric deformation (such as 3D coordinate, depth, normal, and UV maps) and illumination variation (such as albedo map). Then we propose a deep framework to disentangle geometric deformation and illumination variation using the multiple maps extracted from the CT films to collaboratively guide the recovery process. Extensive experiments on simulated and real images demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the previous approaches. We plan to open source the simulated images and deep models for promoting the research on CT film recovery (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/e6b1f6e3-9b36-423f-a225-55b7d0b55523/).","Quan, Quan; Wang, Qiyuan; Li, Liu; Du, Yuanqi; Zhou, S.

In addressing these imperatives, this paper targets more effective leveraging of latent efficiencies of off-site-manufacture, based on findings from a Hong Kong (HK)-based study on assessing and improving SCR in IC in a high-density city. Design/methodology/approach Starting with the identification of critical supply chain vulnerabilities (CSCVs), this study developed a multilevel-multicriteria mathematical model to evaluate the vulnerability levels of IC supply chains (SCs) in HK based on an in-depth questionnaire survey followed by experts' inputs and analyzing them using fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE). Findings The overall vulnerability index indicates that IC in HK is substantially vulnerable to disruptions, while production-based vulnerabilities have the highest impact. Top management attention is needed to address these CSCVs in IC in HK. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is the first structured evaluation model that measures the vulnerability level of IC, providing useful insights to industry stakeholders for well-informed decision-making in achieving resilient, sustainable and performance-enhanced SCs.","Ekanayake, Emac Shen G.; Kumaraswamy, M.; Owusu, E.

In view to expedite new drug leads for COVID-19, Main Proteases (Mpro) of novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a crucial target for this virus. Nitric oxide (NO) inhibits the replication cycle of SARS-CoV. Inhalation of nitric oxide is used in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Herein, we evaluated the phenyl furoxan, a well-known exogenous NO donor to identify the possible potent inhibitors through in silico studies such as molecular docking as per target analysis for candidates bound to substrate binding pocket of SARS-COV-2 Mpro. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of most stable docked complexes (Mpro-22 and Mpro-26) helped to confirm the notable conformational stability of these docked complexes under dynamic state. Furthermore, Molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations revealed energetic contributions of key residues of Mpro in binding with potent furoxan derivatives 22, 26. In the present study to validate the molecular docking, MD simulation and MM-PBSA results, crystal structure of Mpro bound to experimentally known inhibitor X77 was used as control and the obtained results are presented herein. We envisaged that spiro-isoquinolino-piperidine-furoxan moieties can be used as effective ligand for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition due to the presence of key isoquinolino-piperidine skeleton with additional NO effect.

Study of asymptomatic transmission and implications for surveillance and disease burden are ongoing, but there has been little study of the implications of asymptomatic transmission on dynamics of disease. We use a mathematical framework to evaluate expected effects of asymptomatic transmission on the basic reproduction number R0 (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R0 will be under-estimated. Estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase also depend on asymptomatic generation intervals. Our analysis shows that understanding the temporal course of asymptomatic transmission can be important for assessing the importance of this route of transmission, and for disease dynamics. This provides an additional motivation for investigating both the importance and relative duration of asymptomatic transmission.","Park, Sang Woo; Cornforth, Daniel M; Dushoff, Jonathan; Weitz, Joshua S",Epidemics,,91
312452,[corona Infection during Pregnancy],2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic outpatient medicine has drastically been altered how it is delivered. This time period likely represents the largest volume of telehealth visits in the United States health care history. Telehealth presents unique challenges within each subspecialty, and pediatric otolaryngology is no different. This retrospective review was designed to evaluate our division of pediatric otolaryngology's experience with telehealth during the COVID19 pandemic. METHODS: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. All telehealth and face-to-face visits for the month of April 2020 completed by the Pediatric Otolaryngology Division were reviewed. A survey, utilizing both open-ended questions and Likert scaled questions was distributed to the 16 pediatric otolaryngology providers in our group to reflect their experience with telehealth during the 1-month study period. RESULTS: In April, 2020 our outpatient clinic performed a total of 877 clinic visits compared to 2260 clinic visits in April 2019. A total of 769 (88%) were telehealth visits. Telemedicine with video comprised 523 (68%) and telephone only comprised 246 (32%). There were 0 telehealth visits in April 2019. Interpretive services were required in 9.3% (N = 211) clinic visits in April 2019 and 7.5% (N = 66) of clinic visits in April 2020.

CONCLUSIONS: Despite low initial expectations for telehealth, the majority of our providers felt after 1 month of use that telehealth would continue to be a valuable platform post-pandemic clinical practice. Limited physical exam, particularly otoscopy, nasal endoscopy, and nasolaryngoscopy present challenges. However, with adequate information and preparation for the parents and for the physician some of the obstacles can be overcome.","Belcher, Ryan H; Phillips, James; Virgin, Frank; Werkhaven, Jay; Whigham, Amy; Wilcox, Lyndy; Wootten, Christopher T",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,,91

The epidemiological situation of national importance required infection control measures with the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality. An overburdening of the healthcare system should be avoided. The measures taken to combat the pandemic have had an impact on public and private life. Patients suffering from chronic pain have also been greatly affected. QUESTION: Which impact on their care do patients with chronic pain experience? METHOD: After multimodal inpatient treatment 70 pain patients were interviewed by telephone in a standardized fashion. They were asked about their condition as follows: did the changes due to the pandemic result in an increase in pain levels, a deterioration in mood and did the pandemic have a negative impact on the supply of pain medication? RESULTS: Changes in the biopsychosocial area were experienced by the patients and affected their overall well-being. Chronically ill pain patients were particularly affected by the lockdown. A large number of patients associated a deterioration in mood and aggravation of the chronic pain with measures resulting from the pandemic. The mood deterioration was clearly associated (70% of respondents). An increase in pain was associated with changes caused by the pandemic in 44% of respondents. Of the patients 39% reported a deterioration of the pain management. The measures taken to combat the pandemic have had and still have an impact on the lives of chronically ill pain patients. DISCUSSION: It is necessary to maintain the limited but still existing options of coordinated care for pain patients following a multimodal inpatient stay, even in difficult situations. The negative effects of a reduction in medical care are an argument in favor of multimodal outpatient care, especially after inpatient treatment.","Cegla, Thomas H; Magner, Astrid",Schmerz,,91

The strong support from governing authorities such as Operation Warp Speed and robust funding has led to the development and authorization of the tozinameran (BNT162b2) vaccine. The BNT162b2 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA that encodes for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the main site for neutralizing antibodies. Once it binds with the host cells, the lipid nanoparticles enable the transfer of the RNA, causing S antigens' expression of the SARS-CoV-2, conferring immunity. The vaccine is administered as a 2-dose regime 21 days apart for individuals 16 years and older. Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 vaccine was the first candidate to receive FDA-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on December 11, 2020. During phase 2/3 clinical trials, 95% efficacy was reported among 37,706 participants over the age of 16 who received the BNT162b2 vaccination; additionally, 52% efficacy was noted 12 days following the administration of the first dose of BNT162b2, reflecting early protection of COVID-19.

In that regard, the current study was aimed at performing Phase 1 clinical trial to determine the safety of plant formulation in 24 healthy volunteers and Phase 2 trials in 100 COVID-19 patients to determine the tolerability and impact on the level of COVID 19 specific inflammatory markers. The outcomes of the Phase 1study have suggested the safe usage of plant formulation in humans and encouraged to conduct Phase 2 clinical trial. In the Phase 2 trial, the plant formulation was evaluated in 100 COVID-19 patients along with the standard of care. In Phase 1 single dose of 500 mg plant formulation capsule was used as an intervention, while 1gm thrice a day of plant formulation for 14 days was the testing dose for Phase 2. During the Phase 1 trial, no adverse event was observed and all organ systems were normal in function. During the Phase 2 trial, 100 patients underwent randomization, 50 were assigned to receive plant formulation, and 50 to receive placebo. Three patients in the placebo and two patients in the plant formulation group had dropped out from the study. Hence, the primary analysis population included 95 patients (48 allocated to plant formulation and 47 to placebo). The COVID 19 specific inflammatory markers improved faster and became normal in the plant formulation treatment group. In conclusion, the plant formulation (ATRICOV 452) has been found to be safe in phases 1 and 2.

318299,Single-cell transcriptomes of peripheral blood cells indicate and elucidate severity of COVID-19,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, we very often heard the expression “We are at war,” but the warlike tactics that appeared more visibly during the pandemic have been long before used and deployed against the most precarious bodies among us (Butler) In fact, the “danger” constituted by the narrative of fighting the pandemic served in imposing security apparatus and exceptional measures, as well as deepening the “structural reforms” that neoliberal governments consider as their sole task to carry out (Federici) Thus, the rhetorical resource of the pandemic danger gave legitimacy to the expansion of warlike strategies with the complacency of the whole population In the present paper, drawing on an analysis of what we consider to be the main neoliberal governmental strategies in the way of dealing with the pandemic, we question the logic of a “total continuous war” (Foucault), carried out in particular through different bodies hierarchization and the designs of post-pandemic societies This reflection has been developed in three steps: first, we question what is this war that the COVID-19 pandemic made more visible In a second part, we observe government tactics and its relation with the rhetoric of war, which allows neoliberal governments to expose differently the human bodies (Agamben) Finally, we examine the relation between bio-necro-policies and the urgency of promoting a total continuous war that opposes disposable bodies to lives that neoliberal governments seek to protect © The Author(s) 2020","Dias, B.

METHODS: This cohort consisted of 202 pregnancies with poor obstetric history and immune system problems. Patients enrolled in special antenatal care program were administered low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin, low-dose salicylic acid and low-dose corticosteroid (prophylaxis protocol) as soon as their pregnancies were confirmed. Pregnancies with systemic lupus erythematosis, Sjogren syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis were additionally administered HCQ 200 mg daily as a part of their routine treatment. Pregnancies using HCQ were included in the study group (n = 39) while the remainders were included in control group (n = 163). We compared the groups in terms of the presence of miscarriage, fetal growth restriction (FGR), preeclampsia and preterm birth, as well as gestational week at birth, birthweight and ""APGAR score of <7"" at 10th minute. RESULTS: Miscarriage rates were 28.2% and 28.2% while preterm birth rates were 16.6% and 28.2% in the control and study groups, respectively (P = 0.215). Preeclampsia and HCQ-related side effects were not detected in the groups. There were also no significant differences between the groups in terms of FGR, gestational day at birth, birthweight and the presence of ""APGAR score <7"" at 10th minute (P = 0.462, P = 0.064, P = 0.273 and P = 0.627, respectively). CONCLUSION: Low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin, low-dose salicylic acid and low-dose corticosteroid prophylaxis together with HCQ seem to be promising in pregnancies with immune system disorders. HCQ seems to be a safe and effective drug in low dosages.","Beksac, Mehmet Sinan; Donmez, Hanife Guler",J. obstet. gynaecol. res,,91

At the peak of the pandemic surge in mid-April 2020, New Jersey saw 8045 hospitalized patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms, of which 2002 were in intensive care unit beds (86.3% of statewide capacity), including 1705 requiring mechanical ventilation. Because of the severity of pulmonary dysfunction/hypoxia, the unprecedented numbers of critically ill patients, the national opioid shortage, and transmission prevention measures for standard palliative care treatment protocols in place for refractory and/or end-of-life dyspnea were found to be ineffective in providing adequate symptom relief. The aim of the following Notes From the Field is to provide concise, pragmatic, and experiential reflection by 3 palliative care advanced practice nurses from 3 different hospital systems within the pandemic epicenter. The novel methods and opioid strategies implemented by their respective palliative care teams to ensure continued effective and appropriate treatment for end-of-life dyspnea are described.

331401,Antibiotic resistance and bacterial biofilm,2020,"With the emergence and global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community worldwide has focused on search for new therapeutic strategies against this disease. One such critical approach is targeting proteins such as helicases that regulate most of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA metabolism. The purpose of the current study was to predict a library of phytochemicals derived from diverse plant families with high binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 helicase (Nsp13) enzyme. High throughput virtual screening of the Medicinal Plant Database for Drug Design (MPD3) database was performed on SARS-CoV-2 helicase using AutoDock Vina. Nilotinib, with a docking value of -9.6 kcal/mol, was chosen as a reference molecule. A compound (PubChem CID: 110143421, ZINC database ID: ZINC257223845, eMolecules: 43290531) was screened as the best binder (binding energy of -10.2 kcal/mol on average) to the enzyme by using repeated docking runs in the screening process. On inspection, the compound was disclosed to show different binding sites of the triangular pockets collectively formed by Rec1A, Rec2A, and 1B domains and a stalk domain at the base. The molecule is often bound to the ATP binding site (referred to as binding site 2) of the helicase enzyme. The compound was further discovered to fulfill drug-likeness and lead-likeness criteria, have good physicochemical and pharmacokinetics properties, and to be non-toxic. Molecular dynamic simulation analysis of the control/lead compound complexes demonstrated the formation of stable complexes with good intermolecular binding affinity. Lastly, affirmation of the docking simulation studies was accomplished by estimating the binding free energy by MMPB/GBSA technique. Taken together, these findings present further in silco investigation of plant-derived lead compounds to effectively address COVID-19.","Ahmad, Sajjad; Waheed, Yasir; Ismail, Saba; Bhatti, Saadia; Abbasi, Sumra Wajid; Muhammad, Khalid",Molecules (Basel),,91

Notably, devastating diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) currently do not have vaccine therapies. Conventional vaccine platforms, such as live attenuated vaccines and whole inactivated vaccines, can be difficult to manufacture, may cause severe side effects, and can potentially induce severe infection. Subunit vaccines carry far fewer safety concerns due to their inability to cause vaccine-based infections. The applicability of protein nanoparticles (NPs) as vaccine scaffolds is promising to prevent infectious diseases, and they have been explored for a number of viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic diseases. Many types of protein NPs exist, including self-assembling NPs, bacteriophage-derived NPs, plant virus-derived NPs, and human virus-based vectors, and these particular categories will be covered in this review. These vaccines can elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses against specific pathogens, as well as provide protection against infection in a number of animal models. Furthermore, published clinical trials demonstrate the promise of applying these NP vaccine platforms, which include bacteriophage-derived NPs, in addition to multiple viral vectors that are currently used in the clinic. The continued investigations of protein NP vaccine platforms are critical to generate safer alternatives to current vaccines, advance vaccines for diseases that currently lack effective prophylactic therapies, and prepare for the rapid development of new vaccines against emerging infectious diseases.

The aims of this study were to investigate whether COVID-19 leaves behind residual dysfunction, and identify patients who might benefit from post-discharge monitoring. All patients aged &#8805;18 years admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) for COVID-19, and evaluated at post-discharge follow-up between 7 April and 7 May, 2020, were enrolled. Primary outcome was need of follow-up, defined as the presence at follow-up of at least one among: respiratory rate (RR) >20 breaths/min, uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) requiring therapeutic change, moderate to very severe dyspnoea, malnutrition, or new-onset cognitive impairment, according to validated scores. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) served as secondary outcome. 185 patients were included. Median [interquartile range] time from hospital discharge to follow-up was 23 [20-29] days. 109 (58.9%) patients needed follow-up. At follow-up evaluation, 58 (31.3%) patients were dyspnoeic, 41 (22.2%) tachypnoeic, 10 (5.4%) malnourished, 106 (57.3%) at risk for malnutrition. Forty (21.6%) patients had uncontrolled BP requiring therapeutic change, and 47 (25.4%) new-onset cognitive impairment. PTSD was observed in 41 (22.2%) patients. At regression tree analysis, the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) and body mass index (BMI) at ED presentation, and age emerged as independent predictors of the need of follow-up. Patients with PaO2/FiO2 <324 and BMI &#8805;33 Kg/m2 had the highest odds to require follow-up. Among hospitalised patients, age &#8805;63 years, or age <63 plus non-invasive ventilation or diabetes identified those with the highest probability to need follow-up. PTSD was independently predicted by female gender and hospitalisation, the latter being protective (odds ratio, OR, 4.03, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.76 to 9.47, p 0.0011; OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.92, p 0.033, respectively).

Due to the immature methods of extracting multi-antibiotics in different plant tissues, the antibiotic absorption and transportation mechanism in the phytoremediation process has yet to be resolved. Therefore, an improved Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) pretreatment with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) detection method for 28 antibiotics in different plant tissues (root, stem, leaf and seed) was developed in this study. The optimized method showed satisfactory performance with recoveries for most antibiotics ranging from 70% to 130% (except sulfadoxine with 138 ± 8.84% in root, sulfameter with 68.9 ± 1.87% and sulfadoxine with 141 ± 10.0% in seed). The limits of detection (LODs) of the target compounds in root, stem, leaf and seed were 0.04 ± 0.02 ~ 2.50 ± 1.14 ng/g, 0.05 ± 0.02 ~ 1.78 ± 0.42 ng/g, 0.06 ± 0.01 ~ 2.50 ± 0.14 ng/g and 0.13 ± 0.10 ~ 3.64 ± 0.74 ng/g, respectively. This developed method was successfully applied to the determination of antibiotics in different tissues of hydroponic wetland plants exposed to antibiotics-spiked water for one-month. Sixteen of 28 spiked antibiotics were detected in plant tissue samples. Overall, of these 16 antibiotics, all were detected in root samples (from < LOQ to 1478 ± 353 ng/g), eleven in stem samples (from < LOQ to 425 ± 47.0 ng/g), and nine in leaf samples (from < LOQ to 429 ± 84.5 ng/g). This developed analytical method provided a robust tool for the simultaneous screening and determination of antibiotics in different plant tissues.","Chen, Jun; He, Lu-Xi; Cheng, Yu-Xiao; Ye, Pu; Wu, Dai-Ling; Fang, Zhan-Qiang; Li, Jie; Ying, Guang-Guo",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,,91

343213,Differences in cytochrome p450 enzyme expression and activity in fetal and adult tissues,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, first reported in late December 2019, is regarded as the most significant public health emergency of the century. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the current outbreak of COVID-19 has affected millions of people and killed hundreds of thousands in more than 200 countries, including Pakistan. Health-care professionals (HCPs) cannot minimize human interactions or isolate themselves from patients due to their jobs and moral duties. Hence, the outbreak needed HCPs to work in adverse and challenging conditions with possible mental health problems. In light of the stated background, this study aims to explore and understand the factors that impede HCPs to effectively treat COVID-19 patients in Karachi, Pakistan. Based on qualitative methods, a phenomenological approach was considered to record the true experiences of HCPs. Twelve doctors and nurses were recruited from five COVID-19 designated hospitals in Karachi, Sindh Province, using purposive and snowball sampling. Semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews were conducted from April 6 to 14, 2020, and analyzed through thematic analysis. The findings suggest that there were two types of constraints, institutional and personal, which were impeding HCPs to treat COVID-19 patients effectively. Institutional constraints include the poor condition of isolation wards, inadequate availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), excessive and uneven workload, and absence of emotional and psychological support in hospitals. Besides, personal constraints include nervousness due to the novel virus, a constant fear of becoming infected, fear of taking virus to family, extreme isolation and loneliness, and feeling of powerlessness. The study found that HCPs in Pakistan have been dealing with a high risk of infection, causing mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. These mental health problems not only affect attention, understanding, and decision-making capacity of HCPs, which could hinder the fight against COVID-19, but they could also have a continuous effect on their overall well-being on a long-term basis. Therefore, the present study outlines important clinical and policy strategies that are needed to support HCPs as the pandemic continues.","Raza, Ali; Matloob, Sheema; Abdul Rahim, Noor Fareen; Abdul Halim, Hasliza; Khattak, Amira; Ahmed, Noor Hazlina; Nayab, Durr-E-; Hakeem, Abdul; Zubair, Muhammad",Front Psychol,,91

We hypothesized that the conserved response is associated with disease severity and is distinct between patients with different outcomes. To test this, we integrated 4,780 blood transcriptome profiles from patients aged 0 to 90 years infected with one of 16 viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, chikungunya, and influenza, across 34 cohorts from 18 countries, and single-cell RNA sequencing profiles of 702,970 immune cells from 289 samples across three cohorts. Severe viral infection was associated with increased hematopoiesis, myelopoiesis, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We identified protective and detrimental gene modules that defined distinct trajectories associated with mild versus severe outcomes. The interferon response was decoupled from the protective host response in patients with severe outcomes. These findings were consistent, irrespective of age and virus, and provide insights to accelerate the development of diagnostics and host-directed therapies to improve global pandemic preparedness.","Zheng, Hong; Rao, Aditya M; Dermadi, Denis; Toh, Jiaying; Murphy Jones, Lara; Donato, Michele; Liu, Yiran; Su, Yapeng; Dai, Cheng L; Kornilov, Sergey A; Karagiannis, Minas; Marantos, Theodoros; Hasin-Brumshtein, Yehudit; He, Yudong D; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Heath, James R; Khatri, Purvesh",Immunity,,91

346827,Moringa: A natural boon for health to mankind and livestocks,2020,"PURPOSE: Relapse after complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) remains common after treatment. The optimal antibiotic treatment duration for cIAIs is uncertain, especially in cases where source control is not achieved. We hypothesised that in patients with cIAIs, regardless of source control intervention, there would be a lower relapse rate with long-course antibiotics (28 days) compared with short course (&#8804; 10 days). We piloted a trial comparing &#8804; 10-day with 28-day antibiotic treatment for cIAI. METHODS: A randomised controlled unblinded feasibility trial was conducted. Eligible participants were adult patients with a cIAI that were diagnosed &#8804; 6 days prior to screening. Randomisation was to long-course (28 days) or short-course (&#8804;10 days) antibiotic therapy. Choice of antibiotics was determined by the clinical team. Participants were followed up for 90 days. Primary outcomes were willingness of participants to be randomised and feasibility of trial procedures. RESULTS: In total, 172 patients were screened, 84/172 (48.8%) were eligible, and 31/84 (36.9%) were randomised. Patients were assigned to either the short-course arm (18/31, 58.0%) or the long-course arm (13/31, 41.9%). One patient in the short-course arm withdrew after randomisation. In the short-course arm, 4/17 (23.5%) were treated for a cIAI relapse vs 0/13 (0.0%) relapses in the long-course arm. Protocol violations included deviations from protocol-assigned antibiotic duration and interruptions to antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study identified opportunities to increase recruitment in a full trial. This study demonstrates completion of a randomised controlled trial to further evaluate if the optimum antibiotic duration for cIAIs is feasible.

Objetivo Avaliar o número de óbitos domiciliares por parada cardiorrespiratória notificados pelo Serviço de Atendimento Móvel de Urgência (SAMU) em março de 2018, 2019 e 2020. Métodos Trata-se de um estudo observacional realizado a partir da análise de dados de mortalidade por parada cardiorrespiratória de cidadãos atendidos pelo SAMU em Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brasil. Foram analisadas as características sociais e clínicas e as informações de ocorrência. Foi avaliada a taxa de mortalidade por parada cardiorrespiratória em relação ao número total de atendimentos. Foi considerado um nível de significância de 95%. Resultados Houve um aumento nos óbitos domiciliares por parada cardiorrespiratória em março de 2020, em comparação com março de 2018 (p &lt; 0,001) e março de 2019 (p = 0,050).

Understanding balance impairments in ankle OA may help inform the management of this condition. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does balance overall performance differ between individuals with symptomatic radiographic ankle OA, asymptomatic radiographic ankle OA and healthy controls? Are there any differences in mediolateral or anteroposterior balance, or confidence to perform balance tasks between these groups? METHODS: Ninety-six volunteers (31 symptomatic radiographic ankle OA, 41 asymptomatic radiographic ankle OA and 24 healthy controls) completed six static balance tasks: bilateral stance on a firm surface, bilateral stance on foam, and tandem stance, all performed with eyes open and closed. Centre of pressure (COP) data were collected using force plates. Confidence to perform each balance task was collected using an 11-point numerical rating scale. RESULTS: Compared to controls, participants with symptomatic radiographic ankle OA had greater COP area when standing on a firm surface, foam and in tandem with eyes closed (all p < 0.05) and greater total COP sway in both firm surface and tandem stance conditions (p < 0.04). Participants with symptomatic ankle OA had greater COP area (p < 0.04) and total COP sway (p = 0.01) than those with asymptomatic ankle OA during tandem stance. Total COP sway and area were similar between asymptomatic ankle OA and control participants. Some differences in mediolateral and anteroposterior balance were identified between groups. Individuals with symptomatic ankle OA had lower confidence to perform the tandem stance eyes closed task compared to controls. SIGNIFICANCE: Balance impairments and decreased balance confidence were identified in those with symptomatic radiographic ankle OA compared to asymptomatic individuals with and without radiographic ankle OA. This suggests that balance deficits in ankle OA may be related to symptoms, rather than radiographic evidence of disease.","Smith, Michelle D; Rhodes, Jonah; Al Mahrouqi, Munira; MacDonald, David A; Vicenzino, Bill",Gait Posture,,91

Thus, mass burial is being used in different parts of the world to cope with this unusual situation. As a dead body might be contagious for at least hours, if not days, there is a need to manage/design/construct the mass burial considering the safe handling of coffins and other environmental, social, economical and ethical/dignity aspects. However, the guidelines of the World Health Organization do not thoroughly address the potential risk associated with groundwater pollution due to mass burial construction. Hence, the present study discusses the potential risk of groundwater pollution in mass burial sites and sheds light on the factors that control the survival/retention of bacteria and viruses in porous media. Furthermore, using the available knowledge on designing/monitoring of municipal/industrial waste disposal sites, a cost-effective and simple construction method of mass burial is proposed to mitigate its potential environmental impact. © 2021 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","Leong, E.

The proposed method uses a developed breath device composed of a nanomaterial-based hybrid sensor array with multiplexed detection capabilities that can detect disease-specific biomarkers from exhaled breath, thus enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis. An exploratory clinical study with this approach was examined in Wuhan, China, during March 2020. The study cohort included 49 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 58 healthy controls, and 33 non-COVID lung infection controls. When applicable, positive COVID-19 patients were sampled twice: during the active disease and after recovery. Discriminant analysis of the obtained signals from the nanomaterial-based sensors achieved very good test discriminations between the different groups. The training and test set data exhibited respectively 94% and 76% accuracy in differentiating patients from controls as well as 90% and 95% accuracy in differentiating between patients with COVID-19 and patients with other lung infections. While further validation studies are needed, the results may serve as a base for technology that would lead to a reduction in the number of unneeded confirmatory tests and lower the burden on hospitals, while allowing individuals a screening solution that can be performed in PoC facilities. The proposed method can be considered as a platform that could be applied for any other disease infection with proper modifications to the artificial intelligence and would therefore be available to serve as a diagnostic tool in case of a new disease outbreak.","Shan, Benjie; Broza, Yoav Y; Li, Wenjuan; Wang, Yong; Wu, Sihan; Liu, Zhengzheng; Wang, Jiong; Gui, Shuyu; Wang, Lin; Zhang, Zhihong; Liu, Wei; Zhou, Shoubing; Jin, Wei; Zhang, Qianyu; Hu, Dandan; Lin, Lin; Zhang, Qiujun; Li, Wenyu; Wang, Jinquan; Liu, Hu; Pan, Yueyin; Haick, Hossam",ACS Nano,,91

Before COVID, much of the emphasis in transport policy was on demand management, ‘smart’ technological interventions and sustainable mobility. The public health crisis has necessitated an urgent reconsideration of transport and its contribution to post-COVID economic recovery. In recognition of the importance of individual behaviour and collective responsibility in protecting both personal and public health during the crisis, this think piece proposes a new concept of Responsible Transport to help inform and shape transport policy and practice responses to COVID. The novelty of this proposal lies in the fact that it incorporates not only environmental considerations with respect to sustainability but also encompasses considerations of individual and community health and wellbeing. Moreover, it stresses the role of the individual as a responsible autonomous actor in delivering socially desired transport outcomes.","Budd, Lucy; Ison, Stephen",Transp. Res. Interdiscip.

As a consequence, neither sports activities nor social gatherings could take place for an indefinite period. This situation poses potential risks to sports clubs as clubs could lose members, volunteers, and revenue. The purpose of this study is to investigate how strong clubs have been affected so far by COVID-19 and which capacities help or hinder clubs in dealing with the crisis. (2) Methods: The study is based on large-scale primary data (n = 4295) collected among German sports clubs in autumn 2020. Three fractional regression models are applied to examine which organizational capacities are related to potential threats caused by COVID-19. (3) Results: Clubs perceive the risk of losing members as most threatening, followed by the challenge of retaining volunteers. Potential financial threats are perceived as smaller by clubs without their own sports facilities and paid employees. (4) Conclusions: Overall, sports clubs with a strong solidarity culture seem to be affected less by potential threats through COVID-19. To become more resilient to unexpected external influences, capacity building in specific areas of sports clubs should be considered.

358124,Exploration of the Epidemiological and Emotional Impact of Quarantine and Isolation During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"ABSTRACT: Antibodies are a fundamental tool to fight infections but are intrinsically built as a double-edged sword. One side recognizes the microbial antigen, and the other gives a call to arms to fight infection by recruiting immune cells and triggering inflammation. A balanced immune response must combine a potent neutralizing antibody and a swift disposal of the invading agent by innate immune cells with the least tissue damage possible. The longer the immune system takes to control the infection, the higher the possibility for a self-sustaining inflammatory process with potentially fatal consequences for the host. In addition to quantity, the quality of antibodies also matters, because posttranslational modifications altering the N-glycan composition in Fc fractions may help tilt the balance to the effector side, by modifying their affinity for Fc receptors in immune cells. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a wealth of data bolstering our understanding of the rules governing the production of protective and nonprotective antibodies. Also, it has broadened our understanding of the role of viruses in triggering autoimmunity and inflammation, and widened our knowledge of the different mechanisms that can be activated by viral infection and lead to autoantibody production, inflammation, and progressive tissue damage. In addition, the COVID-19 infection has contributed a great deal to our comprehension of the role of antibodies in the causation of cytokine storms and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, also seen in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases.","Rodriguez, Martin A; Fuentes-Silva, Yurilis J; Vásquez, Gloria",J. clin. rheumatol,,91

Herein, by modifying 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) scaffold, we developed an excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)-based fluorescent probe BTFMD for tracking GSH, which exhibited good selectivity, excellent water solubility, a large Stokes shift (181 nm) and fast response rate (within 10 min). Furthermore, the probe was successfully applied for imaging of endogenous GSH in live cells and zebrafish, and probing into the role of GSH in the development of cancer and Parkinson's disease.","Zheng, Ya-Long; Zhang, Han-Chen; Tian, Di-Hua; Duan, De-Chen; Dai, Fang; Zhou, Bo",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,,91
363093,MR imaging of venous malformations: sciatic nerve infiltration patterns and involved muscle groups,2020,"BACKGROUND: eHealth is the use of information and communication technologies to enable and improve health and health care services. It is crucial that medical students receive adequate training in eHealth as they will work in clinical environments that are increasingly being enabled by technology. This trend is especially accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic as it complicates traditional face-to-face medical consultations and highlights the need for innovative approaches in health care. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to evaluate the extent and nature of the existing literature on medical student training in eHealth. In detail, it aims to examine what this education consists of, the barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for improving the medical curriculum. This review focuses primarily on some key technologies such as mobile health (mHealth), the internet of things (IoT), telehealth, and artificial intelligence (AI). METHODS: Searches were performed on 4 databases, and articles were selected based on the eligibility criteria. Studies had to be related to the training of medical students in eHealth. The eligibility criteria were studies published since 2014, from a peer-reviewed journal, and written in either English or French. A grid was used to extract and chart data. RESULTS: The search resulted in 25 articles. The most studied aspect was mHealth. eHealth as a broad concept, the IoT, AI, and programming were least covered. A total of 52% (13/25) of all studies contained an intervention, mostly regarding mHealth, electronic health records, web-based medical resources, and programming. The findings included various barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for improving the medical curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: Trends have emerged regarding the suboptimal present state of eHealth training and barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for optimal training. We recommend that additional studies be conducted on the following themes: barriers, enhancing factors, propositions for optimal training, competencies that medical students should acquire, learning outcomes from eHealth training, and patient care outcomes from this training. Additional studies should be conducted on eHealth and each of its aspects, especially on the IoT, AI, programming, and eHealth as a broad concept. Training in eHealth is critical to medical practice in clinical environments that are increasingly being enabled by technology. The need for innovative approaches in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic further highlights the relevance of this training.","Echelard, Jean-François; Méthot, François; Nguyen, Hue-Anh; Pomey, Marie-Pascale",JMIR Med Educ,,91

365451,The Disorders of Endometrial Receptivity in PCOS and Its Mechanisms,2021,"The newly developed Persian Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) is a seven-item uni-dimensional scale that assesses the severity of fear of COVID-19. A translation and validation of the FCV-19S in the Malay language was expedited due to the severe psychological sequelae of COVID-19 in Malaysia. Formal WHO forward and backward translation sequences were employed in translating the English version into Malay. Malaysian university participants were recruited via convenience sampling online using snowball methods. The reliability and validity properties of the Malay FCV-19S were rigorously psychometrically evaluated (utilising both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis) in relation to socio-demographic variables and response to the depression, anxiety and stress subscales of the Malay validation of the DASS-21. The sample comprised 228 Malaysian participants. The Cronbach &#945; value for the Malay FCV-19S was 0.893 indicating very good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the uni-dimensional factor structure of the FCV19S fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S-M was significantly correlated with anxiety (r = 0.481, p < 0.001) and stress (r = 0.389, p < 0.001) subscales of DASS-21. The FCV-19S-M's properties tested using Rasch analysis were also satisfactory. Hence, the Malay FCV-19S is valid and reliable, with robust psychometric properties from classical and modern psychometric methods. It therefore is a highly crucial and timely addition to the psychological toolkit both in operational and research settings in identifying, managing and responding to the psychological distress engendered by COVID-19.","Pang, Nicholas Tze Ping; Kamu, Assis; Hambali, Nurfarah Lydia Binti; Mun, Ho Chong; Kassim, Mohd Amiruddin; Mohamed, Noor Hassline; Ayu, Friska; Rahim, Syed Sharizman Syed Abdul; Omar, Azizan; Jeffree, Mohd Saffree",Int J Ment Health Addict,,91

Here, we report for the first time that the 11S proteasomal activator PA28Î³ regulates the intracellular abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (nCoV N). Furthermore, we have identified proteasome activator PA28Î³ as a nCoV N binding protein by co-immunoprecipitation assay. As a result of their interaction, nCoV N could be degraded by PA28Î³-20S in vitro degradation assay. This was also demonstrated by blocking de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide. The stability of nCoV N in PA28Î³-knockout cells was greater than in PA28Î³-wildtype cells. Notably, immunofluorescence staining revealed that knockout of the PA28Î³ gene in cells led to the transport of nCoV N from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of PA28Î³ enhanced proteolysis of nCoV N compared to that in PA28Î³-N151Y cells containing a dominant-negative PA28Î³ mutation, which reduced this process. These results suggest that PA28Î³ binding is important in regulating 20S proteasome activity, which in turn regulates levels of the critical nCoV N nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Zhang, Haiyang; Tu, Jialu; Cao, Chulei; Yang, Ting; Gao, Liangcai",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,91
368815,Analyzing multi-step ligand binding reactions for oligomeric proteins by NMR: Theoretical and computational considerations,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the introduction of telemedicine as an alternative to the traditional face-to-face encounters with Vascular Surgery patients in the era of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Retrospective review of prospectively collected data on face-to-face and telemedicine interactions at a multi-site health care system from January to August 2020 in Vascular Surgery patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The end point is direct patient satisfaction comparison between face-to-face and telemedicine encounters/interactions prior and during the pandemic. RESULTS: There were 6,262 patient encounters from 01/01/2020 to 08/06/2020. Of the total encounters, 790 (12.6%) were via telemedicine, which were initiated on 03/11/2020 after the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. These telemedicine encounters were readily adopted and embraced by both the providers and patients and remain popular as an option to patients for all types of visits. 78.7% of patients rated their overall health care experience during face-to-face encounters as ""very good"" and 80.6% of patients rated their health care experience during telemedicine encounters as ""very good"" (p=0.78). CONCLUSION: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has produced unprecedented consequences to the practice of Medicine and specifically of Vascular Surgery, our multi-site health care system has been able to swiftly adapt and adopt telemedicine technologies for the care of our complex patients. Most importantly, the high quality of patient reported satisfaction and health care experience has remained unchanged.","Erben, Y; Franco-Mesa, C; Hamid, O; Lin, M; Stone, W; Meltzer, A J; Hattery, W; Palaj, A; Wilshusen, L L; Vista, T; Kalra, M; Farres, H; Bower, T C; De Martino, R R; Hakaim, A G; Huang, J F; Meschia, J F; TerKonda, S P",J. vasc. surg,,91

However, there is much debate regarding the appropriate level of funding for health and care in the UK. In this Health Policy paper, we look at the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and historical spending in the UK and comparable countries, assess the role of private spending, and review spending projections to estimate future needs. Public spending on health has increased by 3·7% a year on average since the National Health Service (NHS) was founded in 1948 and, since then, has continued to assume a larger share of both the economy and government expenditure. In the decade before the ongoing pandemic started, the rate of growth of government spending for the health and care sector slowed. We argue that without average growth in public spending on health of at least 4% per year in real terms, there is a real risk of degradation of the NHS, reductions in coverage of benefits, increased inequalities, and increased reliance on private financing. A similar, if not higher, level of growth in public spending on social care is needed to provide high standards of care and decent terms and conditions for social care staff, alongside an immediate uplift in public spending to implement long-overdue reforms recommended by the Dilnot Commission to improve financial protection. COVID-19 has highlighted major issues in the capacity and resilience of the health and care system. We recommend an independent review to examine the precise amount of additional funds that are required to better equip the UK to withstand further acute shocks and major threats to health.","Charlesworth, Anita; Anderson, Michael; Donaldson, Cam; Johnson, Paul; Knapp, Martin; McGuire, Alistair; McKee, Martin; Mossialos, Elias; Smith, Peter; Street, Andrew; Woods, Michael",Lancet,,91
372928,Mucosal and transdermal vaccine delivery strategies against COVID-19,2021,"Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) are a valuable tool in stem cell research due to their high proliferation rate, multi-lineage differentiation potential, and immunotolerance properties. However, fibroblast impurity during WJ-MSCs isolation is unavoidable because of morphological similarities and shared surface markers. Here, a proteomic approach was employed to identify specific proteins differentially expressed by WJ-MSCs in comparison to those by neonatal foreskin and adult skin fibroblasts (NFFs and ASFs, respectively). Mass spectrometry analysis identified 454 proteins with a transmembrane domain. These proteins were then compared across the different cell-lines and categorized based on their cellular localizations, biological processes, and molecular functions. The expression patterns of a selected set of proteins were further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunofluorescence assays. As anticipated, most of the studied proteins had common expression patterns. However, EphA2, SLC25A4, and SOD2 were predominantly expressed by WJ-MSCs, while CDH2 and Talin2 were specific to NFFs and ASFs, respectively. Here, EphA2 was established as a potential surface-specific marker to distinguish WJ-MSCs from fibroblasts and for prospective use to prepare pure primary cultures of WJ-MSCs. Additionally, CDH2 could be used for a negative-selection isolation/depletion method to remove neonatal fibroblasts contaminating preparations of WJ-MSCs.","Al Madhoun, Ashraf; Marafie, Sulaiman K; Haddad, Dania; Melhem, Motasem; Abu-Farha, Mohamed; Ali, Hamad; Sindhu, Sardar; Atari, Maher; Al-Mulla, Fahd",,,91

STUDY DESIGN: This is a nationwide observational study including all French hospitals from January 24, 2020, to April 11, 2020. METHODS: We analyzed the aggregated hospital fatality rate. A Poisson regression was performed to investigate associations between characteristics pertaining to populational health, socio-economic context and local healthcare supply at baseline, and the chosen outcome. RESULTS: On April 11, 2020, a total number of 30,960 patients were hospitalized among the 3046 French healthcare facilities, including 6832 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 8581 deaths due to COVID-19 had been recorded, with a median mortality rate per 10,000 people per department of 0.53 (interquartile range: 0.29-1.90). There were significant variations between the 95 French departments even after adjusting for outbreak inception (P < 0.001). After multivariable analysis, four factors were independently associated with a significantly higher aggregated hospital fatality rate: a higher ICU capacity at baseline (estimate = 1.47; P = 0.00791), a lower density of general practitioners (estimate = 0.95; P = 0.0205), a lower fraction of activity from the for-profit private sector (estimate = 0.99; P < 0.001), and the ratio of people older than 75 years (estimate = 0.91; P = 0.0023). CONCLUSIONS: The aggregated hospital fatality rate from COVID-19 in France seems to vary among geographic areas, with some factors pertaining to local healthcare supply being associated with the outcome.","Zeitoun, J-D; Faron, M; Lefèvre, J H",Public Health,,91

There is limited evidence on COVID-19 preparedness of such services in the Asia-Pacific region. AIM: To evaluate the preparedness and capacity of hospice and palliative care services in the Asia-Pacific region to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An online cross-sectional survey was developed based on methodology guidance. Asia-Pacific Hospice and Palliative Care Network subscribers (n = 1551) and organizational members (n = 185) were emailed. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Ninety-seven respondents completed the survey. Around half of services were hospital-based (n = 47, 48%), and public-funded (n = 46, 47%). Half of services reported to have confirmed cases (n = 47, 49%) and the majority of the confirmed cases were patients (n = 28, 61%). Staff perceived moderate risk of being infected by COVID-19 (median: 7/10). > 85% of respondents reported they had up-to-date contact list for staff and patients, one-third revealed challenges to keep record of relatives who visited the services (n = 30, 31%), and of patients visited in communities (n = 29, 30%). Majority of services (60%) obtained adequate resources for infection control except face mask. More than half had no guidance on Do Not Resuscitate orders (n = 59, 66%) or on bereavement care for family members (n = 44, 51%). CONCLUSION: Recommendations to strengthen the preparedness of palliative care services include: 1) improving the access to face mask; 2) acquiring stress management protocols for staff when unavailable; 3) reinforcing the contact tracing system for relatives and visits in the community and 4) developing guidance on patient and family care during patient's dying trajectory.","Lin, Cheng-Pei; Boufkhed, Sabah; Kizawa, Yoshiyuki; Mori, Masanori; Hamzah, Ednin; Aggarwal, Ghauri; Namisango, Eve; Higginson, Irene J; Goh, Cynthia; Harding, Richard",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,91

Therefore, the objective of this study is to help end users (clinicians, healthcare providers and organisations) to understand the real-life performance of point-of-care assays, aiding in their implementation in decentralised, true point-of-care facilities, or inside hospitals. 871 studies were screened in 3 major databases and 51 studies were included, evaluating 20 antigen tests and 10 nucleic-acid amplification platforms. We excluded studies that used processed samples, pre-selected populations, archived samples and laboratory-only evaluations and strongly favored prospective trial designs in our inclusion criteria. We also investigated package inserts, instructions for use, comments on published studies and manufacturers websites in order to assess feasibility of POC placement and additional information of relevance to the end user. Apart from sensitivity and specificity, we present information on time to results, hands-on time, kit storage, machine operating conditions and regulatory status. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically evaluate POC test performance in real-life clinical practice.

381424,Why do we lack a specific magic anti-COVID-19 drug? Analyses and solutions,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Rapid and accurate diagnostic approaches are essential for impeding the spread of infectious diseases. This review aims to summarize current progress of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) systems in the applications for diagnostics of infectious diseases including the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we discuss class 2 CRISPR-Cas biosensing systems-based diagnostics in various emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, CRISPR-Cas systems have created a new era for early diagnostics of infectious diseases, especially with the discovery of the collateral cleavage activity of Cas12 and Cas13. We mainly focus on different CRISPR-Cas effectors for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms as well as provide a detailed explanation of the pros and cons of CRISPR-Cas biosensing systems. In addition, we also introduce future research perspectives. EXPERT COMMENTARY: However, further improvement of newly discovered systems and engineering existing ones should be developed to increase the specificity, sensitivity or stability of the diagnostic tools. It may be a long journey to finish the clinical transition from research use. CRISPR-Cas approaches will emerge as more promising and robust tools for infectious disease diagnosis in the future.","Li, Peipei; Wang, Li; Yang, Junning; Di, Li-Jun; Li, Jingjing",Expert Rev Mol Diagn,,91

383094,Oxidative Stress in Vascular Pathophysiology: Still Much to Learn,2021,"BACKGROUND: More than 79.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1.7 million deaths were caused by SARS-CoV-2; the disease was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Control of the COVID-19 epidemic has become a crucial issue around the globe, but there are limited studies that investigate the global trend of the COVID-19 pandemic together with each country's policy measures. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop an online artificial intelligence (AI) system to analyze the dynamic trend of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitate forecasting and predictive modeling, and produce a heat map visualization of policy measures in 171 countries. METHODS: The COVID-19 Pandemic AI System (CPAIS) integrated two data sets: the data set from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker from the Blavatnik School of Government, which is maintained by the University of Oxford, and the data set from the COVID-19 Data Repository, which was established by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. This study utilized four statistical and deep learning techniques for forecasting: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), feedforward neural network (FNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM). With regard to 1-year records (ie, whole time series data), records from the last 14 days served as the validation set to evaluate the performance of the forecast, whereas earlier records served as the training set. RESULTS: A total of 171 countries that featured in both databases were included in the online system. The CPAIS was developed to explore variations, trends, and forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic across several counties. For instance, the number of confirmed monthly cases in the United States reached a local peak in July 2020 and another peak of 6,368,591 in December 2020. A dynamic heat map with policy measures depicts changes in COVID-19 measures for each country. A total of 19 measures were embedded within the three sections presented on the website, and only 4 of the 19 measures were continuous measures related to financial support or investment. Deep learning models were used to enable COVID-19 forecasting; the performances of ARIMA, FNN, and the MLP neural network were not stable because their forecast accuracy was only better than LSTM for a few countries. LSTM demonstrated the best forecast accuracy for Canada, as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 2272.551, 1501.248, and 0.2723075, respectively. ARIMA (RMSE=317.53169; MAPE=0.4641688) and FNN (RMSE=181.29894; MAPE=0.2708482) demonstrated better performance for South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: The CPAIS collects and summarizes information about the COVID-19 pandemic and offers data visualization and deep learning-based prediction. It might be a useful reference for predicting a serious outbreak or epidemic. Moreover, the system undergoes daily updates and includes the latest information on vaccination, which may change the dynamics of the pandemic.","Yu, Cheng-Sheng; Chang, Shy-Shin; Chang, Tzu-Hao; Wu, Jenny L; Lin, Yu-Jiun; Chien, Hsiung-Fei; Chen, Ray-Jade",J Med Internet Res,,91

Confinement as a preventive measure is itself a threat that produces a social impact. Pandemic and confinement have become a psychosocial adversity factor that affects families and their children. During the pandemic, children and adolescents with a psychiatric disorder may experience exacerbation of their symptoms. However, little is known about this, since studies on this population during the pandemic are scarce. Objective: To review the data available in the current literature on the effect of the pandemic on children and adolescents with a previous psychiatric disorder. Methods: A literature search was carried out using PubMed, Scielo and, due to the exceptional conditions of the pandemic situation, directly using internet search engines. Both English and Spanish papers were included. Results: The information found is presented in the following sections: family and children during the pandemic, evaluation of mental disorders in children and young people during the pandemic, pre-existing psychiatric disorders during the pandemic, and telepsychiatric care. Specific information is presented on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The current pandemic due to COVID-19 and confinement are a psychosocial adversity that threatens the stability of the family. Such a stressor can cause exacerbation of symptoms of a previous mental disorder. Children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders are a vulnerable population and require specialised care. Telepsychiatry is becoming a modality with multiple advantages.","Palacio-Ortiz, Juan David; Londoño-Herrera, Juan Pablo; Nanclares-Márquez, Alejandro; Robledo-Rengifo, Paula; Quintero-Cadavid, Claudia Patricia",Rev.

We present a community-led intervention in Latino communities that integrated social services in mental health service delivery for an equity-based response. METHODS: We used tracking sheets to identify 1,436 unique participants (aged 5-86) enrolled in Latino Health Access's Emotional Wellness program, of whom 346 enrolled in the pre-COVID-19 period (March 2019-February 2020) and 1,090 in the COVID-19 period (March-June 2020). Demographic characteristics and types of services were aggregated to assess monthly trends using Pearson &#967;2 tests. Regression models were developed to compare factors associated with referrals in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. RESULTS: During the pandemic, service volume (P < .001) and participant volume (P < .001) increased significantly compared with the prepandemic period. Participant characteristics were similar during both periods, the only differences being age distribution, expanded geographic range, and increased male participation during the pandemic. Nonreferred services, such as peer support, increased during the pandemic period. Type of referrals significantly changed from primarily mental health services and disease management in the prepandemic period to affordable housing support, food assistance, and supplemental income. CONCLUSION: An effective mental health program in response to the pandemic must incorporate direct mental health services and address social needs that exacerbate mental health risk for Latino communities. This study presents a model of how to integrate both factors by leveraging promotor-led programs.","Moon, Kyle J; Montiel, Gloria Itzel; Cantero, Patricia J; Nawaz, Saira",Prev Chronic Dis,,91

389441,Contributions of immigrants to biomedical research in the US: a personal reflection,2021,"This paper examines the dynamic frequency co-movements and volatility spillovers between crude oil, gas oil, gasoline, heating oil, and natural gas futures markets during the global financial crisis and European crisis (GFC & ESDC), recent oil price crash, and COVID-19 pandemic crisis. We apply the spillover index by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and wavelet methods. The results show significant risk spillovers among the leading energy futures markets. Moreover, the spillovers are intensified during the financial crisis, oil crisis and COVID-19 outbreak. WTI crude oil is the highest net contributor of volatility spillovers to the other markets, whereas the other energy markets are net receivers of spillovers for the different sub periods, with the exception of natural gas before the GFC and during COVID-19 as well as Brent oil during COVID-19. Furthermore, the results show significant integration and multiscale co-movements among energy futures. Natural gas asset offers better diversification benefits to crude oil, heating oil, gasoline and gas oil under short term. Finally, the diversification gains diminish as scales rise. The optimal weight, hedge ratios and hedging effectiveness are time varying and crises-sensitive. These findings have significant implications for energy traders and policymakers to inform their decision-making.","Mensi, Walid Rehman Mobeen Ur Vo Xuan Vinh",Resources Policy,,91

390025,The role of systems biology and synthetic biology in appearing and managing COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Early discontinuation is a substantial barrier to the delivery of endocrine therapies (ETs) and may influence recurrence and survival. The authors investigated the association between early discontinuation of ET and social determinants of health, including insurance coverage and the neighborhood deprivation index (NDI), which was measured on the basis of patients' zip codes, in breast cancer. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of a prospective randomized clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment), women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer who started ET within a year of study entry were included. Early discontinuation was calculated as stopping ET within 4 years of its start for reasons other than distant recurrence or death via Kaplan-Meier estimates. A Cox proportional hazards joint model was used to analyze the association between early discontinuation of ET and factors such as the study-entry insurance and NDI, with adjustments made for other variables. RESULTS: Of the included 9475 women (mean age, 55.6 years; White race, 84%), 58.0% had private insurance, whereas 11.7% had Medicare, 5.8% had Medicaid, 3.8% were self-pay, and 19.1% were treated at international sites. The early discontinuation rate was 12.3%. Compared with those with private insurance, patients with Medicaid (hazard ratio [HR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.92) and self-pay patients (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.25-2.17) had higher early discontinuation. Participants with a first-quartile NDI (highest deprivation) had a higher probability of discontinuation than those with a fourth-quartile NDI (lowest deprivation; HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.62). CONCLUSIONS: Patients' insurance and zip code at study entry play roles in adherence to ET, with uninsured and underinsured patients having a high rate of treatment nonadherence. Early identification of patients at risk may improve adherence to therapy. LAY SUMMARY: In this retrospective analysis of 9475 women with breast cancer participating in a clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment), Medicaid and self-pay patients (compared with those with private insurance) and those in the highest quartile of neighborhood deprivation scores (compared with those in the lowest quartile) had a higher probability of early discontinuation of endocrine therapy. These social determinants of health assume larger importance with the expected increase in unemployment rates and loss of insurance coverage in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Early identification of patients at risk and enrollment in insurance optimization programs may improve the persistence of therapy.","Sadigh, Gelareh; Gray, Robert J; Sparano, Joseph A; Yanez, Betina; Garcia, Sofia F; Timsina, Lava R; Sledge, George W; Cella, David; Wagner, Lynne I; Carlos, Ruth C",Cancer,,91

METHOD: Young subjects who have been followed up with a primary diagnosis of OCD in a university hospital were reached by telephone or online programs to assess symptom profile, symptom severity and exacerbation during pandemic. Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive (CY-BOCS) and Clinical Global Impression- Severity (CGI-S) Scales were used to rate symptom profile and severity before pandemic and during pandemic periods. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the frequency of contamination obsessions (p=0.008) and cleaning/washing compulsions (p=0.039) during pandemic period. CY-BOCS obsessions (p<0.001), compulsions subscales (p<0.001) and total scores (p<0.001), and CGI-S scores (p<0.001) during pandemic period were statistically higher than before pandemic period. There was a significant relationship between the change in CY-BOCS scores with talking/searching in the social environment about COVID-19, daily preoccupation about COVID-19, duration of OCD diagnosis and diagnosis of COVID-19 in someone familiar. CONCLUSIONS: Young subjects with OCD may develop additional symptoms and worsen already existing symptoms of OCD during COVID-19 pandemic.","Tanir, Yasar; Karayagmurlu, Ali; Kaya, Ilyas; Kaynar, Tuba Bilbay; Türkmen, Gaye; Dambasan, Büsra Nur; Meral, Yavuz; Coskun, Murat",Psychiatry Res,,91

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of acetic acid, the active component of vinegar, as a potential disinfectant agent for upper airways. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled and divided into two groups: group 1 (14 patients) was composed of patients treated with off-label hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, whereas group 2 (15 patients) was composed of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine only, combined with the inhalation of acetic acid disinfectant at a 0.34% concentration. A questionnaire-based evaluation of symptoms was performed after 15 days in both groups. RESULTS: It appears that the number of patients treated with acetic acid (group 2) that experienced improvement in individual symptoms was double that of the other group of patients (group 1), although numbers are too small for robust statistical analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Considering its potential benefits and high availability, acetic acid disinfection appears to be a promising adjunctive therapy in cases of non-severe COVID-19 and deserves further investigation.","Pianta, L; Vinciguerra, A; Bertazzoni, G; Morello, R; Mangiatordi, F; Lund, V J; Trimarchi, M",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,,91

Our aim was to describe rates of return to work versus unemployment following coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intensive care admission. DESIGN: Single-center, prospective case series. SETTING: Critical Care Follow-Up Clinic, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy. PATIENTS: One-hundred one consecutive laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients were discharged from our hospital following an ICU stay between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Twenty-five died in the ICU. Seventy-six were discharged alive from hospital. Two patients refused participation, while three were unreachable. The remaining 71 were alive at 6 months and interviewed. INTERVENTIONS: Baseline and outcome healthcare data were extracted from the electronic patient records. Employment data were collected using a previously published structured interview instrument that included current and previous employment status, hours worked per week, and timing of return to work. Health-related quality of life status was assessed using the Italian EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 71 interviewed patients, 45 (63%) were employed prior to coronavirus disease 2019, of which 40 (89%) of them worked full-time. Thirty-three (73%) of the previously employed survivors had returned to work by 6 months, 10 (22%) were unemployed, and 2 (5%) were newly retired.

393558,Strategies for immunomonitoring after vaccination and during infection,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Joblessness is common in survivors from critical care. Our aim was to describe rates of return to work versus unemployment following coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intensive care admission. DESIGN: Single-center, prospective case series. SETTING: Critical Care Follow-Up Clinic, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy. PATIENTS: One-hundred one consecutive laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients were discharged from our hospital following an ICU stay between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Twenty-five died in the ICU. Seventy-six were discharged alive from hospital. Two patients refused participation, while three were unreachable. The remaining 71 were alive at 6 months and interviewed. INTERVENTIONS: Baseline and outcome healthcare data were extracted from the electronic patient records. Employment data were collected using a previously published structured interview instrument that included current and previous employment status, hours worked per week, and timing of return to work. Health-related quality of life status was assessed using the Italian EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 71 interviewed patients, 45 (63%) were employed prior to coronavirus disease 2019, of which 40 (89%) of them worked full-time. Thirty-three (73%) of the previously employed survivors had returned to work by 6 months, 10 (22%) were unemployed, and 2 (5%) were newly retired. Among those who returned to work, 20 (85%) of them reported reduced effectiveness at work. Those who did not return to work were either still on sick leave or lost their job as a consequence of coronavirus disease 2019. Reported quality of life of survivors not returning to work was worse than of those returning to work. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of coronavirus disease 2019 survivors following ICU in our cohort had returned to work by 6 months of follow-up. However, most of them reported reduced work effectiveness.

395664,"The effectiveness of a dose based reporting tool in reducing vaccine wastage at primary care clinics in Delhi, India: an operational research study",2020,"The high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 has accelerated the development of many potential vaccines. However, these vaccines are designed against SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Wuhan, China, and thereby may not be effective against other SARS-CoV-2 variants such as the United Kingdom variant (VUI-202012/01). The UK SARS-CoV-2 variant possesses D614G mutation in the Spike protein, which impart it a high rate of infection. Therefore, newer strategies are warranted to design novel vaccines and drug candidates specifically designed against the mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2. One such strategy is to target ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme2)-Spike protein RBD (receptor binding domain) interaction. Here, we generated a homology model of Spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 UK strain and screened a marine seaweed database employing different computational approaches. On the basis of high-throughput virtual screening, standard precision, and extra precision molecular docking, we identified BE011 (Dieckol) as the most potent compounds against RBD. However, Dieckol did not display drug-like properties, and thus different derivatives of it were generated in silico and evaluated for binding potential and drug-like properties. One Dieckol derivative (DK07) displayed good binding affinity for RBD along with acceptable physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, drug-likeness, and ADMET properties. Analysis of the RBD-DK07 interaction suggested the formation of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions with key residues mediating the ACE2-RBD interaction. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the stability of the RBD-DK07 complex. Free energy calculations suggested the primary role of electrostatic and Van der Waals' interaction in stabilizing the RBD-DK07 complex. Thus, DK07 may be developed as a potential inhibitor of the RBD-ACE2 interaction. However, these results warrant further validation by in vitro and in vivo studies.","Aatif, Mohammad; Muteeb, Ghazala; Alsultan, Abdulrahman; Alshoaibi, Adil; Khelif, Bachir Yahia",Mar. drugs,,91

Methods: In this study, all RT-PCR COVID-19 positive patients screened at corona filtration center, Benazir Bhutto hospital Rawalpindi from 20thMarch 2020 to 10thApril 2020 were included. Mean age of the cohort with age range was calculated. Presenting complaints & Co-morbid were analyzed and tabulated in frequencies and percentages. Portable CXR findings were classified according to BSTI classification and documented in frequencies and percentages. Results: Mean age of the patients was 44 years. Presenting complaints were cough 20 (67%), fever 18 (60%), shortness of breath 11 (37%), sore throat six (20%), loss of sense of taste and smell four(13%). Main co-morbid was hypertension six (20%). Two (7%) patients had normal and seven (23%) had classical COVID CXRs. 21 (70%) patients were in indeterminate group with only one (3%) having unilateral lung disease. Three (10%) patients had diffuse lung involvement and 18(60%) had peripheral lung involvement. Majority of patients 19 (63%), had bilateral middle and lower zonal involvement. Conclusions: In this study, COVID-19 CXRs generally manifested a spectrum of pure ground glass, mixed ground glass opacities to consolidation in bilateral peripheral middle and lower lung zones. BSTI CXR reporting classification of COVID-19 is valid in our patients with addition of middle zonal involvement in classical COVID-19 criteria as opposed to just lower zone involvement.","Durrani, Misbah; Haq, Inam Ul; Kalsoom, Ume; Yousaf, Anum",Pak.

This paper presents for the first time a set of hyperspectral image (HSI) acquisitions and measurements to verify how glare affects acquired HSI data in standard conditions. We acquired two ColorCheckers (CCs) in three different lighting conditions, with different backgrounds, different exposure times, and different orientations. The reflectance spectra obtained from the imaging system have been compared to pointwise reference measures obtained with contact spectrophotometers. To assess and identify the influence of glare, we present the Glare Effect (GE) index, which compares the contrast of the grayscale patches of the CC in the hyperspectral images with the contrast of the reference spectra of the same patches. We evaluate, in both spatial and spectral domains, the amount of glare affecting every hyperspectral image in each acquisition scenario, clearly evidencing an unwanted light contribution to the reflectance spectra of each point, which increases especially for darker pixels and pixels close to light sources or bright patches.","Signoroni, Alberto; Conte, Mauro; Plutino, Alice; Rizzi, Alessandro",,,91

397223,Treatment approaches for COVID-19: A critical review,2021,"Symptomatic treatments are available for Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. An unmet need is cure or disease modification. This review discusses possible reasons for negative clinical study outcomes on disease modification following promising positive findings from experimental research. It scrutinizes current research paradigms for disease modification with antibodies against pathological protein enrichment, such as &#945;-synuclein, amyloid or tau, based on post mortem findings. Instead a more uniform regenerative and reparative therapeutic approach for chronic neurodegenerative disease entities is proposed with stimulation of an endogenously existing repair system, which acts independent of specific disease mechanisms. The repulsive guidance molecule A pathway is involved in the regulation of peripheral and central neuronal restoration. Therapeutic antagonism of repulsive guidance molecule A reverses neurodegeneration according to experimental outcomes in numerous disease models in rodents and monkeys. Antibodies against repulsive guidance molecule A exist. First clinical studies in neurological conditions with an acute onset are under way. Future clinical trials with these antibodies should initially focus on well characterized uniform cohorts of patients. The efficiency of repulsive guidance molecule A antagonism and associated stimulation of neurogenesis should be demonstrated with objective assessment tools to counteract dilution of therapeutic effects by subjectivity and heterogeneity of chronic disease entities. Such a research concept will hopefully enhance clinical test strategies and improve the future therapeutic armamentarium for chronic neurodegeneration.","Müller, Thomas; Mueller, Bernhard Klaus; Riederer, Peter",,,91

With much conflicting evidence on best practice to deliver safe treatment comprising of emergency dento-alveolar surgery, this paper describes the protocols which were undertaken to successfully set up a novel Urgent Dental Care Centre (UDCC) service within a short timeframe. We present patient data from referral through to treatment for the entire ten-week period of operation. A UDCC was established at Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup within 10 days of this announcement. Through an iterative process with minor stakeholders and in collaboration with our Local Dental Committee, a comprehensive urgent dental service was established. Our UDCC received 1,311 referrals within a 10-week period, with 884 patients being accepted for treatment. The majority of treatment delivered in this emergency setting was surgical dento-alveolar procedures (84%). Sixteen per cent of patients attended for trauma, first stage restorative treatment for teeth and postoperative complications. Both aerosol and non-aerosol generating procedures were available to patients. Preventing acute hospital admissions relies on the ability to provide safe dento-alveolar surgery. Our results advocate that our unique UDCC is efficient and provides appropriate patient access and outcomes for those most in need of urgent dental treatment in the face of a pandemic.","Pajpani, M; Patel, K; Bendkowski, A; Stenhouse, P",Br. j. oral maxillofac. surg,,91

Here, we demonstrate that PD-1 signals are needed for optimal memory. Mice deficient in the PD-1 pathway exhibit impaired CD8+ T cell memory following acute influenza infection, including reduced virus-specific CD8+ T cell numbers and compromised recall responses. PD-1 blockade during priming leads to similar differences early post-infection but without the defect in memory formation, suggesting that timing and/or duration of PD-1 blockade could be tailored to modulate host responses. Our studies reveal a role for PD-1 as an integrator of CD8+ T cell signals that promotes CD8+ T cell memory formation and suggest PD-1 continues to fine-tune CD8+ T cells after they migrate into non-lymphoid tissues. These findings have important implications for PD-1-based immunotherapy, in which PD-1 inhibition may influence memory responses in patients.","Pauken, Kristen E; Godec, Jernej; Odorizzi, Pamela M; Brown, Keturah E; Yates, Kathleen B; Ngiow, Shin Foong; Burke, Kelly P; Maleri, Seth; Grande, Shannon M; Francisco, Loise M; Ali, Mohammed-Alkhatim; Imam, Sabrina; Freeman, Gordon J; Haining, W Nicholas; Wherry, E John; Sharpe, Arlene H",Cell Rep,,91

METHODS: The study was a multicentric open-label trial of COVID-19 patients who were aged &#8805;â¯18 years, receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation, and with evidence of systemic inflammatory response who were assigned to standard of care (SOC) or SOC plus intravenous MP (40â¯mg bid for 3 days followed by 20â¯mg bid for 3 days). The primary outcome was a composite of death, admission to the intensive care unit, or requirement for noninvasive ventilation. Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 91 patients were screened, and 64 were randomized (mean age70â¯± 12 years). In the ITT analysis, 14 of 29 patients (48%) in the SOC group and 14 of 35 (40%) in the MP group suffered the composite endpoint (40% versus 20% in patients under 72 years and 67% versus 48% in those over 72 years; pâ¯= 0.25). In the PP analysis, patients on MP had a significantly lower risk of experiencing the composite endpoint (age-adjusted risk ratio 0.42; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.20-0.89; pâ¯= 0.043). CONCLUSION: The planned sample size was not achieved, and our results should therefore be interpreted with caution. The use of MP had no significant effect on the primary endpoint in ITT analysis; however, the PP analysis showed a beneficial effect due to MP, which consistent with other published trials support the use of glucocorticoids in severe cases of COVID-19.","Corral-Gudino, Luis; Bahamonde, Alberto; Arnaiz-Revillas, Francisco; Gómez-Barquero, Julia; Abadía-Otero, Jesica; García-Ibarbia, Carmen; Mora, Víctor; Cerezo-Hernández, Ana; Hernández, José L; López-Muñíz, Graciela; Hernández-Blanco, Fernando; Cifrián, Jose M; Olmos, Jose M; Carrascosa, Miguel; Nieto, Luis; Fariñas, María Carmen; Riancho, José A",Wien. klin.

This review highlights ways CR has evolved, and reviews the history of CR and recent advancements in telemedicine including remote patient monitoring, and mobile health that can be applied to CR. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite that initial studies indicate that home-based CR (HBCR) is safe and effective, HBCR has faced several challenges that have prevented it from becoming more widely implemented. Many previous concerns can now be addressed through the use of new innovations in home-based healthcare delivery. Since its inception, CR has become increasingly recognized as an important tool to improve patient mortality and quality of life in a broad range of cardiac diseases. While there has been little need to modify the delivery of CR since the 1950s, COVID-19 now serves as the necessary impetus to make HBCR an equal alternative to CBCR.","Epstein, Elizabeth; Patel, Neeja; Maysent, Kathryn; Taub, Pam R",Curr Cardiol Rep,,91

420717,2021 AMSSM Oral Research Poster Presentations,2021,"Various mitigation measures have been implemented to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including widely adopted social distancing and mandated face covering. However, assessing the effectiveness of those intervention practices hinges on the understanding of virus transmission, which remains uncertain. Here we show that airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the disease. By analyzing the trend and mitigation measures in Wuhan, China, Italy, and New York City, from January 23 to May 9, 2020, we illustrate that the impacts of mitigation measures are discernable from the trends of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the pandemic trends in the three epicenters. This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing, represents the most likely fighting opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work also highlights the fact that sound science is essential in decision-making for the current and future public health pandemics.","Zhang, Renyi; Li, Yixin; Zhang, Annie L; Wang, Yuan; Molina, Mario J",Proc.

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured with the Elecsys® assay and the EDITM ELISAs (IgM and IgG) in 64 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with serial blood samples (n = 104) collected at different time points from symptom onset. Blood samples from 200 healthy blood donors and 256 intensive care unit (ICU) patients collected before the COVID-19 outbreak were also used. RESULTS: In COVID-19 patients, the percentage of positive results rose with time from symptom onset, peaking to positivity rates after 15-22 days of 100% for the Elecsys® assay, of 94% for the EDITM IgM-ELISA and of 100% for the EDITM IgG ELISA. In the 104 blood samples, the agreement between positive/negative classifications of the Elecsys® assay and the EDITM ELISAs (IgM or IgG) was 90%. The false positivity rates in the healthy blood donors and the ICU patients were < 1% for the Elecsys® assay and < 3% for the EDITM ELISAs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a high sensitivity and specificity for the Elecsys® assay and an acceptable agreement with the EDITM ELISAs.","Egger, Margot; Bundschuh, Christian; Wiesinger, Kurt; Gabriel, Christian; Clodi, Martin; Mueller, Thomas; Dieplinger, Benjamin",Clin Chim Acta,,91

425013,Role of Leptin in Inflammation and Vice Versa,2020,"Suppression of type I interferon (IFN) response is one pathological outcome of the infection of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. To effect this, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 encode multiple IFN antagonists. In this study, we reported on the IFN antagonism of SARS-CoV-2 main protease NSP5. NSP5 proteins of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 counteracted Sendai virus-induced IFN production. NSP5 variants G15S and K90R commonly seen in circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 retained the IFN-antagonizing property. The suppressive effect of NSP5 on IFN-ß gene transcription induced by RIG-I, MAVS, TBK1 and IKKÏµ suggested that NSP5 likely acts at a step downstream of IRF3 phosphorylation in the cytoplasm. NSP5 did not influence steady-state expression or phosphorylation of IRF3, suggesting that IRF3, regardless of its phosphorylation state, might not be the substrate of NSP5 protease. However, nuclear translocation of phosphorylated IRF3 was severely compromised in NSP5-expressing cells. Taken together, our work revealed a new mechanism by which NSP5 proteins encoded by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 antagonize IFN production by retaining phosphorylated IRF3 in the cytoplasm. Our findings have implications in rational design and development of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.","Fung, Sin-Yee; Siu, Kam-Leung; Lin, Huayue; Yeung, Man Lung; Jin, Dong-Yan",Int J Biol Sci,,91

In this work, we develop a multiple equilibria behavioural business cycle model that can account for demand or supply collapses due to abrupt drops in consumer confidence, which affect both consumption propensity and investment. We show that, depending on the model parameters, four qualitatively different outcomes can emerge, characterised by the frequency of capital scarcity and/or demand crises. In the absence of policy measures, the duration of such crises can increase by orders of magnitude when parameters are varied, as a result of the""paradox of thrift"".

METHODS: Data on clinical and demographic features, maintenance treatment, disease course, and outcomes in individuals with IA (rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis) with symptomatic COVID-19 infection were prospectively assessed via web-based questionnaire followed by individual phone calls and electronic medical record review. Baseline characteristics and medication use were summarized for hospitalized and ambulatory patients, and outcomes with the different medication classes were compared using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients with IA were included in the study (80 with confirmed COVID-19 and 23 with high suspicion of COVID-19). Hospitalization was required in 26% of the participants, and 4% died. Patients who were hospitalized were significantly more likely to be older (P < 0.001) and have comorbid hypertension (P = 0.001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = 0.02). IA patients taking oral glucocorticoids had an increased likelihood of being admitted for COVID-19 (P < 0.001), while those receiving maintenance anticytokine biologic therapies did not. CONCLUSION: Among patients with underlying IA, COVID-19 outcomes were worse in those receiving glucocorticoids but not in patients receiving maintenance anticytokine therapy.

However, patients with asthma or COPD should continue all prescribed inhaled medications. Apparently, inhalers, including pMDIs, DPIs, or SMIs, have a low risk of contamination although characteristics of drug formulation can precipitate cough, whereas some researchers do not rule out the probability that nebulizer treatments may increase the risk of infection transmission via droplet nuclei and aerosols. Considering that aerosol therapy generates fugitive emissions that are not inhaled by the patient and are released from the device during expiration, several international professional bodies have provided recommendations for drug delivery via inhalers and in particular, nebulizers. Unfortunately, these recommendations are often in conflict with each other and do not clarify whether it is appropriate to use nebulizers during this COVID-19 pandemic. Considering what is available in literature, there are no known infection-related hazards to an uninfected patient and also a patient with COVID-19 that preclude the use of a nebulizer at home, but it fundamental that all patients, regardless of whether or not suffering from COVID-19, always follow some practical advices.","Cazzola, Mario; Ora, Josuel; Bianco, Andrea; Rogliani, Paola; Matera, Maria Gabriella",Respir Med,,91

Intestinal symptoms of COVID-19 are present in a significant number of patients, and include nausea, diarrhea, and viral RNA shedding in feces. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived intestinal organoids (HIOs) represent an inexhaustible cellular resource that could serve as a valuable tool to study SARS-CoV-2 as well as other enteric viruses that infect the intestinal epithelium. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 productively infects both proximally and distally patterned HIOs, leading to the release of infectious viral particles while stimulating a robust transcriptomic response, including a significant upregulation of interferon-related genes that appeared to be conserved across multiple epithelial cell types. These findings illuminate a potential inflammatory epithelial-specific signature that may contribute to both the multisystemic nature of COVID-19 as well as its highly variable clinical presentation.","Mithal, Aditya; Hume, Adam J; Lindstrom-Vautrin, Jonathan; Villacorta-Martin, Carlos; Olejnik, Judith; Bullitt, Esther; Hinds, Anne; Mühlberger, Elke; Mostoslavsky, Gustavo",Stem Cell Reports,,91

Korea has a unique experience that we had the first large outbreak during the early pandemic and could flatten the epidemic curve without lockdown. In this study, the effective reproductive numbers were calculated for the entire nation and Seoul (the capital city) Metropolitan Area from February 16-15 July, where 60% of the population reside. We compared the changes in population mobility data and reproductive number trends according to the changes in the government's nonpharmaceutical intervention strategy. The total daily mobility decreased when Korea had the first wave of a large outbreak in February-March 2020, which was mainly caused by the decrease of daily noncommuting mobility. However, daily commuting mobility from 16 February to 30 June 2020 was maintained at a similar level since there was no national lockdown for workers who commute between home and work. During the first half-year of 2020, Korea could control the outbreak to a manageable level without a significant decrease in daily public mobility.

We aimed to determine the correlation between changes in HKA or FFD and leg length in patients undergoing TKA, the combined effect of coronal and sagittal plane deformity correction on LLC, and the possibility of estimating LLC mathematically. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective radiographic evaluation of 242 knees, which had undergone primary unilateral TKA for advanced OA with varus and FFD. Full-length standing calibrated anteroposterior radiographs were used to measure the hip-knee-ankle axis (HKA) and functional leg length after adjusting for magnification. Clinical evaluation of FFD was done using a handheld goniometer. RESULTS: 224 knees (92.6%) showed increased limb length after TKA averaging 10.7 mm (SD 9.5 mm, P = .000). There was a significant correlation between the change in HKA and FFD from preoperatively to postoperatively with the amount of LLC (&#961; 0.326 and 0.346, respectively, P = .000). FFD improvement from preoperatively to postoperatively was 8.1° to 1° (P = .000), respectively. A linear relationship was established between LLC and changes in HKA and FFD, where 10° improvement in HKA would result in an LLC of nearly 4 mm, and 10° improvement in FFD would result in a LLC of nearly 8 mm. CONCLUSION: LLC may be substantial after correcting varus and FFD with unilateral TKA, it correlates with the change in HKA and FFD and can be mathematically estimated. CLINICAL TRIALS .

BACKGROUND: Nurses working in shifts are vulnerable to sleep disturbances. However, little is known about the influence of rotating day and night shift schedules and healthy lifestyle on nurses' daily sleep patterns. DESIGN: Descriptive correlational design. METHODS: Thirty-two hospital nurses working in shifts and 32 hospital nurses not working in shifts participated in data collection. Their sleep patterns were measured for six consecutive days using Fitbit Charge 3&#8482; , and information on alcohol consumption, exercise, and eating habits were assessed using a questionnaire. Data were analysed using repeated measures analysis of variance with post hoc Scheffe's test and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The study was conducted in accordance with the STROBE guideline. RESULTS: Overall, nurses working on rotating day and night shifts had significantly shorter total sleep time, longer sleep onset latency, and lower sleep efficiency than those not working in shifts. In particular, nurses working for 3 or 4 consecutive night shifts had significantly shorter total sleep time, lower sleep efficiency and longer sleep onset latency than those working for 0-2 consecutive night shifts. Rotating day and night shifts and alcohol consumption significantly influenced sleep efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: A work schedule of &#8805;3 consecutive night shifts and the habit of alcohol consumption before bed time influence nurses' sleep efficiency. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Given the poor sleep pattern among nurses working in shifts, particularly those working on &#8805;2 consecutive night shifts, it is necessary to develop an optimal shift schedule and a program to promote healthy lifestyle among hospital nurses.","Shin, Seunghwa; Kim, SuHyun",J. clin. nurs,,91

The results indicate that the addition reaction is under thermodynamic and not kinetic control and that the key factor determining the reaction stereoselectivity are the stereochemical constraints imposed by all substituents in the cyclohexane ring. The DFT results indicate that cyclohexylthiol should behave similarly to p-toluylthiol, the one actually employed, and tert-butylthiol should increase the ratio between isomers favoring the desired S configuration of the C5 atom. This work shows that DFT studies can be useful in the selection of a reactant to improve stereoselectivity of a chemical step.","Santos, Pedro Paulo; Veiros, Luís F",Tetrahedron,,91

442731,Phylodynamic analysis and evaluation of the balance between anthropic and environmental factors affecting IBV spreading among Italian poultry farms,2020,"Physical performance measures, including cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPXT), are widely used in geriatric practice and aging research. Theoretically, research participants and study personnel could get infected in the closed environment of the exercise laboratory by contact with respiratory droplets from an infected person, by breathing virus-laden aerosols, or by touching fomites. Older adults are at increased risk of developing more severe disease and of dying from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This special article offers guidance - informed by a synthesis of scientific data and recommendations of the CDC and WHO, - on procedures that can be implemented in exercise laboratories to minimize risk of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections. Most tests of physical function (e.g., gait speed, Short Physical Performance Battery) are not aerosol-generating and are associated with only a small increase in minute ventilation; in contrast, CPXT markedly increases minute ventilation and is potentially aerosol-generating. Researchers should evaluate the benefit-to-risk ratio of information gained from the laboratory assessment versus the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection. Risk mitigation strategies described here fall into four categories: personal hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment; standardized screening; reconfiguration of laboratory space; and optimization of laboratory ventilation. The proposed safety measures are not intended to replace institutional policy, state or federal guidelines; they may not apply to all settings and are expected to evolve as more definitive information becomes available. These practical measures to maximize protection against SARS-CoV2 infection can help maximize participant and staff safety, reduce anxiety, and facilitate protocol adherence, and study integrity.

444186,Lateral Gene Transfer Drives Metabolic Flexibility in the Anaerobic Methane-Oxidizing Archaeal Family Methanoperedenaceae,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Six of the most frequent dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) worldwide - SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17 - are caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the corresponding proteins. While the identification of the causative mutation has advanced knowledge on the pathogenesis of polyQ SCAs, effective therapeutics able to mitigate the severe clinical manifestation of these highly incapacitating disorders are not yet available. AREAS COVERED: This review provides a comprehensive and critical perspective on well-established and emerging therapeutic targets for polyQ SCAs; it aims to inspire prospective drug discovery efforts. EXPERT OPINION: The landscape of polyQ SCAs therapeutic targets and strategies includes (1) the mutant genes and proteins themselves, (2) enhancement of endogenous protein quality control responses, (3) abnormal protein-protein interactions of the mutant proteins, (4) disturbed neuronal function, (5) mitochondrial function, energy availability and oxidative stress, and (6) glial dysfunction, growth factor or hormone imbalances. Challenges include gaining a clearer definition of therapeutic targets for the drugs in clinical development, the discovery of novel drug-like molecules for challenging key targets, and the attainment of a stronger translation of preclinical findings to the clinic.","Neves-Carvalho, Andreia; Duarte-Silva, Sara; Teixeira-Castro, Andreia; Maciel, Patrícia",,,91

Highly active inhibitors could inhibit the normal circulation of the main protease to achieve therapeutic effects as anti-coronavirus agents. In the present research, 48 peptide compounds with SARS-CoV M-pro inhibition selected from the literature were used to establish robust Topomer CoMFA (q(2) = 0.743, r(2) = 0.938, and r(pred)(2) = 0.700) and HQSAR (q(2) = 0.774, r(2) = 0.955, and r(pred)(2) = 0.723) models. Structural modification information was used for designing new M-pro inhibitors. The high contribution-value descriptor generated by Topomer CoMFA was used to screen for the fragments that possess significant inhibitory activities from the ZINC drug database, and 24 new compounds with predicted high inhibitory activity at nanomolar concentration were designed by combining the high contribution value fragments. The molecular docking results further justified that these potential inhibitors could form hydrogen bonds with the residues of CYS145, GLN189, GLU166, HIS163, and GLY143 of target M-pro, which well explains their strong inhibitory effects. The molecular dynamics simulation results indicated that four highly active compounds could stably bond with SARS-CoV-2 M-pro and might be promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 M-pro candidates. Finally, all the newly designed compounds showed premium ADMET properties as per the predictions by the server in the public domain. This research work not only provides robust QSAR models as valuable screening tools for future anti-coronavirus drug development but also renders the newly designed SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors with activity at nanomolar concentration, which can be used for further characterization to obtain novel anti-coronavirus drugs for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.","Tong, J.

In patients with cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), difficulties also arise from the incomplete understanding of the intricate interplay between their routine treatment and pathogenesis of the novel virus. By referring to previous ICI-based investigations, we speculate that ICIs themselves are not linked to high-infection risks of respiratory diseases or inflammation-related adverse effects in patients with cancer. Moreover, ICI treatment may even enhance coronavirus clearance in some patients with malignant tumor by boosting antiviral T-cell responsiveness. However, the 'explosive' inflammation during COVID-19 in some ICI-treated patients with cancer was illustrated as exuberant immunopathological damage or even death. In case of the COVID-19 immunopathogenesis fueled by ICIs, we propose a regular monitor of pathogenic T-cell subsets and their exhaustion marker expression (eg, Th17 and interleukin (IL)-6-producing Th1 subsets with surface programmed death 1 expression) to guide the usage of ICI. Here we aimed to address these considerations, based on available literature and experience from our practice, that may assist with the decision-making of ICI administration during the pandemic.","Shen, Chen; Li, Qianru; Wei, Yongchang; Li, Yuting; Li, Jun; Tao, Juan",J. immunotherap. cancer,,91

During the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, advancement toward universal health coverage (UHC) will become more difficult for many countries, demonstrating that locally led priority setting is urgently needed to provide health services with appropriate financial protection to all. Because resources are limited and no national constituency can provide an unlimited number of services to their whole population in a sustainable manner, rationing and setting priorities for the selection of interventions to be included in a defined package of services is critical. In this Perspective, we discuss how packages of essential health services can be developed in resource-constrained settings, and detail how experts and the public can decide on principles and criteria, use a comprehensive array of analytical methods and choose which services to be provided free of charge. We illustrate these main steps while drawing on a recently conducted exercise of revising the national essential health services package in Ethiopia, which we compare with examples from other countries that have defined their essential benefits packages.

According to the World Health Organization, 3,232,062 global cases of COVID-19 were confirmed on April 30th with a mortality rate of 3.4%. Notably, the symptoms are almost similar to those of flu such as fever, cough, and fatigue. Unfortunately, the global rates of morbidity and mortality caused by this disease are more and still increasing on a daily basis. The rates for patients suffering from inflammatory diseases like diabetes, is even further, due to their susceptibility to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this review, we attempted to focus on diabetes to clarify the physiological and immunological characteristics of diabetics before and after the infection with COVID-19. We hope these conceptions could provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in COVID-19 susceptibility and increase the awareness of risk to motivate behavior changes in vulnerable people for enhancing the prevention. Up to now, the important role of immune responses, especially the innate ones, in the development of the worst signs in COVID-19 infection have been confirmed. Therefore, to better control patients with COVID-19, it is recommended to consider a history of chronic inflammatory diseases as well as the way of controlling immune response in these patients.","Rahmani-Kukia, Nasim; Abbasi, Ardeshir",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,91

Rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and variant strains is paramount for recovery from this pandemic. Conventional SARS-CoV-2 tests interrogate only limited regions of the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome, which are subjected to low specificity and miss the opportunity of detecting variant strains. In this work, we developed the first SARS-CoV-2 tiling array that captures the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome at single nucleotide resolution and offers the opportunity to detect point mutations. A thorough bioinformatics protocol of two base calling methods has been developed to accompany this array. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the tiling array, we genotyped all genomic positions of eight SARS-CoV-2 samples. Using high-throughput sequencing as the benchmark, we show that the tiling array had a genome-wide accuracy of at least 99.5%. From the tiling array analysis results, we identified the D614G mutation in the spike protein in four of the eight samples, suggesting the widespread distribution of this variant at the early stage of the outbreak in the United States. Two additional nonsynonymous mutations were identified in one sample in the nucleocapsid protein (P13L and S197L), which may complicate future vaccine development. With around $5 per array, supreme accuracy, and an ultrafast bioinformatics protocol, the SARS-CoV-2 tiling array makes an invaluable toolkit for combating current and future pandemics. Our SARS-CoV-2 tilting array is currently utilized by Molecular Vision, a CLIA-certified lab for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","Jiang, Limin; Guo, Yan; Yu, Hui; Hoff, Kendal; Ding, Xun; Zhou, Wei; Edwards, Jeremy",Brief. bioinform,,91

Methods: We utilized telehealth carts used for other purposes in the institution and the ED to allow the replacement of one physically present supervising attending physician with a virtual remote attending physician. This physician, working from home, can be virtually present for resident history and physicals with all patients in the supervised pod. Discussions about patient care, review of studies, and decision on final disposition can also be performed. Resident teaching can also be accomplished. Results: Our innovation represents a novel use of telemedicine capabilities which allows us to protect vulnerable faculty from infection during the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining appropriate EM resident supervision and patient care. We found some advantages of this process which allow us to more directly observe the initial resident assessment of the patient. The residents responded favorably to the degree of supervision and patient care that we can provide remotely. Conclusions: Our novel use telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed us to decrease the exposure of more vulnerable faculty while maintaining the ability of these faculty to continue to contribute to patient care and resident education. It is well accepted by our residents and seems to be a viable alternative to physical presence in the ED for at least one faculty member. This modality might also be utilized by an attending who fell ill and was not yet able to return to physical work.

We explored the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions on projected SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada. METHODS: We developed an age-structured agent-based model of the Canadian population simulating the impact of current and projected levels of public health interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Interventions included case detection and isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, physical distancing and community closures, evaluated alone and in combination. RESULTS: Without any interventions, 64.6% (95% credible interval [CrI] 63.9%-65.0%) of Canadians will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (total attack rate) and 3.6% (95% CrI 2.4%-3.8%) of those infected and symptomatic will die. If case detection and contact tracing continued at baseline levels without maintained physical distancing and reimplementation of restrictive measures, this combination brought the total attack rate to 56.1% (95% CrI 0.05%-57.1%), but it dropped to 0.4% (95% CrI 0.03%-23.5%) with enhanced case detection and contact tracing. Combining the latter scenario with maintained physical distancing reduced the total attack rate to 0.2% (95% CrI 0.03%-1.7%) and was the only scenario that consistently kept hospital and intensive care unit bed use under capacity, prevented nearly all deaths and eliminated the epidemic. Extending school closures had minimal effects but did reduce transmission in schools; however, extending closures of workplaces and mixed-age venues markedly reduced attack rates and usually or always eliminated the epidemic under any scenario. INTERPRETATION: Controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission will depend on enhancing and maintaining interventions at both the community and individual levels. Without such interventions, a resurgent epidemic will occur, with the risk of overwhelming our health care systems.","Ng, Victoria; Fazil, Aamir; Waddell, Lisa A; Bancej, Christina; Turgeon, Patricia; Otten, Ainsley; Atchessi, Nicole; Ogden, Nicholas H",CMAJ,,91

467337,Microscopic Manipulation of Ferroelectric Domains in SnSe Monolayers at Room Temperature,2020,"Following the outbreak of COVID-19, governments took unprecedented measures to curb the spread of the virus. Public participation in decisions regarding (the relaxation of) these measures has been notably absent, despite being recommended in the literature. Here, as one of the exceptions, we report the results of 30,000 citizens advising the government on eight different possibilities for relaxing lockdown measures in the Netherlands. By making use of the novel method Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE), participants were asked to recommend which out of the eight options they prefer to be relaxed. Participants received information regarding the societal impacts of each relaxation option, such as the impact of the option on the healthcare system. The results of the PVE informed policymakers about people's preferences regarding (the impacts of) the relaxation options. For instance, we established that participants assign an equal value to a reduction of 100 deaths among citizens younger than 70 years and a reduction of 168 deaths among citizens older than 70 years. We show how these preferences can be used to rank options in terms of desirability. Citizens advised to relax lockdown measures, but not to the point at which the healthcare system becomes heavily overloaded. We found wide support for prioritising the re-opening of contact professions. Conversely, participants disfavoured options to relax restrictions for specific groups of citizens as they found it important that decisions lead to ""unity"" and not to ""division"". 80% of the participants state that PVE is a good method to let citizens participate in government decision-making on relaxing lockdown measures. Participants felt that they could express a nuanced opinion, communicate arguments, and appreciated the opportunity to evaluate relaxation options in comparison to each other while being informed about the consequences of each option. This increased their awareness of the dilemmas the government faces.","Mouter, Niek; Hernandez, Jose Ignacio; Itten, Anatol Valerian",PLoS One,,91

Of 141 PD patients resident in Lombardy, we found 12 COVID-19 cases (8.5%), whose mean age and disease duration (65.5 and 6.3 years, respectively) were similar to controls. Changes in clinical features in the period January 2020 to April 2020 were compared with those of 36 PD controls matched for sex, age, and disease duration using the clinical impression of severity index for PD, the Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale Parts II and IV, and the nonmotor symptoms scale.

On the contrary, there is a concern that the public health interventions may increase the level of loneliness. Loneliness and social isolation are public health risks, closely associated with serious medical conditions. As COVID-19 is new to us today, little is known about emotional well-being among people with visual impairment during the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the knowledge gap, this study conducted phone interviews with a convenience sample of 31 people with visual impairment. The interview incorporated the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale (version 3) and the trait meta-mood scale (TMMS) to measure loneliness and emotional intelligence skills, respectively. This study found that people with visual impairment were vulnerable to the feeling of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and showed individual differences in emotional intelligence skills by different degrees of loneliness. Researchers and health professionals should consider offering adequate coping strategies to those with visual impairment amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Hyung Nam Sutharson Sam Jotham",British Journal of Visual Impairment,,91

477723,Oral Abstracts,2020,"Sindbis virus (SINV), a positive-sense single stranded RNA virus that causes mild symptoms in humans, is transmitted by mosquito bites. SINV reverse genetics have many implications, not only in understanding alphavirus transmission, replication cycle, and virus-host interactions, but also in biotechnology and biomedical applications. The rescue of SINV infectious particles is usually achieved by transfecting susceptible cells (BHK-21) with SINV-infectious mRNA genomes generated from cDNA constructed via in vitro translation (IVT). That procedure is time consuming, costly, and relies heavily on reagent quality. Here, we constructed a novel infectious SINV cDNA construct that expresses its genomic RNA in yeast cells controlled by galactose induction. Using spheroplasts made from this yeast, we established a robust polyethylene glycol-mediated yeast: BHK-21 fusion protocol to rescue infectious SINV particles. Our approach is timesaving and utilizes common lab reagents for SINV rescue. It could be a useful tool for the rescue of large single strand RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.","Ding, L.; Brown, D.

Positive thinking and resilience were identified as mediators between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) victimization experiences and mental health. METHOD: The sample included 384 from 4 universities in Wuhan, China. Four structured instruments were applied to the college students, including scale of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus victimization experience, scale of the positive thinking, scale of the resilience, and scale of the mental health. The responses were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Structural equation models were used to construct measurement and structural models. RESULTS: The findings confirmed that the 2019-nCoV victimization experience was a negative predictor of mental health; positive thinking and resilience were strong mediators between 2019-nCoV victimization experience and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that a complete model was significant because positive thinking compensated for resilience. Notably, these 2 strong mediators will vastly resist the negative influences of 2019-nCoV victimization experience on mental health in Wuhan's college students until the end of the pandemic.

Concise, persuasive messaging is crucial, particularly given substantial levels of vaccine hesitancy in the UK. Our aim was to test which types of written information about COVID-19 vaccination, in addition to a statement of efficacy and safety, might increase vaccine acceptance. METHODS: For this single-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we aimed to recruit 15 000 adults in the UK, who were quota sampled to be representative. Participants were randomly assigned equally across ten information conditions stratified by level of vaccine acceptance (willing, doubtful, or strongly hesitant). The control information condition comprised the safety and effectiveness statement taken from the UK National Health Service website; the remaining conditions addressed collective benefit, personal benefit, seriousness of the pandemic, and safety concerns. After online provision of vaccination information, participants completed the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (outcome measure; score range 7-35) and the Oxford Vaccine Confidence and Complacency Scale (mediation measure). The primary outcome was willingness to be vaccinated. Participants were analysed in the groups they were allocated. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. The study was registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN37254291. FINDINGS: From Jan 19 to Feb 5, 2021, 15 014 adults were recruited. Vaccine hesitancy had reduced from 26·9% the previous year to 16·9%, so recruitment was extended to Feb 18 to recruit 3841 additional vaccine-hesitant adults. 12 463 (66·1%) participants were classified as willing, 2932 (15·6%) as doubtful, and 3460 (18·4%) as strongly hesitant (ie, report that they will avoid being vaccinated for as long as possible or will never get vaccinated). Information conditions did not alter COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in those willing or doubtful (adjusted p values >0·70). In those strongly hesitant, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was reduced, in comparison to the control condition, by personal benefit information (mean difference -1·49, 95% CI -2·16 to -0·82; adjusted p=0·0015), directly addressing safety concerns about speed of development (-0·91, -1·58 to -0·23; adjusted p=0·0261), and a combination of all information (-0·86, -1·53 to -0·18; adjusted p=0·0313). In those strongly hesitant, provision of personal benefit information reduced hesitancy to a greater extent than provision of information on the collective benefit of not personally getting ill (-0·97, 95% CI -1·64 to -0·30; adjusted p=0·0165) or the collective benefit of not transmitting the virus (-1·01, -1·68 to -0·35; adjusted p=0·0150). Ethnicity and gender were found to moderate information condition outcomes. INTERPRETATION: In the approximately 10% of the population who are strongly hesitant about COVID-19 vaccines, provision of information on personal benefit reduces hesitancy to a greater extent than information on collective benefits. Where perception of risk from vaccines is most salient, decision making becomes centred on the personal. As such, messaging that stresses the counterbalancing personal benefits is likely to prove most effective. The messaging from this study could be used in public health communications. Going forwards, the study highlights the need for future health campaigns to engage with the public on the terrain that is most salient to them.

484155,Sit less and move more for cardiovascular health: emerging insights and opportunities,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created a global pandemic resulting in over 1 million deaths worldwide. In the Department of Defense (DoD), over 129,000 personnel (civilians, dependents, and active duty) have been infected with the virus to date. Rapid estimations of transmission and mutational patterns of virus outbreaks can be accomplished using whole-genome viral sequencing. Deriving interpretable and actionable results from pathogen sequence data is accomplished by the construction of phylogenetic trees (from local and global virus sequences) and by the creation of protein maps, to visualize and predict the effects of structural protein amino acid mutations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a sequencing and bioinformatics workflow for molecular epidemiological SARS-CoV-2 surveillance using excess clinical specimens collected under an institutional review board exempt protocol at Joint Base San Antonio, Lackland AFB. This workflow includes viral RNA isolation, viral load quantification, tiling-based next-generation sequencing, sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, and data visualization via phylogenetic trees and protein mapping. RESULTS: Sequencing of 37 clinical specimens collected at JBSA/Lackland revealed that by June 2020, SAR-CoV-2 strains carrying the 614G mutation were the predominant cause of local coronavirus disease 2019 infections. We identified 109 nucleotide changes in the coding region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (which lead to 63 unique, non-synonymous amino acid mutations), one mutation in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), and two mutations in the 3'UTR. Furthermore, we identified and mapped six additional spike protein amino acid changes-information which could potentially aid vaccine design. CONCLUSION: The workflow presented here is designed to enable DoD public health officials to track viral evolution and conduct near real-time evaluation of future outbreaks. The generation of molecular epidemiological sequence data is critical for the development of disease intervention strategies-most notably, vaccine design. Overall, we present a streamlined sequencing and bioinformatics methodology aimed at improving long-term readiness efforts in the DoD.","Nazario-Toole, Ashley E; Xia, Hui; Gibbons, Thomas F",Mil. med,,91

Our proposed model is validated on the eICU collaborate database. We achieved a high AUROC performance (80-83%) and significantly improved AUCPR 4% on Day 5 since ICU admission, compared to the state-of-art prediction models.

However, the molecular mechanisms and prognostic value of GINS2 in breast cancer remain unknown. The present study used; BC-GenExMiner, COSMIC, UCSC Xena, The Human Protein Atlas, GEPIA, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, TIMER and Oncomine, in order to investigate gene expression, co-expression, clinical parameters and mutations in GINS2 in patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, the present study assessed the prognostic value of GINS2 in patients with breast cancer via the Kaplan-Meier plotter database. The results of the present study demonstrated that the mRNA levels of GINS2 were significantly higher in breast cancer tissue compared with normal tissue. In addition, high mRNA expression levels of GINS2 were associated with high Scarff-Bloom-Richardson status grades, a basal-like status and age (&#8804;51 years); however, it was not associated with lymph node metastasis. The survival analysis revealed that increased GINS2 mRNA levels were associated with a worse prognosis for relapse-free survival in all patients with breast cancer, particularly in those with estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-positive subtypes. In addition, a positive association between the GINS2, CENPM and MCM4 genes was confirmed. The results of the present study suggest that GINS2 could be used as a potential prognostic biomarker for breast cancer. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to confirm the effects of GINS2 on the pathogenesis and development of patients with breast cancer.","Yu, Shibo; Zhu, Lizhe; Xie, Peiling; Jiang, Siyuan; Wang, Ke; Liu, Yang; He, Jianjun; Ren, Yu",Oncol Lett,,91

488446,Transcriptome and Coronavirus: New Hope and Therapy,,"A better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to a more effective management of patients with COVID-19. Coagulation dysfunction is a key pathogenetic element of this disease as well as a challenge for practitioners. Marked inflammatory process found in severe forms of COVID-19, the complement activation, the cytokine storm, and disruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are involved in the onset of thrombotic microangiopathy and large vessel coagulopathy. Virus-induced procoagulant activity occurs at the systemic level. Intravascular microthrombi disrupt vascularization in various tissues and organs, contributing to the occurrence of multiorgan failure and explain the higher morbidity and all-cause mortality of patients. It is estimated that almost 20% of patients with COVID-19 have significant coagulation disorders, and about a quarter of those hospitalized in intensive care units are prone to develop thrombosis events under prophylactic anticoagulant treatment. Some of patients who have been immunized after healing from the SARS-CoV-2 infection have a hypercoagulable state and are prone to develop thrombosis. Hypercoagulability is supported by thrombelastographic analysis: patients have an acceleration of the propagation phase of blood clot formation and higher clot strength. Markers of coagulation dysfunction in SARS-CoV2 are: decreased platelet count, increased INR, presence of fibrin degradation products, and especially higher plasma levels of D-dimers, which predict unfavorable outcome in these patients. Age, pre-existing diseases and associated risk factors, together with careful monitoring of clinical evolution and laboratory parameters allow the choice of the best personalized prophylactic or curative anticoagulant treatment.","Mihaila, Romeo Gabriel; Dragos Mihaila, Marius",Biomed. pap. med.

Canadians have valid concerns about delays related to their changing needs as millions move their purchases from food services to retail groceries, but they should not worry about our overall supply of calories. Despite some shortages, the supply chains for flour and cooking oil are not likely to be blocked for an extended period. Learning from the coordinated needs of the BSE crisis in the beef sector, the federal government developed Value Chain Roundtables in 2003, including one for grains. These roundtables bring together government and industry to tackle the issues that face each sector's major needs, including food safety, transportation infrastructure, and market access. A working group made up of various roundtable members was set up specifically to deal with COVID-19-related supply chain challenges. This gives both industry and government a venue to attack any choke point or breakdown within our agrifood supply chains—the exact response we need at this time. A preestablished forum for discussion of critical issues at these roundtables, assuming the right players are active and present, cannot hurt, but it would useful for future planners and researchers if the federal government could clarify any positive impact they have.","Brewin, Derek Gerald",Can.

By July 10, 2020, 397,577 individuals had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR), of whom 110,986 were positive, a positivity cumulative rate of 27.9% (95% CI 27.8-28.1%). As of July 5, case severity rate, based on World Health Organization (WHO) severity classification, was 3.4% and case fatality rate was 1.4 per 1,000 persons. Age was by far the strongest predictor of severe, critical, or fatal infection. PCR positivity of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs in a national community survey (May 6-7) including 1,307 participants was 14.9% (95% CI 11.5-19.0%); 58.5% of those testing positive were asymptomatic. Across 448 ad-hoc testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas including 26,715 individuals, pooled mean PCR positivity was 15.6% (95% CI 13.7-17.7%). SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was 24.0% (95% CI 23.3-24.6%) in 32,970 residual clinical blood specimens. Antibody prevalence was only 47.3% (95% CI 46.2-48.5%) in those who had at least one PCR positive result, but 91.3% (95% CI 89.5-92.9%) among those who were PCR positive > 3 weeks before serology testing. Qatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that is rapidly declining, apparently due to growing immunity levels in the population.","Abu-Raddad, Laith J; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Ayoub, Houssein H; Al Kanaani, Zaina; Al Khal, Abdullatif; Al Kuwari, Einas; Butt, Adeel A; Coyle, Peter; Jeremijenko, Andrew; Kaleeckal, Anvar Hassan; Latif, Ali Nizar; Owen, Robert C; Rahim, Hanan F Abdul; Al Abdulla, Samya A; Al Kuwari, Mohamed G; Kandy, Mujeeb C; Saeb, Hatoun; Ahmed, Shazia Nadeem N; Al Romaihi, Hamad Eid; Bansal, Devendra; Dalton, Louise; Al-Thani, Mohamed H; Bertollini, Roberto",Sci Rep,,91

495844,Opening Up New Supply Chains,2020,"As a recent global health emergency, the quick and reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Thus, many artificial intelligence (AI)-base methods are proposed for COVID-19 chest CT (computed tomography) image analysis. However, there are very limited COVID-19 chest CT images publicly available to evaluate those deep neural networks. On the other hand, a huge amount of CT images from lung cancer are publicly available. To build a reliable deep learning model trained and tested with a larger scale dataset, the proposed model builds a public COVID-19 CT dataset, containing 1186 CT images synthesized from lung cancer CT images using CycleGAN. Additionally, various deep learning models are tested with synthesized or real chest CT images for COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 classification. In comparison, all models achieve excellent results (over than 90%) in accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for both synthesized and real COVID-19 CT images, demonstrating the reliable of the synthesized dataset. The public dataset and deep learning models can facilitate the development of accurate and efficient diagnostic testing for COVID-19.","Jiang, Hao; Tang, Shiming; Liu, Weihuang; Zhang, Yang",,,91

This study used the nationwide cohort of South Korea to develop a machine learning model to predict prognosis based on sociodemographic and medical information. Of 10,237 COVID-19 patients, 228 (2.2%) died, 7772 (75.9%) recovered, and 2237 (21.9%) were still in isolation or being treated at the last follow-up (April 16, 2020). The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that age > 70, male sex, moderate or severe disability, the presence of symptoms, nursing home residence, and comorbidities of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic lung disease, or asthma were significantly associated with increased risk of mortality (p &#8804; 0.047). For machine learning, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), linear support vector machine (SVM), SVM with radial basis function kernel, random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors were tested. In prediction of mortality, LASSO and linear SVM demonstrated high sensitivities (90.7% [95% confidence interval: 83.3, 97.3] and 92.0% [85.9, 98.1], respectively) and specificities (91.4% [90.3, 92.5] and 91.8%, [90.7, 92.9], respectively) while maintaining high specificities > 90%, as well as high area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (0.963 [0.946, 0.979] and 0.962 [0.945, 0.979], respectively). The most significant predictors for LASSO included old age and preexisting DM or cancer; for RF they were old age, infection route (cluster infection or infection from personal contact), and underlying hypertension. The proposed prediction model may be helpful for the quick triage of patients without having to wait for the results of additional tests such as laboratory or radiologic studies, during a pandemic when limited medical resources must be wisely allocated without hesitation.","An, Chansik; Lim, Hyunsun; Kim, Dong-Wook; Chang, Jung Hyun; Choi, Yoon Jung; Kim, Seong Woo",Sci Rep,,91

501049,COVID-19: The Effect of Host Genetic Variations on Host-Virus Interactions,2020,"BACKGROUND: The use of dental handpieces produces aerosols containing microbial agents, bacteria, and viruses representing a high-risk situation for airborne cross infections. The aim of this study was to map and quantify the biological contamination of a dental operatory environment using a biological tracer. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans suspension was infused into the mouth of a manikin, and an operator performed standardized dental procedures using an air turbine, a contra-angle handpiece, or an ultrasonic scaler. The presence of the tracer was measured at 90 sites on the dental unit and the surrounding surfaces of the operatory environment. RESULTS: All tested instruments spread the tracer over the entire dental unit and the surrounding environment, including the walls and ceiling. The pattern and degree of contamination were related to the distance from the infection source. The maximum distance of tracer detection was 360 centimeters for air turbine, 300 cm for contra-angle handpiece, and 240 cm for ultrasonic scaler. No surface of the operative environment was free from the tracer after the use of the air turbine. CONCLUSIONS: Attention should be paid to minimize or avoid the use of rotary and ultrasonic instruments when concerns for the airborne spreading of pandemic disease agents are present. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study supports the recommendations of dental associations to avoid treatments generating aerosols, especially during pandemic periods. Guidelines for the management of dental procedures involving aerosols, as well as methods for the modification of aerosols aimed to inactivate the infective agent, are urgently needed.","Ionescu, Andrei C; Cagetti, Maria G; Ferracane, Jack L; Garcia-Godoy, Franklin; Brambilla, Eugenio",J Am Dent Assoc,,91
501438,Perspectives for the use of N-acetylcysteine as a candidate drug to treat COVID-19,2020,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has had an impact on healthcare systems around the world with 3 million people contracting the disease and 208,000 cases resulting in death as of this writing. Information regarding coronavirus infection in pregnancy is still limited. Objective: This study aimed to describe the clinical course of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 in hospitalized pregnant women with positive laboratory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Study Design: This is a cohort study of pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized at 12 US institutions between March 5, 2020, and April 20, 2020. Severe disease was defined according to published criteria as patient-reported dyspnea, respiratory rate >30 per minute, blood oxygen saturation &#8804;93% on room air, ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen <300 mm Hg, or lung infiltrates >50% within 24-48 hours on chest imaging. Critical disease was defined as respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Women were excluded from the study if they had presumed coronavirus disease 2019, but laboratory testing was negative. The primary outcome was median duration from hospital admission to discharge. Secondary outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and timing of delivery. The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms. Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported. Results: Of 64 hospitalized pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019, 44 (69%) had severe disease, and 20 (31%) had critical disease. The following preexisting comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had cardiac disease, and the mean body mass index was 34 kg/m2. Gestational age was at a mean of 29±6 weeks at symptom onset and a mean of 30±6 weeks at hospital admission, with a median disease day 7 since first symptoms. Most women (81%) were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 7% of women with severe disease and 65% of women with critical disease received remdesivir. All women with critical disease received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days [severe group] and 10.5 days [critical group]; P=.01). Intubation was usually performed around day 9 on patients who required it, and peak respiratory support for women with severe disease was performed on day 8. In women with critical disease, prone positioning was required in 20% of cases, the rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome was 70%, and reintubation was necessary in 20%. There was 1 case of maternal cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal death. Thirty-two of 64 (50%) women with coronavirus disease 2019 in this cohort delivered during their hospitalization (34% [severe group] and 85% [critical group]). Furthermore, 15 of 17 (88%) pregnant women with critical coronavirus disease 2019 delivered preterm during their disease course, with 16 of 17 (94%) pregnant women giving birth through cesarean delivery; overall, 15 of 20 (75%) women with critical disease delivered preterm. There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths or cases of vertical transmission. Conclusion: In pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, admission into the hospital typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 [severe group] vs 12 [critical group]). Women with critical disease had a high rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and there was 1 case of cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal mortality. Hospitalization of pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 resulted in delivery during the clinical course of the disease in 50% of this cohort, usually in the third trimester. There were no perinatal deaths in this cohort.","Pierce-Williams, Rebecca A M; Burd, Julia; Felder, Laura; Khoury, Rasha; Bernstein, Peter S; Avila, Karina; Penfield, Christina A; Roman, Ashley S; DeBolt, Chelsea A; Stone, Joanne L; Bianco, Angela; Kern-Goldberger, Adina R; Hirshberg, Adi; Srinivas, Sindhu K; Jayakumaran, Jenani S; Brandt, Justin S; Anastasio, Hannah; Birsner, Meredith; O039,; Brien, Devon S; Sedev, Harish M; Dolin, Cara D; Schnettler, William T; Suhag, Anju; Ahluwalia, Shabani; Navathe, Reshama S; Khalifeh, Adeeb; Anderson, Kathryn; Berghella, Vincenzo",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,91
502164,Humidity and Deposition Solution Play a Critical Role in Virus Inactivation by Heat Treatment of N95 Respirators,2020,"Hypertension is a critical comorbidity for progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). To facilitate development of novel therapeutic interventions with the potential to control disease progression, there is a need to establish translational animal models that predict treatment effects in human DKD. The present study aimed to characterize renal disease and outcomes of standard of medical care in a mouse model of advanced DKD facilitated by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated renin overexpression in uninephrectomized (UNx) db/db mice. Five weeks after single AAV administration and four weeks after UNx, female db/db UNx-ReninAAV mice received (PO, QD) vehicle, lisinopril (40 mg/kg), empagliflozin (20 mg/kg) or combination treatment for 12 weeks (n=17 per group). Untreated db/+ mice (n=8) and vehicle-dosed db/db UNx-LacZAAV mice (n=17) served as controls. Endpoints included plasma, urine and histomorphometric markers of kidney disease. Total glomerular numbers and individual glomerular volume was evaluated by whole-kidney 3D imaging analysis. db/db UNx-ReninAAV mice developed hallmarks of progressive DKD characterized by severe albuminuria, advanced glomerulosclerosis and glomerular hypertrophy. Lisinopril significantly improved albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury and inflammation. While empagliflozin alone had no therapeutic effect on renal endpoints, lisinopril and empagliflozin exerted synergistic effects on renal outcomes. In conclusion, the db/db UNx-ReninAAV mouse demonstrates good clinical translatability with respect to the physiological and histological hallmarks of progressive DKD. Efficacy of standard of care to control hypertension and hyperglycemia provides proof-of-concept for testing novel drug therapies in the model.","Østergaard, Mette Viberg; Secher, Thomas; Christensen, Michael; Salinas, Casper Gravesen; Roostalu, Urmas; Skytte, Jacob Lercke; Rune, Ida; Hansen, Henrik H; Jelsing, Jacob; Vrang, Niels; Fink, Lisbeth Nielsen","Am. j. physiol., Renal fluid electrolyte physiol",,91

503621,Yeasts Associated with Various Amazonian Native Fruits,2020,"BACKGROUND: Basic studies suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can affect chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), but there is unclear real-world evidence regarding the association of underlying CRS with the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether CRS is associated with increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. METHODS: Altogether, 219,959 adult patients who tested for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea from January 1 to May 15, 2020 (excluding self-referral) were identified in this nested case-control study with propensity score matching. Data on SARS-CoV-2 test results and COVID-19 worsened outcomes (ie, the need for oxygen therapy, intensive care, or mechanical ventilation, and death) were obtained from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea. RESULTS: In this matched cohort, 380 of 12,217 patients with CRS (3.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared with 310 patients without CRS (2.5%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.42). Moreover, 60 of 286 COVID-19 patients with CRS (21.0%) had severe COVID-19 outcomes, compared with 38 without CRS (13.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.71). Subgroup analysis identified that CRS patients with an absence of nasal polyps, prior intranasal corticosteroid use, or nonatopic type had a greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CRS, prior intranasal corticosteroid use, the absence of nasal polyps, or nonatopic type was associated with increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 in the Korean nationwide cohort. Clinicians should be cautious in determining prognosis and care for patients with CRS amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Seung Won; Kim, So Young; Moon, Sung Yong; Yang, Jee Myung; Ha, Eun Kyo; Jee, Hye Mi; Shin, Jae Il; Cho, Seong Ho; Yon, Dong Keon; Suh, Dong In",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,,91
503970,How can clinicians counter viral misinformation?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate the mediating role of worsening sleep quality in the association of the incidence of physical inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high computer/tablet use with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. METHODS: Data of 45,161 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150 min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; &#8805;4 h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; &#8805;4 h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. RESULTS: The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%). CONCLUSION: The association of the incidence of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors with mental health indicators is partly mediated by worsening sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.","Werneck, André O; Silva, Danilo R; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Lima, Margareth G; Souza-Júnior, Paulo R B; Azevedo, Luiz O; Barros, Marilisa B A; Szwarcwald, Célia L",Sleep Med,,91

512448,Doctor at Your Fingertips: An Exploration of Digital Visits from Stakeholders' Perspectives,2020,"Background: COPD patients suffer from respiratory symptoms and limitations in daily life. We aimed to characterize the impact of disease on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being in COPD outpatients. Methods: We conducted a national, cross-sectional study among pulmonologists and general practitioners (GPs). The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C) was used. Inclusion criteria were a physician's diagnosis of COPD and age &#8805;40 years. Subjects with a history of lung surgery, lung cancer or COPD exacerbation within the last four weeks were excluded. Results: Sixty-seven pulmonologists and 6 GPs enrolled 1175 COPD patients. Two hundred forty-eight of those did not fulfill GOLD criteria for COPD (FEV1/FVC <0.7) and 77 were excluded due to missing data. Finally, 850 patients (62.8% men; mean age 66.2 ± 0.3 (SE) years; mean FEV1%pred. 51.5 ± 0.6 (SE)) were analyzed. Last year, 55.4% reported at least one exacerbation, and 12.7% were hospitalized for COPD exacerbation. Mean SGRQ-C total score was 43.1 ± 0.83 (SE) and mean component scores for symptoms, activity and impacts were 55.6, 55.4 and 30.5, respectively. Half of the patients (50.3%) reported not being able to do any sports and 78.7% stated that their respiratory symptoms did not allow them doing anything they would like to do. In patients with less severe COPD (FEV1pred &#8805;50% and non-frequent exacerbations), global health status was overrated, ie, estimated as better by the physician than by the patient, while it was underrated in more severe COPD. Conclusion: In Austria, the burden of disease in COPD outpatients tends to be underestimated in patients with milder airway obstruction and less exacerbations and overestimated in patients with more severe airway obstruction and frequent exacerbations. Our finding suggests that validated assessment of global health status might decrease these differences of perception.","Horner, Andreas; Burghuber, Otto C; Hartl, Sylvia; Studnicka, Michael; Merkle, Monika; Olschewski, Horst; Kaiser, Bernhard; Wallner, Eva Maria; Lamprecht, Bernd",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,,91

515274,Web resources facilitate drug discovery in treatment of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, restrictions to elective surgeries were implemented nationwide. AIMS: To investigate the response to these restrictions in elective gynaecological and In vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedures during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed the Medicare Item Reports for the number of elective gynaecological (labioplasty, vulvoplasty; prolapse and continence; operative hysteroscopy; hysterectomy; fertility) and IVF procedures claimed in Australia between January-June 2020 and compared these to January-June 2019. RESULTS: The number of included gynaecological and IVF procedures performed in January-June 2020 decreased by -13.71% and -12.56%, respectively, compared to January-June 2019. The greatest reductions were in May 2020 (gynaecology -43.71%; IVF -51.63% compared to May 2019), while April 2020 reported decreases of -37.69% and -31.42% in gynaecological and IVF procedures, respectively. In April 2020, 1963 IVF cycle initiations (-45.20% compared to April 2019), 2453 oocyte retrievals (-26.99%) and 3136 embryo transfers (-22.95%) were billed. The procedures with greatest paired monthly decrease were prolapse and continence surgeries in April (676 procedures; -51.85%) and May 2020 (704 procedures; -60.05%), and oocyte retrievals in May 2020 (1637 procedures; -56.70%). CONCLUSIONS: While we observed a decrease in procedural volumes, elective gynaecological and IVF procedures continued in considerable numbers during the restricted timeframes. In the event of future overwhelming biological threat, careful consideration must be given to more effective measures of limiting access for non-emergency procedures to conserve essential resources and reduce risk to both the public and healthcare staff.","Alonso, Anais; Deans, Rebecca; Nesbitt-Hawes, Erin; Yazdani, Anusch; McCormack, Lalla; Koh, Yi Ying; Abbott, Jason",Aust.

The natural course of disease offers us separate windows of specific time intervals to administer either antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy. Instituting the right attack at the right time would maximize the benefit of treatment.

520500,Research progress of coronavirus and related drugs,2020,"BACKGROUND: Over the past 20 years, the development of regional ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) care systems has led to remarkable progress in achieving timely coronary reperfusion with attendant improvement in clinical outcomes, including survival. Despite this progress, contemporary STEMI care does not consistently meet the national guideline-recommended goals, which offers an opportunity for further improvement in STEMI outcomes. The lack of single, comprehensive, national STEMI registry complicates our ability to improve STEMI outcomes in particular for high-risk STEMI subsets such as cardiac arrest (CA) and/or cardiogenic shock (CS). OBJECTIVES: To address this need, the Midwest STEMI Consortium (MSC) was created as a collaboration of 4 large, regional STEMI care systems to provide a comprehensive, multicenter, and prospective STEMI registry without any exclusionary criteria. METHODS: The MSC is a collaboration of 4 large, regional STEMI care systems: Iowa Heart Center in Des Moines, IA; Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation in Minneapolis, MN; Prairie Heart Institute in Springfield, IL; and The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, OH. Each has similar standardized STEMI protocol and together include 6 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-capable hospitals and over 100 non-PCI-capable hospitals. Each center had a prospective database that was transferred to a data coordinating center to create the multicenter database. The comprehensive database includes traditional risk factors, cardiovascular history, medications, time to treatment data, detailed angiographic characteristics, and short- and long-term clinical outcomes up to 5-year for myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Ten-year mortality rates were assessed by using national death index. RESULTS: Currently, the comprehensive database (03/2003-01/2020) includes 14,911 consecutive STEMI patients with mean age of 62.3 ± 13.6 years, female gender (29%), and left anterior descending artery as the culprit vessel (34%). High risk features included: Age >75 years (19%), left ventricular ejection fraction <35% (15%), CA (10%), and CS (8%). CONCLUSION: This collaboration of 4 large, regional STEMI care systems with broad entry criteria including high-risk STEMI subsets such as CA and/or CS provides a unique platform to conduct clinical research studies to optimize STEMI care.","Yildiz, Mehmet; Sharkey, Scott; Aguirre, Frank V; Tannenbaum, Mark; Garberich, Ross; Smith, Timothy D; Shivapour, Daniel; Schmidt, Christian W; Pacheco-Coronado, Roberto; Rohm, Heather S; Chambers, Jenny; Coulson, Teresa; Garcia, Santiago; Henry, Timothy D",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,,91

521605,Skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis - it turns out we still know very little,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing applications have received a lot of public attention. The ongoing debate highlights the challenges of the adoption of data-driven innovation. We reflect on how to ensure an appropriate level of protection of individual data and maximize public health benefits derivable from the collected data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze available COVID-19 contact tracing applications and verify to what extent public health interests and data privacy standards can be fulfilled simultaneously in the process of the adoption of digital health technologies. METHODS: A systematic review of Pubmed, Medbase, and grey literature was performed to identify available contact tracing applications. Two checklists were developed to evaluate (1) the applications' compliance with data privacy standards and (2) their fulfillment of public health interests. Based on both checklists, a scorecard with a selected set of minimum requirements was created with the goal to estimate whether the balance between the objective of data privacy and public health interests can be achieved to ensure the broad adoption of digital technologies. RESULTS: Overall, 21 contact tracing applications were reviewed. In total, 11 criteria were defined to assess the usefulness of each digital technology for public health interests. The most frequently installed features related to contact alerting and governmental accountability. The least frequent feature was the availability of a system of medical or organizational support. Only one app provided a threshold for population coverage needed for the digital solution to be effective. In total, 12 criteria were used to assess the compliance of contact tracing applications with data privacy regulations. Explicit user consent, voluntary use, and anonymization techniques were among the most frequently fulfilled criteria. What mostly lacked were information about personal data breach and data gathered from children. The balance between standards of data protection and public health benefits was achieved best by COVIDSafe and worst by Alipay Health Code. CONCLUSIONS: Contact tracing applications with high levels of compliance with standards of data privacy tend to fulfill public health interests to a limited extent. Simultaneously, digital technologies with a lower level of data privacy protection allow for more data collection. Overall, the review shows that a consistent number of applications appears to comply with standards of data privacy, while their usefulness from the public health perspective can still be maximized.","Kolasa, Katarzyna; Mazzi, Francesca; Leszczuk-Czubkowska, Ewa; Zrubka, Zsombor; Péntek, Márta",,,91

522154,The impact of coronavirus in Brazil: politics and the pandemic,2020,"We studied the possible role of the subways in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City during late February and March 2020. Data on cases and hospitalizations, along with phylogenetic analyses of viral isolates, demonstrate rapid community transmission throughout all five boroughs within days. The near collapse of subway ridership during the second week of March was followed within 1-2 weeks by the flattening of COVID-19 incidence curve. We observed persistently high entry into stations located along the subway line serving a principal hotspot of infection in Queens. We used smartphone tracking data to estimate the volume of subway visits originating from each zip code tabulation area (ZCTA). Across ZCTAs, the estimated volume of subway visits on March 16 was strongly predictive of subsequent COVID-19 incidence during April 1-8. In a spatial analysis, we distinguished between the conventional notion of geographic contiguity and a novel notion of contiguity along subway lines. We found that the March 16 subway-visit volume in subway-contiguous ZCTAs had an increasing effect on COVID-19 incidence during April 1-8 as we enlarged the radius of influence up to 5 connected subway stops. By contrast, the March 31 cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in geographically-contiguous ZCTAs had an increasing effect on subsequent COVID-19 incidence as we expanded the radius up to 3 connected ZCTAs. The combined evidence points to the initial citywide dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 via a subway-based network, followed by percolation of new infections within local hotspots.","Harris, Jeffrey E",,,91
524103,Immunopeptidomics for next-generation bacterial vaccine development,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To study whether D-dimer daily continuous tendency could predict the short-term prognosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODES: According to the short-term prognosis, 81 COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups, one of worse prognosis (Group W) and the other of better prognosis (Group B). The slope of D-dimer linear regression during hospitalization (SLOPE) was calculated as an indicator of D-dimer daily continuous tendency. The SLOPE difference between Group W and Group B was compared. The difference between the discharge results and the 3-month follow-up results was also compared. COX regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between SLOPE and short-term prognosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 16 patients in Group W and 65 patients in Group B. Group W had more critical proportion (pâ< â0.0001), indicating that the symptoms of its patients were more severe during hospitalization. ARDS, the most visible cause of worse prognosis, accounted for up to 68.75%, and many symptoms merged and resulted in worse prognosis. The D-dimer levels of Group W not only were significantly higher (pâ< â0.0001), but also showed an increasing trend. In addition, the D-dimer levels at discharge were significantly higher than those at follow-up (pâ=â0.0261), and the mean difference was as high as 0.7474. SLOPE significantly correlated with the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 independently (RR: 1.687, 95% CI: 1.345-2.116, Pâ< â0.0001). The worst prognosis occurred most likely during the first month after COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Our study found that D-dimer daily continuous tendency independently correlates with worse prognosis and can be used as an independent predictor of the short-term prognosis for COVID-19.","Xing, Yinting; Yang, Wei; Jin, Yingyu; Wang, Chao; Guan, Xiuru",,,91
524104,Immunopeptidomics for next-generation bacterial vaccine development,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses an imminent threat to humanity, especially to the elderly. The molecular mechanisms underpinning the age-dependent disparity for disease progression is not clear. COVID-19 is both a respiratory and a vascular disease in severe patients. The damage endothelial system provides a good explanation for the various complications seen in COVID-19 patients. These observations lead us to suspect that endothelial cells are a barrier that must be breached before progression to severe disease. Endothelial intracellular defences are largely dependent of the activation of the interferon (IFN) system. Nevertheless, low type I and III IFNs are generally observed in COVID-19 patients suggesting that other intracellular viral defence systems are also activated to protect the young. Intriguingly, Nitric oxide (NO), which is the main intracellular antiviral defence, has been shown to inhibit a wide array of viruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Additionally, the increased risk of death with diseases that have underlying endothelial dysfunction suggest that endothelial NOS-derived nitric oxide could be the main defence mechanism. NO decreases dramatically in the elderly, the hyperglycaemic and the patients with low levels of vitamin D. However, eNOS derived NO occurs at low levels, unless it is during inflammation and co-stimulated by bradykinin. Regrettably, the bradykinin-induced vasodilation also progressively declines with age, thereby decreasing anti-viral NO production as well. Intriguingly, the inverse correlation between the percentage of WT eNOS haplotype and death per 100K population could potentially explain the disparity of COVID-19 mortality between Asian and non-Asian countries. These changes with age, low bradykinin and NO, may be the fundamental reasons that intracellular innate immunity declines with age leading to more severe COVID-19 complications.","Guan, Shou Ping; Seet, Raymond Chee Seong; Kennedy, Brian K",Ageing Res Rev,,91

This report indicates that sitting without adverse events is possible in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia during deep sedation with muscle relaxation. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 65-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus, lacunar infarction, and Parkinson's disease was admitted to a local hospital for pneumonia due to COVID-19. After admission, the patient was managed on a ventilator under deep sedation with muscle relaxants and sedatives. Twelve days after admission, the patient was transferred to our hospital due to his worsening respiratory status. DIAGNOSIS: Pneumonia due to COVID-19 was diagnosed using a polymerase chain reaction-dependent method. INTERVENTIONS: The day following transfer, a physical therapist started passive range of motion training and sitting. OUTCOMES: The period spanning his initial rehabilitation to muscle relaxant medication interruption was 9âdays, and he underwent 7 rehabilitation sessions. The patient was unable to sit during only one of the 7 sessions due to pre-rehabilitation hypoxemia. In 5 of the 6 sitting sessions, PaO2/FiO2 transiently decreased but recovered by the time of subsequent blood sampling. The patient's PaCO2 decreased during all sessions. His blood pressure did not drastically decrease in any sitting session, except the first. Sputum excretion via sputum suction increased during sitting, and peak inspiratory pressure did not change. LESSONS: The patient eventually died of pneumonia due to COVID-19. However, sitting during deep sedation with muscle relaxants did not cause any serious adverse events nor did it appear to cause obvious negative respiratory effects.","Kinoshita, Tokio; Umemoto, Yasunori; Yasuoka, Yoshinori; Yoshikawa, Tatsuya; Kouda, Ken; Hori, Shinnosuke; Mikami, Yukio; Nishimura, Yukihide; Miyamoto, Kyohei; Kato, Seiya; Tajima, Fumihiro",Medicine (Baltimore),,91
589842,Occurrence of Ochratoxin A in Different Types of Cheese Offered for Sale in Italy,2021-08-02,"An outbreak of exudative epidermitis (EE) among piglets in a Swedish SPF-herd initiated a survey for indications as to the cause of disease. The herd was established by caesarean section and has been closed to all new animal material, with the exception of semen for artificial insemination (AI). The study comprised serum samples from the SPF-herd over a 10-year period (n=109) and a close monitoring of animals in the herd during the period after the EE outbreak. Serum samples from conventional boars at the AI-station servicing the herd were also included (n=9). All serum samples were tested for antibodies to porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2). In addition, 3-week-old piglets from three litters (n=24) farrowed close after the initial EE outbreak were closely monitored for clinical signs of skin disease, sampled for Staphylococcus hyicus, tested for antibodies to porcine parvovirus and in sequentially collected serum samples tested for interferon-α (IFN-α) and interleukin-6. The PVC-2 serology showed that animals in the herd were sero-negative at least until 2 months prior to the EE outbreak. During the period close after the EE outbreak the animals showed varying levels of antibodies to PCV-2 but all the tested animals had sero-converted 4 months later. The AI boars were also sero-positive to PCV-2 at the time of the EE outbreak. Animals in the SPF-herd remained sero-positive to PCV-2 during the following 7 years. In the monitored litters, one piglet had clinical EE and 15 piglets displayed defined erythemas on the abdomen. Fourteen of the piglets also had IFN-α in serum on one or more occasions during the study, indicating viral activity among the animals. S. hyicus was isolated from all of the piglets from the earliest sampling point (3 days of age) and onwards, irrespective of clinical signs.

Further, increases in the number of stillborn piglets, small litters (<6 piglets) and repeat breeders could be correlated to the time of PCV-2 sero-conversion.

Following these drastic cutbacks, a cautious resumption of elective care is planned. This also applies to the delivery of inpatient and day-care interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy (IMPT). Since the majority of pain medicine centers have been closed to date, the question has arisen as to whether a resumption of regular care can be easily provided under the required protective measures. To answer this question, the authors conducted a survey among patients that were in a position to make a direct comparison between IMPT under normal conditions as well as under the currently required protective measures. The survey recorded the level of disruption caused by the different protective measures in the various treatment modules. An evaluation of the questionnaires, which were completed by two patient groups and all therapists involved, revealed that interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy is possible without significant impairments even under the required protective measures. In particular, wearing protective masks proved to be the protective measure with the greatest negative impact. However, options like the use of protective visors or relocating treatment modules to the outdoors offer practicable alternative solutions for protection. Both patient and therapist satisfaction was high despite these constraints, and personal concern regarding possible infection low.","Luchting, Benjamin",Schmerz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32820359/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00482-020-00491-9,91

To effectively address the problem of malnutrition, especially in resource-scarce communities, knowing the prevalence, causes and risk factors associated with it are essential steps. This scoping review aimed to identify the existing literature that uses classical regression analysis on nationally representative health survey data sets to find the individual socioeconomic, demographic and contextual risk factors associated with malnutrition among children under five years of age in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). Methods: The electronic databases searched include EMBASE (OVID platform), PubMed (MEDLINE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, Web of Science (WoS) and Cochrane Library. Only papers written in the English language, and for which the publication date was between 1 January 1990 and 31 July 2020, were included. Results: A total of 229 papers were identified, of which 26 were studies that have been included in the review. The risk factors for malnutrition identified were classified as child-related, parental/household-related and community or area-related. Conclusions: Study-interest bias toward stunting over other anthropometric indicators of malnutrition could be addressed with a holistic research approach to equally address the various dimension of the anthropometric indicators of malnutrition in a population.","Obasohan, Phillips Edomwonyi; Walters, Stephen J.; Jacques, Richard; Khatab, Khaled",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33256022/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17238782,91

Early identification of infected people and their contacts is the key to being able to isolate them and prevent the dissemination of the pathogen; unfortunately, most countries are unable to do this due to the lack of diagnostic tools. Dogs can identify, with a high rate of precision, unique odors of volatile organic compounds generated during an infection; as a result, dogs can diagnose infectious agents by smelling specimens and, sometimes, the body of an infected individual. We trained six dogs of three different breeds to detect SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory secretions of infected patients and evaluated their performance experimentally, comparing it against the gold standard (rRT-PCR). Here we show that viral detection takes one second per specimen. After scent-interrogating 9,200 samples, our six dogs achieved independently and as a group very high sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, accuracy, and likelihood ratio, with very narrow confidence intervals. The highest metric was the negative predictive value, indicating that with a disease prevalence of 7.6%, 99.9% of the specimens indicated as negative by the dogs did not carry the virus. These findings demonstrate that dogs could be useful to track viral infection in humans, allowing COVID-19 free people to return to work safely.","Vesga, Omar; Valencia, Andres F.; Mira, Alejandro; Ossa, Felipe; Ocampo, Esteban; Agudelo, Maria; Čiuoderis, Karl; Perez, Laura; Cardona, Andres; Aguilar, Yudy; González, Javier M.; Cataño, Juan C.; Agudelo, Yuli; Hernández-Ortiz, Juan P.; Osorio, Jorge E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.158105,91

593414,COVID-19 Research: Lessons from Non-Human Primate Models,2021-08-10,"SARS-CoV-2, primarily considered a respiratory virus, is increasingly recognized as having gastrointestinal aspects based on its presence in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and feces. SARS-CoV-2 uses as a receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), a critical member of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid system. In addition to the systemic endocrine functions, RAAS components are also involved in intracrine and organ-specific local functions. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is a key component of RAAS and a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. It is expressed in many tissues with gastrointestinal (GI) tract ACE-2 levels far exceeding those in the respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 binding to its receptor results in a deficiency of ACE-2 activity in endocrine, intracrine, and local lung and GI tract ACE-2. The local ACE-2 has different organ-specific functions, including hypertension-independent activities; dysregulations of these functions may contribute to multiorgan COVID-19 pathology, its severity, long-term effects, and mortality. We review supporting evidence from this standpoint. Notably, COVID-19 comorbidities involving hypertension, obesity, heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes are associated with gastrointestinal problems and display ACE-2 deficits. While RAAS inhibitors target both endocrine and intracrine ACE-2 activity, the deficit of the local ACE-2 activity in the lungs and more so in the gut have not been targeted. Consequently, the therapeutic approach to COVID-19 should be carefully reconsidered. Ongoing clinical trials testing oral probiotic bound ACE-2 delivery are promising.","Sajdel-Sulkowska, Elizabeth M.",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.684610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177593/,91

We also aimed analysing the effectiveness of an unsupervised home-based exercise routine to counteract the potential increase in sedentary behaviour during the periods within the pandemic. Methods18 non-institutionalized elderly (78.4{+/-}6.0 y.), members of the Spanish cohort of EXERNET-Elder 3.0 project participated in the study. They were recommended to perform an exercise prescription based on resistance, balance and aerobic exercises during the pandemic. Wrist triaxial accelerometers (ActiGraph GT9X) were used to assess the percentage of sedentary time, physical activity and sedentary bouts and breaks of sedentary time. An ANOVA for repeated measures was performed to analyse the differences between the three different periods. ResultsDuring home-quarantine, older adults spent more time in sedentary behaviours (71.6{+/-}5.3%) in comparison with either the situation prior to the pandemic (65.5{+/-}6.7%) or the ending of isolation (67.7{+/-}7.1%) (all p<0.05). Moreover, participants performed less bouts of physical activity and with a shorter duration during home quarantine (both p<0.05). Additionally, no differences in the physical activity behaviours were found between the situation prior to the pandemic and the ending of isolation. ConclusionsAccording with our results, the home-quarantine could negatively affect health due to increased sedentary lifestyle and the reduction of physical activity. Therefore, our unsupervised exercise program does not seem to be a completely effective strategy at least in this period.

Because of symptomatic similarities with common illnesses such as malaria, probable coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases may seek care at drug shops, where the knowledge and skills required to handle it may be lacking, thereby fostering community spread of the disease. This single-arm study provided an intervention to improve COVID-19-related knowledge, attitude, and practices of patent medicine vendors (PMVs) in 97 participating drug shops selected through cluster sampling in Owerri, southeastern Nigeria. The intervention involved a drug shop sensitization using information, education, and communication material, as well as training on the use of a risk assessment checklist to identify probable COVID-19 cases and to take appropriate action. Data were collected to determine the effect of this intervention using a pre-tested questionnaire and practice observation checklist, first at baseline and then 3 months post-intervention. Data analysis involved exploratory analysis and the t-test to determine pre- and post-intervention mean score differences at the 5% α level. There was post-intervention knowledge improvement on the COVID-19 causative pathogen (98.1% post-intervention versus 61.9% pre-intervention) and disease transmissibility from person to person (95.9% post-intervention versus 81.4% pre-intervention) among other knowledge domains. There was significant post-intervention improvement for positive attitude, with a mean gain score of 2.8 ± 1.7 (t = 4.4, P = 0.005), and preventive practices, with a mean gain score of 6.0 ± 4.7 (t = 4.1, P = 0.007).

Electronic intrusion (EI) occurs when individuals covertly gain access of their partner's mobile device to go through content (e.g., text messages, private messages on social media sites), and previous study indicates serious consequences of EI, including increased rates of intimate partner violence, depressive symptoms, and heavy episodic drinking. This study examines jealousy, relationship uncertainty (RU), and EI in a sample of American adults. We hypothesized that jealousy would be related to greater acts of EI, and that this association will be mediated by RU. Data were collected from 754 Qualtrics Panels participants (50 percent male) with an average age of 41.7 years. Most participants (85.7 percent) were married. Results supported hypotheses, demonstrating that jealousy was associated with more EI, and this was due to uncertainty about the relationship's future. This study illuminates a need to study cyberdating abuse (CDA) in older and married populations. Future research should consider the effects of other relationship-specific emotions and cognitions on EI and further develop strategies aimed at reducing risks for CDA in romantic relationships.","Ligman, Kaitlyn; Rodriguez, Lindsey M; Rocek, George",Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34264772/; https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0669,91

Identification of known and approved drugs against novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) seems to be an urgent need for the repurposing of the existing drugs. So, here we examined a safe strategy of using approved drugs of SuperDRUG2 database against modeled membrane protein (M-protein) of SARS-CoV-2 which is essential for virus assembly by using molecular docking-based virtual screening. A total of 3639 drugs from SuperDRUG2 database and additionally 14 potential drugs reported against COVID-19 proteins were selected. Molecular docking analyses revealed that nine drugs can bind the active site of M-protein with desirable molecular interactions. We therefore applied molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculation using MM-PBSA to analyze the stability of the compounds. The complexes of M-protein with the selected drugs were simulated for 50 ns and ranked according to their binding free energies. The binding mode of the drugs with M-protein was analyzed and it was observed that Colchicine, Remdesivir, Bafilomycin A1 from COVID-19 suggested drugs and Temozolomide from SuperDRUG2 database displayed desirable molecular interactions and higher binding affinity towards M-protein. Interestingly, Colchicine was found as the top most binder among tested drugs against M-protein. We therefore additionally identified four Colchicine derivatives which can bind efficiently with M-protein and have better pharmacokinetic properties. We recommend that these drugs can be tested further through in vitro studies against SARS-CoV-2 M-protein.","Peele, K.

Gamma sterilization is attractive for PPE reuse because it can sterilize large quantities of material through hermetically sealed packaging, providing safety and logistic benefits. The Gamma Irradiation Facility at Sandia National Laboratories was used to irradiate N95 filtering facepiece respirators to a sterilization dose of 25 kGy(tissue). Aerosol particle filtration performance testing and electrostatic field measurements were used to determine the efficacy of the respirators after irradiation. Both respirator models exhibited statistically significant decreases in particle filtering efficiencies and electrostatic potential after irradiation. The largest decrease in capture efficiency was 40–50% and peaked near the 200 nm particle size. The key contribution of this effort is correlating the electrostatic potential change of individual filtration layer of the respirator with the decrease filtration efficiency after irradiation. This observation occurred in both variations of N95 respirator that we tested. Electrostatic potential measurement of the filtration layer is a key indicator for predicting filtration efficiency loss.","DeAngelis, Haedi E.; Grillet, Anne M.; Nemer, Martin B.; Wasiolek, Maryla A.; Hanson, Don J.; Omana, Michael A.; Sanchez, Andres L.; Vehar, David W.; Thelen, Paul M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33831014/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248859,91

595954,Similarities between pandemics and cancer in growth and risk models,2021-01-11,"BACKGROUND: Nursing home residents are typically older adults with high levels of chronic illness and impairment. As such, they are particularly susceptible to severe complications and mortality from COVID-19. Since all nursing home residents are at increased risk, nursing home care staff need to know what residents would want to happen should they become infected with COVID-19. This study aims to develop and evaluate advance care planning (ACP) COVID-centric online training and information resources for nursing home staff and family members of residents, to improve care at the end of life during a COVID-19 outbreak. Based on the findings we will develop implementation guidelines for nursing homes to ensure wider impact and application during the pandemic and beyond. METHODS: The content of the training and information resources will be based on a rapid review of literature and guidance on ACP in the context of COVID-19 and consultation with the study expert reference group. An integrated communications company will then work alongside the research team to design the online training and information resources. To evaluate the resources, we will employ a multiple case study design where a nursing home (defined as an institutional setting in which nursing care is provided to older adults on-site 24 h a day) will be the unit of analysis or ‘case’. The RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework will guide the evaluation of implementation of the training and information resources. We will recruit and interview staff and family members from between 6 and 9 nursing homes across Northern Ireland, England and Scotland and gather quantitative data from a feedback survey included in the training and information resources. DISCUSSION: The Necessary Discussions study is very timely given the challenging experiences of nursing homes, their staff, residents and their family members during the COVID-19 pandemic. It meets a key need and addresses an important gap in research and practice. The training and information resources will be ‘COVID-centric’, but they will also have a longstanding relevance for future ACP practice in UK care homes.

Structural factors strongly influence engagement with the child welfare system and families experiencing poverty or financial hardship are at a heightened risk. The economic factors influencing child welfare involvement are further complicated by structural racism which has resulted in a greater prevalence of poverty and financial hardship for families who are Black, Native American or Alaska Native (Indigenous), or and Latino/Hispanic (Latino) and their communities. The multiple decision points within CPS are an opportunity to reify or correct for bias in child welfare outcomes. One major effort to eliminate racial disparities and disproportionalities has been to enact standardized decision-making procedures that aim to control for implicit or explicit bias in CPS. The Structured Decision-Making Model’s (SDM) actuarial-based risk assessment (RA) is the gold-standard of these efforts. In this conceptual article, we ask (1) How are structural factors accounted for in assessment of risk within CPS? and (2) What are the consequences when structural factors are left out of risk assessments procedures? We posit that the exclusion of race, ethnicity, and economic factors from the RA has inflated the importance of variables that become proxies for these factors, resulting in inaccurate assessments of risk. The construction of this tool reflects how structural racism has been overlooked as an important cause of disproportionality in CPS, with interventions then focused on individual workers and cases, rather than the system at large. We suggest a new framework for thinking about risk, the structural risk perspective, and call for a revisioning of assessment of risk within child welfare that acknowledges the social determinants of CPS involvement.","Feely, Megan; Bosk, Emily Adlin",Race Soc Probl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643476/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12552-021-09313-8,91
597100,The tear film and ocular mucins,2004-02-18,"Managing education and research during pandemics has increased in importance since the onset of epidemics such as avian flu, SARS and now CoViD-19. Successful management in times of crisis ensures business continuity and institutional survival, making preparedness preceding an impending pandemic essential. Institutions of higher education (IHEs) must maintain balance between academic continuity and preventing morbidity during a pandemic crisis. To date, however, no general pandemic preparedness frameworks exist for IHEs. The aim of this paper is to report on the development of a Haddon matrix framework for IHE pandemic preparedness based on a scoping literature review of past IHE responses including pre-, during and post-pandemic phases. First, a review of previous global responses by IHEs during past pandemics was carried out. The review findings were then collated into a new IHE-centric Haddon matrix for pandemic preparedness. The content of the matrix is then illustrated through the documented responses of Malaysian universities during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting IHE Haddon matrix can be used by universities as a general guide to identify preparedness gaps and intervention opportunities for business continuity during pandemics.","Shamsir, Mohd Shahir; Krauss, Steven Eric; Ismail, Ismi Arif; Ab Jalil, Habibah; Johar, Muhammad Akmal; Abdul Rahman, Ismail",High Educ Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594092/; https://doi.org/10.1057/s41307-020-00221-x,91

Pre-existing antibody titres (as a result of natural infection) in the serum of these animals were found to be significantly increased as a result of a single shot vaccination carried out between 2 and 12 weeks before calving. This was reflected in a similar increase in the titre and duration of specific antibody in milk and colostrum that was passed on to the calves. The overall response observed was highly dependent on an adequate antigen payload being incorporated within the single dose vaccine. No abnormal local or systemic reactions were observed as a result of vaccination. It is hoped that this approach will lead to the production of a superior commercial vaccine for the protection of neonatal calves against enteric coronavirus infection.","Crouch, C.F; Oliver, S; Hearle, D.C; Buckley, A; Chapman, A.J; Francis, M.J",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X00001778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10930672/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X00001778,91
598640,The effect of COVID19 pandemic restrictions on an urban rodent population,2021-06-21,"Background: With the lack of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, mathematical modeling has stepped up in the COVID-19 management to guide non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) policies. Complete lockdown has been characterized as the most powerful strategy for the epidemic; anyhow, it is associated with undeniable negative consequences. Not aware that global panic could make countries adopt premature and lengthy lockdowns, previous studies only warned about the inefficacy of late quarantine sets. Therefore, we proposed ourselves to find the optimal timing and lasting for COVID-19 suppressive measures. Methods: We used our previously elaborated compartmental SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model to scan different timings for lockdown set and various lockdown lengths under different reproduction number (R0) scenarios. We explored healthcare parameters focusing on ICU occupation and deaths since they condition the sanitary system and reflect the severity of the epidemic. Results: The timing for the lockdown trigger varies according to the original R0 and has great impact on ICU usage and fatalities. The less the R0 the later the lockdown should be for it to be effective. The lockdown length is also something to consider. Too short lockdowns (~15 days) have minimal effect on healthcare parameters, but too long quarantines (>45 days) do not benefit healthcare parameters proportionally when compared to more reasonable 30 to 45-day lockdowns. We explored the outcome of the combination of a 45-day lockdown followed by strict mitigation measures sustained in time, and interestingly, it outperformed the lengthy quarantine. Additionally, we show that if strict mitigation actions were to be installed from the very beginning of the epidemic, lockdown would not benefit substantially regarding healthcare parameters. Conclusion: Lockdown set timing and lasting are non-trivial variables to COVID-19 management.","Mayorga, L.; Garcia, C.; Flores, G.; Masuelli, S.; Sanchez, M. V.; Sanchez, C. G.; Mayorga, L.

599215,Algal Lectins as Potential HIV Microbicide Candidates,2012-07-10,"Alcohol's impact on global health is substantial and of a similar order of magnitude to that from COVID‐19. Alcohol now also poses specific concerns, such as increased risk of severe lung infections, domestic violence, child abuse, depression and suicide. Its use is unlikely to aid physical distancing or other preventative behavioural measures. Globally, alcohol contributes to 20% of injury and 11.5% of non‐injury emergency room presentations. We provide some broad comparisons between alcohol‐attributable and COVID‐19‐related hospitalisations and deaths in North America using most recent data. For example, for Canada in 2017 it was recently estimated there were 105 065 alcohol‐attributable hospitalisations which represent a substantially higher rate over time than the 10 521 COVID‐19 hospitalisations reported during the first 5 months of the pandemic. Despite the current importance of protecting health‐care services, most governments have deemed alcohol sales to be as essential as food, fuel and pharmaceuticals. In many countries, alcohol is now more readily available and affordable than ever before, a situation global alcohol producers benefit from and have helped engineer. We argue that to protect frontline health‐care services and public health more generally, it is essential that modest, evidence‐based restrictions on alcohol prices, availability and marketing are introduced. In particular, we recommend increases in excise taxation coupled with minimum unit pricing to both reduce impacts on health‐care services and provide much‐needed revenues for governments at this critical time.","Stockwell, Tim; Andreasson, Sven; Cherpitel, Cheryl; Chikritzhs, Tanya; Dangardt, Frida; Holder, Harold; Naimi, Timothy; Sherk, Adam",Drug Alcohol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835427/; https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13143,91

In this study, stimuli-responsive Pickering emulsions stabilized by poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate]15-b-poly(diacetone acrylamide)120 (E15D120) worms were indicated, in which E15D120 worms were prepared via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer-based aqueous dispersion polymerization using thermo-sensitive POEGMA15 as both the stabilizer block and macro-chain transfer agent. The factors influencing the morphologies of copolymers during polymerization-induced self assembly have been investigated. A series of different morphological polymer nanoparticles including spheres, worms, and vesicles could be produced through rational synthesis. E15D120 worms demonstrated excellent emulsifying performances and could be used as emulsifiers to form n-dodecane-in-water Pickering emulsions at a low content. The formed n-dodecane-in-water Pickering emulsions revealed a slow demulsification at pH 10 or 70 °C or pH 10/70 °C combinations, and several hours were needed for the demulsification of Pickering emulsions. However, n-dodecane-in-water Pickering emulsions displayed a rapid demulsification (â¼10 min) at an elevated temperature, such as 90 °C. The different demulsification rates were attributed to different sensitivities of E15D120 worms to external stimuli. Pickering emulsions integrating a rapid responsive demulsification with a slow one would be well satisfactory on different occasions.","Gao, Yong; Xiang, Zhe; Zhao, Xi; Wang, Guoxiang; Qi, Chenze",Langmuir,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579524/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c01609,91

Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) reference assays exhibit poor performance with plasma, probably reflecting the dilution and degradation of viral RNA released into the circulation, but these issues could be addressed by analysing viral RNA packaged into extracellular vesicles. Here we describe an assay approach in which extracellular vesicles directly captured from plasma are fused with reagent-loaded liposomes to sensitively amplify and detect a SARS-CoV-2 gene target. This approach accurately identified patients with COVID-19, including challenging cases missed by RT-qPCR. SARS-CoV-2-positive extracellular vesicles were detected at day 1 post-infection, and plateaued from day 6 to the day 28 endpoint in a non-human primate model, while signal durations for 20-60 days were observed in young children.

602903,Addressing the Cold Reality of mRNA Vaccine Stability,2020-12-13,"BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence to support the use of facemasks in preventing infection for primary care professionals. Negative effects on communication has been suggested when the physician wears a facemask. As communication skills and doctor patient relationship are essential to primary care consultations, the effects of doctor’s facemask wearing were explored. METHOD: A randomised controlled study was conducted in primary care to explore the effects of doctors wearing facemasks on patients’ perception of doctors’ empathy, patient enablement and patient satisfaction. Primary care doctors were randomized to mask wearing and non mask wearing clinical consultations in public primary care clinics in Hong Kong. Patients’ views were gathered using the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Measure, Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI) and an overall satisfaction rating scale. The effects of face mask wearing were investigated using multilevel (hierarchical) modelling. RESULTS: 1,030 patients were randomised to doctor-mask wearing consultations (n = 514) and non mask wearing consultations (n = 516). A significant and negative effect was found in the patients’ perception of the doctors’ empathy (CARE score reduction -0.98, p-value = 0.04). In the more established doctor-patient relationship, the effect of doctors’ mask wearing was more pronounced (CARE score reduction -5.67, p-value = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that when doctors wearing a facemask during consultations, this has a significant negative impact on the patient’s perceived empathy and diminish the positive effects of relational continuity. Consideration should be taken in planning appropriate use of facemasks in infectious disease policy for primary care and other healthcare professionals at a national, local or practice level.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed confirmed cases of COVID-19 who attended the fever clinic of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 14 to February 24. In terms of the viral RNA shedding (median values) at first visit, patients were divided into a high–viral RNA shedding group and a low–viral RNA shedding group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to investigate the correlation between viral RNA shedding and clinical features. RESULTS: A total of 918 consecutive COVID-19 patients were enrolled, and severe patients made up 26.1%. After univariate and multivariate logistic regression, advanced age (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.03; P = .001), having severe chronic diseases (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03–2.01; P = .04), and severe illness (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.12–2.28; P = .01) were independent risk factors for high viral RNA shedding.

This study examined whether a novel, personalized, technology‐based nomogram was noninferior with regard to significant hypotensive adverse events (AEs) in healthy donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: IMPACT (IMproving PlasmA CollecTion) was a prospective, multicenter, double‐blinded, randomized, controlled trial carried out between January 6 and March 26, 2020, in three U.S plasma collection centers. Donors were randomly assigned to the current simplified 1992 nomogram (control) or a novel percent plasma nomogram (PPN) with personalized target volume calculation (experimental). Primary endpoint was the rate of significant hypotensive AEs. Noninferiority (NI) was tested with a margin of 0.15%. Collected plasma volume was a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 3443 donors (mean [SD] BMI: 32 [7.74] kg/m(2); 65% male) underwent 23,137 donations (median [range]: 6 [1–22] per subject).

We assume that each parameter in the SIR model is a function of time so that we can compute important parameters, such as the basic reproduction number (R0), more delicately. Using neural networks, we propose a method to find the best time-varying parameters and the solution for the model simultaneously. Moreover, using time-dependent parameters, we find that traditional numerical algorithms, such as the Runge-Kutta methods, can successfully approximate the SIR model while fitting the COVID-19 data, thus modeling the propagation patterns of COVID-19 more precisely.","Jo, Hyeontae; Son, Hwijae; Jung, Se Young; Hwang, Hyung Ju",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063412,91

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to investigate the association between DM and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods Systematic literature search was performed from several electronic databases on subjects that assess DM and outcome in COVID-19 pneumonia. The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome, including mortality, severe COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, and disease progression. Results There were a total of 6452 patients from 30 studies. Meta-analysis showed that DM was associated with composite poor outcome (RR 2.38 [1.88, 3.03], p < 0.001; I2: 62%) and its subgroup which comprised of mortality (RR 2.12 [1.44, 3.11], p < 0.001; I2: 72%), severe COVID-19 (RR 2.45 [1.79, 3.35], p < 0.001; I2: 45%), ARDS (RR 4.64 [1.86, 11.58], p = 0.001; I2: 9%), and disease progression (RR 3.31 [1.08, 10.14], p = 0.04; I2: 0%). Meta-regression showed that the association with composite poor outcome was influenced by age (p = 0.003) and hypertension (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the association was weaker in studies with median age ≥55 years-old (RR 1.92) compared to <55 years-old (RR 3.48), and in prevalence of hypertension ≥25% (RR 1.93) compared to <25% (RR 3.06). Subgroup analysis on median age <55 years-old and prevalence of hypertension <25% showed strong association (RR 3.33) Conclusion DM was associated with mortality, severe COVID-19, ARDS, and disease progression in patients with COVID-19.","Huang, Ian; Lim, Michael Anthonius; Pranata, Raymond",Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334395/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120300837; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120300837?v=s5,91

METHODS: Healthcare providers enrolled consecutively by non-random sampling PWH with lab-confirmed COVID-19, diagnosed at their facilities between April 1st and July 1st, 2020. De-identified data were entered into an electronic Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). The primary endpoint was severe outcome, defined as a composite endpoint of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. The secondary outcome was the need for hospitalization. RESULTS: 286 patients were included; the mean age was 51.4 years (SD, 14.4), 25.9% were female, and 75.4% were African-American or Hispanic. Most patients (94.3%) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), 88.7% had HIV virologic suppression, and 80.8% had comorbidities. Within 30 days of positive SARS-CoV-2 testing, 164 (57.3%) patients were hospitalized, and 47 (16.5%) required ICU admission. Mortality rates were 9.4% (27/286) overall, 16.5% (27/164) among those hospitalized, and 51.5% (24/47) among those admitted to an ICU. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 17.5% (50/286) of all patients and 30.5% (50/164) of hospitalized patients. Older age, chronic lung disease, and hypertension were associated with severe outcomes. A lower CD4 count (<200 cells/mm³) was associated with the primary and secondary endpoints. There was no association between the antiretroviral regimen or lack of viral suppression and predefined outcomes. CONCLUSION: Severe clinical outcomes occurred commonly in PWH and COVID-19. The risk for poor outcomes was higher in those with comorbidities and lower CD4 cell counts, despite HIV viral suppression.","Dandachi, Dima; Geiger, Grant; Montgomery, Mary W; Karmen-Tuohy, Savannah; Golzy, Mojgan; Antar, Annukka A R; Llibre, Josep M; Camazine, Maraya; Díaz-De Santiago, Alberto; Carlucci, Philip M; Zacharioudakis, Ioannis M; Rahimian, Joseph; Wanjalla, Celestine N; Slim, Jihad; Arinze, Folasade; Kratz, Ann Marie Porreca; Jones, Joyce L; Patel, Shital M; Kitchell, Ellen; Francis, Adero; Ray, Manoj; Koren, David E; Baddley, John W; Hill, Brannon; Sax, Paul E; Chow, Jeremy",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32905581/,91
611684,The double-sided effects of Mycobacterium Bovis bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine,2021-01-25,"Youth in foster care are disproportionately at risk for developing internalizing and externalizing problems (Lawrence et al., 2006); however, a history of maltreatment prior to foster care placement does not automatically result in poor mental health outcomes. Among non-foster care youth, the quality of family interactions has been related to adjustment outcomes, such that low family cohesion and high family conflict is associated with poor mental health symptoms (Caples & Barrera, 2006). While little is known about these constructs in foster care placements, they may help explain the variance in internalizing and externalizing problems for youth in foster care. The present study aimed to examine whether characteristics of the foster care environment (i.e., conflict, cohesion) across various placement types (i.e., traditional foster homes, group-care settings) could help explain the link between previous maltreatment exposure and mental health problems. The sample included 178 youth in foster care (M(age) = 15.18, SD = 1.76) and their foster caregivers living in the Midwest. Youth participants completed self-report measures about prior maltreatment history, current family environment characteristics, and youth internalizing symptoms. Foster caregivers completed measures on current family environment and youth externalizing symptoms. Results indicated that caregiver report, but not youth report, of family cohesion was negatively associated with youth report of internalizing problems. When examining the indirect effects, youth report of family conflict partially accounted for the link between youth self-report of maltreatment and internalizing symptoms (B = 0.106, 95% CI = 0.026–0.186). Caregiver report of family conflict fully accounted for the association between youth self-report of maltreatment and caregiver report of youths’ externalizing symptoms (B = 0.108, 95% CI = 0.005–0.211). Findings highlight the importance of utilizing multiple informants when measuring foster family environment and suggest that family conflict is particularly salient for the mental health of youth in foster care.","Stone, Katie J.; Jackson, Yo",J Child Fam Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566392/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-021-02107-x,91
611771,Developing vaccines to counter bioterrorist threats,2014-01-09,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Australia. Investment in research solutions has been demonstrated to yield health and a 9.8-fold return economic benefit. The sector, however, is severely challenged with success rates of traditional peer-reviewed funding in decline. Here, we aimed to understand the perceived challenges faced by the cardiovascular workforce in Australia prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We used an online survey distributed across Australian cardiovascular societies/councils, universities and research institutes over a period of 6 months during 2019, with 548 completed responses. Inclusion criteria included being an Australian resident or an Australian citizen who lived overseas, and a current or past student or employee in the field of cardiovascular research. RESULTS: The mean age of respondents was 42±13 years, 47% were male, 85% had a full-time position, and 40% were a group leader or laboratory head. Twenty-three per cent (23%) had permanent employment, and 82% of full-time workers regularly worked >40 hours/week. Sixty-eight per cent (68%) said they had previously considered leaving the cardiovascular research sector. If their position could not be funded in the next few years, a staggering 91% of respondents would leave the sector. Compared to PhD- and age-matched men, women were less likely to be a laboratory head and to feel they had a long-term career path as a cardiovascular researcher, while more women were unsure about future employment and had considered leaving the sector (all p<0.05). Greater job security (76%) and government and philanthropic investment in cardiovascular research (72%) were highlighted by responders as the main changes to current practices that would encourage them to stay. CONCLUSION: Strategic solutions, such as diversification of career pathways and funding sources, and moving from a competitive to a collaborative culture, need to be a priority to decrease reliance on government funding and allow cardiovascular researchers to thrive.","Climie, Rachel E.; Wu, Jason H.Y.; Calkin, Anna C.; Chapman, Niamh; Inglis, Sally C.; Mirabito Colafella, Katrina M.; Picone, Dean S.; Tan, Joanne T.M.; Thomas, Emma; Viola, Helena M.; Wise, Steven G.; Murphy, Andrew J.; Nelson, Mark R.; Nicholls, Stephen J.; Hool, Livia C.; Doyle, Kerry; Figtree, Gemma A.; Marques, Francine Z.",Heart Lung Circ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1443950620303966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839116/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2020.07.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1443950620303966,91

Furthermore, we harmonize data on the estimated change points with non-pharmaceutical interventions adopted by each state of the United States, which provides us insights regarding the lag time between the enactment of a policy and its effect on COVID-19 outcomes. We present the estimated change points for each state and the District of Columbia and find five different emerging trajectory patterns.

For analysing coronavirus diversity in a bat species‐rich country, a total of 421 anal swabs/faecal samples from Costa Rican bats were screened for CoV RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences by a pancoronavirus PCR. Six families, 24 genera and 41 species of bats were analysed. The detection rate for CoV was 1%. Individuals (n = 4) from four different species of frugivorous (Artibeus jamaicensis, Carollia perspicillata and Carollia castanea) and nectivorous (Glossophaga soricina) bats were positive for coronavirus‐derived nucleic acids. Analysis of 440 nt. RdRp sequences allocated all Costa Rican bat CoVs to the α‐CoV group. Several CoVs sequences clustered near previously described CoVs from the same species of bat, but were phylogenetically distant from the human CoV sequences identified to date, suggesting no recent spillover events. The Glossophaga soricina CoV sequence is sufficiently dissimilar (26% homology to the closest known bat CoVs) to represent a unique coronavirus not clustering near other CoVs found in the same bat species so far, implying an even higher CoV diversity than previously suspected.","Moreira‐Soto, A.; Taylor‐Castillo, L.; Vargas‐Vargas, N.; Rodríguez‐Herrera, B.; Jiménez, C.; Corrales‐Aguilar, E.",Zoonoses Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25653111/; https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12181,91

We report a method of high‐resolution DNA rulers with subnucleotide precision and the discovery of new frameshifting intermediate states on mRNA containing a GA(7)G motif. Two intermediate states were observed with the aid of fusidic acid, one at the “0” reading frame and the other near the “−1” reading frame, in contrast to the “−2” and “−1” frameshifting products found in the absence of the antibiotic. We termed the new near‐“−1” intermediate the Post(−1*) state because it was shifted by approximately half a nucleotide compared to the normal “−1” reading frame at the 5’‐end. This indicates a ribosome conformation that is different from the conventional model of three reading frames.

Rapid testing of a large number of subjects is essential to monitor, and delay, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic. People not knowing that they are infected may not stay in quarantine and, thus, are a risk for infecting others. Unfortunately, the massive number of COVID-19 tests performed is challenging for both laboratories and the units that take the throat swab and have to communicate test results. Here, we present a secure tracking system (CTest) to report COVID-19 test results online as soon as they become available.

With this open-source and browser-based online tracking system, we aim to minimize the time required to inform the tested person but also the test units, e.g. hospitals or the public healthcare system. Instead of personal calls, CTest updates the status of the test automatically when the test results are available. Test reports are published on a secured web-page enabling regular status checks also by patients not using smartphones with dedicated mobile apps which has some importance as smartphone usage diminishes with age.

In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in high risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practices and associated factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. Methods A cross-sectional in-person survey (n=6007) was conducted from 14-30 April 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowed. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge in the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practices) were measured using four items. Multivariable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding. Results About half (48%, 95% CI: 46,49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58,61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48,50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. Conclusion The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanism. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority high-risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve preventions practices and control the spread of COVID-19. Use of female public figures and religious leaders could support the effort towards the increase in awareness.","DEFAR, A.; Molla, G.; Abdella, S.; Tessema, M.; Ahmed, M.; Tadele, A.; Getachew, F.; Hailegiorgis, B.; Tigabu, E.; Ababor, S.; Bizuwork, K.; Deressa, A.; Tasew, G.; kebede, A.; Melese, D.; Gashu, A.; Eshetu, K.; Tayachew, A.; Wossen, M.; Hassen, A.; Habebe, S.; Assefa, Z.; Abayneh, A.; Abate, E.; Tollera, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.14.20172429v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.14.20172429,91

Understanding how these factors affect the progress of the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be essential to know the risks each country is facing because of the disease. In this study, we verified the existence of a relationship between the basic reproduction number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 with different climate variables, while also considering the Global Health Security Index (GHS). We collected data from confirmed cases of COVID-19 along with their respective GHS notes and climate data, from December 31, 2019 to April 13, 2020, for 52 countries. The generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the effect of temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation index, and GHS score on the spread rate of COVID-19. The countries that showed similarity to each other were grouped into clusters using the Kohonen self-organizing map methodology to investigate the importance of each variable in the dissemination of the disease. The temperature variable presented a linear relationship (p < 0.001) with the R0, with an explained variation of 36.2%, while the relative humidity variable did not present a significant relationship with the R0. The response curve of the solar radiation variable presented a significant nonlinear relationship (p < 0.001) with an explained variation of 32.3%. The GHS index variable, with a significant nonlinear relationship (p < 0.001), presented the largest explanatory response in the control of COVID-19, with an explained variation of 38.4%; further, it was observed that the countries with the largest GHS index scores were less influenced by climate variables.","Leichtweis, Bruno Grespan; de Faria Silva, Letícia; da Silva, Felipe Lopes; Peternelli, Luiz Alexandre",One Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771421000252?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771421000252; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723518/,91
620229,"Phosphate, Microbiota and CKD",2021-04-13,"The novel Coronavirus outbreak has created a massive economic crisis, and many succumb to death, disturbing the lives of mankind all over the world. Currently, there are no viable treatment for this condition, drug development approaches are being pursued with vigor. The major treatment options are to repurpose existing drugs or to find new ones. Traditional methods for drug discovery take a longer time, so there is an urgent need to develop some alternative techniques that reduces search space for drug candidates. Towards this endeavor, we propose a novel drug discovery method that leverages on long short term memory (LSTM) model to generate novel molecules that are adept at binding with novel Coronavirus protease. Our study demonstrates that the proposed method is able to recreate novel molecules that correlate very much with the properties of trained molecules. Further, we fine-tune the model to generate novel drug-like molecules that are active towards a specific target. We consider 3CLPro, the main protease of novel Coronavirus, as a therapeutic target and demonstrated in silico screening to assess target structural binding affinities with docking simulations. We observed that 80% of generated molecules show docking free energy of less than −5.8 kcal/mol. The top generated drug candidate has the highest binding affinity with a docking score of −8.5 kcal/mol, which is very much lower when compared to approved existing commercial drugs including, Remdesivir. The low binding energy indicates that the generated molecules could be explored as potential drug candidates for Covid-19.","Amilpur, Santhosh; Bhukya, Raju",J Mol Graph Model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1093326321002163?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1093326321002163,91
620314,Airflow Dynamics of Human Jets: Sneezing and Breathing - Potential Sources of Infectious Aerosols,2013-04-01,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is posing a great threat to the global economy and public health security. Together with the acknowledged angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, glucose-regulated protein 78, transferrin receptor, AXL, kidney injury molecule-1, and neuropilin 1 are also identified as potential receptors to mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, how to inhibit or delay the binding of SARS-CoV-2 with the abovementioned receptors is a key step for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. As the third gasotransmitter, hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) plays an important role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. Recently, survivors were reported to have significantly higher H(2)S levels in COVID-19 patients, and mortality was significantly greater among patients with decreased H(2)S levels. Considering that the beneficial role of H(2)S against COVID-19 and COVID-19-induced comorbidities and multiorgan damage has been well-examined and reported in some excellent reviews, this review will discuss the recent findings on the potential receptors of SARS-CoV-2 and how H(2)S modulates the above receptors, in turn blocking SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells.","Dai, Jing; Teng, Xu; Jin, Sheng; Wu, Yuming",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/7866992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497683/,91
621481,Comparison of alternative models of human movement and the spread of disease,2019-12-19,"Access to palliative care for marginalized communities is frequently problematized as a major challenge facing palliative care services. The traditional response of asking what services can do for the disadvantaged has been invigorated by a new wave of public health measures that embrace death and dying as social processes and ask, what can be done together with such communities as partners working in palliative care. Such work has generated a significant amount of academic, social and political interests over the last 20 years; however, we are yet to see a consistent and sustained change in approach from providers. We argue that this is due to inherent tensions that arise when modelling death, dying and loss as a unified and shared social process. Unresolved tensions destabilize the theoretical foundations and risk misrepresentation of core philosophies. In this integrative review of 75 articles, we present previously undiscussed areas of contention drawing from a pan-disciplinary field of theoretical and empirical evidence. We conclude that new public health approaches lack a consistent and unified theoretical approach. From philosophical, ontological and existential ideas relating to how different stakeholders conceptualize death, to the processes by which communities are motivated and their constituent members empowered through responsibilized notions of duty and reciprocity, there is little acknowledgement of the complex tensions at hand. Increasing academic and political initiative alone is not enough to progress this movement in a manner that achieves its full potential. Instead, we must pay greater attention to the tensions described. This article aims to work with such tensions to better define the landscape of collective moral responsibility in end-of-life care. We believe that this is crucial if palliative care is to avoid becoming a technical speciality with community and communitization reduced to a mere technical solution to more profound questions.","Sawyer, Joseph M.; Higgs, Paul; Porter, John D.H.; Sampson, Elizabeth L.",Palliat Care Soc Pract,https://doi.org/10.1177/26323524211032984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647028/,91

The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid overhaul of several aspects of ED operations in preparation for a sustained response. Objective of the Review:We present the management of the COVID-19 crisis in three EDs (one large academic site, and two community sites) within the same health system. Discussion Aspects of ED throughput, including patient screening, patient room placement, and disposition are reviewed, along with departmental communication procedures and staffing models. Visitor policies are additionally discussed. Special considerations are given to airway management and the care of psychiatric patients. Brief guidance around the use of personal protective equipment is also included. Conclusions A crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic requires careful planning to facilitate urgent restructuring of many aspects of an ED. By sharing our departments’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope other departments can better prepare for this crisis and the next.","Schreyer, Kraftin E.; del Portal, Daniel A.; King, L. J.

The rapid development of several safe and highly efficacious vaccines stands as one of the most extraordinary achievements in modern medicine, but the identification and administration of efficacious therapeutics to treat patients suffering from COVID-19 has been far less successful. A major factor limiting progress in the development of effective treatments has been a lack of suitable preclinical models for the disease, currently reliant upon various animal models and in vitro culture of immortalized cell lines. Here we report the first successful demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral replication in a human primary cell-based organ-on-chip, leveraging a recently developed tissue culture platform known as PREDICT96. This successful demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human primary airway epithelial cells derived from a living donor represents a powerful new pathway for disease modeling and an avenue for screening therapeutic candidates in a high throughput platform.","Fisher, Christine R.; Medie, Felix Mba; Luu, Rebeccah J.; Gaibler, Robert; Miller, Caitlin R.; Mulhern, Thomas J.; Vijayakumar, Vidhya; Marr, Elizabeth; Alladina, Jehan; Medoff, Benjamin; Borenstein, Jeffrey T.; Gard, Ashley L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.15.448611,91

This question may serve to inform whether or not suicides are being accurately reported and documented. Data from all 50 states from the years 2012-2016 were obtained from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A total of 213,726 suicide fatalities, 702,176 unintentional injury fatalities, and 24,533 undetermined injury fatalities comprised the dataset. Injury fatality rates depicted annual increases in both suicide and unintentional injury fatalities but variability in undetermined injury fatalities. Bivariate analyses discovered a statistically significant association between annual suicide fatality rates and unintentional (nonsuicidal) injury fatality rates. It would be suspected, ceteris paribus, that calculated rate changes over these years would follow suit. However, this was not observed. Given the trends and increasing stigma surrounding suicide, it is worth considering the degree to which suicides may be underreported or -documented and the epidemiological and translational ramifications of these trends as they pertain to future suicide research.","Lenno, Jack C.",Psychiatry Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438211/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120303310?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165178120303310,91
624124,Understanding contagion dynamics through microscopic processes in active Brownian particles,2020-11-30,"With vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) being introduced in countries across the world, policy makers are facing many practical considerations about how best to implement a vaccination programme. The supply of vaccines is insufficient for the global population, so decisions must be made as to which groups are prioritised for any vaccination and when. Furthermore, the aims of vaccination programmes will differ between countries, with some prioritising economic benefits that could stem from the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions and others seeking simply to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases or deaths. This paper aims to share the experiences and lessons learned from conducting economic evaluations in Singapore and Thailand on hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines to provide a basis for other countries to develop their own contextualised economic evaluations, with particular focus on the key uncertainties, technical challenges, and characteristics that modellers should consider in partnership with key stakeholders. Which vaccines, vaccination strategies, and policy responses are most economically beneficial remains uncertain. It is therefore important for all governments to conduct their own analyses to inform local policy responses to COVID-19, including the implementation of COVID-19 vaccines in both the short and the long run. It is essential that such studies are designed, and ideally conducted, before vaccines are introduced so that policy decisions and implementation procedures are not delayed.

This has spurred increasing interest in the dynamics of transformation: the actors, capacities and resources needed to fundamentally shift development paths. The private sector is at the core of essential transformative processes necessary to build a future premised on environmental integrity, social inclusivity, and resilience. The activities of the private sector are structured and driven by their underlying business model, which is at its core a set of assumptions about how a business creates, extracts and delivers value. Dominant conceptualizations of the business model remain a narrow imagining of how business interacts with societal processes and shape development patterns. In this article we call for the conceptualization and design of business models anchored in societal purpose and operating within planetary boundaries, apt for the Anthropocene. We identify five building blocks for business models where transdisciplinary sustainability research can accelerate entrepreneurial activity that fosters desirable sustainable pathways by enabling the creation of new capabilities in support of broader transformational processes. This article seeks to inform (and potentially re-orient the efforts of) transdisciplinary scholars engaging the private sector in the co-production of community-based sustainability and resilience-building initiatives.

RECENT FINDINGS: While virtual interviewing decreased cost and increased convenience for applicants and programs involved in the match, it also introduced several potential disadvantages. Maximizing technological capabilities was an area of utmost concern at the start of the interview cycle, and multiple medical education organizations quickly recommended ways to move to virtual process, and to prevent and troubleshoot technical problems. However, other issues were less straightforward, such as how to address new sources of bias introduced by virtual interviewing, and how to ensure that programs and applicants could make informed decisions about their rank lists after only limited virtual interactions. Additionally, the increased convenience of interviewing raised concerns that students would accept more interviews, disrupting the established calculus programs used to determine how many interviews to offer per spot available.

Furthermore, many glucometers connect to smartphones providing an opportunity to integrate with contract tracing apps, medical providers, and electronic medical records. In clinical testing, the developed assay detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient saliva across a range of viral loads - as benchmarked by RT-qPCR - within one hour, with 100% sensitivity (positive percent agreement) and distinguished infected specimens from off-target antigens in uninfected controls with 100% specificity (negative percent agreement).

NETs have been found in severe COVID-19 patients, but their role in disease development is still unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the capacity of NETs to drive epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lung epithelial cells and to analyze the involvement of NETs in COVID-19. Neutrophils activated with PMA (PMA-Neu), a stimulus known to induce NETs formation, induce both EMT and cell death in the lung epithelial cell line, A549. Notably, NETs isolated from PMA-Neu induce EMT without cell damage. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of severe COVID-19 patients showed high concentration of NETs. Thus, we tested in an in vitro alveolar model the hypothesis that virus-induced NET may drive EMT. Co-culturing A549 at air-liquid interface with alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and SARS-CoV2, we demonstrated a significant induction of the EMT in A549 together with high concentration of NETs, IL8 and IL1β, best-known inducers of NETosis. Lung tissues of COVID-19 deceased patients showed that epithelial cells are characterized by increased mesenchymal markers.

It is essential to identify those risk factors that lead to a poor prognosis of the disease. A predisposing host genetic background could be one of these factors that explain the interindividual variability to COVID-19 severity. Thus, we have studied whether the rs4341 and rs4343 polymorphisms of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene, key regulator of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS), could explain the different outcomes of 128 COVID-19 patients with diverse degree of severity (33 asymptomatic or mildly asymptomatic, 66 hospitalized in the general ward, and 29 admitted to the ICU). We found that G allele of rs4341 and rs4343 was associated with severe COVID-19 in hypertensive patients, independently of gender (p<0.05). G-carrier genotypes of both polymorphisms were also associated with higher mortality (p< 0.05) and higher severity of COVID-19 in dyslipidemic (p<0.05) and type 2 diabetic patients (p< 0.01). In conclusion, our preliminary study suggests that the G-containing genotypes of rs4341 and rs4343 confer an additional risk of adverse COVID-19 prognosis. Thus, rs4341 and rs4343 polymorphisms of ACE could be predictive markers of severity of COVID-19 in those patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia or diabetes.

Secondly, we present a study that evaluates the extent to which the proposed approach enhances student learning in such a mixed-ability environment. The study was conducted in a first-year course at the University of British Columbia – Okanagan, and it was based on three components:1) a survey of 25 Likert items(n = 46), 2) class average grade and pass rate over 6 years (n = 42 + 38 + 56 + 79 + 90 + 74), and 3) student ratings of the course over 5 years (n = 42 + 38 + 56 + 79 + 90).

RESULTS: The highest affinity clone to ORF6 displayed the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 (nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, member B3; also named as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1 isoform 1 homolog). The coimmunoprecipitation assay demonstrated the direct binding of ORF6 to the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 in vitro. Confocal imaging revealed a close colocalization of SARS-CoV ORF6 protein with NPIPB3 in human promonocytes. The dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 attenuated the antagonistic activity of SARS-CoV ORF6 on IFN-β-induced ISRE (IFN stimulated response element)-responsive firefly luciferase activity. In addition, confocal imaging and Western blotting assays revealed that the increases in STAT-1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation occurred in the transfected cells expressing both genes of ORF6 and NPIPB3, but not in the ORF6-expressing cells in response to IFN-β. CONCLUSION: The overexpression of NPIPB3 restored the IFN-β responses in SARS-CoV ORF6 expressing cells, indicating that the interaction of SARS CoV ORF6 and NPIPB3 reduced Type I IFN antagonism by SARS-CoV ORF6.","Huang, Su-Hua; Lee, Tzu-Ying; Lin, Ying-Ju; Wan, Lei; Lai, Chih-Ho; Lin, Cheng-Wen",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118215008051; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2015.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26320399/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118215008051,91

Yet, migrants are far too often forgotten in health risk communication responses. We investigate the challenges and efforts made by migrants in Denmark—in the initial months of the pandemic—to access information about COVID-19. We draw on 18 semi-structured interviews conducted in May and June 2020. All interviews are thematically coded and analyzed. Our analysis reveals that many of the migrants faced several challenges, including accessing information in a language understandable to them and navigating constant streams of official news flows issuing instructions about which actions to take. However, we also note that the participating migrants found numerous creative ways to address some of these challenges, often aided by digital tools, helping them access crucial health and risk information. This paper highlights that migrants constitute an underserved group in times of crises. They are vulnerable to getting left behind in pandemic communication responses. However, we also identify key protective factors, social resources, and agentic capabilities, which help them cope with health and risk information deficits. National governments need to take heed of these findings to inform future pandemic responses.","Brønholt, Rasmus Luca Lyager; Langer Primdahl, Nina; Jensen, Anja M.

631444,Post-SARS tourist arrival recovery patterns: An analysis based on a catastrophe theory,2009-10-09,"The people suffering from coronavirus have to lead unprecedented actions including limiting travel especially using public transportation. Therefore, lockdown measures and social distancing to decelerate the distribution of the COVID-19 has become the new norm. Nevertheless, improvement in the ambient air quality of the cities globally has appeared as a key advantage of this lockdown. There is a lack of research in the field of public transportation mobility and the Air Quality Index (AQI) during the COVID-19 lockdown globally. Consequently, this research aims to examine the overall impact of the public transit usage and ambient air quality, i.e. both AQI and indicatory air pollutants, during the lockdown in 12 countries. Data collections for analysis of public transportation usage and air quality status during the lockdown and one year before this period were carried out utilizing public transportation application Moovit and World's Air Pollution. The results demonstrated that the lockdowns of 12 countries led to dramatically decreased human movements and public transit usage up to −90% until the end of March and it had no major changes until the end of May. In the case of ambient air quality, the average values of AQI in the 12 countries within lockdown 2020 for classes I(AQI:0-50), II(AQI:51-100), and III(AQI:101-150) increased by 12%, 9%, and 13% while for classes IV(AQI:151-200), V(AQI:201-300) and VI(AQI:301-greater) decreased by 10%, 27%, and 3% in comparison with the identical time throughout 2019. The results also indicate that throughout lockdown 2020, in the 12 countries, the percentages of indicatory air pollutants of PM2.5, PM10, SO(2), CO, and NO(2) were decreased by 16%, 21%, 41%, 48%, and 35% lower than those in the same time in 2019.

Even if microbiology is positive, they still remain unclassified according to 2008-EORTC/MSG. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) provides new mycological documentation of IA. This retrospective study assessed Aspergillus fumigatus real time qPCR (MycoGENIE®) in BAL to diagnose IA and identify azole-resistant strains. Clinical, radiological, and microbiological data from 114 hematology patients (69% HSCT recipients; 29% on mould active agents) from years 2012-2017 were collected; and 123 BAL samples were tested with qPCR (cutoff: Ct < 40) and galactomannan (GM, Platelia®, cutoff: 0.5 ODI). Patients were classified as proven/probable, possible, and no-IA. ""Atypical-IA"" referred to patients with lesions other than typical according to 2008-EORTC/MSG and positive mycology. Proven IA was diagnosed in two cases (1.6%), probable in 28 (22.8%), possible in 27 (22%), atypical in 14 (11.4%). qPCR was positive in 39 samples (31.7%). Sensitivity and specificity of qPCR for proven/probable IA (vs no-IA; atypical-IA excluded) were 40% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23–59) and 69% (95%CI: 55–81), respectively. Sensitivity of qPCR was higher when combined with GM (83%, 95%CI: 65–94) and in those receiving mould-active agents at BAL (61%, 95%CI: 32–86). One sample had TR34/L98H mutation. In conclusion, in high-risk hematology patients with various lung lesions, A. fumigatus qPCR in BAL contributes to diagnosing IA, particularly if combined with GM and in patients receiving mould-active agents might allow detecting azole-resistant mutations in culture negative samples.","Mikulska, Malgorzata; Furfaro, Elisa; De Carolis, Elena; Drago, Enrico; Pulzato, Ilaria; Borghesi, Maria Lucia; Zappulo, Emanuela; Raiola, Anna Maria; Grazia, Carmen Di; Del Bono, Valerio; Cittadini, Giuseppe; Angelucci, Emanuele; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Viscoli, Claudio",Med Mycol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30753590/; https://doi.org/10.1093/mmy/myz002,91

632880,Specificity of UV-C LED disinfection efficacy for three N95 respirators,2021-07-28,"Summary Background Viral respiratory illnesses are common causes of outbreaks and can be fatal to some patients. Aim To investigate the association between laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections and potential sources of exposure during the previous 7 days. Methods In this nested case–control analysis, healthcare personnel from nine Canadian hospitals who developed acute respiratory illnesses during the winters of 2010/11–2013/14 submitted swabs that were tested for viral pathogens. Associated illness diaries and the weekly diaries of non-ill participants provided information on contact with people displaying symptoms of acute respiratory illness in the previous week. Conditional logistic regression assessed the association between cases, who were matched by study week and site with controls with no respiratory symptoms. Findings There were 814 laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory illnesses. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of a viral illness was higher for healthcare personnel reporting exposures to ill household members [7.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.4–9.1], co-workers (3.4, 95% CI 2.4–4.7) or other social contacts (5.1, 95% CI 3.6–7.1). Exposures to patients with respiratory illness were not associated with infection (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7–1.2); however, healthcare personnel with direct patient contact did have higher odds (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.6). The aORs for exposure and for direct patient contact were similar for illnesses caused by influenza. Conclusion Community and co-worker contacts are important sources of viral respiratory illness in healthcare personnel, while exposure to patients with recognized respiratory infections is not associated. The comparatively low risk associated with direct patient contact may reflect transmission related to asymptomatic patients or unrecognized infections.","Buckrell, S.; Coleman, B. L.; McNeil, S.

Therefore, we aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the digestive system of children. In this meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from January 1, 2020, to June 31, 2020. We also searched for COVID-19 publications in specific journals for more comprehensive results. We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and we excluded duplicate publications, reviews, animal studies, case reports, publications without the full text, studies with incomplete information, and studies from which data extraction was impossible. We conducted a meta-analysis of the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in liver function involving 19 studies. The pooled prevalence of diarrhea was 10% (95% CI: 7–14; I(2) = 84%), that of nausea or vomiting was 7% (95% CI: 5–11; I(2) = 77%), and that of abdominal pain was 4% (95% CI: 2–9; I(2) = 79%).

Considering the limitations and high demand for COVID-19 testing, we have employed MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry for the analysis of 60 gargle samples from human donors and compared the spectra with their respective RT-PCR results. Several standards including isolated human serum immunoglobulins and controls such as pre-COVID-19 saliva and heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus were simultaneously analyzed to provide a relative view of the saliva and viral proteome as they would appear in this works methodology. Five potential biomarker peaks were established that demonstrated high consistency with PCR positive samples. Overall, the agreement of these results with RT-PCR testing was no less than 90% for the studied cohort, which consisted of young and largely asymptomatic student athletes. Further investigation of the potential biomarker peaks is necessary, however, from a clinical standpoint, these results are promising for a rapid and inexpensive COVID-19 assay.","Chivte, P.; LaCasse, Z.; Seethi, V.

635336,Back to the Future: Multiparent Populations Provide the Key to Unlocking the Genetic Basis of Complex Traits,2017-06-06,"Overweight and obesity are major risk factors for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and lung disease. These diseases are the most commonly reported health conditions that predispose individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection to require hospitalization including intensive care unit admissions. The innate immune response is the host’s first line of defense against a human coronavirus infection. However, most coronaviruses are armed with one strategy or another to overcome host antiviral defense, and the pathogenicity of the virus is related to its capacity to suppress host immunity. The multifaceted nature of obesity including its effects on immunity can fundamentally alter the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia, which are the major causes of death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Elevated circulating leptin concentrations are a hallmark of obesity, which is associated with a leptin-resistant state. Leptin is secreted by adipocytes in proportion to body fat and regulates appetite and metabolism through signaling in the hypothalamus. However, leptin also signals through the Jak/STAT and Akt pathways, among others, to modulate T cell number and function. Thus, leptin connects metabolism with the immune response. Therefore, it seems appropriate that its dysregulation would have serious consequences during an infection. We propose that leptin may be the link between obesity and its high prevalence as a comorbidity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this article, we present a synthesis of the mechanisms underpinning susceptibility to respiratory viral infections and the contribution of the immunomodulatory effects of obesity to the outcome.","Rebello, Candida J.; Kirwan, John P.; Greenway, Frank L.",Int J Obes (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-020-0640-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647360/,91

As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we found that 3 of the drugs fulfils the criterions well among which the antiretroviral drug Amprenavir (DrugBank ID–DB00701) would probably be the most effective drug based on the selected criterions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID-19 treatment.

Next, the investigation validated the model using two sets of experimental data from a cabin mockup and an actual airplane. This study then used the validated model to systematically investigate the impact of gaspers on cabin air quality in a seven-row section of the fully-occupied, economy-class cabin of Boeing 767 and 737 airplanes. The CFD calculations formed a database consisting of 9660 data points that provide information about SARS infection risk. It was found that the distribution of opened gaspers can influence the infection risk for passengers. Even though the gasper supplies clean air, it is possible for it to have a negative impact on the passengers' health. Statistically speaking, the overall effect of turning on the gaspers on the mean infection risk for the general population was neutral.","You, Ruoyu; Chen, Jun; Lin, Chao-Hsin; Wei, Daniel; Chen, Qingyan",Build Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287968/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132316304176; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132316304176; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.10.018,91

Here, we investigated the spectrum of immune responses occurring in patients with MERS during the early period of infection. METHODS: We obtained peripheral blood samples from 27 hospitalized patients recruited during the epidemic that occurred in 2015 in South Korea. Plasma cytokines/chemokines and antibodies were quantified. Virus-specific T cells were examined by intracellular cytokine staining after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with overlapping peptides spanning whole virus structural proteins. RESULTS: At the acute phase of infection, elevated levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines were detected in proportion to the severity of the disease. Distinctively high frequencies of MERS coronavirus–reactive CD8(+) T cells were also observed in patients with severe/moderate illness, whereas antibody and CD4(+) T-cell responses were minimally detected at this stage. At the convalescent phase, disease severity–dependent antibody responses emerged and antigen-reactive cells were identified in both T-cell subsets. These T cells belonged to the T-helper 1 or type 1 cytotoxic T cell subtypes. While CD8(+) T cells responded preferentially to the viral S protein compared with E/M/N proteins, especially at the acute stage, slightly more CD4(+) T cells recognized E/M/N proteins compared with S protein at the convalescent phase. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show an association between the early CD8(+) T-cell response and the severity of the infection, and also provide basic information that may help to prepare effective control strategies for MERS in humans.","Shin, Hyoung-Shik; Kim, Yeonjae; Kim, Gayeon; Lee, Ji Yeon; Jeong, Ina; Joh, Joon-Sung; Kim, Hana; Chang, Eunjin; Sim, Soo Yeon; Park, Jun-Sun; Lim, Dong-Gyun",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30060038/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy595,91

Furthermore, we examine the empirical evidence on the relationship between QQI scores and participants’ interactions. Finally, we visualize network structures via sociograms and hierarchically cluster participants to identify subgroups. Our analysis of 281 messages finds that recommendations helped participants to write more messages that compared alternative viewpoints and refined preliminary ideas with higher QQI scores.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the associations between parenting stress, quality of life, and physical activity in a national sample of working mothers who endorsed having been forced to work from home full-time due to the COVID-19 pandemic and examine if physical activity moderates the association between parenting stress and quality of life in this sample of working mothers. METHODS: Participants in this cross-sectional study were 200 full-time working mothers from the United States (mean age = 33.50 years; SD = 6.25; 70.0% White). Participants were recruited from a Qualtrics research panel and completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short-Form, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale-Brief Version, the Parental Stress Scale, and a demographic questionnaire. RESULTS: After controlling for socio-demographic variables (i.e., maternal marital status, annual income, maternal highest level of education), greater parenting stress was associated with poorer maternal quality of life across domains (standardized beta coefficients ranged from −0.26 to −0.47; p < .001). The interaction between parenting stress and moderate intensity physical activity was associated with social relationships quality of life and environment quality of life (standardized beta coefficients ranged from 0.15 to 0.17; p < .05) in our sample of working mothers. The negative effect of parenting stress on maternal social relationships and environmental quality of life was weaker for working mothers who engaged in higher levels of moderate intensity physical activity.

These rolled-up seamless cylinders of graphene sheets possess nanosized hollow-tube-shaped structures. The CNTs can be single-walled, double-walled or multi-walled, depending upon the number of graphene layers from which a single nanotube is composed. The CNTs, favoring encapsulation of drug molecules or by possible attachment of theranostic agents on the nanotube walls, have enabled their use in controlled drug delivery, and in targeting of drug molecules to specific sites such as the lymphatic system, brain, ocular system, and cancerous tissue. This chapter provides an overview of various types of CNTs, methods utilized for their commercial production, and the functionalization approaches employed in drug-delivery applications. In addition, the chapter also endeavors to provide a thoughtful insight into the toxicity and regulatory concerns that need to be addressed before the CNTs can be launched in the market.","Singh, Bhupinder; Lohan, Shikha; Sandhu, Premjeet S.; Jain, Atul; Mehta, Surinder Kumar",Nanobiomaterials in Medical Imaging,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323417365000157; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323417365000157,91

METHODS: Baseline serologies were performed among HCW from 23 Swiss healthcare institutions between June and September 2020, before the second COVID-19 wave. Participants answered weekly electronic questionnaires covering information about nasopharyngeal swabs (PCR/rapid antigen tests) and symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Screening of symptomatic staff by nasopharyngeal swabs was routinely performed in participating facilities. We compared numbers of positive nasopharyngeal tests and occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms between HCW with and without anti-nucleocapsid antibodies. RESULTS: A total of 4812 HCW participated, wherein 144 (3%) were seropositive at baseline. We analyzed 107,807 questionnaires with a median follow-up of 7.9 months. Median number of answered questionnaires was similar (24 vs. 23 per person, P = 0.83) between those with and without positive baseline serology. Among 2712 HCW with ≥ 1 SARS-CoV-2 test during follow-up, 3/67 (4.5%) seropositive individuals reported a positive result (one of whom asymptomatic), compared to 547/2645 (20.7%) seronegative participants, 12 of whom asymptomatic (risk ratio [RR] 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07 to 0.66). Seropositive HCWs less frequently reported impaired olfaction/taste (6/144, 4.2% vs. 588/4674, 12.6%, RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15–0.73), chills (19/144, 13.2% vs. 1040/4674, 22.3%, RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39–0.90), and limb/muscle pain (28/144, 19.4% vs. 1335/4674, 28.6%, RR 0.68 95% CI 0.49–0.95). Impaired olfaction/taste and limb/muscle pain also discriminated best between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 results.

The major technical risk of this procedure is staple line dehiscence. Some surgeons are reluctant to place a nasogastric tube (NGT) blindly due to the perceived risk of damage to the staple line. We sought to determine whether such concern was warranted. METHODS: A porcine tissue model (Animal Technologies, Inc., Tyler, TX) was used. Sleeve gastrectomy was performed using a flexible gastroscope as a guide for the Endo GIA stapler (Covidien, New Haven, CT) in an identical fashion used in our patients. The specimen was then placed in a plastic model of the thorax (VATS Trainers, LLC. Lansing, MI). The NGT was blindly advanced to 55 cm for a total of 50 passes, and to 75 cm for another 50 passes. Endoscopy with water submersion was performed to evaluate for injury or leak. RESULTS: After multiple passes of the NGT, no significant injuries, leaks, or perforations were observed to the gastric model, except for several small petechiae of the gastric mucosa, the largest measuring approximately 3 mm. None were of full thickness or penetrated the mucosa. The staple line showed no evidence of trauma. CONCLUSION: In this porcine model, blind NGT placement was not associated with significant mucosal injury or any damage to the sleeve gastrectomy staple line.","Fabian, Thomas; Robinson, Tyler; Naile, Lauren; Smith, Michael P; McErlean, Mara",Surg Endosc,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-06760-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941548/,91

644074,Selection of adjuvants for vaccines targeting specific pathogens,2019-04-22,"Rapid tests for active SARS-CoV-2 infections rely on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR uses reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) and amplification of specific DNA (primer and probe) targets using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The technology makes rapid and specific identification of the virus possible based on sequence homology of nucleic acid sequence and is much faster than tissue culture or animal cell models. However the technique can lose sensitivity over time as the virus evolves and the target sequences diverge from the selective primer sequences. Different primer sequences have been adopted in different geographic regions. As we rely on these existing RT-PCR primers to track and manage the spread of the Coronavirus, it is imperative to understand how SARS-CoV-2 mutations, over time and geographically, diverge from existing primers used today. In this study, we analyze the performance of the SARS-CoV-2 primers in use today by measuring the number of mismatches between primer sequence and genome targets over time and spatially. We find that there is a growing number of mismatches, an increase by 2% per month, as well as a high specificity of virus based on geographic location.","Nayar, Gowri; Seabolt, Edward E.; Kunitomi, Mark; Agarwal, Akshay; Beck, Kristen L.; Mukherjee, Vandana; Kaufman, James H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.26.424429,91

The occurrence of these diseases is usually accompanied by the lack of vaccines and dedicated therapies leaving prevention as the best strategy to adopt. In that context, and apart from confinement and physical distancing measures, an increase in hygiene actions, namely hand and surface cleaning and disinfection can reduce the infection spread originated from our day-to-day routines. However, during crisis situations the high disinfectants demand can very likely lead to having them running out of stock. This impels many individuals and companies to produce their own disinfectants. Here, we explore the main components of a disinfection formulation, both for hand-rub and surface cleaning. Alcohol and non-alcohol based formulations are described, including the possibility to fine tune the properties of the final product in order to increase public acceptance while maintaining product efficacy. The action mechanisms of the main active principles are also described conjugating information from experimental and theoretical data. Overall, the main aspects to develop a disinfectant formulation are addressed, as well as their function, helping formulation developers to better understand the impact of their choices.","A L Filipe, Hugo; Fiuza, Sónia M; Henriques, César A; Antunes, Filipe E",International journal of pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.121139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34592397/,91

EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TSH-R-Ab), foremost the stimulatory TSH-R-Ab, are a specific biomarker for GD. Their measurement assists in the differential diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and offers accurate and rapid diagnosis of GD. Thyroid ultrasound is a sensitive imaging tool for GD. Worldwide, thionamides are the favored treatment (12-18 months) of newly diagnosed GD with Methimazole (MMI) as the preferred drug. Patients with persistently high TSH-R-Ab and/or persistent hyperthyroidism at 18 months, or with a relapse after completing a course of MMI, can opt for a definitive therapy with radioactive iodine (RAI) or total thyroidectomy (TX). Continued long-term, low-dose MMI administration is a valuable and safe alternative. Patient choice, both at initial presentation of GD and at recurrence, should be emphasized. Propylthiouracil is preferred to MMI during the first trimester of pregnancy. TX is best performed by a high-volume thyroid surgeon. RAI should be avoided in GD patients with active GO, especially in smokers. Recently, a promising therapy with an anti-insulin-like growth factor-1 monoclonal antibody for patients with active/severe GO was FDA-approved. COVID-19 infection is a risk factor for poorly controlled hyperthyroidism, which contributes to the infection-related mortality risk. If GO is not severe, systemic steroid treatment should be postponed during COVID-19 while local treatment and preventive measures are offered. CONCLUSIONS: A clear trend towards serological diagnosis and medical treatment of GD has emerged.","Kahaly, George J",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaa646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929476/,91

Given the limited success in meeting most of the Aichi Targets, this new framework must adopt a different approach. A key challenge the GBF must address is its implementation at national scales. Four ways this implementation challenge can be addressed include: The framework must move away from numerical targets to pursue positive trends in biodiversity, through adopting a “vectors of change” approach; The framework should be structured to focus on ecosystems and processes; The framework should synergise more extensively with existing biodiversity-relevant global agreements to maximise leverage and reduce overlap of resource use; The framework must adopt a much stronger theory of change than is in the current GBF Draft, to serve as the roadmap governments can use in upscaling their implementation of biodiversity conservation, sustainable use and benefit sharing. Finally, the GBF must become a “learning framework”, committed to facilitating and enabling governments to each meet their specific biodiversity challenges, while sharing back experiences with the global community, leading ultimately to realising the 2050 CBD vision of people living in harmony with nature.","Phang, Sui C.; Failler, Pierre; Bridgewater, Peter",Biodivers Conserv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836919/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-020-02009-2,91

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 166 COVID‐19 patients at Tongji Hospital (Wuhan) from February 8 to March 21, 2020. Clinical characteristics and outcomes (as of April 4, 2020) were compared among control (group 1), secondary hyperglycaemia (group 2: no diabetes history, FPG levels ≥7.0 mmol/L once and HbA1c values <6.5%) and diabetic (group 3) patients. RESULTS: Compared to group 1, groups 2 and 3 had higher rates of leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, eosinopenia, and levels of sCRP, ferritin and d‐dimer (P < 0.05 for all). Group 2 patients have higher levels of LDH, prevalence of liver dysfunction and increased IL‐8 than those in group 1, a higher prevalence of increased IL‐8 was found in group 2 than in group 3 (P < 0.05 for all). The proportions of critical patients in groups 2 and 3 were significantly higher compared to group 1 (38.1%, 32.8% vs. 9.5%, P < 0.05 for both). Groups 2 and 3 had significantly longer hospital stays than group 1, which was nearly one week longer. The composite outcomes risks were 5.47 (1.56–19.82) and 2.61 (0.86–7.88) times greater in group 2 and 3 than in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia in both diabetes and secondary hyperglycemia patients with COVID‐19 may indicate poor prognoses.

Well-designed PCR primers rarely cross-react with other analytes, and specificities seen during test validation are often 100%. However, analytical specificities measured during validation may not reflect real-world performance across the entire testing process. Here, we use the unique environment of SARS-CoV-2 screening among otherwise well individuals to examine the false positivity rate of high throughput so-called 'sample-to-answer' nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) on three commercial assays: the Hologic Panther Fusion(R), Hologic Aptima(R) transcription mediated amplification (TMA), and Roche cobas(R) 6800. We used repetitive sampling of the same person as the gold standard to determine test specificity rather than retesting of the same sample. We examined 451 people repetitively sampled over 7 months via nasal swab, comprising 7,242 results. During the study period there were twelve positive tests (0.17%) from 9 people. Eight positive tests (0.11%, five individuals) were considered bona fide true positives based on repeat positives or outside testing and epidemiological data. One positive test had no follow-up testing or metadata and could not be adjudicated. Three positive tests (three individuals) did not repeat as positive on a subsequent collection, nor did the original positive specimen test positive on an orthogonal platform. We consider these three tests false positives and estimate the overall false positive rate of high-throughput automated, sample-to-answer NAAT testing to be approximately 0.041% (3/7242). These data help laboratorians, epidemiologists, and regulators understand specificity and positive predictive value associated with high-throughput NAAT testing.","Chandler, C.

This study intends (1) to examine whether emotional eating (EE) occurred during the pandemic triggered by disease concerns and (2) to explore the associations among EE, dietary changes, and gestational weight gain (GWG). Based on an online survey, 640 new mothers who experienced the lockdown in their third trimester were recruited from seven provinces in China. EE was evaluated with the Chinese version of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, EE domain. A self-designed e-questionnaire was used to collect the data of participants on the sociodemographic characteristics, concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, maternity information, physical activities, and dietary changes during lockdown. The results show that the average EE score was 26.5 ± 8.3, and women living in a severely affected area, who are very worried about the pandemic and who had less physical activity had a higher tendency of EE. Although there is a dietary pattern changed during pandemic, the average GWG in the studied group was in the normal range. However, a higher EE score was associated with a significant excess of GWG in women not from Wuhan (EE score 33–65 vs. 13–22: adjusted Odd Ratio (OR), 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.90, 1.08–3.32). The sensitivity analysis that additionally adjusted for the pregestational body mass index and gestational metabolic disease was consistent with this result. The mediation model was also examined and showed that, after adjusting for living area and exercise, EE was associated with significantly increased consumption of cereals (EE score 33–65 vs. 13–22: adjusted OR, 95% CI = 2.22, 1.29–3.82) and oil (EE score 33–65 vs. 13–22: adjusted OR, 95% CI = 3.03, 1.06–8.69) but decreased consumption of fish and seafood (EE score 33–65 vs. 13–22: adjusted OR, 95% CI = 1.88, 1.14–3.11; 23–32 vs. 13–22: adjusted OR, 95% CI = 1.79, 1.20–2.66). In conclusion, this study indicated that EE occurred in a proportional number of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic and is associated with excess GWG mediated by increased intake of certain foods. The findings suggest the need for psychosocial and nutritional education and interventions during pregnancy checkups. Further studies are needed to determine modifiable psychosocial predictors and potential nutritional concerns in pregnant women during disease outbreaks.","Zhang, Jian; Zhang, Yumei; Huo, Shanshan; Ma, Yidi; Ke, Yalei; Wang, Peiyu; Zhao, Ai",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32731389/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12082250,91

We previously found a diversity of paramyxoviruses within a small, captive colony of E. helvum after it had been closed to contact with other bats for 5 years. In this study, we used under-roost urine collection to further investigate the paramyxovirus diversity and ecology in this colony, which had been closed to the outside for 10 years at the time of sampling. By sampling urine weekly throughout an entire year, we investigated possible seasonal patterns of shedding of virus or viral RNA. Using a generic paramyxovirus L-gene PCR, we detected eight distinct paramyxovirus RNA sequences. Six distinct sequences were detected using a Henipavirus-specific PCR that targeted a different region of the L-gene. Sequence detection had a bi-annual pattern, with the greatest peak in July, although different RNA sequences appeared to have different shedding patterns. No significant associations were detected between sequence detection and birthing season, environmental temperature or humidity, and no signs of illness were detected in any of the bats in the colony during the period of sample collection.","Jolma, Elli Rosa; Gibson, Louise; Suu-Ire, Richard D.; Fleischer, Grace; Asumah, Samuel; Languon, Sylvester; Restif, Olivier; Wood, James L.

647561,Hantavirus Immunology of Rodent Reservoirs: Current Status and Future Directions,2014-03-14,"B lymphocytes have a central role in autoimmune diseases, which are often defined by specific autoantibody patterns and feature a loss of B cell tolerance. A prototypic disease associated with B cell hyperactivity is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In patients with SLE, the loss of B cell tolerance to autoantigens is controlled in a cell-intrinsic manner by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which sense nucleic acids in endosomes. TLR7 drives the extrafollicular B cell response and the germinal centre reaction that are involved in autoantibody production and disease pathogenesis. Surprisingly, TLR9 seems to protect against SLE, even though it is required for the production of autoantibodies recognizing double-stranded DNA-associated antigens, which are abundant in SLE and are a hallmark of this disease. The protective function of TLR9 is at least partly mediated by its capacity to limit the stimulatory activity of TLR7. The roles of TLR7 and TLR9 in the effector function of B cells in lupus-like disease and in patients with SLE, and the unique features of TLR signalling in B cells, suggest that targeting TLR signalling in SLE might be therapeutically beneficial.","Fillatreau, Simon; Manfroi, Benoît; Dörner, Thomas",Nat Rev Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33339987/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-020-00544-4,91

Public Health women and men are now asked to act in task forces, media broadcasts, webinars and consulting activities. In phase 2 of this epidemic - which is about to begin when this volume is to be published - the role of Public Health professionals could become even more relevant. However, this unexpected season must be managed with seriousness and intelligence, capitalizing it also for the future. If our Post-Graduate Schools of Public Health (""Igiene e Medicina Preventiva""), our scientific associations, our academic lecturers and our officers do not prove to be up to the situation, a dull future for the discipline might very well be. On the contrary, if as we all hope, we will be able to ride the wave of a dramatic health crisis, transforming it into a relevant scientific and professional opportunity, then we will be able to build on the post-COVID-19 a cutting-edge, a more attractive, relevant and modern discipline. This Supplement of Acta Biomedica, planned before the onset of the epidemic emergency in Italy, but already successful in presenting two papers on COVID-19, is further proof of how current and lively our discipline is.","Signorelli, Carlo; Fara, Gaetano Maria",Acta Biomed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32275261/; https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i3-s.9507,91
648381,"Virtual screening, ADME/Tox predictions and the drug repurposing concept for future use of old drugs against the COVID-19",2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), known as Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), has caused the sixth world's public health emergency. Healthcare staff, as the frontline population fighting the pandemic, are exposed to a high risk of infection. Therefore, developing a protective intervention for medical staff is of significant importance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the effectiveness and safety of recombinant human interferon alpha (rhIFN-α) nasal drops for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through administering it to medical staff. METHODS: This was a prospective open-label clinical trial with parallel intervention assignment conducted on 2944 medical staff including both doctors and nurses from Taihe Hospital, Shiyan City, Hubei Province, China from January 21, 2020 to July 30, 2020. The participants were bifurcated into two groups of low risk and high risk groups according to the level of direct exposure to COVID-19 patients. The individuals of the low-risk group received rhIFN-α nasal drops for one month in addition to first level protection, and the high-risk group received a combination of rhIFN-α nasal drops coupled with thymosin-α1 with either second or third-level protection protocol. Moreover, the new-outset of COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed by chest computed tomography (CT), after thirty days, was the primary outcome. The adverse reactions were recorded in all participants. RESULTS: 2415 of 2944 individuals belonged to the low-risk group, while 529 to the high-risk group. There was no COVID-19 pneumonia in either of the group after thirty days. The pulmonary CT scans were negative for COVID-19 pneumonia in both the groups with no new clinical symptoms. No serious adverse event was observed during the course of the intervention. CONCLUSION: The rhIFN-α nasal drops along with augmented safeguards based on standard physical isolation could effectively protect medical staff against COVID-19 pneumonia.","Meng, Zhongji; Wang, Tongyu; Chen, Li; Chen, Xinhe; Li, Longti; Qin, Xueqin; Li, Hai; Luo, Jie",Curr Top Med Chem,https://doi.org/10.2174/1568026621666210429083050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33970846/,91

A total of 53 patients with CNS disorders after allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. A total of 35 patients were diagnosed as CNS infections, including 28 viral, 2 bacterial, 1 fungal, 3 mixed infections, and 1 infection with unknown pathogen. Among these 35 patients with CNS infections, mNGS identified 5 patients who were not identified by conventional testing. For the remaining 30 infections, mNGS made concurrent diagnoses with conventional testing in 29, while 1 was diagnosed according to the good response to the antimicrobial treatment without etiological evidence. The presence of Aspergillus detected by mNGS only in one patient was considered false positive due to lack of validation. The sensitivity of mNGS and conventional testing for diagnosing CNS infections post transplant were 97.1% and 82.9%, respectively (P = 0.106), while the specificity of mNGS and conventional testing were 94.4% and 100%, respectively (P = 1.000). These results suggest that mNGS might be a promising technology for diagnosis of CNS infections post transplant.

Despite the current optimized targeted therapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors the treatment of metastatic melanoma is unsatisfactory. Because of the poor prognosis of advanced melanoma there is an urgent need to identify new biomarkers to differentiate melanoma cells from normal melanocytes, to stratify patients according to their risk, and to identify subgroups of patients that require close follow-up or more aggressive therapy. Furthermore, melanoma progression has been associated with the dysregulation of cell adhesion molecules. We have reviewed the literature and have discussed the important role of the expression of the carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) in the development of melanoma. Thus, novel insights into CEACAM1 may lead to promising strategies in melanoma treatment, in monitoring melanoma patients, in assessing the response to immunotherapy, and in completing the standard immunohistochemical panel used in melanoma examination.","Turcu, Gabriela; Nedelcu, Roxana Ioana; Ion, Daniela Adriana; Brînzea, Alice; Cioplea, Mirela Daniela; Jilaveanu, Lucia Beatrice; Zurac, Sabina Andrada",Dis Markers,https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/9406319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27642217/,91

652496,Coccidiosis,2012-12-10,"A local disruption can propagate to forward and downward through the material flow and eventually influence the entire supply chain network (SCN). This phenomenon of ripple effect, immensely existing in practice, has received great interest in recent years. Moreover, forward and backward disruption propagations became major stressors for SCNs during the COVID-19 pandemic triggered by simultaneous and sequential supply and demand disruptions. However, current literature has paid less attention to the different impacts of the directions of disruption propagation. This study examines the disruption propagation through simulating simple interaction rules of firms inside the SCN. Specifically, an agent-based computational model is developed to delineate the supply chain disruption propagation behavior. Then, we conduct multi-level quantitative analysis to explore the effects of forward and backward disruption propagation, moderated by network structure, network-level health and node-level vulnerability. Our results demonstrate that it is practically important to differentiate between forward and backward disruption propagation, as they are distinctive in the associated mitigation strategies and in the effects on network and individual firm performance. Forward disruption propagation generally can be mitigated by substitute and backup supply and has greater impact on firms serving the assembly role and on the supply/assembly networks, whereas backward disruption propagation is normally mitigated by flexible operation and distribution and has bigger impact on firms serving the distribution role and on distribution networks. We further analyze the investment strategies in a dual-focal supply network under disruption propagation. We provide propositions to facilitate decision-making and summarize important managerial implications.","Li, Yuhong; Chen, Kedong; Collignon, Stephane; Ivanov, Dmitry",Eur J Oper Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221720308572?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2020.09.053; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377221720308572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071441/,91
652512,Pathology: The Clinical Description of Human Disease,2012-08-10,"COVID-19 symptoms vary from silence to rapid death, the latter mediated by both a cytokine storm and a thrombotic storm. SARS-CoV (2003) induces Cox-2 catalyzing the synthesis, from highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), of eicosanoids and docosanoids that mediate both inflammation and thrombosis. HUFA balance between arachidonic acid (AA) and other HUFA is a likely determinant of net signaling to induce a healthy or runaway physiological response. AA levels are determined by non-protein coding regulatory polymorphisms that mostly affect the expression of FADS1, located in the FADS gene cluster on chromosome 11. Major and minor haplotypes in Europeans, and a specific functional insertion-deletion (Indel), rs66698963, consistently show major differences in circulating AA (>50%) and in the balance between AA and other HUFA (47-84%) in free living humans; the indel is evolutionarily selective, probably based on diet. The pattern of fatty acid responses is fully consistent with specific genetic modulation of desaturation at the FADS1-mediated 20:3→20:4 step. Well established principles of net tissue HUFA levels indicate that the high linoleic acid and low alpha-linoleic acid in populations drive the net balance of HUFA for any individual. We predict that fast desaturators (insertion allele at rs66698963; major haplotype in Europeans) are predisposed to higher risk and pathological responses to SARS-CoV-2 could be reduced with high dose omega-3 HUFA.","Kothapalli, Kumar S.D.; Park, Hui Gyu; Brenna, J.

653322,Nrf2 Expression Modifies Influenza A Entry and Replication in Nasal Epithelial Cells,2011-07-01,"Abstract The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been associated with worse outcomes in several patient populations, including the elderly and those with chronic comorbidities. Data from previous pandemics and seasonal influenza suggest that pregnant women may be at increased risk for infection-associated morbidity and mortality. Physiological changes in normal pregnancy and metabolic and vascular changes of high-risk pregnancies may affect pathogenesis or exacerbate the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is upregulated in normal pregnancy. Upregulation of ACE2 mediates conversion of Angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor) to Angiotensin 1-7 (vasodilator) and contributes to relatively low blood pressures, despite upregulation of other components of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system. As a result of higher ACE2 expression, pregnant women may be at an elevated risk of complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upon binding to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 causes its downregulation, thus lowering Angiotensin 1-7 levels, which can mimic/worsen vasoconstriction, inflammation, and pro-coagulopathic effects that occur in preeclampsia. Indeed, early reports suggest that, among other adverse outcomes, preeclampsia may be more common in pregnant women with COVID-19. Medical therapy, during both pregnancy and breast feeding, relies on medications with proven safety, but safety data are often missing for medications in the early stages of clinical trials. We summarize guidelines for medical/obstetric care and outline future directions for optimization of treatment and preventive strategies for pregnant patients with COVID-19 with the understanding that relevant data are limited and rapidly changing.","Narang, Kavita; Enninga, Elizabeth Ann L.; Gunaratne, Madugodaralalage D.S.

We describe among short‐term and long‐term residents at three NHs in Michigan the outbreak identification process, universal testing, point prevalence of COVID‐19, and subsequent containment efforts, outcomes, and challenges. DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: Three NHs in southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: All residents (N = 215) at three NHs (total beds = 356) affiliated with a large academic healthcare system. METHODS: Upon detection of confirmed cases within the facility, each NH in collaboration and consultation with local hospital, public health officials, and parent corporation implemented immediate facility‐wide testing and the following intervention measures: cohorting of COVID‐19 positive residents; communication regarding testing and results with residents, healthcare professionals, and families; personal protective equipment reeducation and use throughout facilities; and dedicated staffing for infected patients cohorted in a dedicated COVID‐19 wing. We collected patient data regarding demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, hospitalization, and 14‐day outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 29 cases of COVID‐19 were identified at three participating NHs. Nineteen cases of COVID‐19 were identified through symptom‐triggered testing from March 23 to April 23, 2020; 10 (4.7%) additional cases were identified through universal testing of 215 residents conducted from April 7 to 15, 2020. The hospitalization rate was 37.9%. The case fatality rate was 20.7% (6/29); these patients had multiple comorbidities. No residents who tested positive through the point‐prevalence survey required hospitalization, and five were discharged home within 14 days. CONCLUSION: Proactive and coordinated steps between NH medical directors and administrators, referral hospitals including their laboratories, and local public health officials are necessary to rapidly respond to an outbreak and limit the transmission of COVID‐19. This coordinated public health approach may save lives, minimize the burden to the healthcare system, and reduce healthcare costs.","Montoya, Ana; Jenq, Grace; Mills, John P.; Beal, Jennifer; Diviney Chun, Erin; Newton, Duane; Gibson, Kristen; Mantey, Julia; Hurst, Kristen; Jones, Karen; Mody, Lona",J Am Geriatr Soc,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33034039/,91

CD4 helper cell responses were skewed predominantly toward a T (h) 1 response in blood, lung, and lymph nodes. We observed the generation of germinal center T (fh) cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and a corresponding early appearance of antiviral serum IgG antibodies.

The precise pathophysiological mechanism causing this symptom is unknown. This report describes a case of sudden hearing loss in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old woman with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, was examined. She experienced sudden hearing loss in her right ear and disabling tinnitus. She underwent combined corticosteroid therapy (oral and intratympanic), resulting in an isolated improvement of 250 kHz in the right ear (from 60 dB, the threshold became 15 dB) and of 4, 6, and 8 kHz in the left ear (from 35 dB, 20 dB, and 35 dB, the thresholds became 15 dB, 5 dB and 20 dB, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, hearing loss appears to be a possible sequela to SARS-CoV-2 infection and deserves attention because it is a medical emergency requiring immediate clinical treatment. Additional studies are needed to assess the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in and the long-term characteristics of this type of hearing loss.","Lamounier, Pauliana; Gonçalves, Victória Franco; Ramos, Hugo Valter Lisboa; Gobbo, Débora Aparecida; Teixeira, Racine Procópio; dos Reis, Paulo César; Bahmad, Fayez; Costa, Claudiney Cândido",Am J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.927519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139689/,91

Patients and Methods From April 3 to June 2, 2020, the US FDA Expanded Access Program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfused a convenience sample of 20,000 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Results The incidence of all serious adverse events was low; these included transfusion reactions (n=89; <1%), thromboembolic or thrombotic events (n=87; <1%), and cardiac events (n=680, ∼3%). Notably, the vast majority of the thromboembolic or thrombotic events (n=55) and cardiac events (n=562) were judged to be unrelated to the plasma transfusion per se. The seven-day mortality rate was 8.6% (8.2%, 9.0%), and was higher among more critically-ill patients relative to less ill counterparts, including patients admitted to the intensive care unit vs. not admitted (10.5% vs. 6.0%), mechanically ventilated vs. not ventilated (12.1% vs. 6.2%), and with septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction/failure vs. those without dysfunction/failure (14.0% vs. 7.6%).

This study aims to compare participation in Australia’s National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NBCSP) in those with SMI and those in the general population. We will also investigate treatment pathways after diagnosis to determine whether treatment variations could explain differences in CRC mortality. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will undertake a retrospective cohort study of Australians using linked administrative data to assess differences in screening and cancer care between those with and without SMI, aged 50–74 years on or after 1 January 2006. People with SMI will be defined using antipsychotic medication prescription data. The comparison group will be people enrolled in Medicare (Australia’s universal healthcare system) who have not been prescribed antipsychotic medication. Data on outcomes (NBCSP participation, follow-up colonoscopy, CRC incidence and CRC-cause and all-cause mortality) and confounders will be obtained from national-based and state-based administrative health datasets. All people in New South Wales, aged 50–74 with a new diagnosis of CRC on or after 1 January 2006, will be ascertained to examine stage at diagnosis and cancer treatment in those with and without SMI. Poisson regression will be used to calculate incidence rates and rate ratios for each outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained from the University of Queensland Human Research Ethics Committee, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Ethics Committee and data custodians from every Australian State/Territory.

657812,Revisiting the Elusive Hepatitis C Vaccine,2021-02-02,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected persons compared with symptomatic individuals based on a scoping review of available literature. DESIGN: Rapid scoping review of peer-reviewed literature from 1 January to 5 December 2020 using the LitCovid database and the Cochrane library. SETTING: International studies on the infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. PARTICIPANTS: Studies were selected for inclusion if they defined asymptomatics as a separate cohort distinct from presymptomatics and if they provided a quantitative measure of the infectiousness of asymptomatics relative to symptomatics. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: PCR result (PCR studies), the rate of infection (mathematical modelling studies) and secondary attack rate (contact tracing studies) - in each case from asymptomatic in comparison with symptomatic individuals. RESULTS: There are only a limited number of published studies that report estimates of relative infectiousness of asymptomatic compared with symptomatic individuals. 12 studies were included after the screening process. Significant differences exist in the definition of infectiousness. PCR studies in general show no difference in shedding levels between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; however, the number of study subjects is generally limited. Two modelling studies estimate relative infectiousness to be 0.43 and 0.57, but both of these were more reflective of the infectiousness of undocumented rather than asymptomatic cases. The results from contact tracing studies include estimates of relative infectiousness of 0, but with insufficient evidence to conclude that it is significantly different from 1. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable heterogeneity in estimates of relative infectiousness highlighting the need for further investigation of this important parameter. It is not possible to provide any conclusive estimate of relative infectiousness, as the estimates from the reviewed studies varied between 0 and 1.","McEvoy, David; McAloon, Conor; Collins, Aine; Hunt, Kevin; Butler, Francis; Byrne, Andrew; Casey-Bryars, Miriam; Barber, Ann; Griffin, John; Lane, Elizabeth Ann; Wall, Patrick; More, Simon John",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947725/,91

This protocol describes the methodology adopted to evaluate implementation processes and early effects of PM-JAY in seven Indian states. The study adopts a mixed and multi-methods concurrent triangulation design including three components: 1. demand-side household study, including a structured survey and qualitative elements, to quantify and understand PM-JAY reach and its effect on insurance awareness, health service utilization, and financial protection; 2. supply-side hospital-based survey encompassing both quantitative and qualitative elements to assess the effect of PM-JAY on quality of service delivery and to explore healthcare providers’ experiences with scheme implementation; and 3. process documentation to examine implementation processes in selected states transitioning from either no or prior health insurance to PM-JAY. Descriptive statistics and quasi-experimental methods will be used to analyze quantitative data, while thematic analysis will be used to analyze qualitative data. The study design presented represents the first effort to jointly evaluate implementation processes and early effects of the largest government-funded health insurance scheme ever launched in India.","Allegri, Manuela De; Srivastava, Swati; Strupat, Christoph; Brenner, Stephan; Parmar, Divya; Parisi, Diletta; Walsh, Caitlin; Mahajan, Sahil; Neogi, Rupak; Ziegler, Susanne; Basu, Sharmishtha; Jain, Nishant",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17217812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33114480/,91

The components of the fibrinolytic system are well established and are associated with a wide array of physiological and pathophysiological processes. The aberrant expression of several components, especially urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), its cognate receptor uPAR, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), has shown a direct correlation with increased tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastasis. As a result, targeting the fibrinolytic system has been of great interest in the field of cancer biology. Even though there is a plethora of encouraging preclinical evidence on the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting the key oncogenic components of the fibrinolytic system, none of them made it from “bench to bedside” due to a limited number of clinical trials on them. This review summarizes our existing understanding of the various diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting the fibrinolytic system during cancer.","Mahmood, Niaz; Rabbani, Shafaat A.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22094358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33921923/,91

We show that even under moderately heavy patient load (>500 countrywide hospitalized severely-ill patients; the Israeli Ministry of Health defined 800 severely-ill patients as the maximum capacity allowing adequate treatment), in-hospital mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 significantly increased compared to periods of lower patient load (250–500 severely-ill patients): 14-day mortality rates were 22.1% (Standard Error 3.1%) higher (mid-September to mid-October) and 27.2% (Standard Error 3.3%) higher (mid-December to mid-January). We further show this higher mortality rate cannot be attributed to changes in the patient population during periods of heavier load.","Rossman, Hagai; Meir, Tomer; Somer, Jonathan; Shilo, Smadar; Gutman, Rom; Ben Arie, Asaf; Segal, Eran; Shalit, Uri; Gorfine, Malka",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33771988/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22214-z,91

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and trial registries were searched in April 2020. INCLUSION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that compared a community-based hand hygiene intervention (soap and water, or sanitiser) with a control, or trials that compared sanitiser with soap and water, and measured outcomes of ARI, ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza or related consequences. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts for inclusion and extracted data. RESULTS: Eighteen trials were included. When meta-analysed, three trials of soap and water versus control found a non-significant increase in ARI events (risk ratio (RR) 1.23, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.93); six trials of sanitiser versus control found a significant reduction in ARI events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89). When hand hygiene dose was plotted against ARI relative risk, no clear dose–response relationship was observable. Four trials were head-to-head comparisons of sanitiser and soap and water but too heterogeneous to pool: two found a significantly greater reduction in the sanitiser group compared with the soap group and two found no significant difference between the intervention arms. CONCLUSIONS: Adequately performed hand hygiene, with either soap or sanitiser, reduces the risk of ARI virus transmission; however, direct and indirect evidence suggest sanitiser might be more effective in practice.","Hoffmann, Tammy; Bakhit, Mina; Krzyzaniak, Natalia; Del Mar, Chris; Scott, Anna Mae; Glasziou, Paul",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408031/,91
662190,Avian Influenza: a global threat needing a global solution,2008-11-13,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is the second global health emergency the world has faced in less than two decades, after the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009–2010. Spread of pandemics is frequently associated with increased population size and population density. The geographical scales (national, regional or local scale) are key elements in determining the correlation between demographic factors and the spread of outbreaks. The aims of this study were: (a) to collect the Mexican data related to the two pandemics; (b) to create thematic maps using federal and municipal geographic scales; (c) to investigate the correlations between the pandemics indicators (numbers of contagious and deaths) and demographic patterns (population size and density). METHODS: The demographic patterns of all Mexican Federal Entities and all municipalities were taken from the database of “Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía” (INEGI). The data of “Centro Nacional de Programas Preventivos y Control de Enfermedades” (CENAPRECE) and the geoportal of Mexico Government were also used in our analysis. The results are presented by means of tables, graphs and thematic maps. A Spearman correlation was used to assess the associations between the pandemics indicators and the demographic patterns. Correlations with a p value < 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: The confirmed cases (ccH1N1) and deaths (dH1N1) registered during the H1N1 Influenza pandemic were 72.4 thousand and 1.2 thousand respectively. Mexico City (CDMX) was the most affected area by the pandemic with 8,502 ccH1N1 and 152 dH1N1. The ccH1N1 and dH1N1 were positively correlated to demographic patterns; p-values higher than the level of marginal significance were found analyzing the % ccH1N1 and the % dH1N1 vs the population density. The COVID-19 pandemic data indicated 75.0 million confirmed cases (ccCOVID-19) and 1.6 million deaths (dCOVID-19) worldwide, as of date. The CDMX, where 264,330 infections were recorded, is the national epicenter of the pandemic. The federal scale did not allow to observe the correlation between demographic data and pandemic indicators; hence the next step was to choose a more detailed geographical scale (municipal basis). The ccCOVID-19 and dCOVID-19 (municipal basis) were highly correlated with demographic patterns; also the % ccCOVID-19 and % dCOVID-19 were moderately correlated with demographic patterns. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of COVID-19 pandemic is much greater than the H1N1 Influenza pandemic. The CDMX was the national epicenter in both pandemics. The federal scale did not allow to evaluate the correlation between exanimated demographic variables and the spread of infections, but the municipal basis allowed the identification of local variations and “red zones” such as the delegation of Iztapalapa and Gustavo A. Madero in CDMX.","Sarria-Guzmán, Yohanna; Bernal, Jaime; De Biase, Michele; Muñoz-Arenas, Ligia C.; González-Jiménez, Francisco Erik; Mosso, Clemente; De León-Lorenzana, Arit; Fusaro, Carmine",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33828926/,91
663040,Intrathoracic Mass in a Cat,2008-03-05,"Background: Passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma (CP) is a potential treatment for COVID-19 for which evidence from controlled clinical trials is lacking. Methods: We conducted a multi-center, randomized clinical trial in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. All patients received standard of care treatment, including off-label use of marketed medicines, and were randomized 1:1 to receive one dose (250-300 mL) of CP from donors with IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in categories 5, 6 or 7 of the COVID-19 ordinal scale at day 15. Results: The trial was stopped after first interim analysis due to the fall in recruitment related to pandemic control. With 81 patients randomized, there were no patients progressing to mechanical ventilation or death among the 38 patients assigned to receive plasma (0%) versus 6 out of 43 patients (14%) progressing in control arm. Mortality rates were 0% vs 9.3% at days 15 and 29 for the active and control groups, respectively (log-rank p=0.056). No significant differences were found in secondary endpoints. At inclusion, patients had a median time of 8 days (IQR, 6-9) of symptoms and 49,4% of them were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Conclusions: Convalescent plasma could be superior to standard of care in avoiding progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The strong dependence of results on a limited number of events in the control group prevents drawing firm conclusions about CP efficacy from this trial.

We conducted a retrospective study of infants in this age group who were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Asymptomatic infants who were identified through routine testing following delivery to COVID-19-positive mothers were excluded. We classified infants according to their presentation: asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, moderately symptomatic, and severely/critically symptomatic. A total of 36 infants were included. Of them, two were asymptomatic and four had severe/critical presentation. Of the severely symptomatic infants, two were considered as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and there was one death. One infant in the severe symptomatic group presented with cardiac failure, with the possibility of congenital infection. Another infant presented with cardiogenic shock. None of these infants received antiviral medication. The study found that infants ≤ 90 days can present with a severe form of COVID-19 disease.

The disease can be effectively prevented by whole inactivated virus vaccines. Here, we investigated the innate immune profile induced in vitro by the antigen component of the vaccines, inactivated TBEV (I-TBEV), to gain insights into the mechanism of action of the TBE vaccine as compared to the live virus. To this end, we exposed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to inactivated and live TBEV and assessed cellular responses by RNA sequencing. Both inactivated and live TBEV significantly induced an interferon-dominated gene signature and an increased RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) expression. Using pathway-specific inhibitors, we assessed the involvement of pattern recognition receptors in the sensing of inactivated or live TBEV. Only RLR pathway inhibition significantly suppressed the downstream cascade induced by I-TBEV, while responses to the replicating virus were impacted by the inhibition of RIG-I-like, as well as Toll-like, receptors. Our results show that inactivated and live TBEV predominantly engaged an interferon response in our in vitro PBMC platform, and indicate RLRs as the main pattern recognition receptors involved in I-TBEV sensing.","Signorazzi, Aurora; Pennings, Jeroen L.

Methods: Arkansas and Kentucky county-level COVID-19 cumulative case count data (March 6-November 7, 2020) were obtained. Rt was estimated using the R package 'EpiEstim', by county, region (Delta, non-Delta, Appalachian, non-Appalachian), and policy measures. Results: The Rt was initially high, falling below 1 in May or June depending on the region, before stabilizing around 1 in the later months. The median Rt for Arkansas and Kentucky at the end of the study were 1.15 (95% credible interval [CrI], 1.13, 1.18) and 1.10 (95% CrI, 1.08, 1.12), respectively, and remained above 1 for the non-Appalachian region. Rt decreased when facial coverings were mandated, changing by -10.64% (95% CrI, -10.60%, -10.70%) in Arkansas and -5.93% (95% CrI, -4.31%, -7.65%) in Kentucky. The trends in Rt estimates were mostly associated with the implementation and relaxation of social distancing measures. Conclusions: Arkansas and Kentucky maintained a median Rt above 1 during the entire study period.

However, the studies on these drugs are small, retrospective, uncontrolled and use different endpoints. Therefore, it remains unknown which treatment is superior. We retrospectively evaluated 68 consecutive patients treated with infliximab for aGvHD. We adhered to recently proposed guidelines for aGvHD trials and thus evaluated response on day 7 and 28. Furthermore, we assessed the composite endpoint 6 months freedom from treatment failure (6MFTF). The majority of patients had grade III-IV aGvHD. We found that 41 patients (60%) responded on day 7 and 31 patients (46%) on day 28. Twenty-four patients (35%) achieved 6MFTF. The main reasons for failure within 6 months were death (n = 31) or additional immunosuppression (n = 16). By six and 24 months, 44 and 34% of the patients were alive respectively. Patients with response to infliximab on day 7 and 28 had significantly higher overall survival (OS) probability than non-responders. We show that response on day 7 and 28 identifies high and low risk groups.

667895,Cancer therapy tool informs COVID-19 vaccines,2020-04-28,"Despite its overwhelming clinical importance for understanding and mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic, the protein-coding gene content of the SARS-CoV-2 genome remains unresolved, with the function and even protein-coding status of many hypothetical proteins unknown and often conflicting among different annotations, thus hindering efforts for systematic dissection of its biology and the impact of recent mutations. Comparative genomics is a powerful approach for distinguishing protein-coding versus non-coding functional elements, based on their characteristic patterns of change, which we previously used to annotate protein-coding genes in human, fly, and other species. Here, we use comparative genomics to provide a high-confidence set of SARS-CoV-2 protein-coding genes, to characterize their protein-level and nucleotide-level evolutionary constraint, and to interpret the functional implications for SARS-CoV-2 mutations acquired during the current pandemic. We select 44 complete Sarbecovirus genomes at evolutionary distances well-suited for protein-coding and non-coding element identification, create whole-genome alignments spanning all named and putative genes, and quantify their protein-coding evolutionary signatures using PhyloCSF and their overlapping constraint using FRESCo. We find strong protein-coding signatures for all named genes and for hypothetical ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, and 8, indicating protein-coding roles, and provide strong evidence of protein-coding status for a recently-proposed alternate-frame novel ORF within 3a. By contrast, ORF10 shows no protein-coding signatures but shows unusually-high nucleotide-level constraint, indicating it has important but non-coding functions, and ORF14 and SARS-CoV-1 ORF3b, which overlap other genes, lack evolutionary signatures expected for dual-coding regions, indicating they do not produce functional proteins. ORF9b has ambiguous protein-coding signatures, preventing us from resolving its protein-coding status. ORF8 shows extremely fast nucleotide-level evolution, lacks a known function, and was deactivated in SARS-CoV-1, but shows clear signatures indicating protein-coding function worthy of further investigation given its rapid evolution and potential role in replication. SARS-CoV-2 mutations are preferentially excluded from evolutionarily-constrained amino acid residues and synonymously-constrained nucleotides, indicating purifying constraint acting at both coding and non-coding levels. In contrast, we find a conserved region in the nucleocapsid that is enriched for recent mutations, which could indicate a selective signal, and find that several spike-protein mutations previously identified as candidates for increased transmission and several mutations in isolates found to generate higher viral load in-vitro disrupt otherwise-perfectly-conserved amino-acids, consistent with adaptations for human-to-human transmission.","Jungreis, Irwin; Sealfon, Rachel; Kellis, Manolis",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.02.130955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32577641/,91

An assessment mission took place in August 2016 to collect users’ satisfaction, to estimate the concordance of the received data with the collected data, and to estimate the time required to report data with Argus. RESULTS: Overall completeness of data reporting was 76%, with 80% of reports from a given week being received before Tuesday 9PM. Concordance of data received from Argus and standard paper forms was 99.7%. Median time needed to send a report using Argus was 4 minutes. Overall completeness of data review at district, regional, and central levels were 89%, 68%, and 35% respectively. Implementation cost of Argus was 23 760 USD for 148 facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The use of Argus in Togo enabled healthcare facilities to send weekly reports and alerts through SMS in a user-friendly, reliable and timely manner. Reengagement of surveillance officers at all levels, especially at the central level, enabled a dramatic increase in completeness and timeliness of data report and data review.","Guerra, José; Davi, Kokou Mawule; Rafael, Florentina Chipuila; Assane, Hamadi; Imboua, Lucile; Diallo, Fatoumata Binta Tidiane; Tamekloe, Tsidi Agbeko; Kuassi, Aklagba Kuawo; Ouro-kavalah, Farihétou; Tchaniley, Ganiou; Ouro-Nile, Nassirou; Nabeth, Pierre",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33259550/,91

Symptom overlap between COVID-19 and lung cancer may complicate diagnostic evaluation. We aimed to investigate the incidence, symptoms, differential diagnosis, and outcomes of COVID-19 in lung cancer patients. Methods To determine an at-risk population for COVID-19, we retrospectively identified lung cancer patients receiving longitudinal care within a single institution in the 12 months (4/1/19 – 3/31/20) immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, including an “active therapy population” treated within the last 60 days of this period. Among patients subsequently referred for COVID-19 testing, we compared symptoms, laboratory/radiographic findings, and outcomes of positive versus negative patients. Results Between 4/1/2019-3/31/2020, 696 patients received longitudinal care, including 406 (58%) in the active therapy population. Among 55 patients referred for COVID-19 testing, 24 (44%) were COVID-19 positive, representing a cumulative incidence of 3.4% (longitudinal population) and 1.5% (active therapy population). Compared to COVID-19-negative patients, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to have a supplemental oxygen requirement (11% vs. 54%, p=0.005) and to have typical COVID-19 pneumonia imaging findings (5 vs. 56%, p=0.001). Otherwise, there were no significant differences in presenting symptoms. Among COVID-negative patients, alternative etiologies included treatment-related toxicity (26%), atypical pneumonia (22%), and disease progression (22%). Sixteen COVID-19-postive patients (67%) required hospitalization, and 7 (29%) died from COVID-related complications. Conclusions COVID-19 was infrequent in this lung cancer population, but these patients experienced high rates of morbidity and mortality. Oncologists should maintain a low threshold for COVID-19 testing in lung cancer patients presenting with acute symptoms.","Piper-Vallillo, Andrew J.; Mooradian, Meghan J.; Meador, Catherine B.; Yeap, Beow Y.; Peterson, Jennifer; Sakhi, Mustafa; Do, Andrew; Zubiri, Leyre; Stevens, Sara; Vaughn, Jeanne; Goodwin, Kelly; Gavralidis, Alexander; Willers, Henning; Miller, Adam; Farago, Anna; Piotrowska, Zofia; Lin, Jessica J.; Dagogo-Jack, Ibiayi; Lennes, Inga T.; Sequist, Lecia V.; Temel, Jennifer S.; Heist, Rebecca S.; Digumarthy, Subba; Reynolds, Kerry L.; Gainor, Justin F.",JTO Clin Res Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666364320301752?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666364320301752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33205053/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtocrr.2020.100124,91

Many use cases are envisaged, including complementing molecular methods for diagnosis of active disease and estimating immunity for individuals. At the population level, carefully designed seroepidemiologic studies will aid in the characterization of transmission dynamics and refinement of disease burden estimates and will provide insight into the kinetics of humoral immunity. Yet, despite an explosion in the number and availability of serologic assays to test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, most have undergone minimal external validation to date. This hinders assay selection and implementation, as well as interpretation of study results. In addition, critical knowledge gaps remain regarding serologic correlates of protection from infection or disease, and the degree to which these assays cross-react with antibodies against related coronaviruses. This article discusses key use cases for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection tests and their application to serologic studies, reviews currently available assays, highlights key areas of ongoing research, and proposes potential strategies for test implementation.","Cheng, Matthew P.; Yansouni, Cedric P.; Basta, Nicole E.; Desjardins, Michaël; Kanjilal, Sanjat; Paquette, Katryn; Caya, Chelsea; Semret, Makeda; Quach, Caroline; Libman, Michael; Mazzola, Laura; Sacks, Jilian A.; Dittrich, Sabine; Papenburg, Jesse",Ann Intern Med,https://doi.org/10.7326/m20-2854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32496919/,91
669649,The cardiovascular disorders and prognostic cardiac biomarkers in COVID-19,2021-01-22,"INTRODUCTION: Rumors and conspiracy theories, can contribute to vaccine hesitancy. Monitoring online data related to COVID-19 vaccine candidates can track vaccine misinformation in real-time and assist in negating its impact. This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccine rumors and conspiracy theories circulating on online platforms, understand their context, and then review interventions to manage this misinformation and increase vaccine acceptance. METHOD: In June 2020, a multi-disciplinary team was formed to review and collect online rumors and conspiracy theories between 31 December 2019–30 November 2020. Sources included Google, Google Fact Check, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, fact-checking agency websites, and television and newspaper websites. Quantitative data were extracted, entered in an Excel spreadsheet, and analyzed descriptively using the statistical package R version 4.0.3. We conducted a content analysis of the qualitative information from news articles, online reports and blogs and compared with findings from quantitative data. Based on the fact-checking agency ratings, information was categorized as true, false, misleading, or exaggerated. RESULTS: We identified 637 COVID-19 vaccine-related items: 91% were rumors and 9% were conspiracy theories from 52 countries. Of the 578 rumors, 36% were related to vaccine development, availability, and access, 20% related to morbidity and mortality, 8% to safety, efficacy, and acceptance, and the rest were other categories. Of the 637 items, 5% (30/) were true, 83% (528/637) were false, 10% (66/637) were misleading, and 2% (13/637) were exaggerated. CONCLUSIONS: Rumors and conspiracy theories may lead to mistrust contributing to vaccine hesitancy. Tracking COVID-19 vaccine misinformation in real-time and engaging with social media to disseminate correct information could help safeguard the public against misinformation.","Islam, Md Saiful; Kamal, Abu-Hena Mostofa; Kabir, Alamgir; Southern, Dorothy L.; Khan, Sazzad Hossain; Hasan, S.

669866,Bacteriophages as Potential Tools for Use in Antimicrobial Therapy and Vaccine Development,2021-04-05,"Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the treatment of patients with allergic and atopy-associated diseases has faced major challenges. Recommendations for “social distancing” and the fear of patients becoming infected during a visit to a medical facility have led to a drastic decrease in personal doctor-patient contacts. This affects both acute care and treatment of the chronically ill. The immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection is so far only insufficiently understood and could be altered in a favorable or unfavorable way by therapy with monoclonal antibodies. There is currently no evidence for an increased risk of a severe COVID-19 course in allergic patients. Many patients are under ongoing therapy with biologicals that inhibit type 2 immune responses via various mechanisms. There is uncertainty about possible immunological interactions and potential risks of these biologicals in the case of an infection with SARS-CoV-2. Materials and methods: A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed, Livivo, and the internet to cover the past 10 years (May 2010 – April 2020). Additionally, the current German-language publications were analyzed. Based on these data, the present position paper provides recommendations for the biological treatment of patients with allergic and atopy-associated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: In order to maintain in-office consultation services, a safe treatment environment must be created that is adapted to the pandemic situation. To date, there is a lack of reliable study data on the care for patients with complex respiratory, atopic, and allergic diseases in times of an imminent infection risk from SARS-CoV-2. Type-2-dominant immune reactions, as they are frequently seen in allergic patients, could influence various phases of COVID-19, e.g., by slowing down the immune reactions. Theoretically, this could have an unfavorable effect in the early phase of a SARS-Cov-2 infection, but also a positive effect during a cytokine storm in the later phase of severe courses. However, since there is currently no evidence for this, all data from patients treated with a biological directed against type 2 immune reactions who develop COVID-19 should be collected in registries, and their disease courses documented in order to be able to provide experience-based instructions in the future. Conclusion: The use of biologicals for the treatment of bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and spontaneous urticaria should be continued as usual in patients without suspected infection or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. If available, it is recommended to prefer a formulation for self-application and to offer telemedical monitoring. Treatment should aim at the best possible control of difficult-to-control allergic and atopic diseases using adequate rescue and add-on therapy and should avoid the need for systemic glucocorticosteroids. If SARS-CoV-2 infection is proven or reasonably suspected, the therapy should be determined by weighing the benefits and risks individually for the patient in question, and the patient should be involved in the decision-making. It should be kept in mind that the potential effects of biologicals on the immune response in COVID-19 are currently not known. Telemedical offers are particularly desirable for the acute consultation needs of suitable patients.","Klimek, Ludger; Pfaar, Oliver; Worm, Margitta; Eiwegger, Thomas; Hagemann, Jan; Ollert, Markus; Untersmayr, Eva; Hoffmann-Sommergruber, Karin; Vultaggio, Alessandra; Agache, Ioana; Bavbek, Sevim; Bossios, Apostolos; Casper, Ingrid; Chan, Susan; Chatzipetrou, Alexia; Vogelberg, Christian; Firinu, Davide; Kauppi, Paula; Kolios, Antonios; Kothari, Akash; Matucci, Andrea; Palomares, Oscar; Szépfalusi, Zsolt; Pohl, Wolfgang; Hötzenecker, Wolfram; Rosenkranz, Alexander R.; Bergmann, Karl-Christian; Bieber, Thomas; Buhl, Roland; Buters, Jeroen; Darsow, Ulf; Keil, Thomas; Kleine-Tebbe, Jörg; Lau, Susanne; Maurer, Marcus; Merk, Hans; Mösges, Ralph; Saloga, Joachim; Staubach, Petra; Jappe, Uta; Rabe, Klaus F.; Rabe, Uta; Vogelmeier, Claus; Biedermann, Tilo; Jung, Kirsten; Schlenter, Wolfgang; Ring, Johannes; Chaker, Adam; Wehrmann, Wolfgang; Becker, Sven; Freudelsperger, Laura; Mülleneisen, Norbert; Nemat, Katja; Czech, Wolfgang; Wrede, Holger; Brehler, Randolf; Fuchs, Thomas; Tomazic, Peter-Valentin; Aberer, Werner; Fink-Wagner, Antje-Henriette; Horak, Fritz; Wöhrl, Stefan; Niederberger-Leppin, Verena; Pali-Schöll, Isabella; Pohl, Wolfgang; Roller-Wirnsberger, Regina; Spranger, Otto; Valenta, Rudolf; Akdis, Mübecell; Matricardi, Paolo M.; Spertini, François; Khaltaev, Nicolai; Michel, Jean-Pierre; Nicod, Larent; Schmid-Grendelmeier, Peter; Idzko, Marco; Hamelmann, Eckard; Jakob, Thilo; Werfel, Thomas; Wagenmann, Martin; Taube, Christian; Jensen-Jarolim, Erika; Korn, Stephanie; Hentges, Francois; Schwarze, Jürgen; O´Mahony, Liam; Knol, Edward F.; del Giacco, Stefano; Chivato Pérez, Tomás; Bousquet, Jean; Bedbrook, Anna; Zuberbier, Torsten; Akdis, Cezmi; Jutel, Marek",Allergol Select,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32915172/; https://doi.org/10.5414/alx02166e,91

For Influenza A virus (IAV) such a glycoprotein receptor has not been described, to date. Here we show that IAV is using the host membrane glycoprotein CD66c as a receptor for entry into human epithelial lung cells. Neuraminidase (NA), a viral spike protein binds to CD66c on the cell surface during IAV entry into the host cells. Lung cells overexpressing CD66c showed an increase in virus binding and subsequent entry into the cell. Upon comparison, CD66c demonstrated higher binding capacity than other membrane glycoproteins (EGFR and DC-SIGN) reported earlier to facilitate IAV entry into host cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of CD66c from lung cells inhibited virus binding on cell surface and entry into cells. Blocking CD66c by antibody on the cell surface resulted in decreased virus entry. We found CD66c is a specific glycoprotein receptor for influenza A virus that did not affect entry of non-IAV RNA virus (Hepatitis C virus). Finally, IAV pre-incubated with recombinant CD66c protein when administered intranasally in mice showed decreased cytopathic effects in mice lungs. This publication is the first to report CD66c (CEACAM6) as a glycoprotein receptor for Influenza A virus. Significance Statement Cells are enclosed by a semipermeable membrane that allows selective exchange of biomolecules between cells and their surroundings. A set of specialized proteins in this semipermeable membrane, work like gatekeepers to the cell and regulate entry of these biomolecules. One class of such surface proteins is termed as receptors. Viruses bind to one or more of these receptors and manipulate gatekeepers for their own successful entry into host-cells. A membrane protein that influenza A virus (Flu virus) uses for entry into the cells was not discovered till date. This study reports for the first time, a receptor for influenza A virus, that was sought after by researchers for decades. The viral receptor is a promising target that can be used to inhibit virus entry into host cells.","Rahman, Shah Kamranur; Ansari, Mairaj Ahmed; Gaur, Pratibha; Ahmad, Imtiyaz; Chakravarty, Chandrani; Verma, Dileep Kumar; Chhibber, Sanjay; Nehal, Naila; Sellathanby, Shanmugaapriya; Wirth, Dagmar; Waris, Gulam; Lal, Sunil K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/104026,91

To resolve these complications the local FeH needs to be recovered. Hepcidin, as a master regulator of FeH is both a major player in the recovery and a marker of an efficacy of the restoration. Therefore, both local and systemic hepcidin levels could serve as a dynamic marker of disease progression (the more hepcidin the worse is disease) and treatment efficacy (after iron homeostasis is recovered hepcidin disappears). On the contrast, artificial attempts to suppress hepcidin expression directly or application of hepcidin antagonists could be detrimental.

Fungal empyema is a rare complication of critical illness. Cases are most often nosocomial and associated with high mortality. We report the first documented case of fungal empyema associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure and type-2 diabetes, presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with respiratory failure and septic shock, about one week after he was diagnosed with atypical pneumonia. His nasopharyngeal wash for SARS-CoV-19 returned positive several days after first ED visit. The patient was intubated and started on antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine. He was extubated after 4 days of low-tidal volume ventilation per ARDSNet protocol. He had a prolonged hospital stay complicated by Moraxella bacteremia and was discharged after 21 days. He was readmitted with a chest CT notable for bilateral pulmonary emboli, extensive bilateral pneumonia, and a loculated pleural effusion. He was started on heparin and antibiotics. A chest tube was placed, and pleural fluid studies were notable for an exudative effusion. Pleural cultures obtained grew Candida albicans, which was initially thought to be a possible contaminant;however repeat pleural cultures continued to exhibit C. albicans as did a sputum culture. His WBC count and CRP continued to elevate despite pleural drainage and antibiotics, and he was transferred for a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) evaluation. Fluconazole was initiated. Patient had clinical improvement with fluconazole and continued chest tube drainage, so he did not undergo VATS. He was discharged on oral antimicrobials and apixaban. DISCUSSION: This is the first described case of fungal empyema secondary to COVID-19. Fungal empyema represents less than <1% pleural infections with C. albicans being the most common pathogen. Overall mortality is as high as 73%, and most patients are critically ill. Patients should have prompt chest tube drainage, and in cases of failure with rising CRP or persistent sepsis, early thoracic surgery consultation is appropriate as evidenced by two small studies (n=20 and 70) where early VATS vs. chest tube resulted in decreased hospital stay and rates of treatment failure. CONCLUSION(S): Clinicians should consider fungal empyema in recovered COVID-19 patients presenting with a complicated pleural space. Chest tube drainage and IV antifungal coverage are effective initial therapies along with early evaluation for possible VATS. Reference #1: Davies HE, Davies RJO, Davies CWH.

CONCLUSIONS: FebriDx MxA showed high diagnostic accuracy to identify COVID-19 and could be considered as a real-time triage tool to streamline the management of suspected COVID-19 patients. FebriDx also detected bacterial etiology in non-COVID-19 patients suggesting good performance to distinguish bacterial from viral respiratory infection.","Lagi, Filippo; Trevisan, Sasha; Piccica, Matteo; Graziani, Lucia; Basile, Gregorio; Mencarini, Jessica; Borchi, Beatrice; Menicacci, Lorenzo; Vaudo, Micol; Scotti, Valentina; Fabbri, Alessia; Bandini, Giulia; Tozzetti, Camilla; Berni, Andrea; Aiezza, Noemi; Pestelli, Giulia; Turchi, Valerio; Pignone, Alberto Moggi; Poggesi, Loredana; Nozzoli, Carlo; Morettini, Alessandro; Rossolini, Gian Maria; Bartoloni, Alessandro",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221003775?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.04.065; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221003775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33901656/,91
672678,A New Approach to the Dynamic Modeling of an Infectious Disease,2020-11-03,"Back ground: BCG have heterogeneous immunity to certain pathogens other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis effect. At early times during COVID-19 pandemic heterogeneous immunity towards (SARS-CoV-2), was hypothesized and statistical correlation between of BCG vaccination practices and COVID-19 mortality variances among countries was statistically proved . These studies was criticized because of low evidence of such studies and possible confounding factors. For that reason this study was designed to look for impact of duration of cessation of BCG programs on Covid-19 mortality looking for the hypotheses by different design and looking forward to support previous studies. Methods: Total number of studied group is 14 countries which has stopped BCG vaccination programs. Through applying stem-leaf plot for exploring data screening behavior concerning Covid-19 Mortality for obsolescence duration of cessation of mass BCG vaccination programs, as well as (nonlinear regression of compound model) for predicted shape behavior for that group. Results: Slope value shows highly significant effectiveness of obsolescence of cessation of mass BCG vaccination programs on Covid -19 mortality at P-value<0.000. Obsolescence of duration of cessation of mass BCG vaccination programs has strongly negatively associated with Covid-19 mortality in countries which stopped BCG vaccination programs. Conclusion: The longer the cessation duration of BCG programs, the higher the Covid-19 mortality is, and vice versa.","Raham, T.

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to ascertain the perception of mothers on masking in children as a preventive strategy for COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in two health institutions among 387 mothers who presented with their children for the first time in the hospital during the COVID 19 pandemic. A pretested, semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire which was designed by the researchers was used for data collection. RESULTS: Minority (44.7%) of the mothers perceived masking in children as an appropriate measure for the prevention of COVID-19. The frequent reasons given by majority (55.3%) of the mothers for the inappropriateness of face mask in children included perceived difficulty in breathing (38.5%) and the child’s readiness to pull it off (29.3%). A significantly higher proportion of the children whose mothers were 35 years and above, 64.2% would wear face masks when compared with 31.7% of those whose mothers were < 30 years of age (χ(2) = 28.632, p<0.001). Similarly, a significantly higher proportion (51.0%) of the children who were more than one year of age would wear a face mask when compared with 20.5% of those aged eight days to one year (χ(2) = 19.441, p<0.001). The children whose mothers were <30 years were about four times less likely to wear a face mask when compared with those whose mothers were aged 35 years and above. (AOR = 0.273; 95%CI: 0.155–0.478). The children whose fathers have attained tertiary education were about twice less likely to wear face masks when compared with those whose fathers have attained secondary education and less. (AOR = 0.554; 95%CI: 0.334–0.919). Mothers’ perception of COVID-19 had no significant influence on children’s use of face mask (χ(2) = 2.337, p = 0.127) CONCLUSION: Maternal perception of masking in children as an appropriate strategy for preventing COVID-19 is adjudged low in this study. Right perception is significantly enhanced by maternal educational status, employment and marital status.","Aronu, Ann E.; Chinawa, Josephat M.; Nduagubam, Obinna C.; Ossai, Edmund N.; Chinawa, Awoere T.; Igwe, Wilson C.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33211761/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242650,91

Most studies report clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19; the full spectrum of disease severity has thus not yet been well described. Methods Using retrospective observational methods, this study analyzed factors affecting early clinical symptoms, clinical progress, and severity of disease for COVID-19 positive patients released from quarantine to provide information on establishing optimized care for new patients. The medical data of 7803 laboratory-confirmed patients who had been discharged or died by April 30, 2020 were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Findings On admission, 7383 (94•5%) patients were asymptomatic or showed mild illness, and 372 (4•8%) patients were severe illness. Also, 48 (0 0•6%) were hospitalized with critically ill when diagnosed. Most patients with asymptomatic or mild illness on admission remained mild until discharge, 253 (3•4%) progressed to severe illness, and 83 (1•1%) died in hospital. However, the case fatality were 29•8% and 62•5% in severe and critically ill patients, respectively. At admission, 73•0% of hospitalized patients had symptoms; most common were cough (42•5%), sputum (28•8%), and fever (20•1%). Only 35•2% of laboratory confirmed patients admitted to the temporary care facility complained of symptoms. Increasing odds of being critically ill was associated with older age (OR 28•93, 95% CI 13•34–62•75 for age >70y, vs. age <50 y; p<0•0001), being male (OR 2•15, 95% CI1•59–2•89; p<0•0001), fever (OR 2•52, 95% CI 1.84–3•45; p<0•0001), and shortness of breath (OR 7•40, 95% CI 5•37–10•19; p<0•0001). Comorbid illness significantly increased risk of critical illness or death. Interpretation Most cases were discharged as asymptomatic or recovered from mild illness, and only 9•7% developed severe disease requiring oxygen therapy or more. Case fatality rate was 2•9%, and markedly increased in those over age 50. Risk factors such as age, sex, fever, shortness of breath, and underlying disease can be useful in predicting future clinical severity.

677599,Reply,2021,"INTRODUCTION: While there is emerging evidence for acute sleep disruption in the aftermath of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is unknown whether sleep traits contribute to mortality risk. In this study, we tested whether earlier-life sleep duration, chronotype, insomnia, napping or sleep apnea were associated with increased 30-day COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: We included 34,711 participants from the UK Biobank, who presented for COVID-19 testing between March and October 2020 (mean age at diagnosis: 69.4±8.3; range 50.2–84.6). Self-reported sleep duration (less than 6h/6-9h/more than 9h), chronotype (“morning”/”intermediate”/”evening”), daytime dozing (often/rarely), insomnia (often/rarely), napping (often/rarely) and presence of sleep apnea (ICD-10 or self-report) were obtained between 2006 and 2010. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to adjust for age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, and relevant risk factors (BMI, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory diseases, smoking, and alcohol). RESULTS: The mean time between sleep measures and COVID-19 testing was 11.6±0.9 years. Overall, 5,066 (14.6%) were positive. In those who were positive, 355 (7.0%) died within 30 days (median = 8) after diagnosis. Long sleepers (>9h vs. 6-9h) [20/103 (19.4%) vs. 300/4,573 (6.6%); OR 2.09, 95% 1.19–3.64, p=0.009), often daytime dozers (OR 1.68, 95% 1.04–2.72, p=0.03), and nappers (OR 1.52, 95% 1.04–2.23, p=0.03) were at greater odds of mortality. Prior diagnosis of sleep apnea also saw a two-fold increased odds (OR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.25–3.44 p=0.005). No associations were seen for short sleepers, chronotype or insomnia with COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSION: Data across all current waves of infection show that prior sleep traits/disturbances, in particular long sleep duration, daytime dozing, napping and sleep apnea, are associated with increased 30-day mortality after COVID-19, independent of health-related risk factors. While sleep health traits may reflect unmeasured poor health, further work is warranted to examine the exact underlying mechanisms, and to test whether sleep health optimization offers resilience to severe illness from COVID-19.

Recently, technology has begun to embed remote components. Timely with respect to the pandemic, the present work reviews the most recent literature on technology in dementia contexts together with the newest studies about technological support published until October 2020. The final aim is to provide a synthesis of the timeliest evidence upon which clinical and non-clinical decision-makers can rely to make choices about technology in the case of further pandemic waves. Methods: A review of reviews was performed alongside a review of the studies run during the first pandemic wave. PsycInfo, CINAHL, and PubMed-online were the databases inspected for relevant papers published from January 2010. Results: The search identified 420 articles, 30 of which were reviews and nine of which were new studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Studies were first sorted according to the target population, then summarized thematically in a narrative synthesis. The studies targeting technologies for PWD were categorized as follows: monitoring and security purposes, sustaining daily life, and therapeutic interventions. Each category showed potential benefits. Differently, the interventions for caregivers were classified as informative, psycho-education programs, psychosocial-supportive, therapeutic, and cognitive/physical training. Benefits to mental health, skills learning, and social aspects emerged. Conclusions: The evidence shows that technology is well-accepted and can support PWD and caregivers to bypass physical and environmental problems both during regular times and during future pandemic waves. Nevertheless, the lack of a common methodological background is revealed by this analysis. Further and more standardized research is necessary to improve the implementation of technologies in everyday life while respecting the necessary personalization.","Pappadà, Alessandro; Chattat, Rabih; Chirico, Ilaria; Valente, Marco; Ottoboni, Giovanni",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841281/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.644587,91

We aimed to assess self-reported BUP-related practices and attitudes among emergency physicians. METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional physician survey by adapting a validated questionnaire on opioid harm reduction practices, attitudes and barriers. We recruited physician leads from 6 Canadian provinces to administer surveys to the staff physicians in their emergency department groups between December 2018 and November 2019. We included academic and community non-locum emergency department staff physicians. We excluded responses from emergency department groups with response rates less than 50% to minimize nonresponse bias. Primary (BUP prescribing practices) and secondary (willingness and attitudes) outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: After excluding 1 group for low response (9/26 physicians), 652 of 798 (81.7%) physicians responded from 22 groups serving 34 emergency departments. Among respondents, 64.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 60.4%–67.8%, emergency department group range 7.1%–100.0%) had prescribed BUP at least once in their career, 38.4% had prescribed it for home initiation and 24.8% prescribed it at least once a month. Overall, 68.9% (95% CI 65.3%–72.4%, emergency department group range 24.1%–97.6%) were willing to administer BUP, 64.2% felt it was a major responsibility and 37.1% felt they understood people who use drugs. Respondents most frequently rated lack of adequate training (58.2%) and lack of time (55.2%) as very important barriers to BUP initiation. INTERPRETATION: Two-thirds of the emergency physicians surveyed prescribed BUP, although only one-quarter did so regularly and one-third prescribed it for home initiation; wide variation between emergency department groups existed. Strategies to increase BUP initiation must address physicians’ lack of time and training for BUP initiation and improve their understanding of people who use drugs.","Kestler, Andrew; Kaczorowski, Janusz; Dong, Kathryn; Orkin, Aaron M.; Daoust, Raoul; Moe, Jessica; Van Pelt, Kelsey; Andolfatto, Gary; Klaiman, Michelle; Yan, Justin; Koh, Justin J.; Crowder, Kathryn; Webster, Devon; Atkinson, Paul; Savage, David; Stempien, James; Besserer, Floyd; Wale, Jason; Lam, Alice; Scheueremeyer, Frank",CMAJ Open,https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20200190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548331/,91

SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes are usually sequenced from nasopharyngeal swabs of individual patients to track viral spread. Recently, RT-qPCR of municipal wastewater has been used to quantify the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in several regions globally. However, metatranscriptomic sequencing of wastewater can be used to profile the viral genetic diversity across infected communities. Here, we sequenced RNA directly from sewage collected by municipal utility districts in the San Francisco Bay Area to generate complete and nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The major consensus SARS-CoV-2 genotypes detected in the sewage were identical to clinical genomes from the region. Using a pipeline for single nucleotide variant calling in a metagenomic context, we characterized minor SARS-CoV-2 alleles in the wastewater and detected viral genotypes which were also found within clinical genomes throughout California. Observed wastewater variants were more similar to local California patient-derived genotypes than they were to those from other regions within the United States or globally. Additional variants detected in wastewater have only been identified in genomes from patients sampled outside California, indicating that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for recent introductions of viral lineages before they are detected by local clinical sequencing. These results demonstrate that epidemiological surveillance through wastewater sequencing can aid in tracking exact viral strains in an epidemic context.","Crits-Christoph, Alexander; Kantor, Rose S.; Olm, Matthew R.; Whitney, Oscar N.; Al-Shayeb, Basem; Lou, Yue Clare; Flamholz, Avi; Kennedy, Lauren C.; Greenwald, Hannah; Hinkle, Adrian; Hetzel, Jonathan; Spitzer, Sara; Koble, Jeffery; Tan, Asako; Hyde, Fred; Schroth, Gary; Kuersten, Scott; Banfield, Jillian F.; Nelson, Kara L.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33468686/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02703-20,91

682577,Development and Use of Gene Therapy Orphan Drugs—Ethical Needs for a Broader Cooperation Between the Pharmaceutical Industry and Society,2020-12-23,"The trace element copper (Cu) is part of our nutrition and essentially needed for several cuproenzymes that control redox status and support the immune system. In blood, the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin (CP) accounts for the majority of circulating Cu and serves as transport protein. Both Cu and CP behave as positive, whereas serum selenium (Se) and its transporter selenoprotein P (SELENOP) behave as negative acute phase reactants. In view that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes systemic inflammation, we hypothesized that biomarkers of Cu and Se status are regulated inversely, in relation to disease severity and mortality risk. Serum samples from COVID-19 patients were analysed for Cu by total reflection X-ray fluorescence and CP was quantified by a validated sandwich ELISA. The two Cu biomarkers correlated positively in serum from patients with COVID-19 (R = 0.42, p < 0.001). Surviving patients showed higher mean serum Cu and CP concentrations in comparison to non-survivors ([mean+/−SEM], Cu; 1475.9+/−22.7 vs. 1317.9+/−43.9 µg/L; p < 0.001, CP; 547.2.5+/−19.5 vs. 438.8+/−32.9 mg/L, p = 0.086). In contrast to expectations, total serum Cu and Se concentrations displayed a positive linear correlation in the patient samples analysed (R = 0.23, p = 0.003). Serum CP and SELENOP levels were not interrelated. Applying receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, the combination of Cu and SELENOP with age outperformed other combinations of parameters for predicting risk of death, yielding an AUC of 95.0%. We conclude that the alterations in serum biomarkers of Cu and Se status in COVID-19 are not compatible with a simple acute phase response, and that serum Cu and SELENOP levels contribute to a good prediction of survival. Adjuvant supplementation in patients with diagnostically proven deficits in Cu or Se may positively influence disease course, as both increase in survivors and are of crucial importance for the immune response and antioxidative defence systems.","Hackler, Julian; Heller, Raban Arved; Sun, Qian; Schwarzer, Marco; Diegmann, Joachim; Bachmann, Manuel; Moghaddam, Arash; Schomburg, Lutz",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072977/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061898,91
683123,"Detection of viral antigens, particles, and early antibodies in diagnosis.",1984,"As thousands of new cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed, there is an increasing demand to understand the factors underlying the spread of this disease. Using country-level data, we modeled the early growth in the number of cases for over 480 cities in all Brazilian states. As the main findings, we found that the percentage of people respecting social distancing protocols was the main explanatory factor for the observed growth rate of COVID-19. Those cities that presented the highest spread of the new coronavirus were also those that had lower averages of social distancing. We also underline that total population of cities and connectivity, represented by the city-level importance to the air transportation of people across the country, plays important roles in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. Climate and socioeconomic predictors had little contribution to the big-picture scenario. Our results show that different States had high variability in their growth rates, mostly due to quite different public health strategies to retain the outbreak of COVID-19. In spite of all limitations of such a large-scale approach, our results underline that climatic conditions are likely weak limiting factors for the spread of the new coronavirus, and the circulation of people in the city- and country-level are the most responsible factors for the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil. Moreover, we reinforce that social distancing protocols are fundamental to avoid critical scenarios and the collapse of healthcare systems. We also predict that economic-induced decisions for relaxing social distancing might have catastrophic consequences, especially in large cities.","Baumgartner, M. T.; Lansac-Toha, F. M.; Coelho, M.

It is part of the spondyloarthropathy (SpA) spectrum, an umbrella term for a group of distinct conditions with shared clinical features. Typically, it presents with an asymmetric oligoarthritis of the lower limb joints, and patients may also have sacroiliitis, enthesitis and dactylitis. Other features often seen include anterior uveitis, urethritis and skin manifestations such as pustular lesions on the plantar areas. Although ReA was characterised initially as a sterile arthritis, the detection of metabolically active Chlamydia species in the joint fluid of some affected patients has generated further questions on the pathophysiology of this condition. There are no formal diagnostic criteria, and the diagnosis is mainly clinical. HLA-B27 can support the diagnosis in the correct clinical context, and serves as a prognostic indicator. The majority of patients have a self-limiting course, but some develop chronic SpA and require immunomodulatory therapy.","Jubber, Ameen; Moorthy, Arumugam",The journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh,https://doi.org/10.4997/jrcpe.2021.319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34528623/,91
683557,Prebiotic Peptides Based on the Glycocodon Theory Analyzed with FRET,2021-04-23,"To estimate the fraction of the exhaled airflow that is re-inhaled during normal nasal breathing, experiments were carried out in a water tank with an anatomically accurate respiratory tract model of a 4-year-old child. The velocity of respiratory flow was scaled using similarity laws between air and water. Breath simulation was performed via a computer-controlled piston-cylinder system. Food-dye visualization allows a qualitative analysis of the re-inhaled fraction of this exhaled flow. For the quantitative analysis, neutrally buoyant particles were added to the water medium, and illuminated by the laser which illuminates the whole breathing region of the respiratory model, such that the trajectory and quantity of the re-inhaled particles can be recorded and counted. The experimental results in the pediatric airway replica show that a negligible fraction (<0.06%) of the exhaled airflow is re-inhaled during normal nasal breathing in the absence of the rising thermal plume. The artificial plume generated by a heated aluminium brick at the tank bottom increases the re-inhalation ratio by 4 times under the investigated case (albeit still at a very low value of 0.15%). Our results thus reveal that during normal nasal breathing in the present pediatric subject, the vast majority of human exhaled airflow escapes from the inhalation zone and is not re-inhaled.","Wei, Jianjian; Tang, Julian W.; Borojeni, Azadeh A.T.; Yin, Shi; Martin, Andrew; Finlay, Warren H.; Li, Yuguo",Build Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.12.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132315302092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288038/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132315302092,91

The full-length genome of QdCoV detected in quails with enteritis in Poland has similar organization as Middle Eastern viruses although there is no NSP7c gene. The overall degree of nucleotide sequence identity was 92.4–92.6% between Polish PL/G032/2015 and Middle Eastern UAE-HKU30 QdCoV isolates. The sequences of the individual genes show similar nucleotide identities in the range of 91.4–94.7% with the exception of the S gene with lower identity of 85.6–85.7%. The most variable part of the S gene is its fragment encoding the N-terminal domain of the S protein which is responsible for receptor binding. The amino acid homology in this region between PL/G032/2015 and UAE-HKU30 QdCoVs was 74.5–74.7%. In contrast, the C-terminal domain of the S protein which is responsible for membrane fusion had an amino acid homology of 96.9%. In the phylogenetic tree, PL/G032/2015 branched separately but clustered with the UAE-HKU30 QdCoV isolates. These data suggest that PL/G032/2015 could be a new genetic/serologic variant of QdCoV.

The high-intensity working and mental stress during rescue could induce distress and negatively impact the performance of rescuer afterward. Materials and Methods: To identify the characteristics of stress load and its possible effects on performance, the study surveyed 90 medical rescuers in Wuhan using a mobile phone–based self-rated questionnaire. Results: The results showed an existence of universal but mostly mild distress in rescuers. About 95.6% of the participants reported that they had at least one symptom of distress, whereas, the median scores were <30 (100 as max). Compared with civilian rescuers, a higher proportion of working with immediate virus contact was found in military medical rescuers (P = 0.008); however, no statistical differences of stress load were found between civilians and militaries. The rescuers with positive cognition or good psychological preparation were found having lower stress loads than other rescuers. An inverse correlation between the stress load and performance (R = −0.24, P = 0.023) and a positive correlation between social support and working performance (R = 0.349, P = 0.001) were found in our survey, suggesting the possible negative effects of stress and the beneficial effects of social support on performance. Conclusion: Our study indicated that more attention should be paid to the distress of medical rescuers against COVID-19. Positive cognitions, good psychological preparations, and sufficient social support would be necessary to reduce the distress and improve the performance in COVID-19 rescue.","Xie, Fang; Wang, Xue; Zhao, Yun; Wang, Shi Da; Xue, Cong; Wang, Xiao Tian; Chen, Yu Xin; Qian, Ling Jia",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.563533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248686/,91

The system involves creating an array of 100 peptides that have been selected for broad capability to bind and/or kill viruses and bacteria. The peptides are pre-screened for low cell toxicity prior to large scale synthesis. Any pathogen is then assayed on the chip to find peptides that bind or kill it. Peptides are combined in pairs as synbodies and further screened for activity and toxicity.

This exceptional pandemic has affected countries on every level, particularly health systems which are experiencing saturation. Like many countries, France is currently greatly exposed, and a complete reorganization of hospitals is ongoing. We propose here adaptations of diagnostic procedures, therapies and care strategies for patients treated for digestive cancer during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: French societies of gastroenterology and gastrointestinal (GI) oncology carried out this study to answer two main questions that have arisen (i) how can we limit high-risk situations for GI-cancer patients and (ii) how can we limit contact between patients and care centers to decrease patients’ risk of contamination while continuing to treat their cancer. All recommendations are graded as experts’ agreement according to the level of evidence found in the literature until March 2020. RESULTS: A proposal to adapt treatment strategies was made for the main GI oncology situations. Considering the level of evidence and the heterogeneous progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, all proposals need to be considered by a multidisciplinary team and implemented with patient consent. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 epidemic may significantly affect patients treated for digestive malignancies. Healthcare teams need to consider adapting treatment sequences when feasible and according to the epidemic situation.","Di Fiore, Frederic; Bouché, Olivier; Lepage, Come; Sefrioui, David; Gangloff, Alice; Schwarz, Lilian; Tuech, Jean Jacques; Aparicio, Thomas; Lecomte, Thierry; Boulagnon-Rombi, Camille; Lièvre, Astrid; Manfredi, Sylvain; Phelip, Jean Marc; Michel, Pierre",Dig Liver Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S159086582030133X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418773/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S159086582030133X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2020.03.031,91

Anaphylaxis awareness was surveyed from 10 June–30 July 2018 using a structured questionnaire with 221 junior or senior nursing students. To assess the needs for anaphylaxis education, 14 senior nursing students were interviewed using FGIs from 10–22 June 2018. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively using SPSS, and qualitative data were assessed using thematic analysis. Nursing students’ awareness of anaphylaxis was identified by correct answers to items concerning symptoms (33.0%), causes (64.6%), and treatments (55.8%), with an overall average of 51.5%. The thematic analysis identified four themes reflecting students’ educational needs: the need for anaphylaxis education, various education methods, field training-based study of educational content, and repeated education. Nursing students’ anaphylaxis awareness is low. Their specific needs derived in this study for anaphylaxis education should draw special attention when planning nursing curriculum.

685972,Dynamic mode decomposition of inertial particle caustics in Taylor–Green flow,2021-05-17,"Members of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family inhibit the entry of a wide range of viruses. Viruses often exploit the endocytosis pathways to invade host cells and escape from the endocytic vesicles often in response to low pH. Localization to these endocytic vesicles is essential for IFITM3 to interfere with the cytosolic entry of pH-dependent viruses. However, the nature of the sorting signal that targets IFITM3 to these vesicles is poorly defined. In this study, we report that IFITM3 possesses a YxxΦ sorting motif, i.e., 20-YEML-23, that enables IFITM3 to undergo endocytosis through binding to the μ2 subunit of the AP-2 complex. IFITM3 accumulates at the plasma membrane as a result of either mutating 20-YEML-23, depleting the μ2 subunit, or overexpressing μ2 mutants. Importantly, blocking endocytosis of IFITM3 abrogates its ability to inhibit pH-dependent viruses. We have therefore identified a critical sorting signal, namely 20-YEML-23, that controls both the endocytic trafficking and the antiviral action of IFITM3. This finding also reveals that as an endocytic protein, IFITM3 first arrives at the plasma membrane before it is endocytosed and further traffics to the late endosomes where it acts to impede virus entry.","Jia, Rui; Xu, Fengwen; Qian, Jin; Yao, Yunfang; Miao, Chunhui; Zheng, Yi-Min; Liu, Shan-Lu; Guo, Fei; Geng, Yunqi; Qiao, Wentao; Liang, Chen",Cellular Microbiology,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4065222?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521078/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12262,91

METHODS: The patients with COVID-19 (n=1,024) were divided into nine age groups (0-9 years, 10-19 years, 20-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years, 70-79 years, and 80 years and above). The CT findings were retrospectively analyzed according to the age groups and gender. RESULTS: Under 20 years of age, except for the ground-glass opacity and consolidation, no other finding was observed. Airway changes and crazy-paving pattern were more common over 80 years. While the tree-in-bud pattern was more common in the 20-29 age group than in other age groups, the halo sign was mostly seen at the age of 30-39 years. Unlike other groups, the thin reticular pattern was more common in patients aged 60-79 years. When the findings were compared by gender, the rates of centrilobular nodules (p=0.006), airway changes (p=0.004), and tree-in-bud pattern (p=0.050) were significantly higher in males than in females.

In contrast, studies reported poor achievement of clinical competence in different health sciences programs in the country. Thus, this study aimed to determine the status of achievement of clinical learning outcomes and associated factors among midwifery and nursing students of Jimma University, Ethiopia. METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 25 to 30, 2021 among 147 midwifery and nursing students of Jimma University selected by simple random sampling technique. Data were collected by a semi-structured, pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire, entered into EpiData version 4.2, and analyzed by SPSS version 23. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were done to test the association. The odds ratio at 95% confidence interval (CI) and P-value < 0.05 was used to ascertain statistical significance. RESULTS: Only 65 (44.2%) participants achieved their clinical learning outcomes.

689517,Prediction of vaccine efficacy of the Delta variant,2021-08-31,"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The H-2 blocker famotidine has been suggested as an FDA-approved drug that could potentially be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19. Famotidine has since been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce symptom severity in patients acutely ill with COVID-19. Other studies have suggested that PPIs might have an association with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether famotidine or any other anti-reflux medications have a prophylactic or detrimental effect for SARS-CoV-2 infection when taken regularly for the management of acid reflux. METHODS: An anonymous, web-based survey was distributed via email to adult otolaryngology patients to collect demographic data, past medical history, medication history, incidence of symptoms associated with COVID-19, potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and results of any PCR or serological testing. Associations between reflux medications and incidence of COVID-19 cases were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Chi-square with Fisher's exact test, Point-Biserial correlation, Kendall's-tau-b, independent samples t-test, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used as appropriate. A binary logistic regression model was fit to determine probability of COVID-19 cases after adjustment for other risk factors. RESULTS: There were 307 patients who responded to the survey. The average age of respondents was 52.63 ± 17.03. Famotidine use was not associated with incidence of laboratory-confirmed (p = 0.717) or symptomatically suspected (p = 0.876) COVID-19. No other reflux medications were found to be significant predictors for laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (p > 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between incidence of COVID-19 and use of reflux medications, including famotidine at doses used orally to manage reflux and high dose PPIs. Reflux medications did not protect against or increase the risk of COVID-19.","Balouch, Bailey; Vontela, Swetha; Yeakel, Heather; Alnouri, Ghiath; Sataloff, Robert T.",J Voice,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2021.01.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0892199721000321; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892199721000321?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33516648/,91
690596,"S-PRG Filler Eluate Induces Oxidative Stress in Oral Microorganism: Suppression of Growth and Pathogenicity, and Possible Clinical Application",2021-07-05,"The objective of the study was to examine the effects of perceived stress on depression and subsequently to examine the effects of depression on alcohol use disorders. The data were obtained by an electronic questionnaire survey during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (n = 1523 Slovak university students). Descriptive, regression, and correlation analysis were used in the analytical processing, while the analyses included students’ scores in three diagnostic tools (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Patient Health Questionnaire for depression (PHQ 9), and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)), as well as gender and income characteristics. The PSS identified an increased level of perceived stress in female students, while in contrast, the AUDIT showed an increased level of alcohol use disorders in male students. Differences in mental and behavioural disorders between the gender and income categories were significant in most of the analysed cases. In terms of gender-income characteristics, it was possible to confirm a significant positive effect of the PSS score on the PHQ 9 score, as well as a significant positive effect of the PHQ 9 score on the AUDIT score. As a result, efforts to reduce stress will be reflected in a reduction of depressive disorders as well as a reduction of excessive alcohol consumption among students.","Gavurova, Beata; Ivankova, Viera; Rigelsky, Martin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17238853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260778/,91
690625,An Ophthalmologist's Insight Into The Viral Pandemics,2021-01-06,"Caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 is a virus-induced inflammatory disease of the airways and lungs that leads to severe multi-organ damage and death. Here we show that cellular lipid synthesis is required for SARS-CoV-2 replication and offers an opportunity for pharmacological intervention. Screening a short-hairpin RNA sublibrary that targets metabolic genes, we identified genes that either inhibit or promote SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, including two key candidate genes, ACACA and FASN, which operate in the same lipid synthesis pathway. We further screened and identified several potent inhibitors of fatty acid synthase (encoded by FASN), including the US Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-obesity drug orlistat, and found that it inhibits in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including more contagious new variants, such as Delta. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (K18-hACE2 transgenic mice), injections of orlistat resulted in lower SARS-CoV-2 viral levels in the lung, reduced lung pathology and increased mouse survival. Our findings identify fatty acid synthase inhibitors as drug candidates for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of repurposing fatty acid synthase inhibitors for severe COVID-19 in humans.","Chu, Junjun; Xing, Changsheng; Du, Yang; Duan, Tianhao; Liu, Siyao; Zhang, Pengfei; Cheng, Chumeng; Henley, Jill; Liu, Xin; Qian, Chen; Yin, Bingnan; Wang, Helen Yicheng; Wang, Rong-Fu",Nat Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580494/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-021-00479-4,91
