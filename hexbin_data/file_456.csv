Indeed, the threat of worldwide epidemics has increased. Due to their high infectious ness and rapid person-to-person transmissibility, the emergence of new influenza viruses with pandemic potential poses an especially alarming situation in this regard. The world population would be “immunologically naïve” to a new pandemic virus, permitting explosive spread of the disease. During the last century, three influenza pandemics have demonstrated that this is not merely a hypothetical risk. Currently it is feared that the possible human adaptation of avian influenza viruses that have recently become endemic in birds in Southeast Asia could result in a new pandemic strain. With the publication of the German Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan, preparation for this potential threat has reached an important stage in Germany. The implementation of the plan, which includes measures that go beyond the scope of public health, must now proceed swiftly. The long-term goal of pandemic preparedness planning is to be better equipped to deal with potential health threats in general, in particular those ensuing from the emergence of new infectious diseases under conditions of a growing global network.","Haas, W.

How are countries performing in their challenge toward sustainable development? We address this question by treating countries and Goals as a complex bipartite network. While network science has been used to unveil the interconnections among the Goals, it has been poorly exploited to rank countries for their achievements. In this work, we show that the network representation of the countries-SDGs relations as a bipartite system allows one to recover aggregate scores of countries’ capacity to cope with SDGs as the solutions of a network’s centrality exercise. While the Goals are all equally important by definition, interesting differences self-emerge when non-standard centrality metrics, borrowed from economic complexity, are adopted. Innovation and Climate Action stand as contrasting Goals to be accomplished, with countries facing the well-known trade-offs between economic and environmental issues even in addressing the Agenda. In conclusion, the complexity of countries’ paths toward sustainable development cannot be fully understood by resorting to a single, multipurpose ranking indicator, while multi-variable analyses shed new light on the present and future of sustainable development.","Sciarra, Carla; Chiarotti, Guido; Ridolfi, Luca; Laio, Francesco",Sci Rep,456,1

Considering the high frequency of osteoporosis and obesity among women, the current study aimed to explore the prospective assembly of the most frequent two VDR loci, single nucleotide polymorphism SNPs rs731236 (TaqI) and rs7975232 (ApaI) with a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis (skeletal) and obesity (chronic non-skeletal disorders), in Egyptian women. This was a cross-sectional study, including 97 Egyptian females (25–65 years), randomly chosen, from all employees and workers of the National Research Centre, Egypt. Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, BMI), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and molecular genetic analysis were done. RESULTS: The variation of ApaI genotype between the normal and osteoporotic groups denotes a remarkable association of the homozygote ApaI genotype with osteoporosis risk. Among the normal weight group, bone mineral density (BMD) was significantly associated with TaqI VDR gene polymorphism as the presence of the heterozygote genotype was accompanied with higher BMD while the homozygote one was detected with lower BMD. Also, TaqI VDR gene polymorphism was significantly associated with BMI when participants were divided according to the presence of osteoporosis; increased BMI was expressed in the non-osteoporotic women group carrying the homozygote genotype of Taq I VDR gene while the presence of the heterozygote genotype (TaqI) in the osteoporotic group was associated with increased BMI. CONCLUSIONS: The heterozygote TaqI genotype is protective against the osteoporosis phenotype and accompanied with increased BMI among osteoporotic women, while the homozygote ApaI genotype has a significant association with osteoporosis risk.","Hassan, Nayera E.; El-Masry, Sahar A.; Zarouk, Waheba Ahmed; Eldeen, Ghada Nour; Mosaad, Rehab M.; Afify, Mahmoud A.

How the endomembrane system remodels has been poorly understood. Here we identify a new type of membrane contact formed between the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the ER-exit site (ERES) in the ER–Golgi system, which is essential for promoting autophagosome biogenesis induced by different stress stimuli. The ERGIC–ERES contact is established by the interaction between TMED9 and SEC12 which generates a short distance opposition (as close as 2–5 nm) between the two compartments. The tight membrane contact allows the ERES-located SEC12 to transactivate COPII assembly on the ERGIC. In addition, a portion of SEC12 also relocates to the ERGIC. Through both mechanisms, the ERGIC–ERES contact promotes formation of the ERGIC-derived COPII vesicle, a membrane precursor of the autophagosome. The ERGIC–ERES contact is physically and functionally different from the TFG-mediated ERGIC–ERES adjunction involved in secretory protein transport, and therefore defines a unique endomembrane structure generated upon stress conditions for autophagic membrane formation.","Li, Shulin; Yan, Rui; Xu, Jialu; Zhao, Shiqun; Ma, Xinyu; Sun, Qiming; Zhang, Min; Li, Ying; Liu, Jun-Jie Gogo; Chen, Liangyi; Li, Sai; Xu, Ke; Ge, Liang",Cell Res,456,1

This instability is mainly related to numerous and regular poultry infectious diseases and market fluctuations. If international community considers H5N1 as a zoonotic risk and a pandemic threat which asks for emergency tools, H5N1 is framed by the farmers of our study as an epizootic problem manageable through routinised measures.

This surprising finding underscores the importance of alternative splicing through which a single gene can generate structurally and functionally distinct protein isoforms [1]. Based on genome-wide analysis, 75% of human genes are thought to encode at least two alternatively spliced isoforms [2, 3]. The regulation of splice site usage provides a versatile mechanism for controlling gene expression and for the generation of proteome diversity, playing essential roles in many biological processes, such as embryonic development, cell growth, and apoptosis. The splice sites are generally recognized by the splicing machinery, a ribonuclear protein complex known as the spliceosome. Spliceosome binding is determined by competing activities of various auxiliary regulatory proteins, such as members of SR protein or heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) protein families, which bind specific regulatory sequences and alter the binding of the spliceosome to a particular splice site [1, 4]. Pre-mRNA splicing is regulated in a tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific manner [5]. The selection of splice site can be altered by numerous extracellular stimuli such as hormones, immune response, neuronal depolarization, and cellular stress, through changes in synthesis/degradation, complex formation, and intracellular localization of regulatory proteins. SR proteins are heavily phosphorylated in cells and involved in constitutive and alternative splicing, and the phosphorylation states of SR proteins are altered in response to these extracellular stimuli [6]. Splicing mutations located in either intronic or exonic regions frequently cause hereditary diseases, and more than 15% of mutations that cause genetic disease affect pre-mRNA splicing [7]. Based on a hypothetical idea that we can cure human diseases by regulating the phosphorylation state of SR proteins with synthetic inhibitors of protein kinases, we started our long voyage to challenge the development of new chemical therapeutics.","Hagiwara, Masatoshi",Chembiomolecular Science,456,1

In many respects bats make ideal reservoir hosts for viruses: they are the only mammals that fly, thus assisting in virus dispersal; they roost in large numbers, thus aiding transmission cycles; some bats hibernate over winter, thus providing a mechanism for viruses to persist between seasons; and genetic factors may play a role in the ability of bats to host viruses without resulting in clinical disease. Within the broad diversity of viruses found in bats are some important neurological pathogens, including rabies and other lyssaviruses, and Hendra and Nipah viruses, two recently described viruses that have been placed in a new genus, Henipaviruses in the family Paramyxoviridae. In addition, bats can also act as alternative hosts for the flaviviruses Japanese encephalitis and St Louis encephalitis viruses, two important mosquito-borne encephalitogenic viruses, and bats can assist in the dispersal and over-wintering of these viruses. Bats are also the reservoir hosts of progenitors of SARS and MERS coronaviruses, although other animals act as spillover hosts. This chapter presents the physiological and ecological factors affecting the ability of bats to act as reservoirs of neurotropic viruses, and describes the major transmission cycles leading to human infection.","Mackenzie, John S.; Childs, James E.; Field, Hume E.; Wang, Lin-Fa; Breed, Andrew C.",Neurotropic Viral Infections,456,1

Chatbots are also preferred by users/customers since unlike other alternatives like calling customer care or browsing over FAQ pages, chatbots provide instant responses, are easy to use, are less invasive and are always available. In this paper, we discuss the problem of FAQ answering which is central to designing a retrieval-based informational chatbot. Given a set of FAQ pages s for an enterprise, and a user query, we need to find the best matching question-answer pairs from s. Building such a semantic ranking system that works well across domains for large QA databases with low runtime and model size is challenging. Previous work based on feature engineering or recurrent neural models either provides low accuracy or incurs high runtime costs. We experiment with multiple transformer based deep learning models, and also propose a novel MT-DNN (Multi-task Deep Neural Network)-based architecture, which we call Masked MT-DNN (or MMT-DNN). MMT-DNN significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art transformer models for the FAQ answering task. Further, we propose an improved knowledge distillation component to achieve [Formula: see text]2.4x reduction in model-size and [Formula: see text]7x reduction in runtime while maintaining similar accuracy.

However, there is limited information on the genetic diversity of HPAI H5N1 viruses, especially those isolated from humans in Indonesia. In this study, the genetic and antigenic characteristics of 35 HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from humans were analyzed. Full genome sequences were analyzed for the presence of substitutions in the receptor binding site, and polymerase complex, as markers for virulence or human adaptation, as well as antiviral drug resistance substitutions. Only a few substitutions associated with human adaptation were observed, a remarkably low prevalence of the human adaptive substitution PB2-E627K, which is common during human infection with other H5N1 clades and a known virulence marker for avian influenza viruses during human infections. In addition, the antigenic profile of these Indonesian HPAI H5N1 viruses was determined using serological analysis and antigenic cartography. Antigenic characterization showed two distinct antigenic clusters, as observed previously for avian isolates. These two antigenic clusters were not clearly associated with time of virus isolation. This study provides better insight in genetic diversity of H5N1 viruses during human infection and the presence of human adaptive markers. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating virus genetics for HPAI H5N1 viruses to estimate the risk to human health and the need for increased efforts to monitor the evolution of H5N1 viruses across Indonesia.

In addition, some avian E. coli strains may have zoonotic potential, making poultry a possible source of infection for humans. Due to its extreme genetic diversity, this pathotype remains poorly defined. This study aimed to investigate the diversity of colibacillosis-associated E. coli isolates from Central European countries with a focus on the Czech Republic. RESULTS: Of 95 clinical isolates subjected to preliminary characterization, 32 were selected for whole-genome sequencing. A multi resistant phenotype was detected in a majority of the sequenced strains with the predominant resistance to β-lactams and quinolones being associated with TEM-type beta-lactamase genes and chromosomal gyrA mutations respectively. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed a great diversity of isolates, that were derived from nearly all phylogenetic groups, with predominace of B2, B1 and C phylogroups. Clusters of closely related isolates within ST23 (phylogroup C) and ST429 (phylogroup B2) indicated a possible local spread of these clones. Besides, the ST429 cluster carried bla(CMY-2, − 59) genes for AmpC beta-lactamase and isolates of both clusters were generally well-equipped with virulence-associated genes, with considerable differences in distribution of certain virulence-associated genes between phylogenetically distant lineages. Other important and potentially zoonotic APEC STs were detected, incl. ST117, ST354 and ST95, showing several molecular features typical for human ExPEC. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the concept of local spread of virulent APEC clones, as well as of zoonotic potential of specific poultry-associated lineages, and highlight the need to investigate the possible source of these pathogenic strains.","Papouskova, Aneta; Masarikova, Martina; Valcek, Adam; Senk, David; Cejkova, Darina; Jahodarova, Eva; Cizek, Alois",BMC Vet Res,456,1

Previous encoding algorithms are known to have major drawbacks in their efficient and secure implementation. Some of these drawbacks have been avoided in a recent paper in 2018 at a cost of losing the general functionality of the point multiplication algorithm. In this paper, we address these issues. Our new encoding algorithm takes the binary representations of scalars as input, and constructs a compact binary sequence and a permutation, which explicitly determines a regular sequence of group operations to be performed in d-MUL. Our algorithm simply slides windows of size two over the scalars and it is very efficient. As a result, while preserving the full generality of d-MUL, we successfully eliminate the recursive integer matrix computations in the originally proposed encoding algorithms. We also expect that our new encoding algorithm will make it easier to implement d-MUL in constant time. Our results can be seen as the efficient and full generalization of the one dimensional Montgomery ladder to arbitrary dimension.","Hutchinson, Aaron; Karabina, Koray",Progress in Cryptology - AFRICACRYPT 2020,456,1

We present a new formal framework for local reasoning about the presence of bugs, building on two complementary foundations: 1) separation logic and 2) incorrectness logic. We explore the theory of this new incorrectness separation logic (ISL), and use it to derive a begin-anywhere, intra-procedural symbolic execution analysis that has no false positives by construction. In so doing, we take a step towards transferring modular, scalable techniques from the world of program verification to bug catching.","Raad, Azalea; Berdine, Josh; Dang, Hoang-Hai; Dreyer, Derek; O’Hearn, Peter; Villard, Jules",Computer Aided Verification,456,1

Each of these ventilators is having unique features while meeting standard functional specifications of mechanical ventilators. The first design works on compressed air source as control gas and does not require electrical power for its operation. Parameters like tidal volume, breathing rate etc. can be set mechanically in this ventilator. Second one is an automated Ambu bag based system, which has digital controller providing closed-loop control of critical ventilator parameters and a very unique geared actuation system that ensure long cyclic life to Ambu bag and fine control of parameters. The third design is an air blower based pneumatic circuit ventilator which is a state of the art ICU ventilator. Mathematical modeling of the systems is carried out to design the mechanical/electrical control elements and to simulate the performance of the system. Prototypes of ventilators were developed, testing and simulation runs were carried out and critical parameters were measured ensuring satisfactory performance of the system.",,Trans Indian Natl,456,1

This paper reports results from a major new London-based study exploring public responses to Live Facial Recognition (LFR): a technology that enables police to carry out real-time automated identity checks in public spaces. We find that public trust and legitimacy are important factors predicting the acceptance or rejection of LFR. Crucially, trust and, particularly, legitimacy seem to serve to alleviate privacy concerns about police use of this technology. In an era where police use of new technologies is only likely to increase, especially as the Covid-19 global pandemic develops, these findings have important implications for police–public relations and how the ‘public voice’ is fed into debates.","Bradford, Ben; Yesberg, Julia A; Jackson, Jonathan; Dawson, Paul",Br J Criminol,456,1

However, these firms appear to have adopted API technology largely to meet their customers’ needs and demands. The pressures on industries to develop, implement, and maintain API products and services can prevent companies from gaining a greater awareness of API development’s benefits. Firms may thus miss out on related monetary or non-monetary exploitation of their business assets. This study explored the status of the API economy and development among Finnish industries. The dataset comprised publicly available information from 226 private and public organizations representing a variety of industries, such as industrial, consumer goods, and services sectors.

It is one of the predominant causes of death in pregnant women, infants, and immunocompromised persons. Despite such fatal effects, until now there is no proper medication or drug available for such a serious foodborne infection. One of the most promising ways to deal with this challenge is vaccination. This present study aims at the prediction of B cell epitopes for subunit vaccine designing against Listeria monocytogenes using a reverse vaccinology approach. Among screened out 299 epitopes of strain F2365 of Listeria monocytogenes, based on the VaxiJen score, the top 20 epitopes were selected. 3D modeling of epitopes and alleles was generated by PEPstrMOD and Swiss Model respectively. Molecular docking reveals 4 epitopes viz., MKFLFPLKL, CEETFGIRL, FLKIDPPIL, and VRHHGGGHK based on binding energy. All 4 epitopes were investigated for non-toxicity, binding affinity, and population coverage. After vigorous investigation, epitope FLKIDPPIL was anticipated as the best vaccine contender. The stability of the FLKIDPPIL-HLA DRB1 _0101 complex was proved by performing the simulation. Here, predicted peptide through the Insilico approach may become a potential remedy against listeriosis, after the wet-lab approach and clinical trials.","Srivastava, Shivani; Sharma, Suraj Kumar; Srivastava, Vivek; Kumar, Ajay",Int J Pept Res Ther,456,16

DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: From April 23 to 27, 2020, an online survey was completed by 1,600 community-dwelling older adults in Japan. METHODS: We assessed the frailty status using the Kihon checklist, and other demographics and asked questions regarding PA at two time points: January and April 2020. We defined the total PA time (minutes) per week based on activity frequency and time. RESULTS: The study participants’ mean age, proportion of women, and prevalence of frailty were 74.0±5.6 years, 50% (n=800), and 24.3% (n=388), respectively. We found a significant decrease in total PA time in April 2020 (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 180 [0 to 420]) when compared to January 2020 (median [IQR], 245 [90 to 480]) (P<0.001). We also performed a subgroup analysis according to the frailty category; total PA time significantly decreased in April 2020 when compared to January 2020 for all frailty categories (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the total PA time in April 2020 significantly decreased compared to that in January 2020 in older adults. This finding may lead to a higher incidence of disability in the near future in older people.","Yamada, Minoru; Kimura, Y.; Ishiyama, D.; Otobe, Y.; Suzuki, M.; Koyama, S.; Kikuchi, T.; Kusumi, H.; Arai, H.",J Nutr Health Aging,456,12

In the first part, the Reflection argues that there is, more than ever, an undeferrable need for a change of approach to international law toward ecocentrism, which puts the environment at the center and conceives the environment as us, including humans, non-human beings, and natural objects. To encourage the incorporation of ecocentrism in the entire discipline, the Reflection will rely on some insight of ecofeminism, whose potential has not been fully investigated in international legal scholarship. In the second part, the Reflection illustrates what an eco-centric international law would mean, imagining three possible applications: first, what the author has called environmental global health, which is connected to the current pandemic and puts into question the proposals dealing with global health that completely miss the theorization of the environment as a whole; second, how actors of international law would change according to an eco-centric perspective; and, third, how the rules prohibiting the use of force might be reconceptualized. The analysis contained in these pages cannot itself exhaust all the possible nuances of the legal reasoning, but it is aimed at being a provocative starting point for a change in the mindset and approach of international legal scholarship.","De Vido, Sara",Jus Cogens,456,1

This is despite politicians’ claims that anti-social behaviour reflects a moral decline. This article draws on a focus group study from the North West of England and on ideas from criminology and philosophy. People’s assessments of anti-social behaviour are found to be informed by judgements of morality, most often in terms of ‘doing what’s right’, having respect, and abiding by the Golden Rule, to ‘do to others what you would have them do to you’. Understandings of anti-social behaviour are stretched so far by the public that they can range from littering through to tax avoidance, but what these behaviours have in common is their perceived breaching of our day-to-day moral standards.

METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, the medical records of elderly patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hunan province, China, from January 21 to February 19, 2020 were reviewed. The characteristics of young-old patients and old-old patients were compared. RESULTS: Of the 105 elderly patients confirmed with COVID-19, 81.0% were young-old patients, and 19.0% were old-old patients; 54.3% of elderly patients were females. Overall, 69.5% of elderly patients had underlying diseases, and the most common comorbidities included hypertension (43.8%), diabetes (25.7%), and cardiac disease (16.2%). Of the elderly patients, 22.9% were severe and 10.5% were critical severe cases. On admission, the most frequent symptoms in elderly patients included fever (66.7%), cough (64.8%), and fatigue (33.3%). Lymphopenia (31.4%), increased D-dimer (38.1%), depressed albumin (36.2%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (41.0%), and a high level of C-reactive protein (79.0%) were common among elderly patients with COVID-19. The median prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were longer in old-old patients than young-old patients (PT median 12.3 vs. 13.1 s, p = 0.007; APTT median 39.0 vs. 33.5 s, p = 0.045). Young-old patients showed fewer complications (14.1%) than old-old patients (40.0% p = 0.0014) and fewer received invasive ventilator support (3.5 vs. 25.0%, p = 0.006). As of March 11, 2020, 85.7% of elderly patients had been discharged, 3 deaths had occurred, and 11.4% were still hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients usually have chronic medical illness and are likely to have a severe or critically severe condition. They could show atypical symptoms without fever or cough and multiple organ dysfunction. Old-old patients tend to have more complications than young-old patients during hospitalization. Careful nursing, observation, and systemic treatment are very important in elderly patients.","Frohnhofen, Helmut",,456,1

These concerns arise primarily from a lack of understanding of insurance products, general failures of financial literacy and the need to use relatively exotic products in order to keep costs down for poor households. We investigate the importance of incentivized measures for general understanding, as well as domain-specific knowledge of the decision context on the purchase and the quality of index insurance decisions. We evaluate the quality of financial decisions by comparing the individual expected welfare outcomes of a number of decisions each individual makes to purchase index insurance or not. We find that excess purchase is an important driver of welfare losses, and that our incentivized measure of domain-specific literacy plays a critical role in bringing about better quality index insurance decisions.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and trans-membrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are the two major host factors that contribute to the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animal to human is considered a rare event that necessarily requires strong evolutionary adaptations. Till date no other human cellular receptors are identified beside ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 entry inside the human cell. Proteolytic cleavage of viral spike (S)-protein and ACE2 by TMPRSS2 began the entire host–pathogen interaction initiated with the physical binding of ACE2 to S-protein. SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binds to ACE2 with much higher affinity and stability than that of SARS-CoVs. Molecular interactions between ACE2-S and TMPRSS2-S are crucial and preciously mediated by specific residues. Structural stability, binding affinity and level of expression of these three interacting proteins are key susceptibility factors for COVID-19. Specific protein–protein interactions (PPI) are being identified that explains uniqueness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Amino acid substitutions due to naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms potentially alter these PPIs and poses further clinical heterogeneity of COVID-19. Repurposing of several phytochemicals and approved drugs against ACE2, TMPRSS2 and S-protein have been proposed that could inhibit PPI between them. We have also identified some novel lead phytochemicals present in Azadirachta indica and Aloe barbadensis which could be utilized for further in vitro and in vivo anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. Uncovering details of ACE2-S and TMPRSS2-S interactions would further contribute to future research on COVID-19.

Results: (1) Psychological empowerment was positively correlated with psychological capital and job involvement. Psychological capital was positively correlated with job involvement. Psychological empowerment, psychological capital, and job involvement were significantly and positively correlated with retention intention. (2) Psychological empowerment influences kindergarten teachers' retention intention mainly through three indirect effects: the single intermediary effects of psychological capital and job involvement and the chain intermediary effect of psychological capital → job involvement.

Although cross-sex hormone treatment (CSHT) is usually considered safe, serious adverse events may occur. Here we report a case of deep vein thrombosis associated with estradiol treatment in an otherwise healthy young transgender woman. Case Presentation: A 21-year-old transgender woman using CSHT applied to our outpatient clinic with the complaint of painful swelling in her left leg. She was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the same leg one year earlier when she was admitted to the emergency room of another hospital with similar symptoms, and was given warfarin treatment for 3 months which has improved the symptoms. Three months after cessation of warfarin, symptoms re-occurred, but she was only able to apply to our clinic after another 3 months due to COVID-19 pandemic. Physical examination was unremarkable except asymmetrical swelling in the left leg. She has been receiving oral estradiol 6 mg/day and spironolactone 200 mg/day for 2 years. She denied taking estradiol in higher doses than recommended. She did not have any predisposing factors for DVT including obesity, immobilization and smoking. She had no prior history of venous thromboembolic events (VTE). Family history was also negative for thrombophilia except her uncle was diagnosed with ischemic cerebrovascular event at the age of 60. Lower extremity venous doppler ultrasonography revealed a thrombus in the left popliteal vein that caused total obstruction of blood flow to the distal. Plasma levels of d-dimer and fibrinogen were 0.35 mg/L and 262 mg/dL, respectively. Serum levels of sex hormones were estradiol: 204 pg/mL, total testosterone: 22.4 ng/dL, FSH: 0.22 mIU/mL, LH: 1.5 mIU/mL. Thrombophilia panel revealed a homozygous mutation in MTHFR (1296), and heterozygous mutations in both Factor V Leiden and plasma activator inhibitor (4G/5G). She was given enoxaparin in addition to warfarin until INR was elevated up to desired levels. Oral estradiol treatment was switched to transdermal route. Life-long anticoagulant treatment was suggested since the thrombotic event was triggered by estradiol treatment which will be continued. Conclusions: Limited data are available on incidence and management of VTE associated with estradiol treatment in male-to-female individuals. As in general population, routine screening for thrombophilia is not recommended in transgender women prior to the initiation of CSHT if no personal or family history of VTE is present. Even in the absence of predisposing factors, life-long anticoagulant therapy may be considered since the VTE-provoking estradiol treatment will be continued. Switching the route of estradiol treatment from oral to transdermal may be beneficial.","Oguz, Seda Hanife; Buyukasik, Yahya; Yildiz, Bulent O",J Endocr Soc,456,1

Desire to quantify and prove this impact has led such charities to be interested in and even invest in measures of community well-being. In this paper I explore how the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected local philanthropy’s relationship with data and information by increasing public awareness of community data as a tool for describing rapidly changing community needs, raising expectations for an expedited connection between data analysis and action, and compelling civic leaders to engage in scenario planning. I draw on the case of Syracuse, NY to illustrate how the presence of a real time collaborative data infrastructure presents promising opportunities to address the data needs of place-based philanthropy when it comes to monitoring and acting to improve community well-being in the COVID era.","Ridzi, Frank",Int,456,1

Since the discovery of pivotal mechanisms of senescence such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis inhibition, and the development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), efforts in the understanding of how senescent cells participate in renal physiological and pathological aging have grown exponentially. This has been encouraged by both preclinical studies in animal models with senescent cell clearance or genetic depletion as well as due to evidence coming from the clinical oncologic experience. This review considers the molecular mechanism and pathways that trigger premature renal aging from mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic modifications to autophagy, DNA damage repair (DDR), and the involvement of extracellular vesicles. We also discuss the different pharmaceutical approaches to selectively target senescent cells (namely, senolytics) or the development of systemic SASP (called senomorphics) in basic models of CKD and clinical trials. Finally, an overview will be provided on the potential opportunities for their use in renal transplantation during ex vivo machine perfusion to improve the quality of the graft.","Franzin, Rossana; Stasi, Alessandra; Ranieri, Elena; Netti, Giuseppe Stefano; Cantaluppi, Vincenzo; Gesualdo, Loreto; Stallone, Giovanni; Castellano, Giuseppe",Front Pharmacol,456,1

INTRODUCTION: Patient education is considered a core component of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and nowadays, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, online education programs are critical. However, the best strategy for implementing these digital programs to increase patients’ adherence and learning is not fully established. PURPOSE: To assess the uptake and effectiveness of an educational intervention transmitted through video sessions integrated into a home-based CR program (CR-HB). METHODS: Prospective cohort study including patients (pts) who were participating in a centre-based CR program and accepted to participate in a CR-HB program during COVID-19 pandemic. The CR-HB program consisted of a multidisciplinary online program with educational videos for pts and family members / caregivers, that aimed to educate on necessary behavioural and lifestyle changes. Weekly, a 15-minute video was uploaded and lectured by the correspondent health professional from the CR team. The educational sessions covered the following topics: COVID-19 and cardiovascular (CV) disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking cessation, diabetes, medical therapy and adherence, healthy diet, exercise and physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sexual dysfunction and CV disease. At the end of the program we applied a 10 questions questionnaire to evaluate the knowledge of pts about the topics of educational sessions. All the pts answered the questionnaire and results were compared between the pts who attended the educational sessions and the ones who didn’t. RESULTS: 116 pts with CV disease were included in the CR-HB program (62.6 ± 8.9 years, 95 males). Almost 90% (n = 103) of the participants had coronary artery disease and the mean LVEF was 52 ± 11%. Obesity was the most common risk factor (75%) followed by hypertension (60%), family history of CV disease (42%), dyslipidemia (38%), diabetes (18%), and smoking (13%). The pts participated, on average, in 1.45 ± 2.6 education sessions (rate participation of 13.2%). About half of the pts (49%) attended, at least, one session and these pts attended, on average, 3 sessions (2.96 ± 3.0). The questionnaire results were better in pts who attended at least 1 educational session than in those who did not attend any (7.4 ± 1.9 vs 7,1 ± 1.7), however this difference was not statistically significant. Regarding education status, 33 pts (45.2%) had a bachelor degree and this group of pts had a significant higher result in questionnaire (7.8 ± 1.9 vs 6.7 ± 1.8; p = 0.015) and tended to participate more often in education sessions (2.13 vs 1.6, p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a low rate of participation in sessions, highlighting the importance of developing strategies to increase motivation and adherence to online educational programs. Also, more literate patients had significantly greater health knowledge and adherence to educational sessions, suggesting that this population could benefit more from this type of programs.","Silva, BV; Aguiar Ricardo, I; Alves Da Silva, P; Rodrigues, T; Cunha, N; Couto Pereira, S; Silverio Antonio, P; Brito, J; Pinto, R; Lemos Pires, M; Fiuza, S; Correia, AL; J Pinto, F; Abreu, A",Eur J Prev Cardiol,456,1

The development of water treatment technology to combat viral infection by inactivation or disinfection might play a key role in infection prevention in places where drinking water sources are biologically contaminated. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) has antimicrobial and antifouling surface effects mainly because of its electrochemical properties and texture, and LIG-based water filters have been used for the inactivation of bacteria. However, the antiviral activity of LIG-based filters has not yet been explored. Here we show that LIG filters also have antiviral effects by applying electrical potential during filtration of the model prototypic poxvirus Vaccinia lister. This antiviral activity of the LIG filters was compared with its antibacterial activity, which showed that higher voltages were required for the inactivation of viruses compared to that of bacteria. The generation of reactive oxygen species, along with surface electrical effects, played a role in the mechanism of virus inactivation. This new property of LIG highlights its potential for use in water and wastewater treatment for the electrochemical disinfection of various pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses.","Barbhuiya, Najmul Haque; Singh, Swatantra P.; Makovitzki, Arik; Narkhede, Pradnya; Oren, Ziv; Adar, Yaakov; Lupu, Edith; Cherry, Lilach; Monash, Arik; Arnusch, Christopher J.",Materials (Basel),456,0

PURPOSE: To examine whether metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses during exercise were altered over a period of three months in young adults who previously tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. METHODS: A longitudinal analysis (n=7, 4M) was performed on young adults that tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 in the three‐to‐four weeks prior to data collection (BL), as well as once a month following baseline for two additional months (1M and 2M). Participants completed an incremental peak aerobic capacity test on a cycle ergometer. Metabolic and cardiorespiratory measurements were collected every minute using a metabolic cart. Measured variables included the following: ventilation (V̇(E)), tidal volume (V(T)), breathing frequency (f (B)), absolute and relative oxygen consumption (V̇O(2),), carbon dioxide production (V̇CO(2)), ventilatory efficiency (V̇(E)/V̇CO(2)), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and heart rate (HR). Data were compared across visits at rest and during exercise at 60 W, 120 W, and peak exercise. Values are expressed as mean±SD. RESULTS: No differences were observed between visits in metabolic or cardiorespiratory variables at rest (p>0.05). There were no observed differences in most metabolic and cardiorespiratory variables during exercise at 60 W (p>0.05). However, V(T) during exercise at 60 W differed across visits (BL: 1.08 ± 0.19 L; 1M: 1.27 ± 0.27 L; 2M: 1.21 ± 0.25; p=0.007). No differences in any measure during exercise at 120 W were observed between visits. At peak exercise, V(T) was significantly different between visits (BL: 2.29 ± 0.42 L; 1M: 2.49 ± 0.54 L; 2M: 2.37 ± 0.51 L; p=0.033). Absolute and relative V̇O(2) between visits approached significance (p=0.055 and p=0.069, respectively), with lower peak oxygen consumption at baseline (2.60 ± 0.43 L·min(‐1), 35.7 ± 5.5 mL·kg(‐1)·min(‐1)) compared with follow up visits (1M: 2.84 ± 0.59 L·min(‐1), 38.8 ± 7.1 mL·kg(‐1)·min(‐1);2M: 2.72 ± 0.54 L·min(‐1), 37.3 ± 6.9 mL·kg(‐1)·min(‐1)). Ratings of perceived exertion were not different between visits at any exercise intensity (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses at peak, but not submaximal, exercise may be limited acutely but that the decrement is recovered within two months following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We suspect that the changes observed in tidal volume between visits is related to the trend of greater peak metabolic work rates with time, despite no observed differences in minute ventilation.","Augenreich, Marc; Province, Valesha; Stute, Nina; Stickford, Abigail; Ratchford, Stephen; Stickford, Jonathon",FASEB J,456,1

Students report a desire to resume in‐person learning but safety and flexibility are paramount to achieve this instructional modality. Flipping the classroom is a teaching approach that promotes independent learning outside of class with activity‐based exercises within the classroom. Benefits of a flipped classroom include increased student engagement, course flexibility, and enhanced learning. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the utility of flipping the classroom on learning physiology during the COVID‐19 pandemic. This study utilized undergraduate Human Physiology students (n = 124) during the fall 2020 semester. Course content was provided as asynchronous online lectures with 3 – 5 new videos released weekly. Students independently viewed the lectures outside of class and completed a synchronous weekly online quiz before a weekly in‐person lecture recitation with masks and social distancing. Lecture recitations (50 min) were designed to review, reinforce and practice lecture material—they were generally structured as follows: 1) review most difficult concepts from recent lectures; 2) answer questions collected via collaborative online document; 3) complete/discuss practice questions via iClicker; and 4) complete/discuss mini‐case studies or real‐world scenarios. Sessions were recorded for asynchronous viewing. To supplement lecture, students also completed 3 traditional wet labs and 3 virtual labs (ADInstruments). At the conclusion of the semester, students were offered extra credit (<1% course total) to complete a survey regarding their experience with the flipped classroom environment and perceived barriers to academic success. Student demographics: 71% were female, 52% were nursing majors and 50% were sophomores. Students felt that the flipped classroom design fit well into their schedules (87%) and they learned a lot of material (85%) that was applicable to their lives (90%) and future careers (94%). Students agreed that their questions were answered during lecture recitation (66%), the sessions helped them understand difficult material (70%), and they benefited from the in‐person practice (71%). The majority (68%) stated that lecture recitations improved their physiology education. Despite these positive responses, 60% of students still reported that the COVID‐19 pandemic had negatively impacted their physiology education. Top barriers to educational success included increased stress (77%), working more (52%), lack of motivation (45%), increased family obligations (44%), and feeling overwhelmed (39%). In addition, 20% of students reported contracting COVID‐19 and 42% had to self‐isolate due to exposure. These data demonstrate the benefits of a flipped classroom model to teach undergraduate physiology. This research also highlights the increased challenges that students face as they attempt to continue their education during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Desaulniers, Amy",FASEB J,456,1

Electronic financial transactions are gradually taking over traditional banking services in terms of transferring funds, utility payments, insurance premium, mortgages and even stock trading. Despite the widespread popularity of smartphones and the advantages of mobile banking, the adoption rates of the mobile apps have been very low all over the world. Our study explored the consumer acceptance of mobile apps in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by using a structured online questionnaire that was designed using standard variables from the Technology Acceptance Model. Principal component analysis was used to identify and score these factors for the subsequent categorical regression analysis. Consumers were assigned numerical categories depending on their level of usage of the app, and the CATREG nonlinear technique was used to determine the significance of technology acceptance factors. The results show that almost two-thirds of the sample were currently using Mobile Banking apps, and they predominantly belonged to the 30–40 age-group. Perceived usefulness and available information were identified as the main factors influencing acceptance and level of usage of mobile banking apps. This study makes a significant contribution to the existing literature by identifying consumers according to their level of usage and adopting the categorical regression model, which has not been attempted earlier.

The degree to which individuals see themselves as part of the local social group, or local social identity, i.e., the social identification with the community of the place where people are living, may play an important role in enhancing happiness and well-being, as well as relationships of people with their own living environment, i.e., place attachment. We hypothesized that local social identity influences well-being via specific components of place attachment to the residential city/town, i.e., place identity, social relations, and lack of resources (which is the opposite of place dependence). We measured local social identity, individual well-being, interdependent happiness, and place attachment in a sample of N = 375 participants. We tested our hypotheses by conducting a series of mediation analyses with local social identity as an independent variable, individual well-being and interdependent happiness as dependent variables, and place attachment subfactors, i.e., place identity, social relations, and lack of resources, as mediators. Results showed that the relation between local social identity and both individual well-being and interdependent happiness was positively mediated by place identity and social relations, while the lack of resources emerged as a negative mediator only in the relation between local social identity and individual well-being (not for interdependent happiness).

They occasionally present with near-miss events which if left untreated, can result in death. OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence, indications of ICU admissions, near-miss events, and their effect on mortality in obstetric and puerperal patients. MATERIAL & METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the health records of all the obstetric and puerperal patients (pregnant and until 6 weeks postpartum) admitted to our tertiary care hospital from January 2019 to December 2020. Patient demographic characteristics, obstetric, surgical, and medical conditions, acute physiology, and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores, organ failures, treatment, ICU and hospital length of stay, and mortality outcomes were studied. RESULTS: A total of 22 obstetric patients were admitted to the ICU during the above study period.

However, naming these products has been the subject of considerable debate. This study used a 3 × 10 between-subjects online experiment involving a quota sample of 3,186 U.S. adult panel participants to test common or usual names using images of realistic packages of three types of seafood that a consumer might encounter in a supermarket. The terms tested were, ""cell-based seafood,"" ""cell-cultured seafood,"" ""cultivated seafood,"" and ""cultured seafood"" and the phrases, ""produced using cellular aquaculture,"" ""cultivated from the cells of ____,"" and ""grown directly from the cells of ____,"" where the blanks are filled by the name of the seafood product. Five criteria were used for evaluation, including each term's ability to: enable consumers to distinguish cell-based seafood from wild and farmed fish, to signal potential allergenicity, be seen by consumers as an appropriate term to identify the product, not disparage either cell-based or conventional products, and not evoke thoughts, images, or emotions that are inconsistent with the idea that the products are safe, healthy, and nutritious. The results showed that ""cell-based seafood"" outperforms the other names tested. It enables consumers to recognize that the products are neither wild caught nor farm raised, signals potential allergenicity, is seen as an appropriate name for describing the technology/process, and it performs well with respect to measures of consumer acceptance, particularly in comparison to conventional products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Creating consensus around a single common or usual name for cell-based meat, poultry, and seafood products is clearly important both for regulatory reasons and for shaping public perceptions and understanding of the products that are labeled with it. Our findings suggest that ""cell-based"" is the best common or usual name for seafood products that both meets FDA regulatory requirements and performs well with respect to potential consumer acceptance. Consistent use of this term by industry, advocates, and regulators would help orient consumers to what is likely to be a transformational food technology.","Hallman, William K; Hallman, William K",Journal of food science,456,24

This study aimed at developing a sensitive fluorometric assay for detecting influenza viral RNA through tandem gene amplification methods including reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), followed by strand displacement amplification (SDA) coupled with rolling circle amplification (RCA). Influenza viral RNA was initially amplified by RT-PCR with a tailed reverse primer containing an additional sequence for SDA. The RT-PCR amplicon was then subjected to SDA, yielding multiple copies of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that can be used as a primer for subsequent RCA. Thereafter, a long ssDNA segment harboring tandem repeated G-quadruplexes that were generated through RCA was intercalated by Thioflavin T, yielding a strong fluorescence signal indicating the presence of the target viral RNA. Fluorometric analysis detected influenza viral RNA ranging from 50 pg to 500 pg with a limit of detection of 6.2 pg with a signal-to-background ratio of 10 and identified each influenza virus strain (H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B). Thus, the present method for the label-free fluorometric detection of viral RNA via tandem gene amplifications combining RT-PCR-coupled SDA and G-quadruplex-generating RCA would facilitate the efficient diagnosis of influenza infection.","Lee, Hyobeen; Kim, Dong-Min; Kim, Dong-Eun",The Analyst,456,1

METHODS The study included 38 patients with SSc and 40 healthy controls. A detailed ocular examination was performed on all participants. Corneal parameters such as K1, K2, Km, corneal volume (CV), central corneal thickness (CCT), and ST at a distance of 1000, 2000, and 3000 μm from the scleral spur were measured. CT was measured at five points, including the subfoveal area and the temporal and nasal points at radii of 750.0 and 1500.0 μm. The scleroderma health assessment questionnaire (SHAQ) was administered to SSc patients to investigate the disease-related QoL. RESULTS Individuals with SSc had thicker ST at all distances from the scleral spur (P=0.008, P=0.001, P=0.002, respectively). All corneal parameters were significantly lower in the SSc group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, SSc patients had significantly lower median CT at N750.0, N1500.0, T750.0, and T1500.0 points and thinner subfoveal CT than healthy controls (P < 0.05). There was a weak-moderate negative correlation between ST and the components of the SHAQ scale and SHAQ-global. CONCLUSION Despite not having ocular involvement, SSc patients had thicker ST but thinner CT and corneal parameters than healthy controls. This may indicate subclinical inflammation in patients with SSc. Only ST was affected by organ involvement and QoL among the ocular parameters.","Kaymaz, Serdar; Halil, Yılmaz; Kaya, Hüseyin; Karasu, Ugur; Cobankara, Veli",International journal of rheumatic diseases,456,1

Mammalian cells, including islets, have been shown to be adversely affected by temperature changes in vitro and in vivo, yet protocols that control for thermal fluctuations during cell transport are lacking. To evaluate an optimal method of shipping human islets, an initial assessment of transportation conditions was conducted using standardized materials and operating procedures in 48 shipments sent to a central location by eight pancreas-processing laboratories using a single commercial airline transporter. Optimization of preliminary conditions was conducted, and human islet quality was then evaluated in 2,338 shipments pre- and postimplementation of a finalized transportation container and standard operating procedures. The initial assessment revealed that the outside temperature ranged from a mean of -4.6 ± 10.3°C to 20.9 ± 4.8°C. Within-container temperature drops to or below 15°C occurred in 16 shipments (36%), while the temperature was found to be stabilized between 15°C and 29°C in 29 shipments (64%). Implementation of an optimized transportation container and operating procedure reduced the number of within-container temperature drops (≤ 15°C) to 13% (n = 37 of 289 winter shipments), improved the number desirably maintained between 15°C and 29°C to 86% (n = 250), but also increased the number reaching or exceeding 29°C to 1% (n = 2; overall p < 0.0001). Additionally, postreceipt quality ratings of excellent to good improved pre- versus postimplantation of the standardized protocol, adjusting for preshipment purity/viability levels (p < 0.0001). Our results show that extreme temperature fluctuations during transport of human islets, occurring when using a commercial airline transporter for long distance shipping, can be controlled using standardized containers, materials, and operating procedures. This cost-effective and pragmatic standardized protocol for the transportation of human islets can potentially be adapted for use with other mammalian cell systems and is available online at http://iidp.coh.org/sops.aspx.","Kaddis, John S; Hanson, Matthew S; Cravens, James; Qian, Dajun; Olack, Barbara; Antler, Martha; Papas, Klearchos K; Iglesias, Itzia; Barbaro, Barbara; Fernandez, Luis; Powers, Alvin C; Niland, Joyce C",Cell transplantation,456,5

This study aimed to investigate the impact of the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score applied to DWI on treatment outcomes in patients with acute stroke undergoing stent-retriever embolectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and DWI data from 171 patients with acute anterior circulation stroke who were treated with stent-retriever embolectomy within 6 hours of symptom onset. DWI-ASPECTS scores were analyzed with the full scale or were dichotomized (4-6 versus 7-10). Patients with DWI-ASPECTS ≤3 were excluded from the study. Associations between outcome and clinical and radiologic factors were determined with a multivariate logistic regression analysis. A good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months. RESULTS The median DWI-ASPECTS was 7 (interquartile range, 6-8). The rates of good outcome, symptomatic hemorrhage, and mortality were not different between high DWI-ASPECTS (scores of 7-10) and intermediate DWI-ASPECTS (scores of 4-6) groups. In patients with an intermediate DWI-ASPECTS, good outcome was achieved in 46.5% (20/43) of patients with successful revascularization, whereas no patients without successful revascularization had a good outcome (P = .016). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of good outcome were age and successful revascularization. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggested that there were no differences in outcomes between patients with a high DWI-ASPECTS and those with an intermediate DWI-ASPECTS who underwent stent-retriever embolectomy for acute anterior circulation stroke. Thus, patients with an intermediate DWI-ASPECTS otherwise eligible for endovascular therapy may not be excluded from stent-retriever embolectomy or stroke trials.","Kim, S K; Yoon, W; Park, M S; Heo, T W; Baek, B H; Lee, Y Y",AJNR.

65338,65338,65338,Safety Aspects in Tissue Banking - An Update.,10.904436,3.1253731,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND There are few surgeons in the United States, within private practice and academic centers, currently performing transvaginal cholecystectomies (TVC). The lack of exposure to TVC during residency or fellowship training, coupled with a poorly defined learning curve, further limits interested surgeons who want to apply this technique to their practice. This study describes the learning curve encountered during the introduction of TVC to our academic facility. METHODS This study is an analysis of consecutive TVCs performed between August 14, 2009 and August 3, 2012 at an academic center. The TVC patients were divided into sequential quartiles (n = 15/16). The learning curve outcome was measured as the operative time of TVC patients and compared to the operative time of female laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) patients performed during the same time period. RESULTS Sixty-one patients underwent a TVC with a mean age of 38 ± 12 years and mean BMI was 29 ± 6 kg/m(2). Sixty-seven female patients who underwent a LC with average age 41 ± 15 years and average BMI 33 ± 12 kg/m(2). The average operative time of LC patients and TVC patients was 48 ± 20 and 60 ± 17 min, respectively. Significant improvement in TVC operative times was seen between the first (n = 15 TVCs) and second quartiles (p = 0.04) and stayed relatively constant for third quartile, during which there was no statistically significant difference between the mean LC operative time for the second and third TVC quartiles CONCLUSIONS The learning curve of a fellowship-trained surgeon introducing TVC to their surgical repertoire, as measured by improved operative times, can be achieved with approximately 15 cases.","Wood, Stephanie G; Dai, Feng; Dabu-Bondoc, Susan; Mikhael, Hosni; Vadivelu, Nalini; Duffy, Andrew; Roberts, Kurt E",Surgical endoscopy,456,1

In literature, the debate on the overall mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic, directly and indirectly, associated with the disease, is still open. OBJECTIVES to describe the time trend of the mortality in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic accounting for age, gender, and geographical areas. DESIGN analysis of mortality trend, by region, age, and gender. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS the Italian mortality data, released by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat), have been considered for the analyses. The data refer to the first four months of 2015-2019 and 2020, involving 7,270 municipalities, corresponding to 93% of the Italian population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES the mortality rates in the first four months of 2015-2019 and 2020, age-adjusted, have been calculated together with the percent variation. The data were analysed by gender, age class (<65; >=65 years), Region, and geographical areas (Northern versus Central-Southern Italy). The overall daily mortality series have been represented as rates over 100,000 resident population. RESULTS in addition to the geographical location, the age component was a major determinant of the mortality pattern. The greater increase in the overall mortality was evidenced among elderly subjects in the Northern Italian Regions most affected by the epidemic. In these areas, also gender component played an important role in determining the mortality excess: higher mortality rates in the first four months of 2020 are observed for males in comparison to female populations. CONCLUSIONS this research reveals that the population components are an important issue in determining the COVID-19 mortality excess. For this reason, it is of primary importance to monitor mortality (overall and by COVID-19) by age and gender and to consider these components and the related factors (comorbidity, exposures affecting the lung) in the public prevention policies towards the protection of the most fragile population groups.","Azzolina, Daniela; Magnani, Corrado; Gallo, Elisa; Ferrante, Daniela; Gregori, Dario",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,456,19
68347,68347,68347,Single-port-access surgery with a novel magnet camera system.,11.235067,3.19107,2012,"Graft arteriosclerois (GA), also called allograft vasculopathy, is a pathologic lesion that develops over months to years in transplanted organs characterized by diffuse, circumferential stenosis of the entire graft vascular tree. The most critical component of GA pathogenesis is the proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells within the intima. When a human coronary artery segment is interposed into the infra-renal aortae of immunodeficient mice, the intimas could be expand in response to adoptively transferred human T cells allogeneic to the artery donor or exogenous human IFN-γ in the absence of human T cells. Interposition of a mouse aorta from one strain into another mouse strain recipient is limited as a model for chronic rejection in humans because the acute cell-mediated rejection response in this mouse model completely eliminates all donor-derived vascular cells from the graft within two-three weeks. We have recently developed two new mouse models to circumvent these problems. The first model involves interposition of a vessel segment from a male mouse into a female recipient of the same inbred strain (C57BL/6J). Graft rejection in this case is directed only against minor histocompatibility antigens encoded by the Y chromosome (present in the male but not the female) and the rejection response that ensues is sufficiently indolent to preserve donor-derived smooth muscle cells for several weeks. The second model involves interposing an artery segment from a wild type C57BL/6J mouse donor into a host mouse of the same strain and gender that lacks the receptor for IFN-γ followed by administration of mouse IFN-γ (delivered via infection of the mouse liver with an adenoviral vector. There is no rejection in this case as both donor and recipient mice are of the same strain and gender but donor smooth muscle cells proliferate in response to the cytokine while host-derived cells, lacking receptor for this cytokine, are unresponsive. By backcrossing additional genetic changes into the vessel donor, both models can be used to assess the effect of specific genes on GA progression. Here, we describe detailed protocols for our mouse GA models.","Qin, Lingfeng; Yu, Luyang; Min, Wang",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,456,1

We used Receiver-Operating-Characteristic-curves to calculate the Area-under-the-curve (AUC), cutoff-values, positive (+LR), negative (-LR) and interval-Likelihood-Ratios (iLR) for predicting a PJI. The most significant parameter was synovial interleukin-6 (IL-6) (cutoff-value ≥ 30,750 pg/ml, AUC = 0.959, SE = 90.0%, SP = 94.7%, +LR = 17.27), followed by synovial lactate (cutoff-value ≥ 8.3 mmol/l, AUC = 0.844, SE = 71.4%, SP=88.0%, +LR = 5.95), and synovial glucose (cutoff-value ≤ 44 mg/dl, AUC = 0.829, SE = 79.2%, SP = 78.6%, +LR = 3.69). IL-6 ≥ 30,750 pg/ml and lactate ≥ 10 mmol/l make a PJI very likely, IL-6 <10,000pg/ml or lactate <4.3 mmol/l makes a PJI very unlikely. If none of these thresholds are met, physicians should use the iLR of IL-6, glucose and lactate to estimate the likelihood of PJI.","Lenski, Markus; Scherer, Michael A",The Journal of arthroplasty,456,11

Modified Nernst-Planck Poisson (mNPP) equations are used to calculate the ion density per unit area in a parallel plate capacitor geometry with a bulk ion concentration 215 ≤ cbulk ≤ 1782 mol/m3. With electrodes of equal size at a 2 V potential difference, the EDL ion density of the single-ion conductor is ~ 7 x 1013 ions/cm2, which is approximately 50% of the ion density induced in the dual-ion conductor. However, this difference is reduced to 8% when the electrode at which the cationic EDL forms is 10 times smaller than the counter electrode. Thus, for a field-effect transistor (FET) gated by a single-ion conductor, it is especially important to have a large gate-to-channel size ratio to achieve strong ion doping. The modeled ion densities are validated by Hall-effect measurements on graphene Hall bars gated by a polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based single-ion conductor. The sheet carrier density, nS, is ~ 2 x 1013 cm-2 at Vg = 2 V, which is 3.5 times smaller than the predicted value, and the same order of magnitude as the ns measured for a PEO-based, dual-ion conductor on the same graphene. The numerical modeling results can be approximated by a simple analysis of capacitors in series, where the EDLs are modeled as capacitors with thickness estimated by the sum of the Debye screening length and the Stern Layer. The series of capacitors estimate agrees with the numerical modeling of the dual-ion conductor to within 10% and single-ion conductor to within 30% from 0.25 to 2 V (cbulk = 925 mol/m3); similar agreement is observed in the concentration range of 353 to 1650 mol/m3 for both single and dual-ion conductors.","Woeppel, Aaron; Xu, Ke; Kozhakhmetov, Azimkhan; Awate, Shubham; Robinson, Joshua A; Fullerton-Shirey, Susan K",ACS applied materials & interfaces,456,1

The aim of this study was to examine our experience with the use of the uniportal subxiphoid approach in video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) major lung resections and lymph node dissections. METHODS From October 2014 to August 2015, 153 patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and benign disease underwent uniportal subxiphoid VATS major lung resections. Patients were placed in a lateral position with 60-70° inclination, and a 4- to 5-cm midline median or transverse incision was made below the sternocostal triangle. A 10-mm 30° video camera and VATS instruments were used through the same single incision. Perioperative variables and outcomes were collected prospectively and analysed retrospectively. RESULTS Of the 153 patients who underwent surgery with the uniportal subxiphoid VATS approach, 105 had lobectomies and 48 had segmental resections; 135 cases of lung cancer and 18 cases of benign pulmonary disease were noted. Right upper lobectomy was the most common procedure (51%), and left upper lobectomy was the most time-consuming procedure (190 ± 21 min). The mean operating time was 166.9 ± 12.6 min; the average volume of blood loss was 127.5 ± 27.6 ml. In patients with lung cancer, the mean total number of lymph node stations explored was 3.4 ± 0.8. The duration of chest drain use was 2.6 ± 0.2 days. The length of hospital stay was 4.3 ± 0.4 days. Perioperative arrhythmia was the most common complication (13% of cases). Prolonged air leak was the cause of prolonged hospital stay. Five cases were converted to conventional VATS due to technical difficulties, and eight cases were converted to thoracotomy due to major bleeding. Postoperative 30-day mortality was zero and there were no re-admissions. All cases had a R0 complete cancer resection on histology. CONCLUSIONS Uniportal subxiphoid VATS lobectomy/segmentectomy is a feasible and safe procedure for early-stage lung cancer and benign disease.","Hernandez-Arenas, Luis Angel; Lin, Lei; Yang, Yang; Liu, Ming; Guido, William; Gonzalez-Rivas, Diego; Jiang, Gening; Jiang, Lei",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,456,1

BACKGROUND Burnout is a severe problem among nurses. Literature shows a relationship between stress and burnout and between nature exposure and stress. However, the possible consequent relationship between connection to nature and nurse burnout needs further study. METHODS This cross-sectional study explored the relationship between the subscales (Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Personal Accomplishment [EE, DP, and PA]) of the Maslach Burnout Inventory as ""outcome variables"" and perception of view duration, frequency of exposure to views, view content and artwork content as ""explanatory variables"" in a subset regression model. The study model also included organizational stressors, environmental design factors, unit type, workload, and personal factors as control variables. Fifty-one nurses working in six units in a large tertiary care hospital participated in the study. RESULTS Percentage of perceived nature views and organizational stressors were the top two best predictors correlating with EE (37% of the EE variance; p < .05). Percentage of perceived nature views, organizational stressors, and environmental design were the top three predictors correlating with DP (43% of variance for DP; p < .05). No significant relationship was found between study variables and PA. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study recommend perceiving nature views as an independent or integrated intervention to meditation and relaxation techniques. From a design standpoint, this study suggests that a unit and breakroom design with access to nature views could work as a consistent preventive intervention for burnout.","Mihandoust, Sahar; Pati, Debajyoti; Lee, Jaehoon; Roney, Jamie",HERD,456,31

Understand age-related changes to the face and neck and pertinent anatomy and discuss important aspects of fat graft harvesting, processing, and infiltration. 2. Recognize key differences between common techniques for fat processing and infiltration and develop a plan for patients based on site-specific facial anatomical zones. 3. Appreciate the utility of fat grafting as an adjunct to other facial rejuvenating procedures such as face lift and blepharoplasty procedures and list the potential complications from fat grafting to the face and neck. SUMMARY Fat grafting to the face and neck aids in volume restoration, thereby addressing soft-tissue atrophy associated with the aging face, acquired conditions, or congenital malformations. Often, fat grafting may sufficiently restore facial volume alone or in conjunction with other facial rejuvenation procedures. Facial/neck fat grafting requires a systematic and thoughtful approach, with special care to atraumatic technique. This CME article covers the principles and techniques for modern facial fat grafting to the face and neck. Increasing data support the ability of autologous fat to produce significant and sustainable appearance-related changes. The authors follow the general principles of the Coleman technique for facial fat grafting and have observed tremendous success over the years. Other techniques for facial fat grafting are also discussed including microfat and nanofat processing. As the understanding of facial fat compartments continues to evolve, the authors may better predict fat grafting outcomes following augmentation. Finally, the technique described as ""lipotumescence"" has been successfully used in the breast and other regions of the body that have radiation damage and is discussed in this article specifically for the face and neck.","Azoury, Saïd C; Shakir, Sameer; Bucky, Louis P; Percec, Ivona",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,456,19

We sought to expand the catalogue of dystonia-predominant phenotypes in monogenic DEEs, building on the recently introduced concept of an epilepsy-movement disorder spectrum. METHODS Cases were identified from a whole-exome-sequenced cohort of 45 pediatric index patients with complex dystonia (67% sequenced as parent-child trios). Review of molecular findings in DEE-associated genes was performed. For five individuals with identified DEE-causing variants, detailed information about presenting phenotypic features and the natural history of disease was obtained. RESULTS De-novo pathogenic and likely pathogenic missense variants in GABRA1, GABBR2, GNAO1, and FOXG1 gave rise to infantile-onset persistent and paroxysmal dystonic manifestations, beginning in the limb or truncal musculature and progressing gradually to a generalized state. Coexisting, less prominent movement-disorder symptoms were observed and included myoclonic, ballistic, and stereotypic abnormal movements as well as choreoathetosis. Dystonia dominated over epileptic neurodevelopmental comorbidities in all four subjects and represented the primary indication for molecular genetic analysis. We also report the unusual case of an adult female patient with dystonia, tremor, and mild learning disability who was found to harbor a pathogenic frameshift variant in MECP2. CONCLUSIONS Dystonia can be a leading clinical manifestation in different DEEs. A monogenic basis of disease should be considered on the association of dystonia and developmental delay-epilepsy presentations, justifying a molecular screening for variants in DEE-associated genes.","Dzinovic, Ivana; Škorvánek, Matej; Necpál, Ján; Boesch, Sylvia; Švantnerová, Jana; Wagner, Matias; Havránková, Petra; Pavelekova, Petra; Haň, Vladimír; Janzarik, Wibke G; Berweck, Steffen; Diebold, Isabel; Kuster, Alice; Jech, Robert; Winkelmann, Juliane; Zech, Michael",Parkinsonism & related disorders,456,5

We found that, because small droplets (with initial diameter of 10 μm) are swept by turbulent eddies in the expelled humid puff, their lifetime gets extended by a factor of more than 30 times as compared to what is suggested by the classical picture by Wells, for 50% relative humidity. With increasing ambient relative humidity the extension of the lifetimes of the small droplets further increases and goes up to around 150 times for 90% relative humidity, implying more than 2 m advection range of the respiratory droplets within 1 sec. Employing Lagrangian statistics, we demonstrate that the turbulent humid respiratory puff engulfs the small droplets, leading to many orders of magnitude increase in their lifetimes, implying that they can be transported much further during the respiratory events than the large ones. Our findings provide the starting points for larger parameter studies and may be instructive for developing strategies on optimizing ventilation and indoor humidity control. Such strategies are key in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the present autumn and upcoming winter.","Chong, Kai Leong; Ng, Chong Shen; Hori, Naoki; Yang, Rui; Verzicco, Roberto; Lohse, Detlef",Physical review letters,456,4

Toroviruses, except equine torovirus, are difficult to propagate in cell culture; indeed, to date, only the Aichi/2004 strain of bovine torovirus (BToV) has been isolated among the human, bovine, and porcine toroviruses. In the present study, four cytopathogenic BToVs were isolated from diarrheal feces of the cattle using the HRT-18 cell line, and their genetic and antigenic properties were compared. The cytopathogenic features of BToV isolates in HRT-18 cells were similar to those of the Aichi/2004 strain. However, none of the isolates showed cytopathogenic effects in the HRT-18 cells of different origin, suggesting that one significant factor contributing to the cytopathogenicity of BToV depends on properties of the HRT-18 cells themselves. All BToVs isolated were able to agglutinate mouse, but not chicken, erythrocytes, while they lacked receptor-destroying enzyme activity. Analysis of the N terminus of the spike gene showed that three isolates, but not the Gifu-2007TI/E strain, were phylogenetically located in cluster 1 and its analogs and revealed high cross-reactivity with each other, as demonstrated by neutralization (NT) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. The Gifu-2007TI/E strain was classified close to cluster 2 and exhibited relatively low cross-reactivity with these viruses; however, the difference was not sufficient to classify BToVs into serotypes, suggesting that at least two subtypes distinguishable by the structure of the N terminus of the spike gene and that both NT and HI tests may be exist.","Ito, Toshihiro; Katayama, Shigeji; Okada, Nobutaka; Masubuchi, Katsuo; Fukuyama, Shin-ichi; Shimizu, Mitsugu",Journal of clinical microbiology,456,16

Here, we report the dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients and its association with the viral nucleic acid clearance and clinical outcomes. Eighty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens, including 57 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative cases and 28 antibody positive cases. The viral antigen could be detected in 52.63% (30/57) patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the first 5 days after disease onset (p = 0.0018) and disappeared in about 8 days after disease onset. Viral antigens were highly detectable in patients with low Ct value (less than 30) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCT assay, suggesting the expression of viral antigen was associated with high viral load. Furthermore, positive antigen detection indicated disease progression, nine cases with positive antigen (9/30, 30.0%), in contrast to two cases (2/27, 7.40%) (p = 0.0444) with negative antigen, which progressed into severe disease. Thus, the viral antigens were persistent in early stages of infection when virus was in highly replicating status, and viral antigen detection promises to rapidly screen positive patients in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lv, Ying; Ma, Yuanyuan; Si, Yanhui; Zhu, Xiaoyi; Zhang, Lin; Feng, Haiyan; Tian, Di; Liao, Yixin; Liu, Tiefu; Lu, Hongzhou; Ling, Yun",Bioscience trends,456,16

A large integrated health network rapidly deployed and operationalized multiple access channels to the community, allowing assessment and triage to occur virtually. These channels were characterized by swift implementation of virtual models, including asynchronous e-visits and video visits for C-19 screening. PURPOSE (1) Evaluate implementation characteristics of C-19 screening e-visits and video visits. (2) Identify volume of C-19 screening and other care provided via e-visits and video visits. (3) Discuss future implications of expanded virtual access models. METHODS Retrospective analysis of implementation data for C-19 screening e-visits and video visits, including operational characteristics and visit/screening volumes conducted. RESULTS Virtual channels were implemented and rapidly expanded during the first week C-19 testing was made available. During the study period, primary care clinicians conducted 10,673 e-visits and 31,226 video visits with 9,126 and 26,009 patients, respectively. Within these 2 virtual modalities, 4,267 C-19 tests were ordered (10% of visits). Four hundred forty-eight clinicians supported 24/7 access to these virtual modalities.

Colon polyps that are not amenable for endoscopic removals either because they are too large or situated in anatomically difficult locations can pose a clinical dilemma. Traditionally the most common recommendation for these patients has been to offer a colon resection. Although the laparoscopic approach has improved short-term outcomes, morbidities associated with bowel resection are still significant. We may be over treating majority of these patients because of the remote possibility that these polyps may be harboring a cancer. A combined approach using both laparoscopy and colonoscopy (combined endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery) has been described as an alternative to bowel resection in select patients with polyps that cannot be removed endoscopically. Polyp removal using this combined approach may be an effective alternative in select patients.","Garrett, Kelly A; Lee, Sang W",Clinics in colon and rectal surgery,456,1

Therefore, this study aimed to elaborate assessment of physico-chemical characteristics of the Dhaleshwari River (the adjacent river of newly shifted tannery industrial park) and also the discharged effluent from the central effluent treatment plant (CETP) considering both seasonal and spatial variations. Among the examined 30 water quality parameters (including 11 heavy metals), only TDS, Cl-, NO3-N, EC, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Ni met the standards for discharged wastewater from industrial units into inland surface water set by Bangladesh government. This indicated that the CETP is not fully and/or effectively functioning. Out of 19 parameters (excluding heavy metal), 14 parameters exceeded the Bangladesh standard for drinking water quality either spatially or seasonally. The river water quality indicated slowly biodegradable capacity with algal bloom risk. The concentrations of the studied heavy metals in the river water followed a decreasing order of Ca > K > Mg > Na > Fe > Cr > Pb > Ni > Cu > Zn > Cd, and Cr concentration in the winter season exceeded the standard values. The concentrations of other heavy metals met the quality standard that indicated still the river is capable to self-purify. Furthermore, strong (p < 0.01) and significant (p < 0.05) correlation were observed among the quality parameters in river water. This study suggested that the efficiency of the existing CETP needs to be enhanced, and the proper operation and maintenance are required to meet the desired discharge standard quality. Also, all the unauthorized wastewater outfalls from tanneries must be closed to save the Dhaleshwari River.","Hasan, Md Mahmudul; Ahmed, Md Shakil; Adnan, Raofur",Environmental monitoring and assessment,456,26

This review of how the various existing diagnostic methods have been utilized, first in the context of a rapidly evolving outbreak of novel influenza virus and then during the different subsequent phases and waves of the pandemic, demonstrates the unique roles, advantages, and limitations of each of these methods. Rapid antigen tests were used extensively throughout the pandemic. Recognition of the low negative predictive values of these tests is important. Private laboratories with preexisting expertise, infrastructure, and resources for rapid development, validation, and implementation of laboratory-developed assays played an unprecedented role in helping to meet the diagnostic demands during the pandemic. FDA-cleared assays remain an important element of the diagnostic armamentarium during a pandemic, and a process must be developed with the FDA to allow manufacturers to modify these assays for detection of novel strains in a timely fashion. The need and role for subtyping of influenza viruses and antiviral susceptibility testing will likely depend on qualitative (circulating subtypes and their resistance patterns) and quantitative (relative prevalence) characterization of influenza viruses circulating during future epidemics and pandemics.","Kumar, Swati; Henrickson, Kelly J",Clinical microbiology reviews,456,1

However, little is known about how people living with dementia, their families and healthcare professionals experience integrated care. Therefore, the purpose of this review of the qualitative literature was to examine the experiences and perceptions of integrated dementia care. METHODS This qualitative review synthesised findings from included studies identified from a comprehensive literature search. Searches included: five electronic databases, journal handsearching, and reference list searching of relevant literature reviews and the final included studies. FINDINGS Three overarching themes were identified: 1) Ways of working which facilitate the delivery of integrated dementia care; 2) Informal carers as equal partners in care provision and decision making; and 3) Challenges leading to fragmented and disjointed integrated dementia care. For integrated care to be successful, communication and collaboration between healthcare professionals, and the involvement of informal carers is needed. Multidisciplinary teams and employing case managers to coordinate care provision can improve communication and collaboration. However, distrust between healthcare professionals and a lack of a central database to access and share information often hinders the development of integrated dementia care service provision. CONCLUSION Integrated dementia care can be successful and well received by people living with dementia and their families when certain conditions are met. However, given the negative consequences fragmented and disjointed care can have on people living with dementia and their families, action is needed to further support the development of integrated dementia care services.","Smith, Raymond; Martin, Anne; Wright, Toni; Hulbert, Sabina; Hatzidimitriadou, Eleni",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,456,12

The first patient, a 65-year-old female, presented with complaints of headache for 3 months and was found to have giant supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) (ophthalmic segment) aneurysm. We planned endovascular partial coiling and flow-diverter placement for the treatment of ICA aneurysm. During the progressive deployment of PED, there was nonopening of Pipeline embolization device (PED) at its proximal end. We tried multiple attempts to navigate Marksman microcatheter over the PED delivery microwire and Echelon microcatheter over the Traxcess microwire across the pinched site, but we were not able to achieve success. After that, we tried opposite transcranial approach across prominent anterior communicating artery with the Synchro and Transcend microguidewire which finally resulted in the opening of the device; however, there was acute extravasation of dye on check angiogram. Thus, our technical success turned into disaster. The second patient, a 55-year-old female, presented with complaint of seizures for 3 months due to mass effect of cavernous sinus aneurysm. Pipeline Flex flow-diverter placement was done across the aneurysm neck. During the progressive deployment of device, there was nonopening of the mid and proximal segment of Pipeline Flex which was successfully managed by intra-Navien deployment of device followed by simultaneous push of Marksman microcatheter and pull of Navien catheter. In our case series, two rescue strategies were applied to successfully open the proximal constricted portion of Pipeline Flex; however, technical success in one case resulted in unmanageable disasters. Thus, transcranial rescue strategy for opening the constricted Pipeline Flex device should be cautiously used in our endovascular practice.","Mahajan, Anshu; Banga, Vinit; Chatterjee, Apratim; Goel, Gaurav",Asian journal of neurosurgery,456,31

In this study, six strains of type 2 MRV (MRV2) were isolated from 7 diarrhea piglets from a farm that had an outbreak of diarrhea in piglets in 2018, which tested negative for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and porcine group A rotavirus (RAV). The MRV2 isolate infected neonatal piglets, in which it induced severe diarrhea, while the virus was detected in multiple organs of piglets. Moreover, the complete genome of an MRV2 isolate was obtained, which was a novel reassortant MRV strain of human MRV, porcine MRV, chamois MRV, bat MRV, and mink MRV based on the nucleotide identity and phylogenetic tree. The S1 gene of isolate had eight unique amino acid mutations compared with available MRV2 S1 in the GenBank. To investigate the prevalence of this MRV2, 78 samples of diarrhea feces were collected from 10 pig farms in seven regions of Sichuan province. The obtained results showed that the positive rate of samples was 14% (11/78), and positive rate of farms was 60% (6/10), while the amplified fragments shared the identical amino acid mutations with the isolated strain, thus suggesting that this MRV2 strain was already prevalent in Sichuan province.

METHODS Consecutive patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia who underwent peripheral angiography from 2006 to 2013 were included in an observational cohort analysis. Smoking status was assessed at the time of angiography and during follow-up clinic visits. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the relationship between smoking cessation, mortality, and amputation-free survival. RESULTS Among 739 patients (423 men and 316 women; mean age, 60 ± 12 years), 204 (28%) remained active smokers at the time of lower extremity angiography. At the time of angiography, the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day was 16 ± 10, and the mean pack-years was 40 ± 25. During the course of the subsequent year, 61 patients (30%) successfully quit smoking and maintained continued abstinence. Baseline medication use between groups did not differ significantly. The mean ankle-brachial index was also similar for quitters vs nonquitters (0.53 ± 24 vs 0.49 ± 0.22; P = .3). During follow-up to 5 years, patients who quit smoking had significantly lower all-cause mortality (14% vs 31%; hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.90) and improved amputation-free survival (81% vs 60%; hazard ratio, 0.43, 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.86) compared with patients who continued smoking, with most of the difference driven by reduced mortality among patients who quit smoking. The findings remained significant on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS Approximately one-third of active smokers with peripheral artery disease successfully quit smoking ≤ 1 year after lower extremity angiography. Patients who quit smoking have lower mortality and improved amputation-free survival compared with patients who continue smoking.","Armstrong, Ehrin J; Wu, Julie; Singh, Gagan D; Dawson, David L; Pevec, William C; Amsterdam, Ezra A; Laird, John R",Journal of vascular surgery,456,1

METHODS A systematic review of articles that examined COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients was performed. Patients' demographics, clinical, laboratory and radiological presentations, immunosuppression modification, and COVID-19 specific management were abstracted and analyzed. COVID-19 severity was classified into mild, moderate, and severe. Disease outcome was classified by whether the patient was discharged, still hospitalized, or died. RESULTS 44 articles reporting individual data and 13 articles reporting aggregated data on 149 and 561 kidney transplant recipients respectively with COVID-19 from Asia, Europe and America fulfilled all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among studies reporting case specific data, 76% of cases had severe disease. Compared to patients with mild/moderate disease, patients with severe disease had higher CRP, LDH, Ferritin, D-dimer and were more likely to have bilateral lung involvement at presentation and longer time since transplantation (P<0.05 for all). Recipients' age, gender and comorbidities did not impact disease severity. Patients with severe disease had a more aggressive CNI reduction and more antiviral medications utilization. Outcome was reported on 145 cases, of those 34 (23%) died all with severe disease. Longer duration from transplant to disease diagnosis, hypoxia and higher LDH were associated with mortality (P<0.05). Different immunosuppression reduction strategies, high dose parenteral corticosteroids use and various antiviral combinations did not demonstrate survival advantage. Similar finding was observed for studies reporting aggregated data. CONCLUSION COVID-19 in kidney transplant patients is associated with high rate of disease severity and fatality. Higher LDH and longer time since transplantation predicted both disease severity and mortality. None of the COVID-19 specific treatment correlated with, or improved disease outcome in kidney transplant recipients.","Hasan, Irtiza; Rashid, Tasnuva; Suliman, Sarah; Amer, Hatem; M Chirila, Razvan; Mai, Martin L; Jarmi, Tambi; Khouzam, Samir; Franco, Pablo Moreno; Heilig, Charles W; Wadei, Hani M",Romanian journal of internal medicine = Revue roumaine de medecine interne,456,15

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2000 and November 2004, the charts of 177 children who underwent appendectomy by a single surgeon were reviewed. The patients were divided into open and laparoscopic appendectomy groups. Each group was subdivided into three stages: simple appendicitis, perforated appendicitis, and appendicitis with abscess. The age, gender, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, operating time, duration of postoperative hospital stay, minor and major complications, and use of intravenous analgesia were recorded. Fisher's exact and Student's t-test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS There were fewer minor complications (9/32 vs. 0/20, p = 0.009) in perforated appendicitis stage and fewer major complications (9/26 vs. 1/24, p = 0.011) in appendicitis with abscess stage between open and laparoscopic appendectomy group. But surgery for each laparoscopic appendectomy group took longer to perform than for the corresponding open appendectomy group in each stage (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in other data between corresponding groups in each stage.

Outpatients from a tertiary cancer centre were enrolled. The adapted PRO interface allowed for uniform registration of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms and effective triage of patients at home where we also implemented systematic throat washings, when available. RESULTS Three hundred and sixty patients registered to the telemonitoring systems from March 13 to May 15, 2020. Four prespecified SARS-CoV-2 alarms resulted in three patients with positive PCR testing. Other Covid-19 symptoms (fever 5× and cough 2×) led to pretreatment triage resulting in 1 seroconversion after initial negative testing. One of the 477 throat washings proved positive. CONCLUSIONS The rapid adoption of an amended PRO (self-)registrations and toxicity management system was feasible and coordinated screening for Covid-19. Continued clinical cancer care was maintained, with significant decreased waiting time. The systemic screening with throat washings offered no real improvement.","Rasschaert, Marika; Vanclooster, Pieterjan; Mertens, Tim; Roelant, Ella; Lesage, Katrien; Prenen, Hans; Verlinden, Anke; van Brussel, Ilse; Ravelingien, Jo; Janssens, Annelies; Van Dam, Peter; Peeters, Marc",British journal of cancer,456,1

This study was aimed to explore the temporal and spatial distribution of the disease by analyzing its epidemiological characteristics, and to calculate the early warning signals of HFMD by using a logistic differential equation (LDE) model. METHODS This study included datasets of HFMD cases reported in seven regions in Mainland China. The early warning time (week) was calculated using the LDE model with the key parameters estimated by fitting with the data. Two key time points, ""epidemic acceleration week (EAW)"" and ""recommended warning week (RWW)"", were calculated to show the early warning time. RESULTS The mean annual incidence of HFMD cases per 100,000 per year was 218, 360, 223, 124, and 359 in Hunan Province, Shenzhen City, Xiamen City, Chuxiong Prefecture, Yunxiao County across the southern regions, respectively and 60 and 34 in Jilin Province and Longde County across the northern regions, respectively. The LDE model fitted well with the reported data (R2 > 0.65, P < 0.001). Distinct temporal patterns were found across geographical regions: two early warning signals emerged in spring and autumn every year across southern regions while one early warning signals in summer every year across northern regions. CONCLUSIONS The disease burden of HFMD in China is still high, with more cases occurring in the southern regions. The early warning of HFMD across the seven regions is heterogeneous. In the northern regions, it has a high incidence during summer and peaks in June every year; in the southern regions, it has two waves every year with the first wave during spring spreading faster than the second wave during autumn. Our findings can help predict and prepare for active periods of HFMD.","Rui, Jia; Luo, Kaiwei; Chen, Qiuping; Zhang, Dexing; Zhao, Qinglong; Zhang, Yanhong; Zhai, Xiongjie; Zhao, Zeyu; Zhang, Siyu; Liao, Yuxue; Hu, Shixiong; Gao, Lidong; Lei, Zhao; Wang, Mingzhai; Wang, Yao; Liu, Xingchun; Yu, Shanshan; Xie, Fang; Li, Jia; Liu, Ruoyun; Chiang, Yi-Chen; Zhao, Benhua; Su, Yanhua; Zhang, Xu-Sheng; Chen, Tianmu",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,456,1

Widespread use of personal digital technology has facilitated the emergence of resources that enable easily accessible microsurgical training through digital modalities that augment traditional training. The authors sought to conduct the first systematic review of all such resources. METHODS A systematic review of MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and EMBASE was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis guidelines to identify articles describing easily accessible microsurgery training resources. Additional searches on Google, the iOS application store, the Google Play store, and YouTube were conducted using comparable search terms. RESULTS Nineteen articles describing easily accessible digital microsurgery training resources were identified, which included 9 interactive and 10 passive training resources. Interactive resources included methods for using smartphones, tablets, and computers to provide magnification for microsurgical skill training. Passive resources included training videos, educational forums, and 3-dimensional anatomical models. Google search revealed an additional interactive, commercially available device for positioning a smartphone above a microsurgical training platform. iOS Store and Google Play search revealed 5 passive training applications with tutorials and technique videos. YouTube search revealed 146 videos on microsurgical technique and training models from 19 users with verifiable affiliations. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to costly and variable microsurgical courses and laboratories, digital technology gives trainees the opportunity to learn about and practice microsurgical techniques in any setting at any time and can serve as a valuable adjunct to traditional training modalities.","Margulies, Ilana G; Xu, Hope; Henderson, Peter W",Annals of plastic surgery,456,1

We explore the limits of computational modelling and conclude that, in the domains of science and engineering which are relatively simple and firmly grounded in theory, these methods are indeed powerful. Even so, the availability of code, data and documentation, along with a range of techniques for validation, verification and uncertainty quantification, are essential for building trust in computer-generated findings. When it comes to complex systems in domains of science that are less firmly grounded in theory, notably biology and medicine, to say nothing of the social sciences and humanities, computers can create the illusion of objectivity, not least because the rise of big data and machine-learning pose new challenges to reproducibility, while lacking true explanatory power. We also discuss important aspects of the natural world which cannot be solved by digital means. In the long term, renewed emphasis on analogue methods will be necessary to temper the excessive faith currently placed in digital computation.

Epidemiological data are crucial for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, designing studies, and optimizing resource distribution. The goal of this review is to present general aspects of mortality data published over the past decades. A systematic search of the MEDLINE/PubMed was performed. The articles were divided according to their methodology, type of reported mortality, and time. The main outcome was mortality. Extracted data included study duration, number of patients, and number of centers. The mortality trends and current mortality were calculated for subgroups consisting of in-hospital, ICU, 28/30-d, and 60-d mortality over 3 time periods (A, before 1995; B, 1995-2000; C, after 2000). The retrospectivity and prospectivity were also taken into account. Moreover, we present the most recent mortality rates since 2010. One hundred seventy-seven articles were included in the final analysis. General mortality rates ranged from 11 to 87% in studies including subjects with ARDS of all etiologies (mixed group). Linear regression revealed that the study design (28/30-d or 60-d) significantly influenced the mortality rate. Reported mortality rates were higher in prospective studies, such as randomized controlled trials and prospective observational studies compared with retrospective observational studies. Mortality rates exhibited a linear decrease in relation to time period (P < .001). The number of centers showed a significant negative correlation with mortality rates. The prospective observational studies did not have consistently higher mortality rates compared with randomized controlled trials. The mortality trends over 3 time periods (before 1995, 1995-2000, and after 2000) yielded variable results in general ARDS populations. However, a mortality decrease was present mostly in prospective studies. Since 2010, the overall rates of in-hospital, ICU, and 28/30-d and 60-d mortality were 45, 38, 30, and 32%, respectively.","Máca, Jan; Jor, Ondřej; Holub, Michal; Sklienka, Peter; Burša, Filip; Burda, Michal; Janout, Vladimír; Ševčík, Pavel",Respiratory care,456,26

Researchers in other related fields have studied online clinical supervision, specifically how technology-assisted supervision affects the supervisory relationship, the development of supervisees' competence and confidence, supervisees' satisfaction, and the overall quality of clinical supervision. This paper presents a review of the scientific evidence about online clinical supervision. It is generally agreed that online clinical supervision is a viable alternative to in-person supervision.

Many countries have closed schools as part of measures to limit transmission and this has had a considerable impact on children world-wide. This includes New Zealand (NZ), where rates of CoVID-19 have been very low. The aims of this study were to investigate parents' and caregivers' knowledge of CoVID-19 in children, to understand their levels of concern and to identify their most trusted sources of information. METHODS Participants were recruited via NZ parenting support and interest groups on Facebook.com. Knowledge was assessed by way of a self-administered questionnaire during the 10 days prior to NZ schools reopening on 18 May 2020. RESULTS Of the 1191 study participants, 721 (60%) expressed some level of worry (14.5% very or extremely worried) that their child would catch CoVID-19 at school. A high proportion (79%, 941) thought it likely or very likely that their child would catch CoVID-19 at school if there were to be widespread community transmission. Fear scores for CoVID-19 were generally high, and 828 (80%) of participants said they would vaccinate their child if a newly developed vaccine were available. CONCLUSIONS Parents and caregivers were generally fearful of their children acquiring CoVID-19 at school. This was despite messaging from multiple trusted sources that transmission in schools is unlikely, and the number of NZ CoVID-19 cases being extremely low. These findings have implications for policy development and public health messaging both in NZ and in countries with ongoing community transmission of CoVID-19.","Jeffs, Emma; Lucas, Nathanael; Walls, Tony",Journal of paediatrics and child health,456,19

Hence, it is necessary to study the effects of land use for oil palm and the linkage between each impact for a holistic understanding. Besides, the consideration of various impact aspects in terms of a nexus is necessary for suggesting appropriate practices or zoning, because a single impact evaluation may not be comprehensive. Therefore, this study assessed the land use impacts from oil palm plantations in the five regions of Thailand. The land use impacts studied were greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity, soil quality, and biodiversity. The assessment indicated the southern region to be the most suitable for further expansion of oil palm plantations, which is consistent with the government recommendation. However, if the expansion of oil palm in other regions is necessary, the central region is recommended because of available irrigation supply and better soil fertility compared to other regions. This study found that the land use impacts resulted from unsuitable management of oil palm plantations in the past. The increase of greenhouse gas emissions was mainly due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers for soil quality improvement and water pumping from irrigation water consumption. Meanwhile, the deficiency of water availability led to the degradation of biodiversity and ecosystems. To decrease the land use impacts in the long run, suitable practice is important for sustainable oil palm plantations.","Jaroenkietkajorn, Ukrit; Gheewala, Shabbir H",The Science of the total environment,456,16

We assessed the efficacy of remdesivir in hospitalized Egyptian patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive either remdesivir (200 mg on the first day followed by 100 mg daily for the next 9 days intravenously infused over 30-60 minutes) in addition to standard care or standard care alone. The primary outcomes were the length of hospital stay and mortality rate. The need for mechanical ventilation was assessed as a secondary outcome. Two hundred patients (100 in each group) completed the study and were included in the final analysis. The remdesivir group showed a significantly lower median duration of hospital stay (10 days) than the control group (16 days; P < 0.001). Eleven of the patients in the remdesivir group needed mechanical ventilation compared with eight patients in the control group (P = 0.469). The mortality rate was comparable between the two groups (P = 0.602). Mortality was significantly associated with older age, elevated C-reactive protein levels, elevated D-dimer, and the need for mechanical ventilation (P = 0.039, 0.003, 0.001, and < 0.001 respectively). Remdesivir had a positive influence on length of hospital stay, but it had no mortality benefit in Egyptian patients with COVID-19.

DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING Acute-care academic hospital. PARTICIPANTS In total, 52 adult patients with a positive respiratory viral infection test within 3 days of observation participated. Healthcare workers (HCWs) were recruited in staff meetings and at the time of patient care, and 23 wore personal air-sampling devices. METHODS Viruses were measured in the air at a fixed location and in the personal breathing zone of HCWs. Predetermined environmental surfaces were sampled using premoistened Copan swabs at the beginning and at the end of the 3-hour observation period. Preamplification and quantitative real-time PCR methods were used to quantify viral pathogens. RESULTS Overall, 43% of stationary and 22% of personal air samples were positive for virus. Positive stationary air samples were associated with ≥5 HCW encounters during the observation period (odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-37.8). Viruses were frequently detected on all of the surfaces sampled. Virus concentrations on the IV pole hanger and telephone were positively correlated with the number of contacts made by HCWs on those surfaces. The distributions of influenza, rhinoviruses, and other viruses in the environment were similar. CONCLUSIONS Healthcare workers are at risk of contracting respiratory virus infections when delivering routine care for patients infected with the viruses, and they are at risk of disseminating virus because they touch virus-contaminated fomites.","Phan, Linh T; Sweeney, Dagmar M; Maita, Dayana; Moritz, Donna C; Bleasdale, Susan C; Jones, Rachael M",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,456,31

Transitional care programmes, broadly defined as one or more intervention(s) or service(s) that aim to improve continuity of care, are increasingly being developed to address transitions in care for children and youth with CCNs. However, this literature has not yet been systematically examined at a comprehensive level. The purpose of this scoping review is to map the range of programmes that support transitions in care for children and youth with CCNs and their families during two phases of their lifespan: (1) up to the age of 19 years (not including their transition to adult healthcare) and (2) when transitioning from paediatric to adult healthcare.

In these patients, the sub-umbilical abdominal and pubic regions are often characterized by redundant skin, creating aesthetic and functional discomfort. Monsplasty is an important step in abdominoplasty or bodylift procedures. We report on an original technique used to correct deformity in the pubic region following weight loss. METHODS All interventions were performed by the same surgeon between April and December 2015. On stretched skin, we drew two lines 5 cm lateral to the median line on both sides and connected them with the arc of a circle placed 7 cm from the vulvar fork. Then, monsplasty marks extend to abdominal fold. During lower abdominal contouring, we performed monsplasty with three separate stitches between the camper fascia and aponeurosis of the abdominal muscle. The aim was to bring tension to the pubic region without additional surgical procedure. RESULTS We report on 21 consecutive cases of monsplasty following lower trunk contouring. No reoperation was performed due to complication or aesthetic demand (no under- or over-correction occurred). No complication (e.g. edema, seroma, disturbance of sensibility) was observed in the pubic area. The results were stable 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSIONS We report on a simple, rapid, and reproducible monsplasty technique for all stages of Pittsburgh classifications, which achieved favorable results with no complication. We recommend performance of this effective technique simultaneously with abdominoplasty or bodylift procedures.

AutoDock Vina is used for molecular docking. Through our research, the binding affinity of saquinavir and raltegravir to the protein is higher than other candidate drugs in molecular docking; they are -9.1 kcal/mol and -9 kcal/mol, respectively. Among them remdesivir performance was mediocre, only -7.9 kcal/mol. In our study, ultimately, these systems are also basically stable. The overall contraction of the protein structure is most obvious after the combination of remdesivir. In the remdesivir-protein system, the structure of the terminal end has undergone relatively large changes. And the total number of hydrogen bonds formed in the remdesivir-protein system is larger. The hydrogen bonds can be maintained for a longer time, and the final interaction energy is stronger than other systems. These amino acid sequence fragments have high affinity with the remdesivir molecule. Remdesivir can change the structure of the protein to make it stronger in binding with itself through the interaction with the protein. The simulation study of drug screening for new coronaviruses can provide further support for new coronavirus effective drugs and provide powerful support to defeat the virus.","Zhao, Xiaomeng; Liu, Ruixia; Miao, Zhi; Ye, Nan; Lu, Wenyu",Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,456,16

Methods: A series of NOTA-conjugated peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 were synthesized, with variable linker identity. Since DX600 bears two cystine residues, both linear and cyclic peptides were studied. An ACE2 inhibition assay was used to identify lead compounds, which were labeled with 68Ga to generate peptide radiotracers ([68Ga]NOTA-PEP). The aminocaproate-derived radiotracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was subsequently studied in a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic model. Results: Cyclic DX-600 derived peptides had markedly lower IC50's than their linear counterparts. The three cyclic peptides with triglycine, aminocaproate, and polyethylene glycol linkers had calculated IC50's similar to, or lower than the parent DX600 molecule. Peptides were readily labeled with 68Ga, and the biodistribution of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was determined in a hACE2 transgenic murine cohort. Pharmacologic concentrations of co-administered NOTA-PEP (""blocking"") showed significant reduction of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 signals in the in the heart, liver, lungs, and small intestine. Ex vivo hACE2 activity in these organs was confirmed as a correlate to in vivo results. Conclusion: NOTA-conjugated, cyclic peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 retain their activity when N-conjugated for 68Ga chelation. In vivo studies in a transgenic hACE2 murine model using the lead tracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 showed specific binding in the heart, liver, lungs and intestine - organs known to be affected in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 could be used to detect organ-specific suppression of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected murine models and COVID-19 patients.","Parker, Matthew; Blecha, Joseph; Rosenberg, Oren; Ohliger, Michael; Flavell, Robert R; Wilson, David M","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",456,1

A response to our article, written by Dr. Chia Sing Kow and Dr. Syed Shahzad Hasan raised a few questions. They mentioned our use of hemoglobin A1c may be inaccurate as the patients in our study had high rates of CKD or ESRD which could alter the hemoglobin A1c levels. However due to the limitations of our patient population and perhaps in a lot of other sample populations in the real-world setting, it was the most feasible way to represent glucose control.The writers also suggested that the use of metformin, a potential confounder, was also not adjusted for. This should be considered in future research but addition of too many variables in a regression model may lead to less reliability of results for our study.The letter writers also suggested that the results of our paper may lead to misinterpretation by readers and may influence providers to not use insulin therapy for their patients when necessary due to fear of worse outcomes in the setting of COVID-19. We reiterated that it is very important that the data not be misinterpreted, and that nowhere in our paper did we imply or suggest that patients who need insulin therapy to treat their diabetes should not receive proper therapy due to the association we delineated in our paper.

The rate of cannabis use in this population is disproportionately high (~50 %). Because its use is generally perceived as harmless, cannabis use is often not monitored during MMT. Current literature regarding the effects of cannabis use on MMT is conflicting, and the presence and nature of an association has not been clearly established. The primary objective of this review will be to conduct a systematic review of the literature and, if appropriate, a meta-analysis to determine whether there is an association between cannabis use and MMT outcomes. A secondary objective will be to perform subgroup analyses (by age, sex, method of cannabis measurement, and country) to determine whether cannabis use differentially influences MMT outcomes within these subgroups. METHODS/DESIGN The search will be conducted on the following electronic databases using a predefined search strategy: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Two authors (LZ and MB) will independently screen articles using predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria and will extract data from included articles using a pilot-tested data extraction form. Disagreements at all stages of the screening process will be settled through discussion, and when consensus cannot be reached, a third author (ZS) will be consulted. An assessment of quality and risk of bias will be conducted on all included articles, and a sensitivity analysis will be used to compare results of studies with high and low risk of bias. We will perform random- and fixed-effects meta-analyses, if appropriate, with heterogeneity calculated using the I (2) statistic and formal evaluation of publication bias. DISCUSSION Results of this systematic review will elucidate the association between cannabis use and methadone maintenance treatment outcomes. We will provide evidence that will be useful to clinicians regarding whether monitoring cannabis use during MMT is advantageous for optimizing MMT outcomes.

The significance of delayed posttreatment residual flow occurring months after FD treatment is unknown. CASE DESCRIPTION A 76-year-old woman with a large intracranial aneurysm measuring 23.0 × 18.1 mm in the cavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery was treated with placement of a single FD (Pipeline Embolization Device, Covidien, Irvine, California, USA). Postprocedure digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated flow stagnation inside the aneurysm dome. The patient was discharged 9 days post procedure without new neurologic deficits. A 6-month follow-up DSA demonstrated delayed posttreatment residual flow into the aneurysm sac. Although she was scheduled for additional FD placement because of concern for aneurysmal rupture, the operation was not conducted due to an interim motor vehicle accident. Oral treatment with aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) was continued during her recovery. DSA performed 12 months post procedure showed that the aneurysm had completely thrombosed. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm may form part of the normal clinical course post FD placement and may not preclude eventual thrombosis of the aneurysm. Larger studies are needed to determine whether more frequent follow-up DSAs after FD placement are necessary and whether all patients exhibiting delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm require additional FD placement or if watchful waiting is a more suitable course.","Nakae, Ryuta; Takigawa, Tomoji; Hirata, Koji; Nagaishi, Masaya; Hyodo, Akio; Suzuki, Kensuke",World neurosurgery,456,19

A literature review was undertaken and identified one randomised controlled trial assessing the use of fan for cough. The proposed underlying mechanism of cough relief is stimulation of the trigeminal nerve, possibly by cooling. This mechanism is well described in breathlessness. It presents the possibility of a novel therapeutic approach to managing cough.

We conducted an online study during the epidemic to explore the mental state of tumor patients and their families during this extraordinary time. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was carried out. Questionnaires were distributed through the WeChat ""Questionnaire Star"" network. The snowball sampling technique was adopted and further promoted by subjects who had completed the questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 1,030 valid questionnaires were collected. There were 609 (59.13%) tumor patients and 421 (40.87%) family members. One hundred and fifty-six (15.15%) subjects had anxiety, among which 65 (6.31%) had moderate to severe anxiety. Single-factor analysis indicated that age (>60 years old), the farmer occupation, and a high sleep disorder assessment score were risk factors for anxiety, while the latter two might also be independent risk factors, as suggested by multi-factor analysis. Infrequent contact with doctors was an independent risk factor for cancer patients, while uninterrupted anti-tumor therapy was an independent protective factor. 40.19% of the subjects expressed a need for psychosocial support during the COVID-19 period. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in tumor patients and their relatives experiencing greater psychological pressure than usual, and patients were more worried about anti-tumor treatment and disease progression impacted by the epidemic. Both groups had a significant need for psychosocial help.","Yang, Shengli; Yao, Huang; Song, Yating; Shu, Chengrong; Chen, Mengni; Pi, Guoliang; Jin, Min; Chen, Renwang; Wang, Qiushuang; Chang, Jian; Zuo, Zhigang; Hu, Jianli",Annals of palliative medicine,456,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of 214 consecutive patients with SCSNs that were surgically resected and histologically confirmed as lung adenocarcinomas (n = 112) and granulomatous lesions (n = 102) from 2 medical institutions between October 2011 and June 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients from center 1 ware enrolled as training cohort (n = 150) and patients from center 2 were included as external validation cohort (n = 64), respectively. Radiomics features were extracted from non-contrast chest CT images preoperatively. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used for radiomics feature extraction and radiomics signature construction. Clinical characteristics, subjective CT findings, and radiomics signature were used to develop a predictive radiomics nomogram. The performance was examined by assessment of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS Lung adenocarcinoma was significantly associated with an irregular margin and lobulated shape in the training set (p = 0.001, < 0.001) and external validation set (p = 0.016, = 0.018), respectively. The radiomics signature consisting of 22 features was significantly associated with lung adenocarcinomas of SCSNs (p < 0.001). The radiomics nomogram incorporated the radiomics signature, gender and lobulated shape. The AUCs of combined model in the training and external validation dataset were 0.885 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.823-0.931), 0.808 (95% CI: 0.690-0.896), respectively. Decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION A radiomics signature based on non-enhanced CT has the potential to differentiate between lung adenocarcinomas and granulomatous lesions. The radiomics nomogram incorporating the radiomics signature and subjective findings may facilitate the individualized, preoperative treatment in patients with SCSNs.","Chen, Xiangmeng; Feng, Bao; Chen, Yehang; Liu, Kunfeng; Li, Kunwei; Duan, Xiaobei; Hao, Yixiu; Cui, Enming; Liu, Zhuangsheng; Zhang, Chaotong; Long, Wansheng; Liu, Xueguo",Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society,456,19

Since then, more than 1,000 cases of MERS-CoV infection have been confirmed; infection is typically associated with considerable morbidity and, in approximately 30% of cases, mortality. Currently, there is no protective vaccine available. Replication-competent recombinant measles virus (MV) expressing foreign antigens constitutes a promising tool to induce protective immunity against corresponding pathogens. Therefore, we generated MVs expressing the spike glycoprotein of MERS-CoV in its full-length (MERS-S) or a truncated, soluble variant of MERS-S (MERS-solS). The genes encoding MERS-S and MERS-solS were cloned into the vaccine strain MVvac2 genome, and the respective viruses were rescued (MVvac2-CoV-S and MVvac2-CoV-solS). These recombinant MVs were amplified and characterized at passages 3 and 10. The replication of MVvac2-CoV-S in Vero cells turned out to be comparable to that of the control virus MVvac2-GFP (encoding green fluorescent protein), while titers of MVvac2-CoV-solS were impaired approximately 3-fold. The genomic stability and expression of the inserted antigens were confirmed via sequencing of viral cDNA and immunoblot analysis. In vivo, immunization of type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR(-/-))-CD46Ge mice with 2 × 10(5) 50% tissue culture infective doses of MVvac2-CoV-S(H) or MVvac2-CoV-solS(H) in a prime-boost regimen induced robust levels of both MV- and MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, induction of specific T cells was demonstrated by T cell proliferation, antigen-specific T cell cytotoxicity, and gamma interferon secretion after stimulation of splenocytes with MERS-CoV-S presented by murine dendritic cells. MERS-CoV challenge experiments indicated the protective capacity of these immune responses in vaccinated mice. IMPORTANCE Although MERS-CoV has not yet acquired extensive distribution, being mainly confined to the Arabic and Korean peninsulas, it could adapt to spread more readily among humans and thereby become pandemic. Therefore, the development of a vaccine is mandatory. The integration of antigen-coding genes into recombinant MV resulting in coexpression of MV and foreign antigens can efficiently be achieved. Thus, in combination with the excellent safety profile of the MV vaccine, recombinant MV seems to constitute an ideal vaccine platform. The present study shows that a recombinant MV expressing MERS-S is genetically stable and induces strong humoral and cellular immunity against MERS-CoV in vaccinated mice. Subsequent challenge experiments indicated protection of vaccinated animals, illustrating the potential of MV as a vaccine platform with the potential to target emerging infections, such as MERS-CoV.","Malczyk, Anna H; Kupke, Alexandra; Prüfer, Steffen; Scheuplein, Vivian A; Hutzler, Stefan; Kreuz, Dorothea; Beissert, Tim; Bauer, Stefanie; Hubich-Rau, Stefanie; Tondera, Christiane; Eldin, Hosam Shams; Schmidt, Jörg; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Süzer, Yasemin; Seifried, Janna; Hanschmann, Kay-Martin; Kalinke, Ulrich; Herold, Susanne; Sahin, Ugur; Cichutek, Klaus; Waibler, Zoe; Eickmann, Markus; Becker, Stephan; Mühlebach, Michael D",Journal of virology,456,16

However, multiple challenges persist in scaling innovations. In this study, we aim to summarize the scaling evidence in the health and social care literature and identify current knowledge gaps. METHODS We will conduct a living umbrella review according to the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual. We will consider all knowledge syntheses addressing scaling in health or social care (e.g., any setting, any clinical area) and conducted in a systematic way. We will search the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, PsychINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, Sociological Abstract (Proquest), Academic Search Premier (EBSCO), and Proquest Dissertations & Theses Global, from inception. Furthermore, we will conduct searches of the grey literature. No restriction regarding date or language will be applied. Each phase of the review will be processed by two independent reviewers. We will develop a data extraction form on Covidence. We will assess the methodological quality of the included reviews using AMSTAR2 and the risk of bias using ROBIS. Results will be presented in tabular form and accompanied by a narrative synthesis covering the traditional themes of scaling science that emerge from the analysis, such as coverage, range, and sustainability, as well as themes less covered in the literature, including reporting guidance, models, tools, barriers, and/or facilitators to scaling innovations, evidence regarding application in high-income or low-income countries, and end-user engagement. We will disseminate the findings via publications and through relevant networks. DISCUSSION The findings of the umbrella review will facilitate access to scaling evidence in the literature and help strengthen the science of scaling for researchers, policy makers, and program managers.

This report aims to inform about the changes in training volume and intensity distribution and their effects on functional performance due to a 7-week home-confinement period in professional road cyclists from a Union Cycliste Internationale Pro Team. METHODS A total of 18 male professional cyclists (mean [SD] age = 24.9 [2.8] y, body mass = 66.5 [5.6] kg, maximal aerobic power = 449 [39] W; 6.8 [0.6] W/kg) were monitored during the 10 weeks before the lockdown (outdoor cycling) and the 7-week lockdown (indoor cycling turbo trainer). Data from the mean maximal power output (in watts per kilogram) produced during the best 5-minute and best 20-minute records and the training intensity distributions (weekly volumes at power-based training zones) were collected from WKO5 software. RESULTS Total training volume decreased 33.9% during the lockdown (P < .01). Weekly volumes by standardized zones (Z1 to Z6) declined between 25.8% and 52.2% (effect size from 0.83 to 1.57), except for Z2 (P = .38). There were large reductions in best 5-minute and best 20-minute performance (effect size > 1.36; P < .001) with losses between 1% and 19% in all the cyclists. CONCLUSIONS Total indoor volumes of 12 hours per week, with 6 hours per week at low intensity (Z1 and Z2) and 2 hours per week at high intensity over the threshold (Z5 and Z6), were insufficient to maintain performance in elite road cyclists during the COVID-19 lockdown. Such performance declines should be considered to enable a safe and effective return to competition.","Muriel, Xabier; Courel-Ibáñez, Javier; Cerezuela-Espejo, Victor; Pallarés, Jesús G",International journal of sports physiology and performance,456,1

These groups often benefit from assistive technology (AT) and so it is important to understand how use of AT may be affected by or may help to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Objective: The objectives of this study were to explore the how AT use and provision have been affected during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how AT policies and systems may be made more resilient based on lessons learned during this global crisis. METHODS This study was a rapid, international online qualitative survey in the 6 United Nations (UN) languages (English, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Mandarin Chinese) facilitated by extant World Health Organization (WHO) and International Disability Alliance networks. Themes and subthemes of the qualitative responses were identified using Braun and Clarke's 6-phase analysis. RESULTS Four primary themes were identified in in the data: Disruption of Services, Insufficient Emergency Preparedness, Limitations in Existing Technology, and Inadequate Policies and Systems. Subthemes were identified within each theme, including subthemes related to developing resilience in AT systems, based on learning from the pandemic. CONCLUSION COVID-19 has disrupted the delivery of AT services, primarily due to infection control measures resulting in lack of provider availability and diminished one-to-one services. This study identified a need for stronger user-centred development of funding policies and infrastructures that are more sustainable and resilient, best practices for remote service delivery, robust and accessible tools and systems, and increased capacity of clients, caregivers, and clinicians to respond to pandemic and other crisis situations.","Smith, Emma M; Toro Hernandez, Maria Luisa; Ebuenyi, Ikenna D; Syurina, Elena V; Barbareschi, Giulia; Best, Krista L; Danemayer, Jamie; Oldfrey, Ben; Ibrahim, Nuha; Holloway, Catherine; MacLachlan, Malcolm",International journal of health policy and management,456,27

We have developed an electronic Objectively Structured Practical Examination (e-OSPE) in Medical Biochemistry using the freely available Google forms to mitigate the academic disruption posed by COVID-19 pandemic in our resource-poor setting. Ten e-OSPE stations created, interlinked, and time-restricted. Fifty undergraduate students appeared for the e-OSPE examination on a prefixed date and time. Learner feedback was collected immediately after the completion of the examination. Facilitator feedback was also collected. Students' mean scores in e-OSPE and traditional OSPE were 78.15% and 74.56%, respectively. Their difference was not statistically significant (paired t-test two-tailed p-value 0.0979). Thus, the results of e-OSPE are reliable as compared to traditional OSPE. Bland Altman Plot revealed 92% of students had scores that were in the agreeable limit of both traditional OSPE and e-OSPE. Both the learners and facilitators were in consensus that the online format of e-OSPE is a good alternative for assessment (0.67 and 0.82); their experience was good (0.72 and 0.92) and conduction was well organized (0.73 and 0.86). Several suggestions were also received to make e-OSPE even more effective.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 36 samples were collected from the lungs. Histopathological features and virus distribution were observed by optical microscope and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Immune cells were detected by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Transcriptome and proteome approaches were used to investigate main biological processes involved in COVID-19-associated pulmonary fibrosis. RESULTS The histopathological changes of the lung tissues were characterized by extensive pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and hemorrhage. Viral particles were observed in the cytoplasm of macrophages. CD3+ CD4- T cells T cells, neutrophils, NK cells, γ/δ T cells and monocytes, but not B cells, were abundant in the lungs. Higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines iNOS, IL-1β and IL-6 were in the area of mild fibrosis. Multi-omics analyses revealed a total of 126 out of 20,356 significant different transcription and 114 out of 8,493 protein expression in lung samples with mild and severe fibrosis, most of which were related to fibrosis and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS Our results provide novel insight that the significant neutrophil/ CD3+ CD4- T cell/ macrophage activation leads to cytokine storm and severe fibrosis in the lungs of COVID-19 patient and may contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Chen, Xiao-Jun; Li, Kai; Xu, Lei; Yu, You-Jia; Wu, Bo; He, Yuan-Lin; Zhao, Wen-E; Li, Ding; Luan, Chang-Xing; Hu, Li; Wang, Jie; Ding, Jing-Jing; Yu, Yan-Fang; Li, Jing-Xin; Tan, Zhong-Ming; Liu, Xiao-Fei; Wei, Dong; Zhang, Zhi-Hong; Guo, Xue-Jiang; Su, Chuan; Hu, Zhi-Bin; Guo, Yue-Shuai; Chen, Jing-Yu; Chen, Feng",European journal of clinical investigation,456,11

Different management strategies have been described with variable success. We present a case of keloid scar formation following cardiac surgery including our management and the final aesthetic result. CASE DESCRIPTION A 64 year old female of fair complexion underwent mitral valve replacement. The procedure and postoperative recovery were uncomplicated, however, during the following year, thick keloid scars formed over the incision sites. Initial non surgical measures failed to relieve pain and did not offer any tangible aesthetic benefit. Eventually surgical excision was attempted. She presented to our clinic for nine months follow up with significant improvement in pain and aesthetic result. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION Several theories have attempted to explore the pathophysiology of keloid scar formation. A number of predisposing factors have been documented however none existed in this case. A variety of invasive and non invasive approaches have been described but significant differences in success rates and methodology of investigations still precludes a standardized management protocol. CONCLUSIONS In this case study a rare presentation of keloid scar has been presented. The variety of methods used to improve pain and aesthetic result demonstrates the propensity of keloid scars to recur and the therapeutic challenges that surgeons have to face in their quest for a satisfactory patient outcome.","Patel, Rikesh; Papaspyros, Sotiris C; Javangula, Kalyana C; Nair, Unnikrishnan",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,456,7

Epidemiological studies identified diabetes as the primary comorbidity associated with severe and/or lethal MERS-CoV infection. Understanding how diabetes affects MERS is important due to the global burden of diabetes and pandemic potential of MERS-CoV. We used a model in which mice were made susceptible to MERS-CoV by expressing human DPP4 and type 2 diabetes was induced by administering a high fat diet. Upon infection with MERS-CoV, diabetic mice had a prolonged phase of severe disease and delayed recovery which was independent of virus titers. Histological analysis revealed that diabetic mice had delayed inflammation which was then prolonged through 21 dpi. Diabetic mice had fewer inflammatory monocyte/macrophages and CD4+ T cells which correlated with lower levels of Ccl2 and Cxcl10 expression. Diabetic mice also had lower levels of Tnfa, Il6, Il12b, and Arg1 expression and higher levels of Il17a expression. These data suggest that the increased disease severity observed in individuals with MERS and comorbid type 2 diabetes is likely due to a dysregulated immune response which results in more severe and prolonged lung pathology.","Kulcsar, Kirsten A; Coleman, Christopher M; Beck, Sarah E; Frieman, Matthew B",JCI insight,456,31

We quantified the contribution of tumor, treatment, hospital, sociodemographic, and neighborhood factors to racial/ethnic survival disparities in California. Materials and Methods California Cancer Registry data were used to estimate population-based cancer-specific survival for patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer between 2000 and 2013 for each racial/ethnic group (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and separately each for Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino) compared with non-Hispanic whites. The percentage contribution of factors to overall racial/ethnic survival disparities was estimated from a sequence of multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results In baseline models, black patients had the lowest survival for all cancer sites, and Asian American and Pacific Islander patients had the highest, compared with whites. Mediation analyses suggested that stage at diagnosis had the greatest influence on overall racial/ethnic survival disparities accounting for 24% of disparities in breast cancer, 24% in prostate cancer, and 16% to 30% in colorectal cancer. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was an important factor in all cancers, but only for black and Hispanic patients. The influence of marital status on racial/ethnic disparities was stronger in men than in women. Adjustment for all covariables explained approximately half of the overall survival disparities in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, but it explained only 15% to 40% of disparities in lung cancer. Conclusion Overall reductions in racial/ethnic survival disparities were driven largely by reductions for black compared with white patients. Stage at diagnosis had the largest effect on racial/ethnic survival disparities, but earlier detection would not entirely eliminate them. The influences of neighborhood socioeconomic status and marital status suggest that social determinants, support mechanisms, and access to health care are important contributing factors.","Ellis, Libby; Canchola, Alison J; Spiegel, David; Ladabaum, Uri; Haile, Robert; Gomez, Scarlett Lin",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,456,10

A case series.,10.949566,3.2288122,2017,"BACKGROUND Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is currently the most common bariatric procedure in France. It achieves both adequate excess weight loss and significant reduction of comorbidities. However, leak is still the most common complication after SG. Nevertheless, its risk of occurrence is <3% in specialized centers. Its management is difficult, long, and challenging. Although the procedure is commonly endoscopic and nonoperative, the management of post-SG fistulas could sometimes be surgical, including peritoneal lavage, abscess drainage, disrupted staple line suturing, resleeve, gastric bypass, or total gastrectomy. Roux-en-Y fistulojejunostomy (RYFJ) has been described as a salvage option. In this study, we report the early results of RYFJ for post-SG fistula, emphasizing indications, operative technique, and short-term outcome. METHODS Between January 2007 and December 2012, we treated 62 patients with post-SG fistula. Before surgery, intra-abdominal or thoracic abscesses or collections were either excluded or treated by computed tomographic scan-guided drainage or even surgery. Endoscopic stenting was then attempted. After optimization of the nutritional status in case of failure of endoscopic measures, some of the patients underwent RYFJ. RESULTS Between January 2007 and December 2012, a total of 21 patients (16 women and 5 men) had RYFJ for post-SG fistula. Mean age was 47 years (range, 22-59 years). Procedures were performed laparoscopically in all but 3 cases. The rate of secondary conversion to laparotomy was 11.1%. The was no mortality. The postoperative morbidity rate was less than 5%. The rate of fistula control was eventually 100%. CONCLUSIONS RYFJ is a safe and feasible salvage procedure for the treatment of patients with post-SG fistula. Longer outcome analysis is, however, needed especially regarding the physiological and metabolic behavior of the procedure.","Chouillard, Elie; Chahine, Elias; Schoucair, Naim; Younan, Antoine; Jarallah, Mohammad Al; Fajardy, Alain; Vitte, René-Louis; Biagini, Jean",Surgical endoscopy,456,12

Objective To determine the effect of 16:8-hour time-restricted eating on weight loss and metabolic risk markers. Interventions Participants were randomized such that the consistent meal timing (CMT) group was instructed to eat 3 structured meals per day, and the time-restricted eating (TRE) group was instructed to eat ad libitum from 12:00 pm until 8:00 pm and completely abstain from caloric intake from 8:00 pm until 12:00 pm the following day. Design, Setting, and Participants This 12-week randomized clinical trial including men and women aged 18 to 64 years with a body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 27 to 43 was conducted on a custom mobile study application. Participants received a Bluetooth scale. Participants lived anywhere in the United States, with a subset of 50 participants living near San Francisco, California, who underwent in-person testing. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was weight loss. Secondary outcomes from the in-person cohort included changes in weight, fat mass, lean mass, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c levels, estimated energy intake, total energy expenditure, and resting energy expenditure. Results Overall, 116 participants (mean [SD] age, 46.5 [10.5] years; 70 [60.3%] men) were included in the study. There was a significant decrease in weight in the TRE (-0.94 kg; 95% CI, -1.68 to -0.20; P = .01), but no significant change in the CMT group (-0.68 kg; 95% CI, -1.41 to 0.05, P = .07) or between groups (-0.26 kg; 95% CI, -1.30 to 0.78; P = .63). In the in-person cohort (n = 25 TRE, n = 25 CMT), there was a significant within-group decrease in weight in the TRE group (-1.70 kg; 95% CI, -2.56 to -0.83; P < .001). There was also a significant difference in appendicular lean mass index between groups (-0.16 kg/m2; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.05; P = .005). There were no significant changes in any of the other secondary outcomes within or between groups. There were no differences in estimated energy intake between groups. Conclusions and Relevance Time-restricted eating, in the absence of other interventions, is not more effective in weight loss than eating throughout the day.

To uncover cellular protein responses in classical swine fever virus-infected PK-15 cells, a proteomic analysis was conducted using 2D PAGE followed by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS identification. Altered expression of 35 protein spots in infected cells at 48 h p.i. were identified in 2D gels, with 21 of these being characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS, including 16 upregulated proteins and 5 down-regulated proteins. Western-blot analysis confirmed the up-regulation of annexin 2 and down-regulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The altered proteins could be sorted into 7 groups according to cellular function: cytoskeleton, energy metabolism, replication/transcription and translation processes, protein processing, antioxidative stress proteins, heat shock proteins and signal transduction. The altered expression of these proteins provides a response profile of PK-15 host cells to CSFV infection. Further study of these altered proteins may facilitate understanding the mechanisms of CSFV infection and pathogenesis.","Sun, Jinfu; Jiang, Ying; Shi, Zixue; Yan, Yujuan; Guo, Huancheng; He, Fuchu; Tu, Changchun",Journal of proteome research,456,16

Monitoring of haemodynamics can detect early abnormal circulation that may lead to these complications. We described time-frequency relationships between near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) cerebral regional haemoglobin oxygen saturation (CrSO2) and preductal peripheral perfusion index (PI), capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) in extremely preterm infants in the first 72 h of life. Patients were sub-grouped in infants with PH and/or IVH (N H = 8) and healthy controls (N C = 11). Data were decomposed in wavelets allowing the analysis of localized variations of power. This approach allowed to quantify the percentage of time of significant cross-correlation, semblance, gain (transfer function) and coherence between signals. Ultra-low frequencies (<0.28 mHz) were analyzed as slow and prolonged periods of impaired circulation are considered more detrimental than transient fluctuations. Cross-correlation between CrSO2 and oximetry (PI, SpO2 and HR) as well as in-phase semblance and gain between CrSO2 and HR were significantly lower while anti-phase semblance between CrSO2 and HR was significantly higher in PH-IVH infants compared to controls. These differences may reflect haemodynamic instability associated with cerebrovascular autoregulation and hemorrhagic complications observed during the transitioning physiology.","Beausoleil, Thierry P; Janaillac, Marie; Barrington, Keith J; Lapointe, Anie; Dehaes, Mathieu",Scientific reports,456,5

In an otherwise tragic time, this provides a unique natural experiment to investigate the environmental impact of such a (temporary) ‘de-globalization’. Here, we estimate the medium-run impact of a battery of COVID-19 related lockdown measures on air quality across 162 countries, going beyond the existing short-run estimates from a limited number of countries. In doing so, we leverage a new dataset categorizing lockdown measures and tracking their implementation and release, extending to 31 August 2020. We find that domestic and international lockdown measures overall led to a decline in PM2.5 pollution by 45% and 35%, respectively. This substantial impact persists in the medium-run, even as lockdowns are lifted, there is, however, substantial heterogeneity across different types of lockdown measures, different countries, and different sources of pollution. We show that some country trajectories are much more appealing (with fewer COVID-19 casualties, less economic downturn and bigger pollution reductions) than others. Our results have important policy implications and highlight the potential to ‘build back better’ a sustainable economy where pollution can be curbed in a less economically costly way than during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bonardi, Jean-Philippe Gallea Quentin Kalanoski Dimitrija Lalive Rafael Madhok Raahil Noack Frederik Rohner Dominic Sonno Tommaso",Environmental Research Letters,456,9

According to this model a metastable trimer, anchored in the viral membrane through its transmembrane domain, transits to a trimeric prehairpin intermediate, anchored at its opposite end in the target membrane through its fusion peptide. A subsequent refolding event creates a trimer of hairpins (often termed a six-helix bundle) in which the previously well-separated transmembrane domain and fusion peptide (and their attached membranes) are brought together, thereby driving membrane fusion. While there is ample biochemical and structural information on the trimer-of-hairpins conformation of class I viral fusion proteins, less is known about intermediate states between native metastable trimers and the final trimer of hairpins. In this study we analyzed conformational states of the transmembrane subunit (TM), the fusion subunit, of the Env glycoprotein of the subtype A avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV-A). By analyzing forms of EnvA TM on mildly denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate gels we identified five conformational states of EnvA TM. Following interaction of virions with a soluble form of the ASLV-A receptor at 37 degrees C, the metastable form of EnvA TM (which migrates at 37 kDa) transits to a 70-kDa and then to a 150-kDa species. Following subsequent exposure to a low pH (or an elevated temperature or the fusion promoting agent chlorpromazine), an additional set of bands at >150 kDa, and then a final band at 100 kDa, forms. Both an EnvA C-helix peptide (which inhibits virus fusion and infectivity) and the fusion-inhibitory agent lysophosphatidylcholine inhibit the formation of the >150- and 100-kDa bands. Our data are consistent with the 70- and 150-kDa bands representing precursor and fully formed prehairpin conformations of EnvA TM. Our data are also consistent with the >150-kDa bands representing higher-order oligomers of EnvA TM and with the 100-kDa band representing the fully formed six-helix bundle. In addition to resolving fusion-relevant conformational intermediates of EnvA TM, our data are compatible with a model in which the EnvA protein is activated by its receptor (at neutral pH and a temperature greater than or equal to room temperature) to form prehairpin conformations of EnvA TM, and in which subsequent exposure to a low pH is required to stabilize the final six-helix bundle, which drives a later stage of fusion.","Matsuyama, Shutoku; Delos, Sue Ellen; White, Judith M",Journal of virology,456,9

However, the information about the impact of COVID-19 on the whole hematological population is scarce. We aimed to describe the 30th day overall survival (OS) after COVID-19 infection in patients with a hematological disease in Argentina. A completely anonymous survey from the Argentine Society of Hematology was delivered to all the hematologists in Argentina; it started in April 2020. A cut-off to analyze the data was performed in December 2020 and, finally, 419 patients were reported and suitable for the analysis (average age: 58 years, 90% with malignant diseases). After the COVID-19 diagnosis, the 30-day OS for the whole population was 80.2%. From the entire group (419), 101 (24.1%) individuals required intensive care unit admission, where the 30-day OS was 46.6%. Among allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients, the 30-day OS was 70.3%. Factors associated with a low OS were two or more comorbidities, an active hematological disease and history of chemotherapy. In individuals with the three factors, the 30-day OS was 49.6% while the 30-day OS in those without those factors was 100%.

The quintessential example is quarantine. While isolating sick patients tends not to provoke much concern, quarantine of healthy people who only might be infected often is controversial. In fact, as the experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) shows, the vast majority of those placed under quarantine typically don't become ill. Efforts to enforce involuntary quarantine through military or police powers also can backfire, stoking both panic and disease spread. Yet quarantine is part of a limited arsenal of options when effective treatment or prophylaxis is not available, and some evidence suggests it can be effective, especially when it is voluntary, home-based and accompanied by extensive outreach, communication and education efforts. Even assuming that quarantine is medically effective, however, it still must be ethically justified because it creates harms for many of those affected. Moreover, ethical principles of reciprocity, transparency, non-discrimination and accountability should guide any implementation of quarantine.","Wynia, Matthew K",The American journal of bioethics : AJOB,456,29

A 174 bp cDNA probe targeting the viral RNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein of a Canadian PRRSV isolate was generated by polymerase chain reaction. The cDNA probe was labeled by random priming with digoxigenin-dUTP using a commercially available kit. The ability of the digoxigenin-labeled probe to specifically detect PRRSV RNA was tested on cultured cells infected with 6 Canadian PRRSV isolates, a US PRRSV isolate and the European Lelystad isolate. The probe detected all Canadian PRRSV isolates tested as well as the US PRRSV isolate but did not detect the Lelystad isolate. In addition, when tested on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from pigs experimentally infected with several Canadian isolates and from a field case, a strong signal without background staining was obtained. Our results indicate that nonradioactive in situ hybridization could represent a useful tool for the detection of PRRSV in routinely fixed and processed tissues.

ANIMALS 12 dairy herds in Ohio affected with WD (case herds). For each case herd, 2 unaffected herds from the same area were concurrently used as control herds. PROCEDURE A case-control study was conducted, using herds as the unit of investigation. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify risk factors for contracting disease. RESULTS 4 factors appeared to increase a herd's risk for WD: increase in herd prevalence of adult cows that had a fourfold or more increase in BCV serum IgG antibody titer; increase in herd prevalence of adult cows that had a fourfold or more increase in bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) titer; housing cattle in tiestall or stanchion barns rather than free-stall facilities; and use of equipment to handle manure and subsequently handle feed. The adjusted population-attributable risk for these variables was 71, 43, 53, and 31%, respectively, and 99% overall, indicating that these variables had considerable impact on WD outbreaks for the study population. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In dairies in Ohio, recent herd exposure to BCV appeared to increase the risk for WD outbreaks. Some WD outbreaks might have been associated with acute BVDV infection. Certain housing and management practices may have increased the risk of an outbreak of WD.","Smith, D R; Fedorka-Cray, P J; Mohan, R; Brock, K V; Wittum, T E; Morley, P S; Hoblet, K H; Saif, L J",American journal of veterinary research,456,4

Pigs of different ages were affected, and the main clinical signs were fever, dyspnea, and abdominal respiration. Coughing was not a constant finding of the syndrome. At necropsy, macroscopic lesions included the overall appearance of pale animals, general lymphadenopathy, hepatic congestion, and consolidation of the lungs. Histopathologic findings were mainly proliferative pneumonia with a significant macrophage invasion, necrotic inflammatory cells in the alveoli and the airways, a marked proliferation of type II pneumocytes, and thickening of the alveolar septae. Fluorescent antibody examination of lungs of sick piglets did not demonstrate porcine parvovirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, or encephalomyocarditis virus. However, evidence of the presence of an influenza type A infection was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) staining using monoclonal antibody directed to nucleocapsid protein (NP) of human type A influenza virus. The virus was isolated either by intra-allantoic inoculation of specific-pathogen-free embryonating hens' eggs or propagation in canine kidney (MDCK) cells in the presence of trypsin. By hemagglutination inhibition tests, no cross-reactivity was demonstrated with human influenza H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 strains, and infected MDCK cells did not react by IIF with monoclonal antibodies to NP protein of type B influenza virus. The hemagglutination activity of plaque-purified isolates was only partly inhibited by hyperimmune serum produced to subtypes A/Wisconsin/76/H1N1 and A/New Jersey/76/H1N1 of swine influenza virus. Gnotobiotic piglets that were infected intranasally with egg-adapted isolates of this new antigenic variant of swine influenza virus developed the very same type of lesions observed in field cases.","Dea, S; Bilodeau, R; Sauvageau, R; Montpetit, C; Martineau, G P","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",456,33

Macrophages are key sentinel cells in the respiratory system, and it is therefore relevant to compare the responses of human macrophages to infections with the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and other respiratory viruses. Primary human monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with SARS-CoV in vitro. Virus replication was monitored by measuring the levels of positive- and negative-strand RNA, by immunofluorescence detection of the SARS-CoV nucleoprotein, and by titration of the infectious virus. The gene expression profiles of macrophages infected with SARS-CoV, human coronavirus 229E, and influenza A (H1N1) virus were compared by using microarrays and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Secreted cytokines were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SARS-CoV initiated viral gene transcription and protein synthesis in macrophages, but replication was abortive and no infectious virus was produced. In contrast to the case with human coronavirus 229E and influenza A virus, there was little or no induction of beta interferon (IFN-beta) in SARS-CoV-infected macrophages. Furthermore, SARS-CoV induced the expression of chemokines such as CXCL10/IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 and CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein 1. The poor induction of IFN-beta, a key component of innate immunity, and the ability of the virus to induce chemokines could explain aspects of the pathogenesis of SARS.","Cheung, Chung Y; Poon, Leo L M; Ng, Iris H Y; Luk, Winsie; Sia, Sin-Fun; Wu, Mavis H S; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Gordon, Siamon; Guan, Yi; Peiris, Joseph S M",Journal of virology,456,19

Syncytin is specifically expressed in the human placenta and mediates trophoblast cell fusion into the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast layer. It is a polypeptide of 538 amino acids and is predicted to be posttranslationally cleaved into a surface (SU) subunit and a transmembrane (TM) subunit. Functional characterization of syncytin protein can aid understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying syncytin-mediated cell fusion. In this report, we studied the structure-function relationship of syncytin in 293T and HeLa cells transiently expressing wild-type syncytin or syncytin mutants generated by linker scanning and deletion mutagenesis. Of the 22 linker-inserted mutants, mutants InS51, InV139, InE156, InS493, InA506, and InL529 were fusogenic, suggesting that regions around amino acids S51, V139, and E156 in the SU subunit and S493, A506, and L529 in the cytoplasmic domain (CTM) of syncytin are flexible in conformation. Of the 17 deletion mutants, nine mutants with deletions in the region from amino acids 479 to 538 were fusogenic. The deletion mutant DelI480, containing only the first four amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain, had enhanced fusogenic activity in comparison with the wild-type. In addition, two heptad repeat regions (HRA and B) were defined in the TM subunit of syncytin. A peptide inhibitor derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat region (HRB) was shown to potently inhibit syncytin-mediated cell fusion. Our results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of syncytin is not essential for syncytin-mediated fusion but may play a regulatory role, and an intramolecular interaction between HRA and B is involved in the fusion process.","Chang, Chingwen; Chen, Po-Tsang; Chang, Geen-Dong; Huang, Chang-Jen; Chen, Hungwen",Biology of reproduction,456,1

For safe and effective delivery of viral antigens to the mucosal immune system, we have developed a novel surface antigen display system for lactic acid bacteria using the poly-gamma-glutamic acid synthetase A protein (PgsA) of Bacillus subtilis as an anchoring matrix. Recombinant fusion proteins comprised of PgsA and the Spike (S) protein segments SA (residues 2 to 114) and SB (residues 264 to 596) were stably expressed in Lactobacillus casei. Surface localization of the fusion protein was verified by cellular fractionation analyses, immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry. Oral and nasal inoculations of recombinant L. casei into mice resulted in high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using S protein peptides. More importantly, these antibodies exhibited potent neutralizing activities against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pseudoviruses. Orally immunized mice mounted a greater neutralizing-antibody response than those immunized intranasally. Three new neutralizing epitopes were identified on the S protein using a peptide neutralization interference assay (residues 291 to 308, 520 to 529, and 564 to 581). These results indicate that mucosal immunization with recombinant L. casei expressing SARS-associated coronavirus S protein on its surface provides an effective means for eliciting protective immune response against the virus.","Lee, Jong-Soo; Poo, Haryoung; Han, Dong P; Hong, Seung-Pyo; Kim, Kwang; Cho, Michael W; Kim, Eun; Sung, Moon-Hee; Kim, Chul-Joong",Journal of virology,456,17

All subjects had exposure to a source patient and the epidemic progressively propagated in a short time. For the infectious chain, we defined these patients who had exposure to a source patient as the primary cases, which included 35 patients (41.7%). Patients who got the disease by exposure to the primary cases were defined as secondary cases, which included 34 patients (40.5%). Similarly, the tertiary cases included 15 patients (17.9%). RESULTS (1) No statistical differences in age, sex ratio, incubation period and hospitalization duration among various infectious generations were found (P > 0.05). (2) With descending in infectious generations, the initial temperature lowered, and cases with cough decreased (P < 0.05) with no statistical differences in the peak temperature, other accompanying symptoms and leukopenia (P > 0.05). (3) With descending in infectious generations, the course from the appearance of pulmonary lesions to their resolution shortened (P < 0.05).

The LESS procedure has been done for various urological diseases and studies have shown that it results in less pain, shorter hospi­tal stays and excellent cosmetic outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We describe our initial experience with LESS adrenalectomy without the use of the transumbilical approach. The participants were 16 consecutive patients who underwent LESS adrenalectomy using a SILS port™ (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) at Hiroshima University Hospital. Various parameters including the insufflation time, estimated blood loss, resumption of oral intake and complications were ana­lyzed. RESULTS The adrenalectomy was completed successfully with no major intraoperative complications in 15 of the patients. One LESS adrenalectomy was converted to a conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy by placement of two additional 12 mm trocars; this patient was therefore excluded from the study. The mean (range) patient age was 53.8 (35-69) years, body mass index (BMI) was 23.5 (20.7-27.2) kg/m2, tumor size was 19.8 (9-45) mm, insufflation time was 188.0 (95-340) min and estimated blood loss was 36.3 (10-80) mL. In all cases articulating instruments were used for satisfactory dissection and triangulation. One bowel injury (serosal) occurred and was repaired in the open laparotomy before SILS port™ insertion. All patients at the follow-up visit were satisfied and pleased with their scars. CONCLUSION We found LESS adrenalectomy to be apparently safe, effective and minimally invasive for ad­renal diseases.

Relevant studies have shown that ambient temperature may influence the spread of novel coronavirus. However, the effect of ambient temperature on COVID-19 remains controversial. Human mobility is also closely related to the pandemic of COVID-19, which could be affected by temperature at the same time. The purpose of this study is to explore the underlying mechanism of the association of temperature with COVID-19 transmission rate by linking human mobility. The effective reproductive number, meteorological conditions and human mobility data in 47 countries are collected. Panel data models with fixed effects are used to analyze the association of ambient temperature with COVID-19 transmission rate, and the mediation by human mobility. Our results show that there is a negative relationship between temperature and COVID-19 transmission rate. We also observe that temperature is positively associated with human mobility and human mobility is positively related to COVID-19 transmission rate. Thus, the suppression effect (also known as the inconsistent mediation effect) of human mobility is confirmed, which remains robust when different lag structures are used. These findings provide evidence that temperature can influence the spread of COVID-19 by affecting human mobility. Therefore, although temperature is negatively related to COVID-19 transmission rate, governments and the public should pay more attention to control measures since people are more likely to go out when temperature rising. Our results could partially explain the reason why COVID-19 is not prevented by warm weather in some countries.","Shao, Wenjing; Xie, Jingui; Zhu, Yongjian",Environ Res,456,26

The quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, more and more infected patients are relapsing after discharge, which suggests qPCR may fail to detect the virus in some cases. In this study, we selected 74 clinical samples from 43 recovering inpatients for qPCR and Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) synchronous blind detection, and established a cutoff value for ddPCR diagnosis of COVID-19. The results showed that at a cutoff value of 0.04 copies/µL, the ddPCR sensitivity and specificity are 97.6% and 100%, respectively. In addition, we also analyzed 18 retained samples from 9 discharged patients who relapsed. Although qPCR showed all 18 samples to be negative, ddPCR showed 12 to be positive, and there was only one patient with two negative samples; the other eight patients had at least one positive sample. These results indicate that ddPCR could significantly improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis, especially for discharged patients with a low viral load, and help to reduce misdiagnosis during recovery.","Liu, Chong; Shi, Qingxin; Peng, Mingfei; Lu, Ruyue; Li, Haohao; Cai, Yingying; Chen, Jiaxi; Xu, Jiaqin; Shen, Bo",Aging (Albany NY),456,32

Our group has published that bronchial epithelial cells from atopic normal and asthmatic patients and treated with Interleukin-13 (IL-13), a type 2 cytokine, suppressed gene expression of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Kimura H, et al. 2020). To further complement our studies, we examined ACE2 gene expression from individuals with severe asthma, and also assessed ACE2 protein levels from all groups. Because ACE2 is expressed in nasal epithelium, we also examined the effects of IL-13 on ACE2 expression in nasal epithelial cells. Objective: To determine if ACE2 gene and protein expression in upper and lower airways is modulated by IL-13. Methods: Non-atopic and atopic non-asthmatic normal, nonsevere and severe asthmatic participants were recruited and underwent bronchoscopy and nasal brushings to obtain primary bronchial and nasal epithelial cells. Epithelial cells were cultured at ALI for 2 weeks. Cells were treated with IL-13 (10 ng/ml) for 48 hours for gene expression and at 10, 50 and 100 ng/ml for 72 hours to determine protein expression from cell lysates by ELISA. Results: In bronchial epithelial cells, gene expression of ACE2 decreased following IL-13 treatment compared to untreated control: mean reduction: 0.52 ± 0.12 (p&lt;.001) in atopic normal cells, 0.67 ± 0.14 (p=0.038) in non-severe asthma cells, and 0.66 ± 0.03 (p&lt;.001) in severe asthma cells. There was no significant difference in the reduction in ACE2 gene expression between these three groups following IL-13 treatment. In nasal epithelial cells, the mean reduction in ACE2 gene expression was 0.42 ± 0.08 (p&lt;.001) in atopic normal cells and 0.48 ± 0.01 (p&lt;.001) in non-severe asthma cells) compared to untreated control. IL-13 significantly decreased ACE2 protein levels in bronchial epithelial cells in a dose dependent and similar manner in all groups compared to untreated control (p=0.011 in non-atopic normal, p=0.023 in atopic normal, p=0.016 in non-severe asthma, and p=0.011 in severe asthma, respectively, by Jonckheere-Terpstra test). IL-13 also reduced ACE2 protein expression in atopic normal and non-severe asthma group (p=0.033 and 0.003, respectively) in nasal epithelial cells. Conclusion: IL-13 attenuates ACE2 gene expression and protein production in both nasal and bronchial epithelial cells regardless of asthma and atopic status. These observations suggest that type 2 cytokines may confer protection in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Kimura, H.; Conway, M.; Francisco, D.; Kraft, M.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,456,27

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the phantom experiment, seven robot-assisted punctures were made to evaluate the accuracy of the method. In the animal experiment, 18 punctures (nine robotic and nine manual) were made in the livers of nine rabbits. The indicators, such as needle-tract length, angle deviation, puncture accuracy, number of scans required, and radiation exposure dose were compared between manual and robotic punctures. The paired-samples t-test was used for analysis. RESULTS: In the phantom experiment, the mean accuracy of seven punctures was 2.67 mm. In the animal experiment, there was no significant difference in needle-tract length (32.58 mm vs. 34.04 mm, p = .606), angle deviation (17.21° vs. 21.23° p = .557) and puncture accuracy (8.42 vs. 8.77 mm, p = .851) between the two groups. However, the number CT scans required (2.44 vs. 3.33, p = .002), and the radiation exposure dose (772.98 vs. 1077.89 mGy/cm, p = .003) were lower in the robot group than in the manual group.

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp-12) is a complex with nsp-7 and nsp-8 cofactors and is a major constituent of viral replication and RNA synthesis machinery. In the current study, the RdRp of the virus was selected as a receptor protein for computational drug discovery. Computational homology modelling was done in order to find the hidden secondary structures and structural assessment of the viral protein to target them via antiviral drugs. The study was based on molecular docking of different phytochemicals to check their potentials against viral replicative proteins. Out of 200 ligands used in this study from different plants, the best ten were selected based on drug discovery parameters such as S-score, ligand interactions, hydrophobic interactions and druglikeness. The ten best selected ligands were found to be verbenalin, epigallocatechin, swertisin, nobiletin, pinoresinol, caftaric acid, hesperetin, islandicin, neochlorogenic acid and sesamin that exploit the potency as antagonists of viral protein. Among binding interactions of all ligands, Arg339 centred as the main interacting residue among almost all the ligands. Till now, many antiviral agents have shown potency in only mild cases of SARS-CoV-2, but no effective drug has been found for critical pulmonary cases. In clinical trials, many broad-spectrum antiviral agents have been still in trial periods of testing against SARS-CoV-2. Till date, no effective drug or vaccine has been validated with significant efficacy and potency against the SARS-CoV-2; therefore, there is an urgent need to design effective vaccine against nCoV-19 infection.","Mahrosh, Hafiza Salaha; Mustafa, Ghulam",Environ Dev Sustain,456,29

Likewise, after a slight increase of deaths in April (14,804) compared to March (12,396), a considerable decline occurred in May (5170) and June (1464). Doubling times of cumulative cases grew from 2 to 6 days until March 20 to 2 weeks up to April 5, and thereafter no further doubling occurred until June 30.

Microglial inflammatory responses to a subsequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge were significantly enhanced in male SAMP8 mice relative to normal aging senescence-accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice at 17â¯weeks, but not 8â¯weeks of age.

Many respiratory viruses can spread via contact and droplet transmission, but increasing epidemiological data have shown that viral aerosol is an essential transmission route of coronavirus and influenza virus due to its ability to spread rapidly and high infectiousness. Aerosols have the characteristics of small particle size, long-time suspension and long-distance transmission, and easy access to the deep respiratory tract, leading to a high infection risk and posing a great threat to public health. In this review, the characteristics of viral aerosol generation, transmission, and infection as well as the current advances in the aerosol transmission of zoonotic coronavirus and influenza virus are summarized.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From the start of the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Bergamo, Italy, we have prospectively screened all consecutive outpatients who presented for treatment to the Oncology Division of the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo for SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression. We identified patients treated with ICIs and compared these to patients with the same cancer subtypes treated with TTs or CT. RESULTS: Between March 5 and May 18, 293 consecutive patients (49% melanoma, 34% non-small cell lung cancer, 9% renal cell carcinoma, 8% other) were included in this study: 159 (54%), 50 (17%) and 84 (29%) received ICIs, CT or TTs, respectively. Overall 89 patients (30.0%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Mortality of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients was statistically significantly higher compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (8/89 vs 3/204, respectively, Fisher's exact test p=0.004). All deaths were due to COVID-19. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were more frequent in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative cases (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test p=0.0008). The incidence of SAEs in SARS-CoV-2 positive compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative patients was similar in ICI and CT patients (17.3% and 3.7% for positive and negative patients in ICIs and 15.4% and 2.7% in CT, Breslow-Day test p=0.891). No COVID-19-related SAEs were observed in the TTs patients. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SAEs was higher for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients treated with ICIs and CT, mostly in advanced disease. No SAEs were observed in patients treated with TTs. SAEs were COVID-19 related rather than treatment related. Treatment with ICIs does not appear to significantly increase risk of SAEs compared with CT.

We specifically chose CART to examine neural mechanism(s) underlying photoperiod-induced responses, since it is a potent anorectic neuropeptide and involved in the regulation of changes in the body mass and reproduction in mammals. We first studied the distribution of CART-immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus of migratory redheaded buntings (Emberiza bruniceps). CART-immunoreactive neurons were found extensively distributed in the preoptic, lateral hypothalamic (LHN), anterior hypothalamic (AN), suprachiasmatic (SCN), paraventricular (PVN), dorsomedialis hypothalami (DMN), inferior hypothalamic (IH), and infundibular (IN) nuclei. Then, we correlated hypothalamic CART-immunoreactivity in buntings with photostimulated seasonal states, particularly winter non-migratory/non-breeding (NMB) state under short days, and spring premigratory/pre-breeding (PMB) and migratory/breeding (MB) states under long days. There were significantly increased CART-immunoreactive cells, and percent fluorescent area of CART-immunoreactivity was significantly increased in all mapped hypothalamic areas, except the SCN, PVN, AN, and DMN in photostimulated PMB and MB states, as compared to the non-stimulated NMB state. In particular, CART was richly expressed in the medial preoptic nucleus, LHN, IH and IN during MB state in which buntings showed reduced food intake and increased night-time activity. These results suggest that changes in the activity of the CART-containing system in different brain regions were associated with heightened energy needs of the photoperiod-induced seasonal responses during spring migration and reproduction in migratory songbirds.","Singh, Omprakash; Agarwal, Neha; Yadav, Anupama; Basu, Sumela; Malik, Shalie; Rani, Sangeeta; Kumar, Vinod; Singru, Praful S",Brain Struct Funct,456,10

PLS occurred in 9 (9%) patients (median 12 days post-transplant); all due to ABO antibodies. There were 31 minor ABO mismatch transplants. No patient required change in immunosuppression. Immune cytopenias (excluding PLS) occurred in six patients at an incidence of 1·7/100 patient years; three immune haemolysis, one immune thrombocytopenia, one acquired Glanzmann's and one immune neutropenia; 50% occurred with other cytopenias. All cases eventually responded to treatment, with a median of four treatments (range 1-8) and 5/6 were treated with rituximab. One patient with immune haemolysis required bortezomib. Complications were common in patients with immune cytopenias; 4/6 with infection needing intravenous antibiotics and 3/6 with venous thromboembolism. In 3/6 cases, a secondary cause for the immune cytopenia was evident. Switching from tacrolimus to ciclosporin was not necessary. There were five cases of transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA; 1·5/100 patient years) requiring calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal; two cases associated with acute rejection. Two cases were managed with plasma exchange, one with plasma infusions and one with eculizumab.

While most vaccine strategies for these viruses are developed around a programmed antibody response, relatively less attention is paid to our innate immune defenses that can determine the outcome of a viral infection via the production of antiviral cytokines like Type I Interferons. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the “cytokine storm” induced by aberrant activation of the innate immune response against a viral pathogen may sometimes offer replicative advantage to the virus thus promoting disease pathogenesis. Thus, it is important to fine tune the responses of the innate immune network that can be achieved via a deeper insight into the candidate molecules involved. Several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like the Toll like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and the retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) like receptors (RLRs) recognize cytosolic RNA viruses and mount an antiviral immune response. RLRs recognize invasive viral RNA produced during infection and mediate the induction of Type I Interferons via the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) molecule. It is an intriguing fact that the mitochondrion, one of the cell’s most vital organelle, has evolved to be a central hub in this antiviral defense. However, cytokine responses and interferon signaling via MAVS signalosome at the mitochondria must be tightly regulated to prevent overactivation of the immune responses. This review focuses on our current understanding of the innate immune sensing of the host mitochondria by the RLR-MAVS signalosome and its specificity against some of the emerging/re-emerging RNA viruses like Ebola, Zika, Influenza A virus (IAV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that may expand our understanding for novel pharmaceutical development.","Dutta, Sourav; Das, Nilanjana; Mukherjee, Piyali",Front.

It is a respiratory illness caused by the novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was initially reported in late December 2019. In a span of 6 months, this pandemic spread across the globe leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. Soon after the identification of the causative virus, questions concerning the impact of environmental factors on the dissemination and transmission of the virus, its persistence in environmental matrices, and infectivity potential begin to emerge. As the environmental factors could have far-reaching consequences on infection dissemination and severity, it is essential to understand the linkage between these factors and the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to improve our current understanding over this topic, the present article summarizes topical and substantial observations made regarding the influences of abiotic environmental factors such as climate, temperature, humidity, wind speed, air, and water quality, solid surfaces/interfaces, frozen food, and biotic factors like age, sex, gender, blood type, population density, behavioural characteristics, etc. on the transmission, persistence, and infectivity of this newly recognized SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further, the potential pathways of virus transmission that could pose risk to population health have been discussed, and the critical areas have been identified which merits urgent research for the assessment and management of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction-based (RT-PCR) analyses do not achieve sufficient sensitivity in the diagnosis of the disease. METHODS: The data from 2217 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 and hospitalized or discharged with home isolation were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, comorbidities, PCR results, initial computed tomography (CT), laboratory values, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)/Lymphocyte ratio, initial treatments and last status were recorded. The diagnostic sensitivity of LDH/Lymphocyte ratio, which is the main purpose of the study, was analyzed statistically. RESULTS: In order to test the effectiveness of LDH/Lymphocyte ratio for COVID-19 for diagnostic purposes, CT results were considered as gold standard. The area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 0.706 (p < 0.001; cut-off > 0.06) (Sensitivity: 76.4, specificity: 59.60). For the evaluation of LDH/Lymphocyte ratio in terms of survival, AUC was found to be 0.749 (p < 0.001; cut-off > 0.21) (Sensitivity: 70.59, specificity: 73.88). CONCLUSION: Studies based on radiological findings have demonstrated that CT involvement has higher sensitivity. LDH/Lymphocyte ratio was analyzed in terms of diagnosis and mortality with using specific CT involvement as gold standard method which was found to be a more sensitive due to PCR false negativity; 0.06 and 0.21 were obtained as cut off values for diagnosis and mortality.","Serin, Istemi; Sari, Nagehan Didem; Dogu, Mehmet Hilmi; Acikel, Sakine Damla; Babur, Gulnihal; Ulusoy, Avni; Onar, Mediha Irem; Gokce, Emre Cem; Altunok, Oguz; Yaylaci Mert, Feyza; Karakilic, Ayse; Baltik, Muhammed; Gulesir, Begum",J Infect Public Health,456,1

All the possible genotypes for SNP c.2534G > A (GG, AG, and AA) were observed in the studied population. However, Sahiwal cows revealed dimorphic pattern (AG and GG). The effect of targeted SNP on incidence of mastitis was evaluated and found to be significant. Animals with GG genotype were less susceptible to clinical mastitis and had comparatively lower somatic cell score (SCS) in Hardhenu cattle (P < 0.01) and Murrah buffalo (P < 0.05). Animals having GG genotype also exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) lower age at first calving (AFC). AG genotyped Murrah buffalo animals revealed significantly higher second lactation milk yield (P < 0.01). GG genotype with SCS and AFC could therefore be exploited as a promising candidate marker for the genetic improvement of udder health and AFC in dairy animals.","Magotra, Ankit; Pander, B L; Dalal, D S; Malik, B S; Garg, Asha Rani; Malik, Anika",Trop Anim Health Prod,456,24

Crediting its virulent nature, it becomes imperative to identify potential therapeutic agents against the deadly virus. The 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is a cysteine protease which causes the proteolysis of the replicase polyproteins to generate functional proteins, which is a crucial step for viral replication and infection. Computational methods have been applied in recent studies to identify promising inhibitors against 3CLpro to inhibit the viral activity. This review provides an overview of promising drug/lead candidates identified so far against 3CLpro through various in silico approaches such as structure-based virtual screening (SBVS), ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) and drug-repurposing/drug-reprofiling/drug-retasking. Further, the drugs have been classified according to their chemical structures or biological activity into flavonoids, peptides, terpenes, quinolines, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, protease inhibitors, phenalene and antibiotic derivatives. These are then individually discussed based on the various structural parameters namely estimated free energy of binding (&#916;G), key interacting residues, types of intermolecular interactions and structural stability of 3CLpro-ligand complexes obtained from the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. CONCLUSION: The review provides comprehensive information of potential inhibitors identified through several computational methods thus far against 3CLpro from SARS-CoV-2 and provides a better understanding of their interaction patterns and dynamic states of free and ligand-bound 3CLpro structures.","Singh, Ekampreet; Khan, Rameez Jabeer; Jha, Rajat Kumar; Amera, Gizachew Muluneh; Jain, Monika; Singh, Rashmi Prabha; Muthukumaran, Jayaraman; Singh, Amit Kumar",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,456,26

This study was aimed at performance assessment of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG ELISAs, and investigation of their utility for patient diagnosis and sero-epidemiologic investigations. Methods: Serum/plasma samples from COVID-19 patients or asymptomatic contacts (n=180) and healthy donors (n=90) were tested in parallel using two commercial IgM ELISAs (Erbalisa and Inbios), and four IgG ELISAs (Kavach, Euroimmun, Erbalisa and Inbios) along with an indigenous ß-propiolactone inactivated virus-based ELISA (IRSHA-IgG-ELISA). Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was used as reference test. Results: Among 180 COVID-19 patients, 125 tested positive by PRNT. Inbios-IgM-ELISA showed sensitivity (Se)/specificity (Sp)/positive predictive value (PPV)/negative predictive value (NPV) of 93.6/97.8/98.4/94.4 per cent in relation to PRNT, and performed better than Erbalisa-IgM-ELISA (Se: 48%, Sp: 95.6%, PPV: 95.2%, NPV: 65.2%). During the first week of disease, only 47.4 per cent of the COVID-19 patients tested IgM positive by Inbios-IgM-ELISA, detection improving at two weeks and beyond (~86-100%). Among IgG tests, Inbios-IgG-ELISA ranked first in terms of sensitivity (83.2%), followed by IRSHA (64.8%), Euroimmun (64%), Erbalisa (57.6%) and Kavach (56%) tests. For all IgG tests, sensitivity improved during the third (73.9-95.7%) and fourth week (100%) of illness. The specificity (96.7-100%) and PPV (96.2-100%) of all IgG tests were high; NPV ranged between 71.9 and 87.1 per cent with Inbios-IgG-ELISA scoring highest. Interpretation & conclusions: Our results show that IgM detection by the current, most sensitive ELISAs cannot replace molecular diagnosis, but may aid as a supplement test. The available IgG tests are suitable for serosurveys for the assessment of previous virus exposure.","Kulkarni, Ruta; Shrivastava, Shubham; Patil, Harshad P; Kore, Pravin; Rane, Prajakta; Palkar, Sonali; Lalwani, Sanjay; Mishra, Akhilesh Chandra; Arankalle, Vidya A",Indian journal of medical research,456,1

Our IRB-approved observational study included consecutive 241 adult patients (> 18 years; 105 females; 136 males) with RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent non-contrast chest CT at one of the two tertiary care hospitals (site A: Massachusetts General Hospital, USA; site B: Firoozgar Hospital Iran). We recorded patient age, gender, comorbid conditions, laboratory values, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and final outcome (recovery or death). Two thoracic radiologists reviewed all chest CTs to record type, extent of pulmonary opacities based on the percentage of lobe involved, and severity of respiratory motion artifacts. Thin-section CT images were processed with the prototype (Siemens Healthineers) to obtain quantitative features including lung volumes, volume and percentage of all-type and high-attenuation opacities (&#8805; -200 HU), and mean HU and standard deviation of opacities within a given lung region. These values are estimated for the total combined lung volume, and separately for each lung and each lung lobe. Multivariable analyses of variance (MANOVA) and multiple logistic regression were performed for data analyses. About 26% of chest CTs (62/241) had moderate to severe motion artifacts. There were no significant differences in the AUCs of quantitative features for predicting disease severity with and without motion artifacts (AUC 0.94-0.97) as well as for predicting patient outcome (AUC 0.7-0.77) (p > 0.5). Combination of the volume of all-attenuation opacities and the percentage of high-attenuation opacities (AUC 0.76-0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.82) had higher AUC for predicting ICU admission than the subjective severity scores (AUC 0.69-0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.81). Despite a high frequency of motion artifacts, quantitative features of pulmonary opacities from chest CT can help differentiate patients with favorable and adverse outcomes.","Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Bezerra Cavalcanti Rockenbach, Marcio Aloisio; Ebrahimian, Shadi; Doda Khera, Ruhani; Bizzo, Bernardo C; Buch, Varun; Babaei, Rosa; Karimi Mobin, Hadi; Mohseni, Iman; Mitschke, Matthias; Zimmermann, Mathis; Durlak, Felix; Rauch, Franziska; Digumarthy, Subba R; Kalra, Mannudeep K",J. digit. imaging,456,21

The insidious onset of type 2 diabetes delays diagnosis and increases morbidity2. Given the multifactorial vascular effects of diabetes, we hypothesized that smartphone-based photoplethysmography could provide a widely accessible digital biomarker for diabetes. Here we developed a deep neural network (DNN) to detect prevalent diabetes using smartphone-based photoplethysmography from an initial cohort of 53,870 individuals (the 'primary cohort'), which we then validated in a separate cohort of 7,806 individuals (the 'contemporary cohort') and a cohort of 181 prospectively enrolled individuals from three clinics (the 'clinic cohort'). The DNN achieved an area under the curve for prevalent diabetes of 0.766 in the primary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.750-0.782; sensitivity 75%, specificity 65%) and 0.740 in the contemporary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.723-0.758; sensitivity 81%, specificity 54%). When the output of the DNN, called the DNN score, was included in a regression analysis alongside age, gender, race/ethnicity and body mass index, the area under the curve was 0.830 and the DNN score remained independently predictive of diabetes. The performance of the DNN in the clinic cohort was similar to that in other validation datasets. There was a significant and positive association between the continuous DNN score and hemoglobin A1c (P &#8804; 0.001) among those with hemoglobin A1c data. These findings demonstrate that smartphone-based photoplethysmography provides a readily attainable, non-invasive digital biomarker of prevalent diabetes.","Avram, Robert; Olgin, Jeffrey E; Kuhar, Peter; Hughes, J Weston; Marcus, Gregory M; Pletcher, Mark J; Aschbacher, Kirstin; Tison, Geoffrey H",Nat. med,456,5

Studies suggest that there are many differences between men and women in the immune response to CoV-19 infection and inflammatory diseases. Women, compared to men, are less susceptible to viral infections based on a different innate immunity, steroid hormones and factors related to sex chromosomes. The presence of two X chromosomes in women emphasize the immune system even if one is inactive. The immune regulatory genes encoded by X chromosome in female gender causes lower viral load levels, and less inflammation than in man, while CD4+ T cells are higher with better immune response. In addition, women generally produce higher levels of antibodies which remain in the circulation longer. The levels of activation of the immune cells are higher in women than in men, and it is correlated with the trigger of TLR7 and the production of IFN. TLR7 is higher in women than in men and its biallelic expression leads to higher immune responses and increases the resistance to viral infections. TLR7 is expressed in innate immune cells which recognizes single strand RNA virus by promoting the production of antibodies against the virus and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-1 family members. Moreover, in women the production of inflammatory IL-6 after viral infection is lower than in males and is often correlated with a better longevity. In addition, on the X chromosome there are loci that code for the genes involved in the regulation of immune cells such as FOXP3, and transcription factor for Treg involved in virus pathogenesis. The X chromosome influences the immune system by acting on many other proteins, including TLR8, CD40L and CXCR3 which can be over-expressed in women, and influence the response to viral infections and vaccinations. However, the biallelic expression of the X-linked genes can promote harmful autoimmune and inflammatory responses. Cardiovascular diseases are more frequent in males and subjects without cardiovascular dysfunctions infected by CoV-19 have a better prognosis, but these effects are still under study. It is hoped that certain drugs, such as CoV-19 receptor blockers, anti-inflammatories (against rheumatic diseases), monoclonal antibodies, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6, the remdesevir drug (analogue adenosine, effective against ebola), hydroxychloroquine (for the treatment of malaria) and vaccines, will open up new strategies and new therapeutic ways to combat this terrible virus.","Conti, P; Younes, A",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,456,30

However, the outcomes of recovered patients have not been well defined. METHODS: This is a prospective observational follow-up study of survivors with COVID-19 from a designated tertiary center in Hefei, China. We examined chest computed tomography (CT) scanning, pulmonary function, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and 36 item Short Form General Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS: Among 81 enrolled patients, 62 (77%) patients and 61 (75%) patients, respectively, completed 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. Abnormal CT findings were still present in 73% of patients at 1 month and 54% at 3 months, whereas chest CT scan scores improved progressively at 1-month (5.0 ± 5.1) and 3-month follow up (3.0 ± 4.5) compared with that during hospitalization (11 ± 6.8). Mild restrictive pulmonary impairment was detected in 11% and 10% of patients at 1-month and 3-month follow up, respectively. The 6MWD was 523 ± 77 m in male patients and 484 ± 58 m in female patients, which was significantly lower than in healthy controls (606 ± 68 m, 568 ± 78 m, p < 0.001). SF-36 scores were significantly impaired in the domains of role physical (RP), role emotional (RE), and social functioning (SF) compared with the normal age-matched population. RP was improved at 3-month compared with 1-month follow up in the 41-64 years group (p < 0.01). Multivariable analysis showed that older age (over 40 years) and steroid administration during hospitalization were independently associated with worse chest CT scores at 3-month follow up. CONCLUSIONS: At 3 months, chest CT abnormalities were present in one half of COVID-19 survivors and worse chest CT scores were independently associated with older age and steroid administration during hospitalization. Residual pulmonary function impairments were modest, whereas exercise capacity and SF-36 scores were significantly lower than the general population.

Multiple organizations have developed guidance, but to date, no comparative summary has emerged to understand differences in existing recommendations. METHODS: We developed and applied a comparative methodology to a convenience sample of recommendations available on The Transplantation Society website. Document types were classified according to characteristics such as type of organization (e.g. governing body or professional society) and geographic region. Recommendations were grouped according to content and summaries were posted on a public website. This process is ongoing and will be updated as new recommendations become available. RESULTS: 18 documents were extracted in the initial review. All documents were based on expert opinion, and none described a formal literature review or adherence with clinical guideline development processes. Recommendation categories included screening of potential donors, risk assessment of potential recipients, post-transplant risk, living/paired donation, protection of ODT professionals, and ethics/logistics. While many documents included similar recommendations, such as the need to screen and test patients who are potential donors, there was variation on some topics. Type of recommended laboratory testing varied with 64% recommending nasopharyngeal swabs, 43% oropharyngeal, and 24% bronchial aspirates. Updated results are available at https://cdtrp.ca/en/covid-19-international-recommendations-for-odt/ CONCLUSION:: The current state of COVID-19 ODT recommendations are limited to expert opinion. Substantial variation exists regarding recommendations, which are based on emerging, but currently low-quality evidence. This summary of existing recommendations will serve to inform priorities for evidence-based recommendations.","Weiss, Matthew J; Lalani, Jehan; Patriquin-Stoner, Chelsea; Dieudé, Mélanie; Hartell, David; Hornby, Laura; Shemie, Sam D; Wilson, Lindsay; Mah, Allison",Transplantation,456,16

To effect this, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 encode multiple IFN antagonists. In this study, we reported on the IFN antagonism of SARS-CoV-2 main protease NSP5. NSP5 proteins of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 counteracted Sendai virus-induced IFN production. NSP5 variants G15S and K90R commonly seen in circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 retained the IFN-antagonizing property. The suppressive effect of NSP5 on IFN-ß gene transcription induced by RIG-I, MAVS, TBK1 and IKKÏµ suggested that NSP5 likely acts at a step downstream of IRF3 phosphorylation in the cytoplasm. NSP5 did not influence steady-state expression or phosphorylation of IRF3, suggesting that IRF3, regardless of its phosphorylation state, might not be the substrate of NSP5 protease. However, nuclear translocation of phosphorylated IRF3 was severely compromised in NSP5-expressing cells. Taken together, our work revealed a new mechanism by which NSP5 proteins encoded by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 antagonize IFN production by retaining phosphorylated IRF3 in the cytoplasm. Our findings have implications in rational design and development of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.","Fung, Sin-Yee; Siu, Kam-Leung; Lin, Huayue; Yeung, Man Lung; Jin, Dong-Yan",Int J Biol Sci,456,10

The underlying basis of this association is likely complex in nature. The host-cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important for viral cell entry. It is unclear whether obesity alters expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in the lower respiratory tract. Here, we show that: 1) Ace2 expression is elevated in the lung and trachea of diet-induced obese male mice and reduced in the esophagus of obese female mice relative to lean controls; 2) Tmprss2 expression is increased in the trachea of obese male mice but reduced in the lung and elevated in the trachea of obese female mice relative to lean controls; 3) in chow-fed lean mice, females have higher expression of Ace2 in the lung and esophagus as well as higher Tmprss2 expression in the lung but lower expression in the trachea compared to males; and 4) in diet-induced obese mice, males have higher expression of Ace2 in the trachea and higher expression of Tmprss2 in the lung compared to females, whereas females have higher expression of Tmprss2 in the trachea relative to males. Our data indicate diet- and sex-dependent modulation of Ace2 and Tmprss2 expression in the lower respiratory tract and esophagus.

The patient showed mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, speech delay and mild dysmorphic features. In DECIPHER, we found six individuals carrying a ""pure"" overlapping microduplication.

However, according to estimates in different countries, agriculture has suffered less than other sectors such as construction, industry and tourism, so agricultural development can be a good option to compensate for the economic damage caused to other sectors. The quality of available water and soil resources for agricultural development is not only limited, but is also decreasing incrementally, so the use of saline and unconventional soil and water resources is inevitable. Biosaline agriculture or haloculture is a system in which highly saline water and soil resources are used sustainably for the economic production of agricultural crops. It seems that in the current situation of the world (with COVID-19's impact on agriculture on the one hand and the quantitative and qualitative decline of freshwater and soil on the other), haloculture with a re-reading of territorial capabilities has good potential to provide a part of human food supply. In this review article, the potential of haloculture to offset the adverse impacts of the pandemic is analyzed from five perspectives: increasing the area under cultivation, using unconventional water, stabilizing dust centers, increasing the body's immune resistance, and reducing losses in agribusiness due to the coronavirus.

Indeed, more developed and wealthier areas became more isolated after government interventions and experienced a significantly lower burden of the pandemic.

Whereas the classical definition relies on the time from exposure to time of first symptoms, a more practical working definition is the time from exposure to time of first live virus excretion. For COVID-19, average incubation period times commonly span 5-7 days which are generally longer than for most typical other respiratory viruses. There is considerable variability reported however for the late right-hand statistical distribution. A small but yet epidemiologically important subset of patients may have the late end of the incubation period extend beyond the 14 days that is frequently assumed. Conservative assumptions of the right tail end distribution favor safety, but pragmatic working modifications may be required to accommodate high rates of infection and/or healthcare worker exposures. Despite the advent of effective vaccines, further attention and study in these regards are warranted. It is predictable that vaccine application will be associated with continued confusion over protection and its longevity.

Meanwhile, 5'-untranslated region of SARS-CoV-2 has high CG content and is capable of forming an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to recruit host ribosome for translating its RNA. These features allow SARS-CoV-2 to reproduce efficiently in host cells, because less energy is consumed in disrupting the stem-loops formed by its genomic RNA. Notably, genomes of cellular organisms also have very low CG abundance, suggesting that mutating C/G into A/T occurs universally in all life forms. Moreover, CG is the dinucleotide related to CpG island, mutational hotspot and single nucleotide polymorphism in cellular organisms.

However, there is little research on how individuals' coping strategies were related to changes in mental health over time. METHODS: The current study used data from the COVID-19 Social Study in the United Kingdom (N = 26,505) to explore whether coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-focused, avoidant, and socially-supportive) were associated with (i) better mental health as lockdown was introduced, and (ii) faster recovery over time. RESULTS: People with greater use of problem-focused, avoidant, and supportive coping displayed more mental health symptoms, while greater use of emotion-focused coping was associated with fewer mental health symptoms. Symptoms decreased over time for all coping strategies, but only socially-supportive coping was associated with a faster decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating a potential protective effect of social support on psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Problem-, avoidant- and emotion-focused coping strategies were not associated with faster improvements in mental health. Suggesting the adoption of one of these coping styles in itself is not necessarily a driver of improvements in mental health; rather, specific attributes of the behaviours expressed as part of this coping style appear to be important in and of themselves.","Fluharty, Meg; Bu, Feifei; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Soc Sci Med,456,16

Minority populations are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. This study evaluates the risk of QT prolongation and subsequent outcomes after administration of these medications in largely underrepresented minority COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted an observational study on hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the Montefiore Health System (Bronx, NY). We examined electrocardiograms (ECG) pre/post-medication initiation to evaluate QTc, HR, QRS duration, and presence of other arrhythmias. RESULTS: One hundred five patients (mean age 67 years; 44.8% F) were analyzed. The median time from the first dose of any treatment to post-medication ECG was 2 days (IQR: 1-3). QTc in men increased from baseline (440 vs 455 ms, p < 0.001), as well as in women (438 vs 463 ms, p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with QT prolongation increased significantly (14.3% vs 34.3%, p < 0.001) even when adjusted for electrolyte abnormalities. The number of patients whose QTc > 500 ms was significantly increased after treatment (16.2% vs. 4.8%, p < 0.01). Patients with either QTc > 500 ms or an increase of 60 ms had a higher frequency of death (47.6% vs. 22.6%, p = 0.02) with an odds ratio of 3.1 (95% CI: 1.1-8.7). Adjusting for race/ethnicity yielded no significant associations. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and/or azithromycin were associated with QTc prolongation but did not result in fatal arrhythmias. Our findings suggest that any harm is unlikely to outweigh potential benefits of treatment. Careful risk-benefit analyses for individual patients should guide the use of these medications. Randomized control trials are necessary to evaluate their efficacies.","Hsia, Brian C; Greige, Nicolas; Quiroz, Jose A; Khokhar, Ahmed S; Daily, Johanna; Di Biase, Luigi; Ferrick, Kevin J; Fisher, John D; Krumerman, Andrew",J Interv Card Electrophysiol,456,16

METHODS: We conducted an online survey in the Asan Medical Center and Ulsan University Hospital, South Korea. We extracted data of 824 nursing professionals who consented to participate, including demographic variables and the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9), PHQ-9, GAD-7, and Brief Resilience Scale scores. RESULTS: Resilience was negatively correlated with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (rho=-0.23), Generalized Anxiety Scale-7 items (GAD-7) (rho=-0.25), Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidem-ics-6 items (SAVE-6) (rho=-0.15), and Stress And anxiety to Viral Epidemics-3 items (SAVE-3) (rho=-0.13, all, p&lt;0.001). Logistic regression analysis adjusting age, marital status, and years of employment revealed that high level of general anxiety [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.31-1.50], work-related stress during viral epidemics (aOR=1.16, 95% CI=1.03-1.29), and a low level of resilience (aOR=0.91, 95% CI=0.85-0.97) were expecting variables for the depression of healthcare workers.

Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were defined as those confirmed by COVID-19 PCR in respiratory samples or clinically suspected cases from chest radiograph or CT. Severe COVID-19 was defined as those requiring supplementary oxygen due to saturations of 93% or less.ResultDuring January 2021, a total of 24 patients were referred to liaison psychiatry with concurrent COVID-19 infection. Out of these patients, 63% had a previous mental health diagnosis. The most common reason for referral was low mood (37.5%), followed by agitation (25%) and psychosis (25%). When considering first psychiatric presentations with concurrent COVID-19 infection, the most common presentation was psychosis (44%). The time course of psychosis was most frequently seen in the seven days prior to a positive swab. In one case a patient was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for psychosis two days prior to developing symptoms. Two of these patients were worked up for possible encephalitis including radiological imaging and lumbar puncture. For patients defined as having severe COVID-19, the most common referral was low mood. In those referred for low mood, 66% had a history of an affective disorder. In two cases low mood was complicated by an acute stress reaction to recent bereavement. For one patient this included the bereavement of two relatives to COVID-19. For patients admitted to intensive care and intubated for respiratory support the most common referrals were low mood and agitation. These factors we found a barrier to successful rehabilitation following periods of significant illness.ConclusionThe impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric presentations extends beyond the socio-economic factors precipitating crises across the nation. Our findings of acute psychiatric illness in the prodromal phase of the viral illness suggest a neuropsychiatric pathogenesis to COVID-19.","Nelmes, Elizabeth Ng Audrey",BJPsych Open,456,7

RECENT FINDINGS: Literature from the review period includes case series demonstrating the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in the conjunctival secretions of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The global ophthalmology community published reports outlining the enhanced infection control measures undertaken by different institutions around the world to mitigate transmission of the novel coronavirus. Telemedicine has been increasingly implemented in glaucoma practices to reduce in-office patient volume. New data regarding the efficacy and feasibility of tools for home monitoring of intraocular pressure, virtual visual field testing, and remote disc photography are reviewed. SUMMARY: COVID-19 has posed a global public health threat due to the severity of its contagion and associated morbidity and mortality. Glaucoma specialists have responded to the pandemic with innovative modifications to reduce viral transmission and optimize patient and staff safety in the office and operating room. The role of teleglaucoma has expanded and will continue to evolve as remote diagnostic devices undergo further refinement and validation.","Vinod, Kateki; Sidoti, Paul A",Curr Opin Ophthalmol,456,1

Molnupiravir increases the frequency of viral RNA mutations and impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models and in humans. Here, we establish the molecular mechanisms underlying molnupiravir-induced RNA mutagenesis by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Biochemical assays show that the RdRp uses the active form of molnupiravir, β-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC) triphosphate, as a substrate instead of cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate. When the RdRp uses the resulting RNA as a template, NHC directs incorporation of either G or A, leading to mutated RNA products. Structural analysis of RdRp–RNA complexes that contain mutagenesis products shows that NHC can form stable base pairs with either G or A in the RdRp active center, explaining how the polymerase escapes proofreading and synthesizes mutated RNA. This two-step mutagenesis mechanism probably applies to various viral polymerases and can explain the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of molnupiravir.","Kabinger, Florian; Stiller, Carina; Schmitzová, Jana; Dienemann, Christian; Kokic, Goran; Hillen, Hauke S.; Höbartner, Claudia; Cramer, Patrick",Nat Struct Mol Biol,456,17

Bidi Bidi, Uganda’s largest refugee settlement, hosts over 230,000 residents. There is a dearth of evidence-based sexual violence prevention and post-rape clinical care interventions in low- and middle-income humanitarian contexts tailored for refugee youth. Graphic medicine refers to juxtaposing images and narratives, often through using comics, to convey health promotion messaging. Comics can offer youth-friendly, low-cost, scalable approaches for sexual violence prevention and care. Yet there is limited empirical evaluation of comic interventions for sexual violence prevention and post-rape clinical care. This paper details the study design used to develop and pilot test a participatory comic intervention focused on sexual violence prevention through increasing bystander practices, reducing sexual violence stigma, and increasing post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) knowledge with youth aged 16–24 and healthcare providers in Bidi Bidi. Participants took part in a single-session peer-facilitated workshop that explored social, sexual, and psychological dimensions of sexual violence, bystander interventions, and post-rape clinical care. In the workshop, participants completed a participatory comic book based on narratives from qualitative data conducted with refugee youth sexual violence survivors. This pilot study employed a one-group pre-test/post-test design to assess feasibility outcomes and preliminary evidence of the intervention’s efficacy. Challenges included community lockdowns due to COVID-19 which resulted in study implementation delays, political instability, and attrition of participants during follow-up surveys. Lessons learned included the important role of youth facilitation in youth-centred interventions and the promise of participatory comics for youth and healthcare provider engagement for developing solutions and reducing stigma regarding SGBV. The Ngutulu Kagwero (Agents of change) project produced a contextually and age-tailored comic intervention that can be implemented in future fully powered randomized controlled trials to determine effectiveness in advancing sexual violence prevention and care with youth in humanitarian contexts.","Logie, Carmen H.; Okumu, Moses; Lukone, Simon Odong; Loutet, Miranda; McAlpine, Alyssa; Latif, Maya; Berry, Isha; Kisubi, Nelson; Mwima, Simon; Kyambadde, Peter; Neema, Stella; Small, Eusebius; Balyejjusa, Senkosi Moses; Musinguzi, Joshua",Glob Health Action,456,20

However, structure-based studies of how glycans affect protein structure, how they are synthesized, and how they regulate other biological processes remain challenging. Despite the abundant presence of glycans on proteins and the dense layers of glycans that surround most of our cells, structures containing glycans are underrepresented in the PDB. There are sound reasons for this, including difficulties in producing proteins with well-defined glycosylation and the tendency of mobile and heterogeneous glycans to inhibit crystallization. Nevertheless, the structures we do find in the PDB, even some of the earliest deposited structures, have had an impact on our understanding of function. I highlight a few examples in this review and point to some promises for the future.

Assessing virus-neutralizing activity of human serum to monitor population immunity and response to infection and vaccination is key to pandemic control. We developed a virus neutralization platform strategy that relies only on bioinformatic and genetic information of the virus of interest. The platform uses viral envelope glycoprotein cDNAs to set up an assay that mimics multicycle infection but is safe and, therefore, amenable to biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions for viruses that require BSL3 facilities (e.g., SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2). As a complement to this platform, we present a new cell-based immunofluorescent (CBI) assay that uses SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S)-expressing cells to accurately measure the neutralization potential of human sera and is readily adaptable to variants of concern. These methods should be useful additions to the tools for assessing antiviral immunity, whether acquired via natural infection or vaccines. IMPORTANCE Assays for rapid biosafety level 2 (BSL2) evaluation of neutralizing properties of antibodies acquired via natural infection or through vaccination is urgently needed.

High relative humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission when temperature is low, but tends to reduce transmission when temperature is high. Implementing classical control measures can dramatically slow the spread of the disease.

Colorimetric assays are a representative tool to simply identify the target molecules in specimens through color changes of an indicator (e.g., nanosized metallic particle, and dye molecules). The detection method is used to confirm the presence of biomarkers visually and measure absorbance of the colored compounds at a specific wavelength. In this study, we propose a colorimetric assay based on an extended form of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) self-assembly shielded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) under positive electrolyte (e.g., 0.1 M MgCl(2)) for detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This platform is able to verify the existence of viral molecules through a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) shift and color changes of AuNPs in the UV–vis wavelength range. We designed a pair of thiol-modified probes at either the 5′ end or 3′ end to organize complementary base pairs with upstream of the E protein gene (upE) and open reading frames (ORF) 1a on MERS-CoV. The dsDNA of the target and probes forms a disulfide-induced long self-assembled complex, which protects AuNPs from salt-induced aggregation and transition of optical properties. This colorimetric assay could discriminate down to 1 pmol/μL of 30 bp MERS-CoV and further be adapted for convenient on-site detection of other infectious diseases, especially in resource-limited settings.","Kim, Hanbi; Park, Minseon; Hwang, Joonki; Kim, Jin Hwa; Chung, Doo-Ryeon; Lee, Kyu-sung; Kang, Minhee",ACS Sens,456,24

Our notion of the “racialization of privacy” refers to the phenomenon that family privacy, including the freedom to create a family uninhibited by law, pressure, and custom, is delimited by race. Building upon racial formation theory, this article examines three examples: the Native American boarding school system (1870s to 1970s), eugenic laws and practices (early/mid 1900s), and contemporary deportation. Analysis reveals that state-sponsored limitations on family privacy is a racial project that shapes the racial state. Performing an ideological genealogy with our cases, this article makes three contributions: it illustrates how the state leverages policies affecting families to define national belonging; it reveals how access to family privacy is patterned by race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexuality, and national origin; and it distills how Whiteness and a national racial hierarchy are socially constructed and maintained over time. With the racialization of privacy, we identify how the state seeks to reproduce institutionalized White supremacy and the effects this has on families.

Both GP5 and M feature a short ectodomain, three transmembrane regions, and a long cytoplasmic tail, which contains three and two conserved cysteines, respectively, in close proximity to the transmembrane span. We report here that GP5 and M of PRRSV-1 and -2 strains are palmitoylated at the cysteines, regardless of whether the proteins are expressed individually or in PRRSV-infected cells. To completely prevent S-acylation, all cysteines in GP5 and M have to be exchanged. If individual cysteines in GP5 or M were substituted, palmitoylation was reduced, and some cysteines proved more important for efficient palmitoylation than others. Neither infectious virus nor genome-containing particles could be rescued if all three cysteines present in GP5 or both present in M were replaced in a PRRSV-2 strain, indicating that acylation is essential for virus growth. Viruses lacking one or two acylation sites in M or GP5 could be rescued but grew to significantly lower titers. GP5 and M lacking acylation sites form dimers and GP5 acquires Endo-H resistant carbohydrates in the Golgi apparatus suggesting that trafficking of the membrane proteins to budding sites is not disturbed. Likewise, GP5 lacking two acylation sites is efficiently incorporated into virus particles and these viruses exhibit no reduction in cell entry. We speculate that multiple fatty acids attached to GP5 and M in the endoplasmic reticulum are required for clustering of GP5/M dimers at Golgi membranes and constitute an essential prerequisite for virus assembly.","Zhang, Minze; Han, Xiaoliang; Osterrieder, Klaus; Veit, Michael",PLoS Pathog,456,26

What do we know?,10.800371,3.3181129,2021-02-09,"BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients are at risk of severe COVID-19. We managed COVID-19 haemodialysis outpatients in dedicated satellite dialysis units. This provided rare opportunity to study early disease progress in community-based patients. We aimed to (1) understand COVID-19 progression, (2) identify markers of future clinical severity and (3) assess associations between dialysis management strategies and COVID-19 clinical outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of all outpatients managed at a COVID-19 haemodialysis unit. We analysed data recorded as part of providing COVID-19 clinical care. We analysed associations between features at diagnosis and the first 3 consecutive haemodialysis sessions in patients who required future hospital admission, and those who had died at 28 days. RESULTS: Isolated outpatient haemodialysis was provided to 106 patients over 8 weeks. No patients received antiviral medication or hydroxychloroquine. 21 patients (20%) were admitted at COVID-19 diagnosis. 29 of 85 patients (34%) were admitted after initial outpatient management. 16 patients (15%) died. By multivariate analysis, non-active transplant list status, use of institutional transport, and increased white cell count associated with future hospitalisation and increased age associated with death. Oxygen saturations progressively decreased over the first 3 dialysis sessions in the cohorts who progressed to future hospital admission or death. Mean ultrafiltration volume of the first three haemodialysis sessions was reduced in the same cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient haemodialysis in patients with COVID-19 is safe for patients and staff. Features at the first 3 dialysis sessions can identify individuals at risk of future hospitalisation and death from COVID-19.","Medjeral-Thomas, Nicholas R.; Thomson, Tina; Ashby, Damien; Muthusamy, Anand; Nevin, Margaret; Duncan, Neill; Loucaidou, Marina",Kidney Int Rep,456,24

However, because there are often additional procedural protections to ensure that a ballot cast in person counts, voting by mail can also jeopardize people’s ability to cast a recorded vote. An experiment carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates both forces. Philadelphia officials randomly sent 46,960 Philadelphia registrants postcards encouraging them to apply to vote by mail in the lead-up to the June 2020 primary election. While the intervention increased the likelihood a registrant cast a mail ballot by 0.4 percentage points (P = 0.017)—or 3%—many of these additional mail ballots counted only because a last-minute policy intervention allowed most mail ballots postmarked by Election Day to count.","Hopkins, Daniel J.; Meredith, Marc; Chainani, Anjali; Olin, Nathaniel; Tse, Tiffany",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,456,17

Cependant, dans ces études, les patients étaient sélectionnés et évalués après diagnostic, sans groupe contrôle, et les troubles olfactifs étaient rapportés sans évaluation clinique. Dans cette étude nous avons évalué la valeur diagnostique de l’anosmie rapportée et de l’anosmie objectivée par un test olfactif standardisé avant prélèvement dans un centre de dépistage du SARS-CoV-2. Matériels et méthodes Étude diagnostique proposée de façon consécutive à tout adulte se présentant pour un prélèvement diagnostique par RT-PCR nasopharyngé au centre de dépistage ambulatoire du SARS-CoV-2 du CHU entre le 23 mars et le 22 avril 2020. Les critères de non-inclusion étaient un antécédent de troubles olfactifs, une indication d’hospitalisation, une barrière de la langue, des troubles cognitifs, et une grossesse ou un allaitement en cours. Les personnes répondaient à un questionnaire syndromique, puis réalisaient un examen olfactif standardisé à l’aide de trois bandelettes imprégnées de 5 microlitres d’huiles essentielles (lavande, citronnelle et menthe poivrée). Un score basé sur la reconnaissance et l’intensité des odeurs variait de 0 (anosmie totale) à 6 (normosmie). Les personnes avec un score olfactif<4 étaient considérées anosmiques. Le prélèvement nasopharyngé était ensuite réalisé. Les valeurs de sensibilité et de spécificité de l’anosmie rapportée ou objectivée étaient calculées par rapport au diagnostic de COVID-19 confirmé par RT-PCR. Résultats L’étude a été proposée à 854 personnes ; 809 personnes ont été incluses, dont 754 soignants. L’âge moyen était de 42 ans (±13vans), et 596 (74 %) des personnes étaient des femmes. Cinquante-huit (7,2 %) personnes ont été testées positives pour le SARS-CoV-2. Trente-huit personnes rapportaient une anosmie (4,7 % ; 38/809), 38 personnes un score d’anosmie clinique<4, et 19 personnes les deux à la fois. La prévalence de l’anosmie rapportée ou objectivée par l’examen clinique était de 39,7 % (n =23/58) chez les cas de COVID-19 confirmées. Les valeurs de sensibilité de l’anosmie rapportée et clinique étaient de 0,31 [IC95 % : 0,20–0,45] et 0,34 [0,22–0,48], et de spécificité 0,97 [0,96–0,98] et 0,98 [0,96–0,99] respectivement. Les valeurs prédictives positives de l’anosmie rapportée et clinique étaient de 0,47 [0,31–0,64] et 0,53 [0,36–0,69] respectivement, et les valeurs prédictives négatives identiques de 0,95 [0,93–0,96]. Sur les 19 personnes ayant à la fois une anosmie rapportée et clinique, 18 avaient la COVID-19. Conclusion Dans cette population de patients dépistés en ambulatoire pour une COVID-19 asymptomatique ou modérée et chez qui l’anosmie a été recherchée avant tout test virologique de SARS-CoV-2, les prévalences de l’anosmie rapportée ou clinique étaient faibles avec des discordances fréquentes. L’anosmie est un signe peu sensible mais cependant très spécifique de la maladie. La présence d’anosmie selon les deux méthodes était associée à une forte probabilité de maladie COVID-19.","Villerabel, C.; Makinson, A.; Jaussent, A.; Picot, M.; Nègre-Pagès, L.; Morquin, D.; Reynes, J.; Le Moing, V.; Tuaillon, E.; Venail, F.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,456,21

In this cross-sectional study, we examined factors associated with different levels of psychological impact as a result of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. From April 1 to 30, 2020, we used a self-administered online questionnaire to collect data from 10,609 respondents. Using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on respondents, we categorized the levels of impact as normal, mild, moderate, or severe. Ordinal logistic regression was used to examine the associated factors. The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe psychological impact was 10.2%, 4.8%, and 45.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of reporting normal vs mild, moderate, or severe psychological impact were 5.9 times higher for people living in the Chittagong Division, 1.7 times higher for women with lower education levels, 3.0 times higher among those who were divorced or separated, 1.8 times higher for those working full time, and 2.4 times higher for those living in shared apartments. The odds of reporting a psychological impact were also higher among people who did not enforce protective measures inside the home, those in self-quarantine, those who did not wear face masks, and those who did not comply with World Health Organization precautionary measures. Increased psychological health risks due to COVID-19 were significantly higher among people who experienced chills, headache, cough, breathing difficulties, dizziness, and sore throat before data collection. Our results showed that 1 in 2 respondents experienced a significant psychological impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health researchers should consider these factors when targeting interventions that would have a protective effect on the individual's psychological health during a pandemic or future disease outbreak.","Abir, Tanvir; Osuagwu, Uchechukwu L; Kalimullah, Nazmul Ahsan; Yazdani, Dewan Muhammad Nur-A; Husain, Taha; Basak, Palash; Goson, Piwuna Christopher; Mamun, Abdullah Al; Permarupan, P Yukthamarani; Milton, Abul Hasnat; Rahman, Md Adnan; Rahman, Md Lutfar; Agho, Kingsley Emwinyore",Health security,456,1

The increase is particularly high in emergency departments in rural areas and in emergency departments with low pediatric volumes. These sites have been shown to be particularly less prepared for children with mental disorders. How the recent COVID-19 pandemic will affect the mental health of children is unknown, but it has brought new stressors, including family unemployment and food insecurity, while removing children from traditional resources they have relied on to cope with stress. This may further increase the number of children coming to emergency departments needing care for mental health disorders.

A qualitative exploration with university and college students,11.275948,3.525934,2021-04-16,"The response of the global food system to the Covid‐19 crisis demonstrated not just its capacity to prevent a health crisis turning into a food crisis, but also highlighted deep divisions around the manner in which food security and climate action interact. The global food system has genuine shortcomings which are part of a much broader, complex picture of trade‐offs between enhancing climate action and food production; all major agricultural countries and regions face area constraints in meeting growing demands from the expected increase in world population. Amongst all major global players it is only in the EU that agriculture has reduced its GHG emissions, and even there momentum seems to have been exhausted recently. However, per capita and per area emissions differ significantly, with the ‘old world’ having a higher level of agricultural intensity than the ‘new world’. These production changes saw Brazil, the US and the EU, in different sectors and to varying degrees, increase the volume of food surpluses, while Africa and Asia generally increased their deficits; the former in food grains and the latter in feed and livestock products. These facts clearly point to an uncomfortable reality – that globally, we need to produce more with less, and therefore both economic and environmental efficiency matter.","Haniotis, Tassos",Eurochoices,456,23
