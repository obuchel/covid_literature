33975,Design and Development of Digital Twins: a Case Study in Supply Chains,2020-06-06,"We propose to use a, recently introduced, efficient L1 distance minimization through mixed-integer linear programming for minimizing the number of valuations to be modified inside an incoherent probabilistic assessment. This is in line with one basic principle of optimal corrective explanation for decision makers. A shrewd use of constraints and of slack variables permit to steer the correction of incoherent assessments towards aimed directions, like e.g. the minimal number of changes. Such corrective explanations can be searched alone, as minimal changes, or jointly with the property of being also inside the L1 distance minimizers (in a bi-optimal point of view). The detection of such bi-optimal solutions can be performed efficiently by profiting from the geometric characterization of the whole set of L1 minimizers and from the properties of L1 topology.","Baioletti, Marco; Capotorti, Andrea",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274306/,768

35564,Anna Reynvaanprijzen digitaal uitgereikt,2020-06-16,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the risk of long-term cognitive impairment associated with delirium in acute neurologic injury patients. DESIGN: We analyzed a 10-year cohort of adult acute neurologic injury patients (stroke and traumatic brain injury) without preexisting mild cognitive impairment or dementia, utilizing administrative databases. Patients were followed for in-hospital delirium and mild cognitive impairment or dementia. We report incidence and adjusted hazard ratios for mild cognitive impairment or dementia associated with delirium. Subgroups analyzed include acute neurologic injury categories, dementia subtypes, repeated delirium exposure, and age strata. SETTING: We used state emergency department and state inpatient databases for New York, Florida, and California. All visits are included in the databases regardless of payer status. PATIENTS: We included adult patients with diagnosis of stroke and traumatic brain injury as acute neurologic injury. Patients with preexisting mild cognitive impairment or dementia were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 911,380 acute neurologic injury patients, 5.2% were diagnosed with delirium. Mild cognitive impairment or dementia incidence among delirium patients was approximately twice that of nondelirium patients. In adjusted models, risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia was higher among patients with delirium (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.58). Increased risk was observed across all subgroups including patients less than or equal to 55 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Identification, management, and prevention of in-hospital delirium could potentially improve long-term cognitive outcomes in acute neurologic injury patients.","Meeks, Jennifer R.; Bambhroliya, Arvind B.; Sheth, Sunil A.; Khan, Babar; Slooter, Arjen J.

Manuscript submission and peer reviewing data from journals may be indicators of productivity impacts among aquatic scientists. We tested four null hypotheses: the COVID-19 disruption has had no effect on (i) the number of submissions to journals, or (ii) the geographic region in which the corresponding author is based, nor on the peer review process in terms of (iii) acceptance rate of requests to review and (iv) time in review. We used data provided by seven leading aquatic science journals covering the period 2009–2020 and representing 32 756 submissions. Submission differences varied between journals and were lower than expected in March 2020, but due to increases in subsequent months, there was no overall change in the number of submissions during the COVID-19 disruption months of February–June 2020. Geographic patterns in the number of submissions varied more by journal than by region, with both higher and lower numbers of submissions relative to expected numbers. Acceptance rates of requests to review were ∼2% lower overall; however, time in review declined by an average of 5 days relative to earlier years, showing that those scientists undertaking reviews did them more quickly during the COVID-19 disruption. Collectively, these results show that the overall productivity of the aquatic science community, as measured by publications and reviewing rates and times, has thus far only been slightly disrupted, although the impacts will vary greatly among individuals depending on life circumstances. The breadth and longevity of this disruption are unprecedented, making it important to continue to assess the relative impacts across a wide demographic range of aquatic scientists and to consider approaches to allow those differentially affected to recover to pre-COVID-19 levels of productivity.","Hobday, Alistair J; Browman, Howard I; Bograd, Steven J",ICES J Mar Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543572/,768

40715,De dimensies voor gezondheid verkennen,2020-10-20,"Roma teenagers are often excluded from participation opportunities, when they could be informing a wide range of law, policy and practice. CoE and EU recommendations make it clear that improvements in living conditions can only be achieved through active participation of Roma people. The 2018 Roma Civil Society Monitoring report reinforces that 'it is essential for Roma to be involved not only in narrowly defined 'Roma issues', but also in a wider range of topics and policies'. We address the question of what methods enable Roma children to become involved in influencing health policy and service design, focusing on the case of Bulgaria. A qualitative European survey (Feb - June 2020) in English, French, Spanish and Bulgarian identified professional perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 on children, with a focus on Roma families. Case studies of Roma children's experiences, and examples of their participation, were analysed of these case studies was conducted by the authors (combining sociological, public health and community perspectives). Accuracy of emergent findings were assessed through dialogue with survey participants. Preliminary results indicate that participatory practices that enable Roma children's participation in designing public health policy, services and responses are limited and pre-existing inequalities are deepening. However relevant isolated examples of inclusive participation were identified: information design, peer-administered questionnaires, arts-based activities, dialogue events, and campaigning in Bulgaria and beyond. Inclusive methods that enable Roma teenagers' engagement in health policy and service design are closely tied to methods used with other communities facing discrimination. However, significant structural barriers, related to economic inequalities and anti-gypsyism are additional barriers faced by some Roma children. International exchange of examples of such practices could inform future health promotion practice.","Larkins, C; Jovanovic, M; Milkova, R",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543575/,768

In this study, infection of HLFPV in Hibiscus rosa-sinensis was firstly confirmed for the first time by traditional electron microscopy, modern reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and RNA-seq methods in China (HLFPV-Ch). Sequence properties analyzing suggested that the full-length sequences (6,465 nt) of HLFPV-Ch had a high sequence identity and a similar genomic structure with other tobamoviruses. It includes a 5′-terminal untranslated region (UTR), followed by four open reading frames encoding for a 128.5-kDa replicase, a 186.5-kDa polymerase, a 31-kDa movement protein, 17.6-kDa coat protein, and the last a 3′-terminal UTR. Furthermore, HLFPV-Ch–derived virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs) ant its putative target genes, reported also for the first time, were identified and characterized from disease Hibiscus rosa-sinensis through sRNA-seq and Patmatch server to investigate the interaction in this pathogen systems. HLFPV-Ch–derived vsiRNAs demonstrated several general and specific characteristics. Gene Ontology classification revealed predicted target genes by vsiRNAs are involved in abroad range of cellular component, molecular function and biological processes.

The present study evidenced that co‐transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and telocytes (TCs) improved the severity of experimental lung tissue inflammation, edema, and injury, where TCs increased MSCs migration into the lung and the capacity of MSCs proliferation and movement. Of molecular mechanisms, Osteopontin‐dominant networks were active in MSCs and TCs, and might play supportive and nutrimental roles in the interaction between MSCs and TCs, especially activated TCs by lipopolysaccharide. The interaction between epidermal growth factor and its receptor from MSCs and TCs could play critical roles in communications between MSCs and TCs, responsible for MSCs proliferation and movement, especially after inflammatory activation. Our studies provide the evidence that TCs possess nutrimental and supportive roles in implanted MSCs, and co‐transplantation of MSCs and TCs can be a new alternative in the therapy of acute lung injury.","Zhang, Ding; Song, Dongli; Shi, Lin; Sun, Xiaoru; Zheng, Yonghua; Zeng, Yiming; Wang, Xiangdong",Clin Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7724099/,768
43233,De lessen van 2020,2020-12-22,"Neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) have multiple etiological factors, mainly genetic background, environmental conditions and immunological factors. The host immune responses play a pivotal role in various physiological and pathophysiological process. In NPDs, inflammatory immune responses have shown to be involved in diseases severity and treatment outcome. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are involved in various neurobiological pathways, such as GABAergic signaling and neurotransmitter synthesis. Infectious agents are among the major amplifier of inflammatory reactions, hence, have an indirect role in the pathogenesis of NPDs. As such, some infections directly affect the central nervous system (CNS) and alter the genes that involved in neurobiological pathways and NPDs. Interestingly, the most of infectious agents that involved in NPDs (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus) is latent (asymptomatic) and co-or-multiple infection of them are common. Nonetheless, the role of co-or-multiple infection in the pathogenesis of NPDs has not deeply investigated. Evidences indicate that co-or-multiple infection synergically augment the level of inflammatory reactions and have more severe outcomes than single infection. Hence, it is plausible that co-or-multiple infections can increase the risk and/or pathogenesis of NPDs. Further understanding about the role of co-or-multiple infections can offer new insights about the etiology, treatment and prevention of NPDs. Likewise, therapy based on anti-infective and anti-inflammatory agents could be a promising therapeutic option as an adjuvant for treatment of NPDs.","Abdoli, Amir; Taghipour, Ali; Pirestani, Majid; Mofazzal Jahromi, Mirza Ali; Roustazadeh, Abazar; Mir, Hamed; Ardakani, Hoda Mirzaian; Kenarkoohi, Azra; Falahi, Shahab; Karimi, Mahdi",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7725732/,768

51451,Column,2021-04-20,"One of the most significant phenomena among students at risk is low resilience. However, very little is known about teacher-related factors that affect students’ resilience. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to shed light on the relationships between teacher-level (affective and continuance organizational commitment, professional commitment, burnout, and job characteristics) and student-level variables (optimal educational climate, OEC: the needs of belonging, respect from others, autonomy, self-efficacy, and self-fulfillment), as OEC is viewed as a main source of students’ psychological resilience. A sample of 243 teachers and 1777 10th-grade students from 44 nationwide secondary schools in Israel participated in this study. The study included the entire population of this selected cohort. Using hierarchical linear model (HLM) coefficient models, we found two major factors that significantly predicted students’ OEC: teachers’ affective organizational commitment and teachers’ job characteristics. These findings indicate that schools may serve as a protective factor for students at risk, since schools can strengthen teachers’ affective abilities in order to ensure their students’ psychological resilience. These findings are especially important when working with students at risk, who tend to be exposed to a wider range of stress factors, both individually and academically. The importance of these relationships becomes even greater considering the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic, which has had a significant global impact on many aspects, including students’ relationships with schools and teachers.","Freund, Anat; Zriker, Amit; Sapir, Zehava",Eur J Psychol Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8019305/,768

This paper discusses the application of innovative technologies to crisis resolution (ResTech) and sets out its potential scope of application. ResTech is the application of technologies: i) to support the work of resolution authorities in developing resolution plans and in resolving financial firms; and ii) to allow financial firms to achieve regulatory compliance and better risk management in a more effective and automated manner. This paper also argues that the features and market dynamics of resolution differ from those of RegTech and SupTech: there is little market incentive for the private sector to foster innovation in the area of crisis resolution. The lack of private sector incentives to invest in R&D on how to resolve a firm’s crisis leaves the task to resolution authorities. In addition, resolution-technologies may support the identification of optimal liquidation strategy for small and medium-sized financial firms, by ensuring the maximisation of creditors’ proceeds out of the insolvency estate.","Loiacono, Giuseppe; Rulli, Edoardo",J Bank Regul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8019345/,768

54385,Isala: samen de beste zorg geven,2021-06-22,"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, concerns have been raised as to whether IBD patients under biologic therapy might be more susceptible to the disease and its complications. This study aimed to determine the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in a large cohort of IBD patients on biologic therapy in Lombardy, the hardest-hit Italian region by the pandemic. METHODS: This is an observational retrospective multicentre study collecting data about COVID-19 in IBD patients on biologic therapy in regular clinical follow-up at 11 IBD referral units in Lombardy, between February 20th and May 20th, 2020. The main endpoints were to assess the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and its outcome (hospitalization/death) among IBD patients on biologic therapy and to identify any variations among the different classes of biologic agents. Secondarily, we compared the results with the incidence of COVID-19 in the general population of Lombardy in the same period and the incidence of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in our study population compared with those of a second cohort of IBD patients undergoing non-biological therapies and coming from the same geographic area. RESULTS: Overall, 1816 IBD patients on biologic therapy were enrolled. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 3.9 per 1000 (7/1816) with a hospitalization rate of 57% and a case-fatality rate (CFR) of 29%. In our Cohort, the gut-selective therapy (Vedolizumab and Etrolizumab) was the only risk factor of developing symptomatic COVID-19 (OR 8.7, 95% CI 1.7–45.0, p = 0.01). Conversely, non-gut selective anti-cytokine agents were associated with a lower incidence of infection (OR 0.13, 95%CI 0.02–0.74) and development of symptoms (OR 0.60, 95%CI 0.37–0.98). Compared to the general population of Lombardy, a lower incidence of COVID-19 was observed (3.9 vs 8.5 per 1000 with a RR 0.45, 95%CI 0.21–0.95); conversely, in terms of hospitalization rate and CFR, the clinical outcome was not statistically different. Finally, compared to a second cohort of 565 IBD patients treated with non-biologic conventional therapies, a significantly lower risk of symptomatic disease was observed in patients on biologic agents (OR 0.3, 95%CI 0.2–0.4, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Compared to the general population, IBD patients on biologic therapy are not exposed to a higher risk of COVID-19; compared to gut-selective agents, cytokine blockers are associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic infection, supporting the decision of maintaining the ongoing treatment.","Ferretti, F; Monico, M C; Carvalhas Gabrielli, A M; Carmagnola, S; Bezzio, C; Saibeni, S; Bosani, M; Caprioli, F; Mazza, S; Casini, V; Cortelezzi, C; Parravicini, M; Cassinotti, A; Cosimo, P; Indriolo, A; Di Sabatino, A; Lenti, M V; Pastorelli, L; Conforti, F; Ricci, C; Sarzi-Puttini, P; Vecchi, M; Maconi, G; Ardizzone, S",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194715/,768

This cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on patients with IBD in Spain during lockdown and the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: A self-report questionnaire that integrated the Spanish version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale–21 items (DASS-21) and the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSS) was designed to gather sociodemographic data and information related to the effects of COVID-19 on the lives of IBD patients. Twelve IBD units invited their patients to answer the anonymous online survey via email or by using a QR code displayed at the unit. A link to the survey was also published on the GETECCU (Spanish IBD group) website and social media account. The survey was conducted between the 1(st) July and the 25(th) August 2020. RESULTS: Of the 693 survey participants with IBD, 67% were female, mean age 43 (12y SD). 61% had ulcerative colitis, 36% Crohn’s disease 3% indeterminate colitis. Only 15 participants were diagnosed with COVID-19: 3 of them required hospital admission and none required ICU admission.

54392,nieuws: Berichten uit de verpleegkundige praktijk,2021-06-22,"BACKGROUND: The availability of subcutaneous (SC) administration devices of biologics in addition to intravenous (IV) administration has influenced patients’ and clinicians’ preferences towards initiating or transitioning to SC administration particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst SC administration improves patient convenience and reduces demands on infusion centres we hypothesised that the reduction in healthcare contact associated with SC therapies may reduce the opportunities available for objective disease assessment. We aimed to compare the uptake of objective assessment of disease activity between patients receiving IV and SC biologic therapy. METHODS: Patients on maintenance infusion-based or subcutaneous biologic therapy for IBD between 09/2020 and 02/2021 were identified from a prospectively maintained database at an Australian tertiary IBD centre. Patients scheduled for review in IBD clinic for a prescription of maintenance biologic therapy during the follow-up period were included. Clinic records were reviewed to determine whether patients had undergone objective disease assessment including: biochemical investigation (C-Reactive protein) and Faecal Calprotectin (FCP) within the preceding 8 weeks and/or endoscopic/imaging assessment within the preceding 6 months of clinic review. Frequency of objective disease assessment was compared between patients who received IV versus SC maintenance biologic therapy. RESULTS: A total of 307 patients were included: IV maintenance n=195 (Infliximab n=135; Vedolizumab n= 60) and SC maintenance n=112 (Adalimumab n=54; Ustekinumab n=54; Golimumab n=4). Patients who received IV biologics were more likely than the SC cohort to have had biochemical assessment in the form of CRP (90% vs 72%, p<0.001) and FCP (54% vs 46%, p=0.16). Patients in the SC biologic cohort were more likely not to have had investigations completed prior to their clinical review (20% versus 4%, p<0.001). There was no difference in the overall rates of complete objective disease assessment (CRP/FCP and endoscopy/imaging) between the IV and SC cohort (28% vs 30% (p=0.74). CONCLUSION: Patients on subcutaneous biologic therapies in our cohort were less likely to have had objective disease monitoring than those receiving intravenous biologics prior to scheduled IBD clinic review. Route of of biologic administration may influence rates of uptake of objective disease activity assessment. Tools that safeguard against the disparity of monitoring uptake, including messaging prompts and patient-centric mobile applications may help standardise the approach to objective disease assessment independent of the route of biologic administration.","Hilley, P; Li Wai Suen, C; Srinivasan, A; Choy, M C; De Cruz, P",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194782/,768

Further research is needed to help answer the questions: do IBD patients have an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2? Do IBD patients have more severe COVID-19 outcomes? Does IBD therapy increase the risk of infection? Do any IBD treatments protect against COVID-19? OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of immunosuppressors, genetically engineered biologics, and janus kinase blockers on the level of SARS-CoV-2 class G immunoglobulins in IBD patients who underwent COVID-19. . METHODS: The level of SARS-CoV-2 class G immunoglobulins was analyzed in 66 patients with IBD after COVID-19 infection. Male 28 (42.4%) of women 38 (57.6 per cent). The median age was 39±4.2 years. The duration of the anamnesis ranged from 1 to 8 years (Iu 4 years).

RESULTS: A 98% decrease in scheduled surgeries, an 84% decrease in healthcare burden from the pediatric emergency department, a 55.24% decrease in urgent surgeries, an 82% decrease in outpatient activity at external consultations, and a 94% decrease in inter-hospital referrals, along with a 66% increase in urgent pathology severity, were found.

56711,Crisis als katalysator,2021-08-24,"Major epidemics of the last two decades (SARS, H1N1, MERS, Ebola, and Zika) have been followed by increases in inequality [Furceri et al. (2020), COVID Economics, 12, 138–157]. In this article, we show that the extent of fiscal consolidation in the years following the onset of these pandemics has played an important role in determining the extent of the increase in inequality. Episodes marked by extreme austerity—measured using either the government’s fiscal balance, health expenditures, or redistribution—have been associated with an increase in the Gini measure of inequality three times as large as in episodes where fiscal policy has been more supportive. We survey the evidence thus far on the distributional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which suggests that inequality is likely to increase in the absence of strong policy actions. We review the case made by many observers [IMF (2020), Fiscal Monitor; Stiglitz (2020), Finance & Development, Fall 2020; Sandbu (2020b), Financial Times, 26 November 2020)] that fiscal support should not be withdrawn prematurely despite understandable concerns about high public debt-to-GDP ratios.","Furceri, Davide; Loungani, Prakash; Ostry, Jonathan D; Pizzuto, Pietro",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8344863/,768
