766,766,766,Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN Polymorphisms Associated with Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis Infection,17.027643,9.822909,2012-02-27,"The recognition of pathogen-derived structures by C-type lectins and the chemotactic activity mediated by the CCL2/CCR2 axis are critical steps in determining the host immune response to fungi. The present study was designed to investigate whether the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within DC-SIGN, Dectin-1, Dectin-2, CCL2 and CCR2 genes influence the risk of developing Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA). Twenty-seven SNPs were selected using a hybrid functional/tagging approach and genotyped in 182 haematological patients, fifty-seven of them diagnosed with proven or probable IPA according to the 2008 EORTC/MSG criteria. Association analysis revealed that carriers of the Dectin-1 (rs3901533 T/T) and Dectin-1 (rs7309123 G/G) genotypes and DC-SIGN (rs4804800 G), DC-SIGN (rs11465384 T), DC-SIGN (7248637 A) and DC-SIGN (7252229 C) alleles had a significantly increased risk of IPA infection (OR = 5.59 95%CI 1.37–22.77; OR = 4.91 95%CI 1.52–15.89; OR = 2.75 95%CI 1.27–5.95; OR = 2.70 95%CI 1.24–5.90; OR = 2.39 95%CI 1.09–5.22 and OR = 2.05 95%CI 1.00–4.22, respectively). There was also a significantly increased frequency of galactomannan positivity among patients carrying the Dectin-1 (rs3901533_T) allele and Dectin-1 (rs7309123_G/G) genotype. In addition, healthy individuals with this latter genotype showed a significantly decreased level of Dectin-1 mRNA expression compared to C-allele carriers, suggesting a role of the Dectin-1 (rs7309123) polymorphism in determining the levels of Dectin-1 and, consequently, the level of susceptibility to IPA infection. SNP-SNP interaction (epistasis) analysis revealed significant interactions models including SNPs in Dectin-1, Dectin-2, CCL2 and CCR2 genes, with synergistic genetic effects. Although these results need to be further validated in larger cohorts, they suggest that Dectin-1, DC-SIGN, Dectin-2, CCL2 and CCR2 genetic variants influence the risk of IPA infection and might be useful in developing a risk-adapted prophylaxis.","Sainz, Juan; Lupiáñez, Carmen Belén; Segura-Catena, Juana; Vazquez, Lourdes; Ríos, Rafael; Oyonarte, Salvador; Hemminki, Kari; Försti, Asta; Jurado, Manuel",PLoS One,234,1
1074,1074,1074,The relationship between preoperative creatinine clearance and outcomes for patients undergoing liver transplantation: a retrospective observational study,16.708128,9.60266,2013-02-14,"BACKGROUND: Renal failure with following continuous renal replacement therapy is a major clinical problem in liver transplant recipients, with reported incidences of 3% to 20%. Little is known about the significance of postoperative acute renal failure or acute-on-chronic renal failure to postoperative outcome in liver transplant recipients. METHODS: In this post hoc analysis we compared the mortality rates of 135 consecutive liver transplant recipients over 6 years in our center subject to their renal baseline conditions and postoperative RRT. We classified the patients into 4 groups, according to their preoperative calculated Cockcroft formula and the incidence of postoperative renal replacement therapy. Data then were analyzed in regard to mortality rates and in addition to pre- and peritransplant risk factors. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in ICU mortality (p=.008), hospital mortality (p=.002) and cumulative survival (p<.0001) between the groups. The highest mortality rate occurred in the group with RRT and normal baseline kidney function (20% ICU mortality, 26.6% hospital mortality and 50% cumulative 1-year mortality, respectively). The hazard ratio in this group was 9.6 (CI 3.2-28.6, p=.0001). CONCLUSION: This study shows that in liver transplant recipient’s acute renal failure with postoperative RRT is associated with mortality and the mortality rate is higher than in patients with acute-on-chronic renal failure and postoperative renal replacement therapy.","Wenger, Urs; Oberkofler, Christian E; Zimmermann, Manuel; Stehberger, Paul A; Scherrer, Marcel; Schuepbach, Reto A; Cottini, Silvia R; Steiger, Peter; Béchir, Markus",BMC Nephrol,234,1
4232,4232,4232,Heart rate variability is depressed in the early transitional period for newborns with complex congenital heart disease,17.142118,9.509287,2019-06-25,"PURPOSE: To compare early changes in autonomic nervous system (ANS) tone between newborns with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) and newborns without CHD. METHODS: We performed a case–control study of heart rate variability (HRV) in newborns with complex CHD [transposition of the great arteries (TGA) or hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)] and low-risk control newborns without CHD. Cases with CHD were admitted following birth to a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit and had archived continuous ECG data. Control infants were prospectively enrolled at birth. ECG data in cases and controls were analyzed for HRV in the time and frequency domains at 24 h of age. We analyzed the following HRV metrics: alpha short (α(s)), alpha long (α(L)), root mean square short and long (RMS(s) and RMS(L)), low-frequency (LF) power, normalized LF (nLF), high-frequency (HF) power, and normalized HF (nHF). We used ANOVA to compare HRV metrics between groups and to control for medication exposures. RESULTS: HRV data from 57 infants with CHD (TGA, n = 33 and HLHS, n = 24) and from 29 controls were analyzed. The HRV metrics α(S), RMS(L), LF, and nLF were significantly lower in infants with CHD than in the controls. Due to the effect of normalization, nHF was higher in CHD infants (P < 0.0001), although absolute HF was lower (P = 0.0461). After adjusting for medications, α(S) and nLF remained lower and nHF higher in newborns with CHD (P < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: Infants with complex CHD have depressed autonomic balance in the early postnatal period, which may complicate the fetal–neonatal transition.","Mulkey, Sarah B.; Govindan, Rathinaswamy; Metzler, Marina; Swisher, Christopher B.; Hitchings, Laura; Wang, Yunfei; Baker, Robin; Larry Maxwell, G.; Krishnan, Anita; du Plessis, Adre J.",Clin Auton Res,234,17
4277,4277,4277,Predictive risk factors for postoperative pneumonia after heart transplantation,16.67169,9.58338,2020-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a frequent complication in patients undergoing heart transplantation (HTx) that increases morbidity and mortality in this population. Nevertheless, the risk factors for postoperative pneumonia (POP) are still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive risk factors for POP in HTx recipients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, all patients undergoing HTx between January 2014 and December 2015 were included. All cases of POP occurring until hospital discharge were investigated. The study aimed to determine risk factors using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Data are expressed in Odds Ratio [95% CI]. P < 0.05 was necessary to reject the null hypothesis. RESULTS: A total of 175 patients were included without any patients being lost to follow-up, and 89 instances of POP were diagnosed in 59 (34%) patients. Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common pathogens. In the multivariate analysis, the risk factors were preoperative mechanical ventilation (OR 1.42 [1.12–1.80], P < 0.01) and perioperative blood transfusion (OR 1.42 [95% CI: 1.20–1.70], P < 0.01). POP significantly impacted mortality at 30 days (OR: 4 [1.3–12.4], P = 0.01) and 1 year (OR: 6.8 [2.5–8.4], P < 0.01) and was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, time to weaning from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and stay in an intensive care unit. Plasma exchanges and intravenous administration of immunoglobulins did not increase the risk of POP. CONCLUSION: After HTx, preoperative mechanical ventilation and blood transfusion were risk factors for POP and were associated with increased mortality. Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common pathogens of POP.","Vidal, Charles; Pasqualotto, Romain; James, Arthur; Dureau, Pauline; Rasata, Julie; Coutance, Guillaume; Varnous, Shaida; Leprince, Pascal; Amour, Julien; Bouglé, Adrien",BMC Anesthesiol,234,1
6402,6402,6402,Abstracts from the First International Conference on Heart Failure in Children and Young Adults,17.051943,9.690939,2004,"BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a nonmalignant disorder of immune regulation, with overproduction of cytokines and diminished immune surveillance. Symptoms are nonspecific and may affect multiple organs, including the central nervous system. Neuroimaging findings have been described in case reports and small series; body imaging findings have not been described extensively. OBJECTIVE: To summarize findings of the most frequently performed imaging studies of the brain, chest and abdomen in patients with HLH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of chest radiographs and CT, abdominal ultrasound and CT, brain CT and MRI, skeletal surveys, and autopsy data. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were diagnosed and treated for HLH at our institution over an 11-year period; 15 patients (60%) died. Common chest radiograph findings included alveolar-interstitial opacities with pleural effusions, often with rapid evolution and resolution. Hepatosplenomegaly, gallbladder wall thickening, hyperechoic kidneys and ascites were common abdominal findings, which resolved after therapy in some cases. Brain-imaging studies revealed nonspecific periventricular white-matter abnormalities, brain-volume loss and enlargement of extra-axial fluid spaces. Three infant cases, one with intracranial hemorrhage, one with multiple pathologic rib fractures and one with diaphyseal periosteal reaction involving multiple long bones on skeletal survey, raised suspicion of child abuse at presentation. Abuse was not substantiated in any case. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and radiologists should be aware of the radiographic manifestations of HLH, which are nonspecific and overlap with infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. Findings in the chest (similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome) and abdomen may progress rapidly and then regress with institution of appropriate anti-HLH therapy. CNS findings may be progressive. In some infants, initial imaging findings may mimic nonaccidental trauma.","Fitzgerald, Nancy E.; MacClain, Kenneth L.",Pediatr Radiol,234,1

The critical care of the liver transplant recipient has paralleled these improvements, largely thanks to input from multidisciplinary teams and institution-specific protocols guiding management and care. This article provides an overview of the approach to critical care of the postoperative adult liver transplant recipient outlining common issues faced by the intensivist. Approaches to extubation and hemodynamic assessment are described. The provision of appropriate immunosuppression, infection prophylaxis, and nutrition is addressed. To aid prompt diagnosis and treatment, intensivists must be aware of postoperative complications of bleeding, primary nonfunction, delayed graft function, vascular thromboses, biliary complications, rejection, and organ dysfunction.","Fernandez, Thomas M.

6952,6952,6952,Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Kinetics in Critically Ill Children with Sepsis,17.067783,9.723204,1994,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the Charlson Comorbidity Index-Grade (CCI-G) on predicting outcomes and overall survival after open and minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). METHODS: One hundred and forty-six patients who underwent esophagectomy between 1995 and 2011 for stage II and III cancer were selected and separated into open esophagectomy (Open) and MIE groups. Risk adjustment was performed using the CCI-G. The outcomes of interest were operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), lymph node harvest, length of hospital stay (LOS), major complications, 30-day mortality, and overall survival. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (44 %) underwent Open while 71 (49 %) had MIE. An additional (7 %) were converted and classified with MIE. There was no significant difference between MIE and Open in terms of operative time. MIE had less EBL (mean difference = 234 mL, p < 0.001), higher lymph node harvest (mean = 7.4 nodes, p < 0.001), and shorter LOS (median = 1.5 days, p = 0.02). Atrial arrhythmias were the most frequent complication, occurring in 33 % of patients in both the MIE and the Open group (p = 0.988). Thirty-day mortality was 2 % for MIE and 5 % for Open (p = 0.459). Five-year survival was 41 % for MIE and 33 % for Open (p = 0.513). Operative approach, age, gender, BMI, clinical stage, and neoadjuvant therapy did not have any significant effect on the outcomes or overall survival. CCI-G influenced outcomes with operative time, LOS, cardiovascular complication, and anastomotic leak rate, favoring CCI-G 0 compared to CCI-G 3. Overall survival was worse for CCI-G 1 in comparison with CCI-G 0 [hazard ratio (HR) 1.99, p = 0.027]. CONCLUSIONS: MIE is a safe alternative to open esophagectomy for the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer. The presence of comorbidities increased operative time, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications while worsening overall survival.","Dolan, James P.; Kaur, Taranjeet; Diggs, Brian S.; Luna, Renato A.; Schipper, Paul H.; Tieu, Brandon H.; Sheppard, Brett C.; Hunter, John G.",Surg Endosc,234,1

Theory predicts that as a disease transmission system undergoes a transition from stability at the disease-free equilibrium to sustained transmission, it will exhibit characteristic behaviours known as critical slowing down, referring to the speed at which fluctuations in the number of cases are dampened, for instance the extinction of a local transmission chain after infection from an imported case. These phenomena include increases in several summary statistics, including lag-1 autocorrelation, variance and the first difference of variance. Here, we report the first empirical test of this prediction during the resurgence of malaria in Kericho, Kenya. For 10 summary statistics, we measured the approach to criticality in a rolling window to quantify the size of effect and directions. Nine of the statistics increased as predicted and variance, the first difference of variance, autocovariance, lag-1 autocorrelation and decay time returned early warning signals of critical slowing down based on permutation tests. These results show that time series of disease incidence collected through ordinary surveillance activities may exhibit characteristic signatures prior to an outbreak, a phenomenon that may be quite general among infectious disease systems.","Harris, Mallory J.; Hay, Simon I.; Drake, John M.",Biol Lett,234,1

However, the relative importance of the other SDD components, enteral and protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis, versus other methods of infection prevention and versus other contextual exposures cannot be resolved within individual studies. METHODS: Seven candidate generalized structural equation models founded on COGO concepts were confronted with Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter bacteremia as well as ventilator-associated pneumonia data derived from > 200 infection prevention studies. The following group-level exposures were included in the models: use and mode of antibiotic prophylaxis, anti-septic and non-decontamination methods of infection prevention; proportion receiving mechanical ventilation; trauma ICU; mean length of ICU stay; and concurrency versus non-concurrency of topical antibiotic prophylaxis study control groups. RESULTS: In modeling Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter gut overgrowth as latent variables, anti-septic interventions had the strongest negative effect against Pseudomonas gut overgrowth but no intervention was significantly negative against Acinetobacter gut overgrowth. Strikingly, protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis and concurrency each have positive effects in the model, enteral antibiotic prophylaxis is neutral, and Acinetobacter bacteremia incidences are high within topical antibiotic prophylaxis studies, moreso with protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis exposure. Paradoxically, topical antibiotic prophylaxis (moreso with protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis) appears to provide the strongest summary prevention effects against overall bacteremia and overall VAP. CONCLUSIONS: Structural equation modeling of published Gram-negative bacillus infection data enables a test of the COGO concept. Paradoxically, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas bacteremia incidences are unusually high among studies of topical antibiotic prophylaxis.","Hurley, James C.",Crit Care,234,15

Conflicting data exist in elderly patients who underwent AVR plus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We sought to evaluate the early and long-term outcomes of combined AVR + CABG in patients older than 75 years of age. From June 1999 to June 2018, 402 patients ≥ 75 years who underwent iAVR (n = 200; 49.7%) or combined AVR plus CABG (n = 202; 50.3%) were retrospectively analysed. AVR + CABG patients were older than iAVR patients (78.5 ± 2.5 vs 77.6 ± 2.8 years; p < 0.0001), with greater co-morbidities and more urgent/emergency surgery. 30-day mortality was 6.5% in the AVR + CABG and 4.5% in the iAVR group (p = 0.38). Multivariate analysis identified EuroSCORE II [odd ratio (OR) 1.13] postoperative stroke (OR 12.53), postoperative low cardiac output syndrome (OR 8.72) and postoperative mechanical ventilation > 48 h (OR 8.92) as independent predictors of 30-day mortality; preoperative cerebrovascular events (OR 3.43), creatinine (OR 7.27) and extracorporeal circulation time (OR 1.01) were independent predictors of in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCE). Treatment was not an independent predictor of 30-day mortality and in-hospital MACCE. Survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 94.7 ± 1.6%, 72.6 ± 3.6% and 31.7 ± 4.8% for iAVR patients and 89.1 ± 2.3%, 73.9 ± 3.5% and 37.2 ± 4.8% for AVR + CABG subjects (p = 0.99). Using adjusted Cox regression model, creatinine [hazard ration (HR) 1.50; p = 0.018], COPD (HR 1.97; p = 0.003) and NYHA class (HR 1.39; p < 0.0001) were independent predictors of late mortality; the combined AVR + CABG was not associated with increased risk of late mortality (HR 0.83; p = 0.30). In patients aged ≥ 75 years, combined AVR + CABG was not associated with increased 30-day mortality, in-hospital MACCE and long-term mortality.

However, there has been a more limited evaluation of the impact of race on immediate perioperative outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare 30-day postoperative outcomes among different races. STUDY DESIGN: The 2016 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database was queried to identify patients aged ≥ 18 and body mass index ≥ 35 who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) with known information on race. We then evaluated the effect of five different races on four different 30-day outcomes. RESULTS: Of the total 106,932 patients (79.5% White, 19.3% African American (AA), 0.5% Asian, 0.4% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander), 30-day rates of postoperative complication, readmission, re-intervention, and reoperation were 6, 3.8, 1.3, and 1.2%, respectively. After controlling for other covariates in multivariate logistic regression and selecting White as reference, AA was the only race associated with a higher risk of postoperative complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.13; confidence interval [CI] 1.06–1.2) and readmissions (OR 1.47; CI 1.3–1.6). AA and American Indian or Alaska Native were also associated with higher re-interventions (OR 1.31; CI 1.15–1.51 and OR 2.11; CI 1.03–4.34).

Aim of present study is to check the anti-chikungunya activities of Zingiber officinale (Ginger) in the animal cell culture model. The medicinal plant extract was prepared from Z. officinale rhizome. Median tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50)) of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD) of Z. officinale extract was determined in Vero cell-line on the basis of cell viability followed by MTT assay. In vitro anti-chikungunya activity was performed in Vero cell-line with MNTD and half of MNTD of Z. officinale medicinal plant extract. The anti-viral effect of Z. officinale was studied by observing the cytopathic effects and cell viability measured by MTT assay. Maximum non-toxic dose of Z. officinale plant extract was found 62.5 μg/ml. During anti-chikungunya experimentation, cell viability increased to 51.05% and 35.10%, when Vero cells were pre-treated with MNTD and half of MNTD of Z. officinale extract respectively. Similarly, in co-treatment, when MNTD, half of MNTD of Z. officinale and Median tissue culture infective dose CHIKV were inoculated simultaneously, then the viability of Vero cell-line was increases by 52.90% and 49.02% respectively. The rhizome extracts of Z. officinale have high potential to treat CHIKV. Medicinal plants and their metabolites are most important sources of antimicrobial and can be utilized for the development of new drugs.

12166,12166,12166,Will the new decade bring home remote monitoring of heart failure patients?,16.911478,9.519737,2019-12-16,"Ebola virus (EBOV) entry requires internalization into host cells and extensive trafficking through the endolysosomal network in order to reach late endosomal/lysosomal compartments that contain triggering factors for viral membrane fusion. These triggering factors include low-pH-activated cellular cathepsin proteases, which cleave the EBOV glycoprotein (GP), exposing a domain which binds to the filoviral receptor, the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). Here, we report that trafficking of EBOV to NPC1 requires expression of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex as well as its regulator, UV radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG). Using an inducible clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, we demonstrated that depletion of HOPS subunits as well as UVRAG impairs entry by all pathogenic filoviruses. UVRAG depletion resulted in reduced delivery of EBOV virions to NPC1(+) cellular compartments. Furthermore, we show that deletion of a domain on UVRAG known to be required for interaction with the HOPS complex results in impaired EBOV entry. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that EBOV requires both expression of and coordination between the HOPS complex and UVRAG in order to mediate efficient viral entry. IMPORTANCE Ebola viruses (EBOV) and other filoviruses cause sporadic and unpredictable outbreaks of highly lethal diseases. The lack of FDA-approved therapeutics, particularly ones with panfiloviral specificity, highlights the need for continued research efforts to understand aspects of the viral life cycle that are common to all filoviruses. As such, viral entry is of particular interest, as all filoviruses must reach cellular compartments containing the viral receptor Niemann-Pick C1 to enter cells. Here, we present an inducible CRISPR/Cas9 method to rapidly and efficiently generate knockout cells in order to interrogate the roles of a broad range of host factors in viral entry. Using this approach, we showed that EBOV entry depends on both the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex in coordination with UV radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG). Importantly, we demonstrate that the HOPS complex and UVRAG are required by all pathogenic filoviruses, representing potential targets for panfiloviral therapeutics.","Bo, Yuxia; Qiu, Shirley; Mulloy, Rory P.; Côté, Marceline",J Virol,234,1

In this report, we investigated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) egress in a cell line from a child with Pompe disease, a glycogen storage disease caused by a defect in the enzyme required for glycogen digestion. In Pompe cells, both the late autophagy pathway and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) pathway are interrupted. We have postulated that intact autophagic flux is required for higher recoveries of VZV infectivity. To test that hypothesis, we infected Pompe cells and then assessed the VZV infectious cycle. We discovered that the infectious cycle in Pompe cells was remarkably different from that of either fibroblasts or melanoma cells. No large late endosomes filled with VZV particles were observed in Pompe cells; only individual viral particles in small vacuoles were seen. The distribution of the M6PR pathway (trans-Golgi network to late endosomes) was constrained in infected Pompe cells. When cells were analyzed with two different anti-M6PR antibodies, extensive colocalization of the major VZV glycoprotein gE (known to contain M6P residues) and the M6P receptor (M6PR) was documented in the viral highways at the surfaces of non-Pompe cells after maximum-intensity projection of confocal z-stacks, but neither gE nor the M6PR was seen in abundance at the surfaces of infected Pompe cells. Taken together, our results suggested that (i) Pompe cells lack a VZV trafficking pathway within M6PR-positive large endosomes and (ii) most infectious VZV particles in conventional cell substrates are transported via large M6PR-positive vacuoles without degradative xenophagy to the plasma membrane. IMPORTANCE The long-term goal of this research has been to determine why VZV, when grown in cultured cells, invariably is more cell associated and has a lower titer than other alphaherpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) or pseudorabies virus (PRV). Data from both HSV1 and PRV laboratories have identified a Rab6 secretory pathway for the transport of single enveloped viral particles from the trans-Golgi network within small vacuoles to the plasma membrane. In contrast, after secondary envelopment in fibroblasts or melanoma cells, multiple infectious VZV particles accumulated within large M6PR-positive late endosomes that were not degraded en route to the plasma membrane. We propose that this M6PR pathway is most utilized in VZV infection and least utilized in HSV1 infection, with PRV’s usage being closer to HSV1’s usage. Supportive data from other VZV, PRV, and HSV1 laboratories about evidence for two egress pathways are included.","Girsch, James H.; Jackson, Wallen; Carpenter, John E.; Moninger, Thomas O.; Jarosinski, Keith W.; Grose, Charles",J Virol,234,1

However, a temporary centrifugal pump-based Bi-VAD might have clinical advantages versus ECMO or implantable VADs. From January 2000 to July 2018, we retrospectively reviewed 36 pediatric patients who required mechanical circulatory support (MCS) for acute heart failure. Cases with postoperative MCS were excluded. Since 2016, we have tried to immediately add a right VAD rather than ECMO, when the patients begin to present features of right heart failure after left VAD support started in cases that the patients’ respiratory function did not require an oxygenator. Original diagnoses included dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 18), myocarditis (n = 11), and others (n = 7). Eleven patients were supported by Bi-VAD, and 25 patients were supported by ECMO; of these. Four patients were successfully weaned from VAD, and 10 patients were weaned from ECMO. Eleven patients underwent heart transplantation. Overall, we have 15 (41.7%) early mortalities. There were no significant differences in early mortality, morbidity, and weaning rate between the Bi-VAD group and the ECMO group.

The pathophysiology of SCD is characterized by chronic inflammatory processes, triggered by hemolytic and vaso-occlusive events, which lead to the va - ried complications, organ damage and elevated mortality seen in individuals with the disease. In association with activation of the endothelium and leukocytes, hemostatic alterations and thrombotic events are welldocumented in SCD. Here, we discuss the role of inflammatory pathways in modulating coagulation and inducing platelet activation in SCD, due to tissue factor activation, adhesion molecule expression, inflammatory mediator production and the induction of innate immune responses, among other mechanisms. Thromboinflammatory pathways may play a significant role in some of the major complications of SCD, such as stroke, venous thromboembolism and possibly acute chest syndrome, besides exacerbating the chronic inflammation and cellular interactions that trigger vaso-occlusion, ischemia-reperfusion processes, and eventually organ damage.","Conran, Nicola; De Paula, Erich V.",Haematologica,234,1

This psychological syndrome leads to serious health consequences, and jeopardises patient care. Despite this, there is no data pertaining to these potential adverse mental health outcomes in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, SA, where it is overshadowed by the fight against priorities such as HIV and AIDS/TB. This study therefore aimed to establish the nature and extent of burnout, anxiety and depressive symptoms and their associations among public sector MDs in KZN. A cross sectional study was conducted among MDs at five KZN public sector training hospitals to investigate their associations with practitioner (individual) and organisational factors using the Maslach Burnout Inventory–Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Of the 150 participants, 88 (59.0%) screened positive for burnout, as indicated by high scores on the emotional exhaustion or depersonalisation subscales in the MBI-HSS. One fifth screened positive for anxiety (n = 30) and depressive symptoms (n = 32). Burnout was significantly associated with individual factors of anxiety (p<0.01) and depressive (p<0.01) symptoms based on adjusted logistic regression models. Organisational factors, such as lack of clinical supervisor support (p<0.01) and hospital resources (p<0.01), were significantly associated with burnout based on the bivariate analyses. Burnout, anxiety and depressive symptoms in MDs are highly prevalent and intertwined in resource constrained KZN public training hospitals. Addressing burnout at individual and organisational levels is important to mitigate its adverse effects.","Naidoo, Thejini; Tomita, Andrew; Paruk, Saeeda",PLoS One,234,13

Specifically, for the first time, rPET water bottle flake is processed using only an open source toolchain with Fused Particle Fabrication (FPF) or Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF) processing rather than first converting it to filament. In this study, first the impact of granulation, sifting, and heating (and their sequential combination) is quantified on the shape and size distribution of the rPET flakes. Then 3D printing tests were performed on the rPET flake with two different feed systems: an external feeder and feed tube augmented with a motorized auger screw, and an extruder-mounted hopper that enables direct 3D printing. Two Gigabot X machines were used, each with the different feed systems, and one without and the latter with extended part cooling. 3D print settings were optimized based on thermal characterization, and both systems were shown to 3D print rPET directly from shredded water bottles. Mechanical testing showed the importance of isolating rPET from moisture and that geometry was important for uniform extrusion. The mechanical strength of 3D-printed parts with FPF and inconsistent flow is lower than optimized fused filament, but adequate for a wide range of applications. Future work is needed to improve consistency and enable water bottles to be used as a widespread DRAM feedstock.","Little, Helen A.; Tanikella, Nagendra G.; J.

This study was undertaken to investigate prevalence of G. anatis in 12 poultry flocks originating from Iranian provinces with leading chicken production and to determine genetic diversity, antimicrobial resistance, and the presence of major antigens of the isolates investigated. Out of the 120 chicken tracheal samples collected and tested, 84 (70%) were positive for G. anatis. Genotyping by Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis and genome sequencing revealed a total of 24 pulsotypes for 71 strains (at a 87% similarity level) and seven genome clusters comprising 21 strains (97% similarity level), respectively. The combination of the two typing methods confirmed the presence of several genotypes originating from a common ancestor affecting poultry yet also suggested that identical clones were shared among chickens within farms and between different farms. The latter finding is to our knowledge the first example of clonal presence of G. anatis in epidemiologically unrelated farms. The 21 sequenced strains were characterized against a panel of commonly used antibiotics and showed lowered sensitivity to tetracycline (76.2%) and enrofloxacin (90.5%). The widespread presence of multiresistant G. anatis isolates calls for non-antibiotic prophylactics. Three major immunogen genes, gtxA, Gab_1309 and Gab_2312 were detected in the isolates indicating these antigens likely represent effective vaccine targets. A conserved sequence of the gtxA gene across a range of epidemiologically independent strains suggests the use of GtxA for future vaccine development purposes.","Allahghadry, Toloe; Ng, Duncan Y.

Among the child-level attributable factors are unhealthy self-care behaviours (poor oral hygiene and high sugary diet). In order to improve the children’s oral health, an improved programme called the ‘Senyuman Indah Milik Semua’ Programme (SIMSP) or ‘Beautiful Smile for All’ programme is introduced. In this programme, a triad of dental hygienist-teacher-parent works together to improve children’s oral hygiene levels compared with the existing POHP that involves dental hygienists only. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of the SIMSP versus the existing POHP on oral hygiene levels of 5–6-year-old children in the Kampar district, Perak state, Malaysia. METHODS: This study is a pragmatic, cluster-randomised, parallel-group, matched pair, controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment. Randomisation is performed using a computer-generated table with a 1:1 allocation comparing the SIMSP and the POHP involving 28 preschools in the Kampar district, Perak, Malaysia. The intervention consists of preschool visits by a group of dental therapists, in-class oral health lessons and daily toothbrushing conducted by class teacher, child home toothbrushing supervised by parents, and infographic oral health messages to parents. The control consists of the existing POHP that involves preschool visits by a group of dental therapists only. The trial lasts for 6 months. Primary outcome variable is the mean plaque score change after 6 months. To determine the feasibility of the SIMSP, a process evaluation will be conducted using the perspectives of dental therapists, teachers, and parents on the appropriateness, effectiveness, facilitators, and barriers to the SIMSP implementation as well as an audit trail to assess the trial intervention. DISCUSSION: Cluster randomisation may lead to a random effect and cluster selection bias. These factors will be accounted for when analysing the data and interpreting the outcomes. The effectiveness of the SIMSP will be evaluated by comparing the results with those of the POHP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04339647.

This lack also reduces our understanding of the epidemiology associated with S. suis in the United States and thus affects the efficiency of control and prevention strategies. In this study we applied whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based approaches for the characterization of S. suis and identification of VAGs. RESULTS: Of 208 S. suis isolates classified as pathogenic, possibly opportunistic, and commensal pathotypes, the genotype based on the classical VAGs (epf, mrp, and sly encoding the extracellular protein factor, muramidase-release protein, and suilysin, respectively) was identified in 9% (epf+/mrp+/sly+) of the pathogenic pathotype. Using the chi-square test and LASSO regression model, the VAGs ofs (encoding the serum opacity factor) and srtF (encoding sortase F) were selected out of 71 published VAGs as having a significant association with pathotype, and both genes were found in 95% of the pathogenic pathotype. The ofs+/srtF+ genotype was also present in 74% of ‘pathogenic’ isolates from a separate validation set of isolates. Pan-genome clustering resulted in the differentiation of a group of isolates from five swine production companies into clusters corresponding to clonal complex (CC) and virulence-associated (VA) genotypes. The same CC-VA genotype patterns were identified in multiple production companies, suggesting a lack of association between production company, CC, or VA genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed ofs and srtF genes were stronger predictors for differentiating pathogenic and commensal S. suis isolates compared to the classical VAGs in two sets of U.S. isolates. Pan-genome analysis in combination with metadata (serotype, ST/CC, VA genotype) was illustrated to be a valuable subtyping tool to describe the genetic diversity of S. suis.

Most cases of IM are caused by the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) or Cytomegalovirus (CMV). However, it is difficult to diagnose IM only with subjective symptoms, and thus EBV and CMV are nearly indistinguishable in clinical practice. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old healthy Japanese woman had a 2-day history of high fever and consulted us. She had sex for the first time 6 months earlier. Her virus antibodies showed that she was infected with primary CMV. About 5 months later, she again experienced high fever and lymph node enlargement at the posterior cervical region. Her virus antibodies showed that she was infected with primary EBV at that time. CONCLUSION: Herein, we report a healthy adult Japanese woman with primary EBV infection relatively soon after primary CMV infection. It is very interesting to compare the symptoms and/or clinical data after EBV and CMV infection in the same patient within a short period of time. Our patient was diagnosed based only on subjective symptoms, physical examination and laboratory data, without tests of such virus-related antibodies. Therefore, clinicians should bear in mind that primary EBV infection and/or primary CMV infection is possible when patients have symptoms such as high fever, pharyngitis and lymphadenopathy, even in healthy adults.","Koyama, Katsumasa; Anno, Takatoshi; Urano, Takashi; Shigemoto, Ryo; Irie, Shintaro; Kawasaki, Fumiko; Kawanaka, Miwa; Kawamoto, Hirofumi; Kaneto, Hideaki; Tomoda, Koichi",J Med Case Rep,234,1

CL is commonly diagnosed by directly detecting the parasites or their DNA in tissue samples. New diagnostic methodologies target specific proteins (biomarkers) secreted by the parasite during the infection process. However, specific bioreceptors for the in vivo or in vitro detection of these novel biomarkers are rather limited in terms of sensitivity and specificity. For this reason, we here introduce three novel peptides as bioreceptors for the highly sensitive and selective identification of acid phosphatase (sAP) and proteophosphoglycan (PPG), which have a crucial role in leishmaniasis infection. These high-affinity peptides have been designed from the conservative domains of the lectin family, holding the ability to interact with the biological target and produce the same effect than the original protein. The synthetic peptides have been characterized and the affinity and kinetic constants for their interaction with the targets (sAP and PPG) have been determined by a surface plasmon resonance biosensor. Values obtained for K(D) are in the nanomolar range, which is comparable to high-affinity antibodies, with the additional advantage of a high biochemical stability and simpler production. Pep2854 exhibited a high affinity for sAP (K(D) = 1.48 nM) while Pep2856 had a good affinity for PPG (K(D) 1.76 nM). This study evidences that these peptidomimetics represent a novel alternative tool to the use of high molecular weight proteins for biorecognition in the diagnostic test and biosensor devices for CL.

However, its role in cancer development has not been clearly elucidated. In this study, expression levels of CYP2J2 in various cancer types were determined using the Oncomine, the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEIPA), DriverDBv3, UALCAN, and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) databases. The prognostic value of CYP2J2 for KIRC was analyzed using GEPIA, UALCAN, OSkirc, and DriverDBv3 databases. We evaluated the expression levels of CYP2J2 transcript, protein, and promoter methylation at different clinical characteristics in KIRC through the UALCAN database. Simultaneously, CYP2J2 network-related functions were evaluated using the GeneMANIA interactive tool while the biological processes involved in CYP2J2 and its interactive genes were investigated through Metascape and FunRich. Then, we used TIMER to determine the correlation between CYP2J2 expression levels and immune infiltration levels in KIRC. In KIRC, the CYP2J2 gene, RNA, and protein were found to be overexpressed. However, the methylation level of CYP2J2 promoter in KIRC was lower than in normal tissues. Surprisingly, elevated expression levels of CYP2J2 exhibited better prognostic outcomes in KIRC. Evaluation of protein-protein interaction networks and biological processes revealed that CYP2J2 was principally involved in immune responses, apoptosis, and other metabolic processes. Moreover, we found that the expression levels of CYP2J2 were positively correlated with infiltration levels of B cells, CD8 + T cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in KIRC. Therefore, we speculated that the overexpression of CYP2J2 prolonged the survival outcome of KIRC patients, which may be related to the change of tumor immune microenvironment. Moreover, all these new understandings of CYP2J2 may provide important value for the early diagnosis and new targeted drug therapy of KIRC.","Zou, Xiong; Mo, Zengnan",Biomed Res Int,234,27

Vascular leakage is a common clinical crisis in DHF/DSS patients and highly associated with increased endothelial permeability. The presence of vascular leakage causes hypotension, circulatory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation as the disease progresses of DHF/DSS patients, which can lead to the death of patients. However, the mechanisms by which DENV infection caused the vascular leakage are not fully understood. This study reveals a distinct mechanism by which DENV induces endothelial permeability and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mice tissues. We initially show that DENV2 promotes the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression and secretion in DHF patients’ sera, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and macrophages. This study further reveals that DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) induces MMP-9 expression through activating the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Additionally, NS1 facilitates the MMP-9 enzymatic activity, which alters the adhesion and tight junction and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mouse tissues. Moreover, NS1 recruits MMP-9 to interact with β-catenin and Zona occludens protein-1/2 (ZO-1 and ZO-2) and to degrade the important adhesion and tight junction proteins, thereby inducing endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mouse tissues. Thus, we reveal that DENV NS1 and MMP-9 cooperatively induce vascular leakage by impairing endothelial cell adhesion and tight junction, and suggest that MMP-9 may serve as a potential target for the treatment of hypovolemia in DSS/DHF patients.","Pan, Pan; Li, Geng; Shen, Miaomiao; Yu, Zhenyang; Ge, Weiwei; Lao, Zizhao; Fan, Yaohua; Chen, Keli; Ding, Zhihao; Wang, Wenbiao; Wan, Pin; Shereen, Muhammad Adnan; Luo, Zhen; Chen, Xulin; Zhang, Qiwei; Lin, Luping; Wu, Jianguo",PLoS Pathog,234,11

MAIN BODY: IL-22, an important member of the IL-10 family of cytokines, is released by cells of the adaptive and innate immune system and plays a key role in the development of inflammatory diseases. The binding of IL-22 to its receptor complex can trigger a diverse array of downstream signaling pathways, in particular the JAK/STAT, to induce the expression of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, numerous studies suggest that IL-22 is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by regulation of VSMC proliferation and migration, angiogenesis, inflammatory response, hypertension, and cholesterol metabolism.

While classical de novo drug development involves high costs, risks, and time-consuming paths, drug repurposing allows to reuse already-existing and approved drugs for new indications. Numerous research has been carried out in this field, both in vitro and in silico. Computational drug repurposing methods make use of modern heterogeneous biomedical data to identify and prioritize new indications for old drugs. In the current paper, we present a new complete methodology to evaluate new potentially repurposable drugs based on disease-gene and disease-phenotype associations, identifying significant differences between repurposing and non-repurposing data. We have collected a set of known successful drug repurposing case studies from the literature and we have analysed their dissimilarities with other biomedical data not necessarily participating in repurposing processes. The information used has been obtained from the DISNET platform. We have performed three analyses (at the genetical, phenotypical, and categorization levels), to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between actual repurposing-related information and non-repurposing data. The insights obtained could be relevant when suggesting new potential drug repurposing hypotheses.","Prieto Santamaría, Lucía; Ugarte Carro, Esther; Díaz Uzquiano, Marina; Menasalvas Ruiz, Ernestina; Pérez Gallardo, Yuliana; Rodríguez-González, Alejandro",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,234,17

To summarize and meta-analyze the association between PM and cancer, published articles reporting associations between outdoor PM exposure and any type of cancer with individual outcome assessment that provided a risk estimate in cohort studies were identified via systematic searches. Of 3,256 records, 47 studies covering 13 cancer sites (30 for lung cancer, 12 for breast cancer, 11 for other cancers) were included in the quantitative evaluation. The pooled relative risks (RRs) for lung cancer incidence or mortality associated with every 10-μg/m(3) PM(2.5) or PM(10) were 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10–1.23; I(2) = 81%) or 1.22 (95% CI, 1.02–1.45; I(2) = 96%), respectively. Increased but non-significant risks were found for breast cancer. Other cancers were shown to be associated with PM exposure in some studies but not consistently and thus warrant further investigation.","Yu, Pei; Guo, Suying; Xu, Rongbin; Ye, Tingting; Li, Shanshan; Sim, Malcolm R.; Abramson, Michael J.; Guo, Yuming",Innovation (N Y),234,1

Alveolar epithelial cells provide the major barrier between the airspace and fluid filled tissue compartments. As such, regulation of the alveolar epithelium is critical to maintain a healthy lung and for optimal gas exchange. In this chapter, we discuss functional roles for alveolar epithelial cells with particular emphasis on intercellular junctions and communication. As a thin layer of cells directly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, alveoli are particularly sensitive to oxidant insults. Alcohol significantly diminishes the normal antioxidant reserves of the alveolar epithelium, thereby rendering it sensitized for an exaggerated damage response to acute and chronic injuries. The effects of alcohol on alveolar epithelia are discussed along with open questions and potential therapeutic targets to prevent the pathophysiology of alcoholic lung disease.","Molina, Samuel A.; Koval, Michael",Alcohol Use Disorders and the Lung,234,12

The frequent emergence of new viral diseases is mainly due to international trade, climate change, and the ability of viruses for rapid evolution. Disease control is based on two strategies: i) immunization (genetic resistance obtained by plant breeding, plant transformation, cross-protection, or others), and ii) prophylaxis to restrain virus dispersion (using quarantine, certification, removal of infected plants, control of natural vectors, or other procedures). Disease management relies strongly on a fast and accurate identification of the causal agent. For known viruses, diagnosis consists in assigning a virus infecting a plant sample to a group of viruses sharing common characteristics, which is usually referred to as species. However, the specificity of diagnosis can also reach higher taxonomic levels, as genus or family, or lower levels, as strain or variant. Diagnostic procedures must be optimized for accuracy by detecting the maximum number of members within the group (sensitivity as the true positive rate) and distinguishing them from outgroup viruses (specificity as the true negative rate). This requires information on the genetic relationships within-group and with members of other groups. The influence of the genetic diversity of virus populations in diagnosis and disease management is well documented, but information on how to integrate the genetic diversity in the detection methods is still scarce. Here we review the techniques used for plant virus diagnosis and disease control, including characteristics such as accuracy, detection level, multiplexing, quantification, portability, and designability. The effect of genetic diversity and evolution of plant viruses in the design and performance of some detection and disease control techniques are also discussed. High-throughput or next-generation sequencing provides broad-spectrum and accurate identification of viruses enabling multiplex detection, quantification, and the discovery of new viruses. Likely, this technique will be the future standard in diagnostics as its cost will be dropping and becoming more affordable.","Rubio, Luis; Galipienso, Luis; Ferriol, Inmaculada",Front Plant Sci,234,17

Seeking to reduce risk, long term care communities are also: ending group dining and group activities, prohibiting family visits, turning to dedicated staffing for the memory care neighborhood, and assuring that staff wear PPE even as residents typically won’t keep masks on or necessarily respect social distancing. The CDC has issued its recommendations relating to safety in memory care settings related to Covid‐19 here and supports many of these practices, but that also calls for ongoing activity programming. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019‐ncov/hcp/memory‐care.html.While health and safety concerns are of great urgency, “dementia care at a distance” raises concerns for the emotional well‐being of people living with dementia. Sam Fazio and his colleagues write eloquently about the importance of person centered care and therapeutic environments (including meaningful engagement and caring relationships) in The Fundamentals of Person‐Centered Care, Gerontologist, 2018, Vol. 58, No. S1, S10–S19 https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnx122. Without disease modifying medication, this presentation will argue that socialization, in many ways, is the “treatment” for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia. With innovative thinking, “social distancing” can become “sociable distancing.” This session will offer strategies for maintaining person centered approaches in long‐term care settings during this challenging time. Innovations include: staff training focused on caring approaches and the benefits of short moments of engagement throughout the day; the importance of unplugging from negative news in order to support positive emotion; activities that can be safely conducted in small groups (6 feet apart) and one‐on‐one; ways to make personal care more of a social experience; strategies to utilize the resident’s social history or life story to make connection and provide needed clues and cues; and innovative uses of technology to keep the resident connected with friends and family. The presentation will end with some further techniques for resident care during the Covid‐19 pandemic and argue that the medical model and social model must both be present to provide quality of life for persons living with dementia.","Troxel, David A; Anzelmo, Nancy A Schier; Bell, Virginia M",Alzheimers Dement,234,0

This is not easily possible with existing INN models due to some fundamental limitations. The cINN combines the purely generative INN model with an unconstrained feed-forward network, which efficiently preprocesses the conditioning image into maximally informative features. All parameters of a cINN are jointly optimized with a stable, maximum likelihood-based training procedure. Even though INN-based models have received far less attention in the literature than GANs, they have been shown to have some remarkable properties absent in GANs, e.g. apparent immunity to mode collapse. We find that our cINNs leverage these properties for image-to-image translation, demonstrated on day to night translation and image colorization. Furthermore, we take advantage of our bidirectional cINN architecture to explore and manipulate emergent properties of the latent space, such as changing the image style in an intuitive way.

The mobile application supports graph operations such as creating/editing graphs, running basic graph algorithms on graphs, and observing their step-by-step execution. Students can also test their knowledge level by using the quiz section of the mobile learning application. The study is conducted at a public university in Turkey with the participation of voluntary freshman students that take the Discrete Structures course. Graph theory is lectured for three weeks as the final subject of the course. Various features of the mobile application were introduced to the students by the lab assistant at laboratory sessions of 45 min that were conducted for a period of three weeks after the theoretical lectures in which the graph theory topics were covered. After these introduction sessions, students were able to use the mobile application as a supplementary tool any time they want. In order to investigate the effect of using the mobile learning application on the academic performance of students, a quasi-experimental research design with experimental and control groups was utilized. Quantitative data were collected by using the grades students achieved from the questions related to graph theory in the final exams of the course. The data for each year was analyzed by performing independent groups t-tests.

Nevertheless, in October 2020, at the beginning of a new wave of infection, it reaches just one fifth of the population. This means that the app’s potential to provide information about potential infections, which have taken place unnoticed, is dwindling. AIMS: The aim of the study is to explore the subjective perception and impact of the app on the individual, as well as the inhibiting and facilitating factors of its use. These effects can provide conclusions about the needs of the population and accordingly challenges for public health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dataset was created through two procedural steps. The first step is a forum analysis of a total of 300 reviews. The second step consists of 40 qualitative, semi-structured interviews. The data were inductively–deductively coded and evaluated along a content-structuring form of qualitative content analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The effects of the app are a result of complex interactions. Of central importance for the dynamics are public spaces and social interactions, which are perceived as dangerous during this pandemic. Against this background, practices with the app can generate new visibilities that lead to a reassessment of the concrete threat. This again, can reopen possibilities for action. However, critical positions on data protection and data security may lead to new insecurities and possibly to the rejection of the app.","Urban, Monika",Pr&#x000e4;v Gesundheitsf,234,1

With respect to first variable this equation is a fractional-order nonhomogeneous differential equation in the positive part of the considering segment, and with respect to second variable is a second-order differential equation with spectral parameter in the negative part of this segment. Using the Fourier series method, the solutions of direct and inverse boundary value problems are constructed in the form of a Fourier series. Theorems on the existence and uniqueness of the problem are proved for regular values of the spectral parameter.

Over the last decades, both prevalence and incidence rates of heart failure have increased worldwide, resulting in a significant global public health issue. However, an early diagnosis is not an easy task because symptoms of heart failure are usually non-specific. Therefore, this study aims to develop a risk prediction model for incident heart failure through a machine learning-based predictive model. Although African Americans have a higher risk of incident heart failure among all populations, few studies have developed a heart failure risk prediction model for African Americans. Methods: This research implemented the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to establish the Jackson Heart Study’s predictive model. In the analysis of real data, missing data are problematic when building a predictive model. Here, we evaluate predictors’ inclusion with various missing rates and different missing imputation strategies to discover the optimal analytics. Results: According to hundreds of models that we examined, the best predictive model was the XGBoost that included variables with a missing rate of less than 30 percent, and we imputed missing values by non-parametric random forest imputation. The optimal XGBoost machine demonstrated an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.8409 to predict heart failure for the Jackson Heart Study. Conclusion: This research identifies variations of diabetes medication as the most crucial risk factor for heart failure compared to the complete cases approach that failed to discover this phenomenon.","Guo, Chao-Yu; Wu, Min-Yang; Cheng, Hao-Min",Int J Environ Res Public Health,234,24

There has been debate on whether to use such systems in orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Thirty-five participants were enrolled in a double-blinded randomised controlled study investigating efficacy of the Stryker Flyte Surgical Helmet (Stryker Corporation, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) as protection against respiratory droplets. Wearing the SSHS in a fit testing hood, subjects were randomised to nebulised saccharin solution or placebo. Twenty were allocated to the saccharin group with 15 to placebo. Positive sweet taste represented test failure. Taste tests were performed with the helmet fan turned on and off. RESULTS: SSHS did not prevent saccharin taste (p < 0.0001). Within the saccharin cohort, 40% recorded a positive taste with the fan on and 100% with the fan off. There was a statistically significant difference in mean time-to-taste saccharin (p = 0.049) comparing fan on (123.5 s) vs. off (62.6 s). CONCLUSIONS: SSHS do not protect against aerosol particulate and therefore are not efficacious in protection against COVID-19. The fan system employed may even increase risk by drawing in particulates and delaying recognition of intraoperative cues that point to respirator mask leak.","Erotocritou, M; Schaller, G; Nayar, S; Overton, A; Stelzhammer, T; Berber, O",Br J Surg,234,24

It results in serious clinical complications in humans and has become a global threat. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in different clinical samples in Ethiopia. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library. All identified observational studies reporting the prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae from clinical samples in Ethiopia were included. Four authors independently extracted data and analysed using R software version 3.6.1 and STATA statistical software version 13. A random-effects model was computed to estimate the pooled prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Ethiopia. RESULTS: Of 142 articles reviewed, 14 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the different clinical specimens in Ethiopia was 49 % (95 % CI: 39, 60). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the leading ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae followed by Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii with a prevalence of 74, 67 and 60 %, respectively. ESBL-producing isolates showed a high rate of resistance to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, Amoxicillin clavulanic acid (AMC), ampicillin and aztreonam. The better options for the treatment of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are amikacin and Imipenem. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in different clinical samples in Ethiopia is alarmingly high and represents a threat to human health. Hence, a coordinated effort needs to be implemented for the prevention and control of these Enterobacteriaceae .","Diriba, Kuma; Awulachew, Ephrem; Gemede, Aschelew; Anja, Asrat",Access Microbiol,234,24

Similarly, ISO 17034 is also very important international standard for development/production of reference materials (RMs) by competent producers. CSIR-National Physical Laboratory of India (NPLI) was one of the 38 National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) those who signed International Committee for Weights and Measures Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA) during 21st General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) meeting in Paris, France on 14th October, 1999. NPLI has been maintaining quality system based on ISO/IEC 17025 for more than two decades to fulfil the requirements of CIPM MRA. NPLI has participated in 130 international inter-comparisons so far; some of them were also piloted by NPLI. NPLI has also undergone International Peer Reviews through Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) to register 236 Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) on various parameters in International Bureau of Weights and Measures Key Comparison Database (BIPM KCDB). However, NPLI for the first time implemented uniform quality system based on ISO 17034 in 2020. In this direction, NPLI for the first time prepared integrated Quality Manual to make policies, objectives and procedures addressing all the requirements of both the standards. Presently, 28 Sub-Divisions of NPLI follow quality system. Some of the Sub-Divisions are involved only in calibration/testing activities maintain only ISO/IEC 17025: 2017. Similarly, some of the Sub-Divisions are involved only in development/production of RMs/certified reference materials (CRMs) (Bharatiya Nirdeshak Dravya, BND(®)–Indian Reference Material) maintain only ISO 17034.

Consequently, women’s potential mates must show they can provide investment – especially when women are seeking a long-term mate. Investment may be exhibited through financial and social status, and the ability to care for a mate and any resulting offspring. Men who care for children and pets (hereafter “dependents”) are perceived as high-quality mates, given that dependents signal an ability to invest; however, no studies have examined how dependents are associated with short-term and long-term mating strategies. Here, online dating profiles were used to test the predictions that an interactive effect between sex and mating strategy will predict displays of dependents, with long-term mating strategy predicting for men but not women. Moreover, this pattern should hold for all dependent types and, due to relative asymmetries in required investment, differences will be strongest regarding displays of children and least in non-canine pets. As expected, men seeking long-term mates displayed dependents more than men seeking short-term mates, but both men and women seeking long-term mates displayed dependents similarly. This pattern was driven mostly by canines. These findings indicate that men adopting a long-term mating strategy display their investment capabilities more compared to those seeking short-term mates, which may be used to signal their mate value.","Zinck, Mackenzie J.; Weir, Laura K.; Fisher, Maryanne L.",Evol Psychol Sci,234,16

Large saccades are associated with reaching movements toward objects, whereas small saccades facilitate the identification of more detailed object features necessary for successful grasping and manual manipulation. To determine whether these represent dichotomous processing streams, we used resting-state functional MRI to examine the functional connectivity patterns of the medial and lateral frontal eye field (FEF) regions that encode large- and small-amplitude saccades, respectively. We found that the spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent signals of the medial FEF were functionally correlated with areas known to be involved in reaching movements and executive control processes, whereas lateral FEF was functionally correlated with cortical areas involved in object processing and in grasping, fixation, and manipulation of objects. The results provide strong evidence for two distinct visuomotor network systems in the primate brain that likely reflect the alternating phases of vision for action in natural environments.","Babapoor-Farrokhran, Sahand; Hutchison, R Matthew; Gati, Joseph S; Menon, Ravi S; Everling, Stefan",Journal of neurophysiology,234,27

METHODS AND RESULTS An AGI-30 impinger containing particles [MS2 bacteriophage or 30-nm polystyrene latex (PSL)] of known concentration was operated with sterile air. Reaerosolized particles as a function of sampling flow rate and particle concentration in the impinger collection liquid were characterized using a scanning mobility particle sizer. Reaerosolization from the impinger was also compared to that from a BioSampler. Results show that reaerosolization increases as flow rate increases. While the increased particle concentration in the impinger collection liquid leads to an increase in the reaerosolization of PSL particles, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in the reaerosolization of virus particles. Reaerosolization of virus particles begins to decrease as the particle concentration in the impinger collection liquid rises above 10(6) PFU ml(-1). This phenomenon results from aggregation of viral particles at high concentrations. Compared with micron-sized particles, nanosized virus particles are easier to aerosolize because of reduced inertia. Reaerosolization from the BioSampler is demonstrated to be significantly less than that from the impinger. CONCLUSIONS Reaerosolization from impingement sampling methods is a mode of loss in airborne virus sampling, although it is not as significant a limitation as the primary particle size of the aerosol. Utilizing a BioSampler coupled with short sampling periods to prevent high accumulative concentrations can minimize the impact of reaerosolization. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY This study confirms reaerosolization of virus particles to be a mode of loss in impingement sampling and identifies methods to minimize the loss.","Riemenschneider, L; Woo, M-H; Wu, C-Y; Lundgren, D; Wander, J; Lee, J-H; Li, H-W; Heimbuch, B",Journal of applied microbiology,234,12

The article analyses the performance of different processes for the recycling of crystalline silicon PV waste, in a life cycle perspective. The life cycle impacts of the recycling are compared, under different scenarios, to the environmental benefits of secondary raw materials recovered. Base-case recycling has a low efficiency and, in some cases, not even in line with legislative targets. Conversely, high-efficient recycling can meet these targets and allows to recover high quality materials (as silicon, glass and silver) that are generally lost in base-case recycling. The benefits due to the recovery of these materials counterbalance the larger impacts of the high-efficiency recycling process. Considering the full life cycle of the panel, the energy produced by the panel grants the most significant environmental benefits. However, benefits due to high-efficient recycling are relevant for some impact categories, especially for the resource depletion indicator. The article also points out that thermal treatments are generally necessary to grant the high efficiency in the recycling. Nevertheless, these treatments have to be carefully assessed since they can be responsible for the emissions of air pollutants (as hydrogen fluoride potentially released from the combustion of halogenated plastics in the panel's backsheet). The article also identifies and assesses potential modifications to the high-efficiency recycling process, including the delocalisation of some treatments for the optimisation of waste transport and the introduction of pyrolysis in the thermal processing of the waste. Finally, recommendations for product designers, recyclers and policymakers are discussed, in order to improve the resource efficiency of future PV panels.","Ardente, Fulvio; Latunussa, Cynthia E L; Blengini, Gian Andrea",Waste management,234,16

We assessed trends and correlates of HPV vaccine uptake from 2012 to 2019 in a cohort of gbMSM in Vancouver. METHODS We recruited sexually active gbMSM aged ≥16 years using respondent-driven sampling from February 2012 to February 2015 and followed them until July 2019. We evaluated self-reported HPV vaccine trends using mixed-effects logistic regression and identified factors associated with uptake using multivariable mixed-effects Poisson regression. RESULTS A total of 719 participants were recruited and completed the baseline visit, of whom 549 were unvaccinated with at least one follow-up visit. The median age was 33 years and 23% were living with HIV. HPV vaccination increased from 4% in 2012 to 28% in 2019 (p<0.001) among gbMSM >26 years, and from 9% in 2012 to 20% in 2017 (p<0.001) among gbMSM ≤26 years. Vaccination uptake increased after September 2015, following vaccination policy expansion (adjusted rate ratio (aRR)=1.82, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.12). In multivariable models, increased vaccination was associated with age ≤26 years vs ≥45 years (aRR=3.90; 95% CI 1.75 to 8.70), age 27-44 vs ≥45 years (aRR=2.86; 95% CI 1.46 to 5.62), involvement in gay community sports teams (aRR=2.31; 95% CI 1.15 to 4.64) and other groups (aRR=1.71; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.79), awareness of HIV-postexposure prophylaxis (aRR=5.50; 95% CI 1.31 to 23.09), recent sexually transmitted infection testing (aRR=2.72; 95% CI 1.60 to 4.60) and recent sex-work (aRR=2.59; 95% CI 1.08 to 6.19). CONCLUSIONS Although we observed increases in HPV vaccination uptake from 2012, by 2019 HPV vaccination still remained below 30% among gbMSM in Vancouver, BC. Additional interventions are needed to increase vaccine uptake.","Khatra, Jatinder; Sang, Jordan Mitchell; Wang, Clara; Bacani, Nicanor; Lachowsky, Nathan John; Grennan, Troy; Burchell, Ann Natalie; Lal, Allan; Roth, Eric; Hogg, Robert; Card, Kiffer; Moore, David",Sexually transmitted infections,234,1

While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number R 0, variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others. Methods: We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution. Results: Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R 0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for R 0 and k (95% CrIs: R 0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of R 0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution. Conclusions: Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.","Endo, Akira; Abbott, Sam; Kucharski, Adam J; Funk, Sebastian",Wellcome open research,234,16

Techniques such as the tie-over dressing, cotton bolster, and vacuum-assisted closure are used to address this, but each has its limitations. This study is designed to assess the effect of antimicrobial-impregnated dressing (AMD) combined with negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) on skin graft survival. DESIGN Retrospective case-control study PARTICIPANTS : Patients with chronic or contaminated wounds treated with split-thickness skin graft. A broad spectrum of wounds was included, from causes such as trauma, burns, chronic diabetic ulcers, and infection. INTERVENTIONS Antimicrobial-impregnated dressing, which contains 0.2% polyhexamethylene biguanide, with NPWT MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:: Success of skin graft MAIN RESULTS : In the AMD group, all skin grafts achieved 100% take without secondary intervention. No infection or graft failure was observed in any patients, and no complications, such as hematoma or seroma formation, were noted, although in the control group partial loss of skin grafts was noted in 3 patients. Infection and inadequate immobilization were thought to be the main reasons. There were no hematoma or seroma formations in the control group. CONCLUSION Use of an AMD dressing with NPWT after split-thickness skin grafting can be an effective method to ensure good graft to wound contact and enhances skin graft take in chronic and contaminated wounds.","Wu, Cheng-Chun; Chew, Khong-Yik; Chen, Chien-Chang; Kuo, Yur-Ren",Advances in skin & wound care,234,1

AIMS OF THE STUDY The primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between TNFSF14 and OSM levels and survival. Our secondary goal was to investigate a potential association between these markers and the incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). MATERIALS & METHODS We consecutively recruited 60 patients with a clinical diagnosis of aSAH. LIGHT/TNFSF14 and OSM serum concentrations were determined by ELISA. The primary endpoint was survival at Day 30, while development of DCI was assessed as secondary outcome. RESULTS Patients had significantly higher levels of both markers than the control group (median of LIGHT: 18.1 pg/ml vs. 7 pg/ml; p = 0.01; median of OSM: 10.3 pg/ml vs. 2.8 pg/ml, p < 0.001). Significantly lower serum level of LIGHT/TNFSF14 was found in nonsurviving patients (n = 9) compared with survivors (n = 51; p = 0.011). Based on ROC analysis, serum LIGHT/TNFSF14 with a cutoff value of >7.95 pg/ml predicted 30-day survival with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 78% (Area: 0.763; 95% CI: 0.604-0.921, p = 0.013).

Based on binary logistic regression analysis, LIGHT/TNFSF14 was found to be independently associated with 30-day mortality, but not with DCI. CONCLUSION In this cohort, a higher serum level of LIGHT/TNFSF14 was associated with increased survival of patients with aSAH.","Schranz, Daniel; Molnar, Tihamer; Erdo-Bonyar, Szabina; Simon, Diana; Berki, Tímea; Nagy, Csaba; Czeiter, Endre; Buki, Andras; Lenzser, Gabor; Csecsei, Peter",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,234,1

Therefore, a minimal continuous cuff pressure must be maintained. Aim of this study was to analyse the course of cuff pressure in an in-vitro model during manual cuff pressure control manoeuvres. METHODS An artificial trachea was intubated with an appropriately sized ETT and cuff pressure set to 20 cm H2 O. Thirty-two experienced ICU nurses each performed six cuff pressure control manoeuvres (three times in two different ETTs) using a manual cuff pressure manometer. Course of cuff pressure from connecting the manometer to disconnecting it from the cuff pilot balloon was recorded using a pressure transducer. RESULTS There were 190 cuff pressure control manoeuvres suitable for analysis. In all control manoeuvres a cuff pressure below 20 cm H2 O was noted. In 20.0% of the control manoeuvres the cuff pressure dropped below 10 cm H2 O. Cuff pressure drops were mainly caused by initially connecting the manometer to the pilot balloon, less frequently by manipulating the pressure gauge of the manometer. Disconnecting the manometer after the control manoeuvre caused a cuff pressure drop in 78.1% of cases, contributing to a final cuff pressure below 20 cm H2 O in 31.3% of control manoeuvres. CONCLUSION Routine manual cuff pressure control manoeuvres in ETT cuffs result in considerable cuff pressure drops. This may have an impact on silent aspiration of pharyngeal contents passing along the cuff into the lower airway.","Aeppli, Norbert; Lindauer, Bastian; Steurer, Marc P; Weiss, Markus; Dullenkopf, Alexander",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,234,1

This contamination can concentrate within gamma camera heads to degrade images and is also a radiation hazard to staff. A method for sequestrating this airborne contamination was investigated using an ultra-low particulate air filter. The prevalence of radioactive contamination and the levels of contamination captured were quantified and only 36% of patients were found to have undergone the ventilation procedure without producing significant airborne contamination. Advice is given on best practice that will minimize airborne contamination and minimize the risks to staff working in the Nuclear Medicine department.

OBJECTIVES To assess the effects and associations of total fat intake on measures of weight and body fatness in children and young people not aiming to lose weight. SEARCH METHODS For this update we revised the previous search strategy and ran it over all years in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE (PubMed), and Embase (Ovid) (current to 23 May 2017). No language and publication status limits were applied. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished studies (5 June 2017). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged 24 months to 18 years, with or without risk factors for cardiovascular disease, randomised to a lower fat (30% or less of total energy (TE)) versus usual or moderate-fat diet (greater than 30%TE), without the intention to reduce weight, and assessed a measure of weight or body fatness after at least six months. We included prospective cohort studies if they related baseline total fat intake to weight or body fatness at least 12 months later. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We extracted data on participants, interventions or exposures, controls and outcomes, and trial or cohort quality characteristics, as well as data on potential effect modifiers, and assessed risk of bias for all included studies. We extracted body weight and blood lipid levels outcomes at six months, six to 12 months, one to two years, two to five years and more than five years for RCTs; and for cohort studies, at baseline to one year, one to two years, two to five years, five to 10 years and more than 10 years. We planned to perform random-effects meta-analyses with relevant subgrouping, and sensitivity and funnel plot analyses where data allowed. MAIN RESULTS We included 24 studies comprising three parallel-group RCTs (n = 1054 randomised) and 21 prospective analytical cohort studies (about 25,059 children completed). Twenty-three studies were conducted in high-income countries. No meta-analyses were possible, since only one RCT reported the same outcome at each time point range for all outcomes, and cohort studies were too heterogeneous to combine.Effects of dietary counselling to reduce total fat intake from RCTsTwo studies recruited children aged between 4 and 11 years and a third recruited children aged 12 to 13 years. Interventions were combinations of individual and group counselling, and education sessions in clinics, schools and homes, delivered by dieticians, nutritionists, behaviourists or trained, supervised teachers. Concerns about imprecision and poor reporting limited our confidence in our findings. In addition, the inclusion of hypercholesteraemic children in two trials raised concerns about applicability.One study of dietary counselling to lower total fat intake found that the intervention may make little or no difference to weight compared with usual diet at 12 months (mean difference (MD) -0.50 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to 0.78; n = 620; low-quality evidence) and at three years (MD -0.60 kg, 95% CI -2.39 to 1.19; n = 612; low-quality evidence). Education delivered as a classroom curriculum probably decreased BMI in children at 17 months (MD -1.5 kg/m2, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.55; 1 RCT; n = 191; moderate-quality evidence). The effects were smaller at longer term follow-up (five years: MD 0 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.63; n = 541; seven years; MD -0.10 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.55; n = 576; low-quality evidence).Dietary counselling probably slightly reduced total cholesterol at 12 months compared to controls (MD -0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), but may make little or no difference over longer time periods. Dietary counselling probably slightly decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol at 12 months (MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04; 1 RCT; n = 618, moderate-quality evidence) and at five years (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.01; 1 RCT; n = 623; moderate-quality evidence), compared to controls. Dietary counselling probably made little or no difference to HDL-C at 12 months (MD -0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.02; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), and at five years (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.04; 1 RCT; n = 522; moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, counselling probably made little or no difference to triglycerides in children at 12 months (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence). Lower versus usual or modified fat intake may make little or no difference to height at seven years (MD -0.60 cm, 95% CI -2.06 to 0.86; 1 RCT; n = 577; low-quality evidence).Associations between total fat intake, weight and body fatness from cohort studiesOver half the cohort analyses that reported on primary outcomes suggested that as total fat intake increases, body fatness measures may move in the same direction. However, heterogeneous methods and reporting across cohort studies, and predominantly very low-quality evidence, made it difficult to draw firm conclusions and true relationships may be substantially different. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We were unable to reach firm conclusions. Limited evidence from three trials that randomised children to dietary counselling or education to lower total fat intake (30% or less TE) versus usual or modified fat intake, but with no intention to reduce weight, showed small reductions in body mass index, total- and LDL-cholesterol at some time points with lower fat intake compared to controls. There were no consistent effects on weight, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or height. Associations in cohort studies that related total fat intake to later measures of body fatness in children were inconsistent and the quality of this evidence was mostly very low. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries, and may not be applicable in low- and middle-income settings. High-quality, longer-term studies are needed, that include low- and middle-income settings to look at both possible benefits and harms.","Naude, Celeste E; Visser, Marianne E; Nguyen, Kim A; Durao, Solange; Schoonees, Anel",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,234,1

In nonmalignant tissue, PC plays an essential role in controlling whole-body energetics through regulation of gluconeogenesis in the liver, synthesis of fatty acids in adipocytes, and insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells. In breast cancer, PC activity is linked to pulmonary metastasis, potentially by providing the ability to utilize glucose, fatty acids, and glutamine metabolism as needed under varying conditions as cells metastasize. PC enzymatic activity appears to be of particular importance in cancer cells that are unable to utilize glutamine for anaplerosis. Moreover, PC activity also plays a role in lipid metabolism and protection from oxidative stress in cancer cells. Thus, PC activity may be essential to link energy substrate utilization with cancer progression and to enable the metabolic flexibility necessary for cell resilience to changing and adverse conditions during the metastatic process.","Kiesel, Violet A; Sheeley, Madeline P; Coleman, Michael F; Cotul, Eylem Kulkoyluoglu; Donkin, Shawn S; Hursting, Stephen D; Wendt, Michael K; Teegarden, Dorothy",Cancer & metabolism,234,1

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between prior statin use and SSNHL. STUDY DESIGN A nested case-control study. SETTING Participants aged ≥40 years were enrolled from the 2002-2015 Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort. METHODS A total of 5876 patients with SSNHL were matched with 23,504 control participants for age, sex, income, and region of residence. History of statin use for 2 years before SSNHL onset was investigated between the groups. The odds ratios (ORs) of the length of statin use for SSNHL stratified by age, sex, income, and region of residence were analyzed with conditional logistic regression. Dyslipidemia, total cholesterol, blood pressure, blood glucose, hemoglobin, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score were adjusted. The adjusted variables were subjected to subgroup analyses. RESULTS The SSNHL group had a longer duration of statin use than the control group (mean [SD], 81.9 [197.7] days vs 72.7 [188.0] days; P = .001). However, statin use was not associated with SSNHL after adjusting for the confounders (adjusted OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.98-1.11; P = .245). There was a positive correlation between statin use and SSNHL in the crude model (crude OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.16; P = .001). However, there was no association between statin use and SSNHL in all subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION Previous statin use was not associated with SSNHL.","Kim, So Young; Wee, Jee Hye; Min, Chanyang; Yoo, Dae Myoung; Choi, Hyo Geun",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,234,1

Across the world, hundreds of thousands of health care systems are considering a central question: how do we connect with our patients? Digital health has been used as a stopgap in many cases to continue the essential functions of health systems. As the post-pandemic world and our ""new normal"" come into focus, further needs will have to be met with a digital patient interaction, with an eye toward value transformation. One barrier to fully leveraging digital tools is the lack of a framework for classifying the type of digital health care. This can limit our ability to design, deploy, evaluate, and communicate through digital means. This article presents 3 categories of digital health and their relationships to value metrics: (1) telehealth or direct care delivery, (2) digital access tools, and (3) digital monitoring. An evidence-based discussion reveals past successes, current promises, and future challenges in reducing defects in value through digital care. In the coming years, value transformation will become more crucial to the success of health care systems. By using the taxonomy in this article, health systems can better implement digital tools with a value-driven purpose. Defining the role of digital health in the post-pandemic world is needed to assist health systems and practices to build a bridge to value-based care.","D'Anza, Brian; Pronovost, Peter J",Population health management,234,20

The OrVil system (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) is one of those methods, but its technical and oncologic feasibility have not been proven and need to be observed. METHODS Among 87 patients who underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG; 79 cases) and laparoscopy-assisted proximal gastrectomy with double tract anastomosis (LAPG_DT; 8 cases) from April 2004, 47 patients underwent the conventional extracorporeal method (Group I; 2004-2008) were compared with 40 patients treated with the intracorporeal OrVil system (Group II; 2009-2012). RESULTS There was no significant difference in clinicopathologic characteristics between the two groups except tumor location; more cardia lesions were involved in group II (p = 0.012). The mean time for esophagojejunostomy (E-J), defined as the time from anvil insertion to closure of the jejunal entry site has no significant difference (Group I vs II: 22.2 ± 3.2 min vs 18.6 ± 3.5 min, p = 0.623). In terms of anastomotic complication, there was no significant difference in E-J leakage and stricture. E-J leakage occurred in 2 out of 47 (4.3%) cases in group I and 2 out of 40 (5%) in group II (p = 0.628); half of them were treated conservatively in each group and the others underwent reoperation. E-J stricture occurred in 2 (4.3%) cases in group I and 1 (2.5%) in group II (p = 0.561), which required postoperative gastrofiberscopic balloon dilatation. CONCLUSIONS Esophagojejunostomy using the OrVil system was a feasible and safe technique compared with the conventional extracorporeal method through mini-laparotomy in terms of anastomotic complications. Moreover, it can help to reduce surgeon's stress regarding esophagojejunostomy because it needs no purse-string procedure and serves a secure operation view laparoscopically.","Jung, Yoon Ju; Kim, Dong Jin; Lee, Jun Hyun; Kim, Wook",World journal of surgical oncology,234,8

Our goal was to capture the properties of synergic behavior in football, using spatiotemporal data from one match of the 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP RUSSIA, to explore the application of player-ball-goal angles in cluster phase analysis. Linear mixed effects models were used to test the statistical significance of different effects, such as: team, half(-time), role and pitch zones. Results showed that the cluster phase values (synchronization) for the home team, had a 3.812×10-2±0.536×10-2 increase with respect to the away team (X2(41)=259.8, p<0.001) and that changing the role from with ball to without ball increased synchronization by 16.715×10-2±0.283×10-2 (X2(41)=12227.0, p<0.001). The interaction between effects was also significant. The player-team relative phase, the player-ball-goal angles relative frequency and the team configurations, showed that variations of synchronization might indicate critical performance changes (ball possession changes, goals scored, etc.). This study captured the ongoing player-environment link and the properties of team synergic behavior, supporting the use of sensor-based data computations in the development of relevant indicators for tactical analysis in sports.","Carrilho, Daniel; Santos Couceiro, Micael; Brito, João; Figueiredo, Pedro; Lopes, Rui J; Araújo, Duarte",Sensors,234,27

The annual outbreaks tended to show two peaks in Okinawa, in summer and winter, although the main islands of Japan, located in a temperate climate area, showed only winter influenza activity. Epidemic types and subtypes in Okinawa mostly matched those on the main islands of Japan in winter and those in Taiwan in summer. Rates of amantadine resistance dramatically increased, from 7.3% in the November 2002-to-March 2003 season to 90.0% in summer 2005, and a similarly high rate of resistance continued for the rest of the study period. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of A/H3N2 isolates collected from 2002 to 2007 revealed a monophyletic lineage that was divided into four period groups. Each group included amantadine-sensitive and -resistant viruses within independent clusters. In the November 2005-to-March 2006 season, all of the amantadine-resistant viruses were clustered in clade N, with dual (position 193 and 225) amino acid mutations in their HA1 subunits. In 2005, clade N amantadine-resistant viruses existed in Okinawa several months before the circulation of this clade on the main islands of Japan. In conclusion, surveillance in Okinawa to monitor influenza virus circulation is important for elucidating the dynamics of virus transmission in a border area between temperate and subtropical areas, as Okinawa is one of the best sentinel points in Japan.","Suzuki, Yasushi; Taira, Katsuya; Saito, Reiko; Nidaira, Minoru; Okano, Shou; Zaraket, Hassan; Suzuki, Hiroshi",Journal of clinical microbiology,234,31

In total, 129 anesthetic procedures were performed with no mortalities. Hypothermia and hyperthermia were the most common anesthetic complications, and the mean rectal temperatures were significantly higher during summer than in winter. Dental abnormalities were common; the majority of abnormal findings were broken or discolored teeth attributed to previous dental trauma and were not trap-induced. Blood (n=72) was analyzed from 53 martens for venous blood gas, lactate, hematocrit, and/or selected serum biochemistry analytes. Lactate concentration was measured by two different devices (VetScan i-STAT 1 and Lactate Plus) and compared for clinical agreement for 26 samples. Both methods for lactate measurement provided statistically similar results. Using domestic feline reference ranges, the acid-base status and relative arterial oxygen saturation of anesthetized martens in this study were normal as determined by blood pH and pulse oximetry, respectively. Serum biochemistry parameters, multiple environmental parameters, and marten-specific attributes were evaluated for their influence on lactate in American martens using linear regression and an information-theoretic approach with model averaging. Blood urea nitrogen was in all of the top models and was positively related to lactate (β=0.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.00-0.04). Initial body temperature, ambient temperature, and time from trap discovery until immobilization of martens were informative predictors for lactate level. Recommendations for the live-trapping and isoflurane anesthesia of free-ranging martens include using caution during warmer summer months, minimizing disturbance prior to induction, monitoring lactate in addition to vital rates, and being prepared to prevent or treat both hypothermia and hyperthermia during any time of year.","Spriggs, Maria C; Muller, Lisa I; Keenlance, Paul; Sanders, Robert L; Witt, Jill C; Miller, Debra L",Journal of wildlife diseases,234,1

In KNHANES, although portable spirometry has been used, its reliability has not been verified. Methods We prospectively enrolled 58 participants from four Korean institutions. The participants were classified into normal pattern, obstructive pattern, and restrictive pattern groups according to their previous spirometry results. Lung function was estimated by conventional spirometry and portable spirometry, and the results were compared. Results Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of forced vital capacity (FVC) (coefficient, 9.993; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.988-0.996), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (coefficient, 0.997; 95% CI, 0.995-0.998), FEV1/FVC ratio (coefficient, 0.995; 95% CI, 0.992-0.997), and FEF25-75% (coefficient, 0.991; 95% CI, 0.984-0.994) were excellent (all P<0.001).

The RCT compared the DES with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and provisional bare-metal stent (BMS) placement. BACKGROUND Local drug delivery for superficial femoral artery lesions has been investigated with the intent of limiting restenosis similarly to DES for the coronary arteries. One-year outcomes of DES in the superficial femoral artery are promising, but longer-term benefits have not been established. METHODS In the RCT, patients were randomly assigned to primary DES implantation (n = 236) or PTA (n = 238). Acute PTA failure occurred in 120 patients, who underwent secondary randomization to DES (n = 61) or BMS (n = 59) placement. The single-arm study enrolled 787 patients with DES treatment. RESULTS Compared with the control group, the primary DES group demonstrated significantly superior 2-year event-free survival (86.6% vs. 77.9%, p = 0.02) and primary patency (74.8% vs. 26.5%, p < 0.01). In addition, the provisional DES group exhibited superior 2-year primary patency compared with the provisional BMS group (83.4% vs. 64.1%, p < 0.01) and achieved higher sustained clinical benefit (83.9% vs. 68.4%, p = 0.05). Two-year freedom from target lesion revascularization with primary DES placement was 80.5% in the single-arm study and 86.6% in the RCT.

This study assessed the association between baseline microscopic and submicroscopic asymptomatic P. falciparum infections and anti-malarial antibody levels and whether these parasitaemia modify protective associations between antibody levels and malaria in Ghanaian children. Healthy children (N=973, aged 0.5-12 years) were recruited into a 50-week longitudinal malaria cohort study from January 2016 to January 2017. Baseline asymptomatic parasitaemia were determined by microscopy (microscopic parasitaemia) and polymerase chain reaction (submicroscopic parasitaemia) and antibody levels against crude schizont antigens measured by ELISA. Antibody levels, parasite diversity and risk of malaria in the ensuing transmission season were compared among children who had baseline asymptomatic microscopic or submicroscopic or no P. falciparum infections. Of the 99 asymptomatic baseline infections, 46 (46.5%) were microscopic and 53 (53.5%), submicroscopic. Cox regression analysis adjusting for age group, sex and community found a strong association between both baseline microscopic [Hazard ratio (HR)=0.36, 95%CI=(0.21, 0.63), p<0.001] and submicroscopic [HR=0.22, 95%CI=(0.11, 0.44), p<0.001] asymptomatic parasitaemia and a reduced risk of febrile malaria compared to those who were uninfected at baseline. Baseline asymptomatic submicroscopic parasitaemia had a significant effect on associations between anti-schizont antibodies and protection against febrile malaria (likelihood ratio test p<0.001). The study found both baseline P. falciparum asymptomatic microscopic and more strongly submicroscopic infections to be associated with protection against febrile malaria in the ensuing transmission season.

Our understanding of clinical characteristics of liver damage and the relationship with disease severity in COVID-19 is still limited. AIM To investigate the serum hepatic enzyme activities in different phenotypes of COVID-19 patients, evaluate their relationship with the illness severity, and analyze correlation of glycyrrhizin treatment and abnormal liver enzyme activities. METHODS 147 patients with COVID-19 were employed in a retrospective study that investigated hepatic dysfunction. Liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were analyzed in these patients. Patients with diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG) treatment were further investigated. RESULTS Of the 147 patients, 56 (38.1%) had abnormal ALT activity and 80 (54.4%) had abnormal AST activity. The peak of abnormal hepatic enzyme activities occurred at 3 to 6 days after on admission. Serum AST and LDH levels were elevated, while the SOD level was decreased in severe and critical patients, compared with mild cases. DG treatment may alleviate the abnormal liver enzyme activities in non-critical COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal liver functions may be observed in patients with COVID-19, which were associated with SARS-CoV-2 induced acute liver damage. Glycyrrhizin treatment may be an effective therapeutic approach for the outcome of abnormal hepatic enzyme activities in severe COVID-19 cases. Serum hepatic enzyme tests may reflect the illness severity and should be monitored. This article is protected by copyright.

CT scans are often over-utilized and ordered before a surgeon has evaluated the patient. Our aim was to develop a tool using machine learning (ML) algorithms that would help determine if there would be benefit in obtaining a CT scan prior to surgeon consultation. METHODS Retrospective chart review of 100 randomly selected cases who underwent appendectomy and 100 randomly selected controls was completed. Variables included components of the patient's history, laboratory values, CT readings, and pathology. Pathology was used as the gold standard for appendicitis diagnosis. All variables were then used to build the ML algorithms. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayesian Network Classifiers (BNC) models with and without CT scan results were trained and compared to CT scan results alone and the Alvarado score using area under the Receiver Operator Curve (ROC), sensitivity, and specificity measures as well as calibration indices from 500 bootstrapped samples. RESULTS Among the cases that underwent appendectomy, 88% had pathology-confirmed appendicitis. All the ML algorithms had better sensitivity, specificity, and ROC than the Alvarado score. SVM with and without CT had the best indices and could predict if imaging would aid in appendicitis diagnosis. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that SVM with and without CT results can be used for selective imaging in the diagnosis of appendicitis. This study serves as the initial step and proof-of-concept to externally validate these results with larger and more diverse patient population.","Gunasingha, Rathnayaka M K D; Grey, Scott F; Munoz, Beau; Schobel, Seth; Lee, Joseph; Erwin, Casey; Irons, Thomas; McMillan, Elizabeth; Unselt, Desiree; Elster, Eric; Bradley, Matthew",World journal of surgery,234,1

The potential benefits of patient-centric sampling far outweigh the short-term challenges associated with implementation of this disruptive approach. This is especially true given we are amid a global pandemic and enabling patients to sample at home would help not only clinical trials, but healthcare in general. This perspective article aims to convince the reader that patient-centric sampling is a reality and that we are on the cusp of an information revolution in clinical trials that will be enabled by patient-centric (e.g., at home) sampling.","P Bateman, Kevin",Bioanalysis,234,8

Association analyses of estimated breeding values (EBVs) were performed for 41,028 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and permutation analysis was used to empirically establish the genome-wide significance threshold (P < 0.05) for each trait. SNPs significantly associated with each trait were used in a forward selection algorithm to identify genomic regions putatively harbouring genes with effects on each trait. A total of 53, 66 and 68 SNPs explained 54.12% (24.10%), 62.69% (29.85%) and 55.13% (26.54%) of the additive genetic variation (when accounting for the genomic relationships) in steer breeding values for AFI, RFI and ADG, respectively, within this population. Evaluation by pathway analysis revealed that many of these SNPs are in genomic regions that harbour genes with metabolic functions. The presence of genetic correlations between traits resulted in 13.2% of SNPs selected for AFI and 4.5% of SNPs selected for RFI also being selected for ADG in the analysis of breeding values. While our study identifies panels of SNPs significant for efficiency traits in our population, validation of all SNPs in independent populations will be necessary before commercialization.","Rolf, M M; Taylor, J F; Schnabel, R D; McKay, S D; McClure, M C; Northcutt, S L; Kerley, M S; Weaber, R L",Animal genetics,234,0

There are no financial limitations to access to treatment in most countries. Patients in these countries have access to at least one pangenotypic regimen. The most common barriers to the elimination of HCV in Central Europe are a lack of established national screening programmes and limited political commitment to the elimination of HCV.

A lethal plague is described in this drama. We adopted a critical approach to Oedipus Rex in analyzing the literary description of the disease, unraveling its clinical features, and defining a possible underlying cause. Our goals were to clarify whether the plague described in Oedipus Rex reflects an actual historical event; to compare it with the plague of Athens, which was described by Thucydides as occurring around the same time Sophocles wrote; and to propose a likely causative pathogen. A critical reading of Oedipus Rex and a comparison with Thucydides' history, as well as a systematic review of historical data, strongly suggests that this epidemic was an actual event, possibly caused by Brucella abortus.","Kousoulis, Antonis A; Economopoulos, Konstantinos P; Poulakou-Rebelakou, Effie; Androutsos, George; Tsiodras, Sotirios",Emerging infectious diseases,234,1

However, it is critically dependent on the effective gas-liquid transfer of hydrogen, which is a sparingly soluble gas. Very little is known about the impact of liquid and gas flow and bubble size on gas-liquid transfer during H2 injection in full-scale anaerobic digesters. A computational fluid dynamic model was developed using a two-fluid approach for non-Newtonian liquid in the open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) platform, OpenFOAM. The newly developed model was validated against published experimental data-sets of a gas-mixed, laboratory-scale anaerobic digester, with good agreement between the numerical and experimental velocity fields. The hydrodynamics of the full-scale in-situ biomethanation system using venturi ejectors for H2 injection was then simulated to investigate gas-liquid dynamics, including gas-liquid mass transfer, at different operational conditions. Gas-liquid mixing is mainly controlled by the gas-plumes interaction, which promotes turbulence at the interaction zone, resulting in increasing gas bubbles mixing with the liquid and the gas-liquid interfacial area. However, beyond the plume interaction zone, the digester had flow short-circuiting and inactive zones. It was found that, due to this short-circuiting behaviour, an increase in gas flow-rate may not be an effective option in reducing inactive zones, although it can increase the gas-liquid interfacial area. Comparative analysis of the impact of gas flow and bubble size indicated that gas flow had a linear effect on both kLa and gas holdup, but that bubble size had a non-linear impact, with higher kLa values achieved at bubble sizes less than 2 mm. Comparison against measured data in the same system indicated the predicted kLa values were at the same level as measured kLa, at a bubble size of 2 mm.","Ahmmed, Mohammad Shakil; Jensen, Mads Borgbjerg; Kofoed, Michael V W; Ottosen, Lars D M; Batstone, Damien J",Water research,234,24

By combining cryo-electron microscopy and biochemistry, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds to the human 40S subunit in ribosomal complexes, including the 43S pre-initiation complex and the non-translating 80S ribosome. The protein inserts its C-terminal domain into the mRNA channel, where it interferes with mRNA binding. We observe translation inhibition in the presence of Nsp1 in an in vitro translation system and in human cells. Based on the high-resolution structure of the 40S-Nsp1 complex, we identify residues of Nsp1 crucial for mediating translation inhibition. We further show that the full-length 5' untranslated region of the genomic viral mRNA stimulates translation in vitro, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 combines global inhibition of translation by Nsp1 with efficient translation of the viral mRNA to allow expression of viral genes.","Schubert, Katharina; Karousis, Evangelos D; Jomaa, Ahmad; Scaiola, Alain; Echeverria, Blanca; Gurzeler, Lukas-Adrian; Leibundgut, Marc; Thiel, Volker; Mühlemann, Oliver; Ban, Nenad",Nature structural & molecular biology,234,0

We performed a retrospective review of data for consecutive patients with venous sinus thrombosis who underwent endovascular treatment between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2013 at participating institutions. We identified a total of 13 patients with a diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis. The most frequently utilized type of endovascular intervention was the Penumbra aspiration system (Penumbra Inc., Alameda, California, USA) (nine cases), followed by local infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (bolus and/or drip in six cases) and stent retrievers (Solitaire FR (Covidien, Irvine, California, USA) in three cases and Trevo (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA) in one case).

High cervical and skull base dissections are often more challenging to treat because of the distal location and tortuous anatomy. The Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) may be a reasonable treatment option for this indication. OBJECTIVES To report a case series of patients treated with the PED for high cervical and skull base dissections, focusing on their presentation, indications for treatment, dissection revascularization success, and pseudoaneurysm obliteration evaluated by imaging, and to review available pertinent literature. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all cases of high cervical and skull base dissections treated with a PED at our institution. Patient clinical characteristics, presentation, procedural and follow-up imaging, and clinical course were analyzed to evaluate for procedure complications, dissection revascularization success, pseudoaneurysm obliteration, and clinical outcome. RESULTS This is a retrospective case series including 11 patients with 13 carotid dissections treated in our center. There were nine traumatic and four spontaneous dissections. The most common presentation was cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack (CVA/TIA; 5 patients) and headache/face pain (4 patients). Eleven dissections were associated with pseudoaneurysms. Three patients failed medical management with anticoagulation, although flow-limiting stenosis was the main indication for endovascular intervention. Up to three PEDs per vessel were deployed. Angioplasty was used in 10 cases. Complete revascularization (<10% residual stenosis) was achieved in 91% of vessels and 50% of pseudoaneurysms were completely or near completely obliterated immediately after PED(s) deployment. Proximal iatrogenic dissection was the only intraoperative complication. Follow-up imaging was available for nine treated vessels and demonstrated patent PEDs without significant in-stent stenosis up to 9 months after intervention. 75% of pseudoaneurysms were completely obliterated at follow-up. One PED partially collapsed but had no neurological consequences. There were no new CVA/TIAs. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience with treatment of high cervical and skull base dissections with the PED appears to show that this technique may be a safe and viable treatment option. However, long-term results are needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of such treatment.","Brzezicki, Grzegorz; Rivet, Dennis J; Reavey-Cantwell, John",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,234,1

OBJECTIVES To assess the role of ultrasound in muscle monitoring during MV in respiratory patients. METHODS Eligible 68 mechanically ventilated patients were consecutively enrolled. Serial ultrasound measurements of diaphragmatic thickness at the end of inspiration (Tdi) and mid-upper arm (MUA) muscle thickness were recorded every other day till weaning. Before discharge, functional status score (FSS) was assessed. RESULTS Tdi decreased in 72.1%, did not change in 13.2% and increased in 14.7% of the patients. MUA muscle thickness decreased in 47.17% and did not change in others. Significant correlation between Tdi and MUA muscle thickness change was found (r = 0.404, P = 0.001); however, MUA muscle thickness change could not predict Tdi change (B = 0.067, P = 0.059). Diaphragmatic and MUA thickness change showed significant negative correlation with ICU stay (r = -0.260, -0.647, P = 0.032, <0.001) and MV duration (r = -0.335, -0.596, P = 0.005, <0.001), respectively. Weaning failure was significantly higher among patients with decreased Tdi (64.28%) and FSS was significantly lower in those with decreased MUA muscle thickness. US measurements of Tdi and MUA muscle thickness showed excellent intra-observer (ICC = 0.996, 0.999, P < 0.001) and inter-observer agreement (ICC = 0.992, 0.998, P < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION Sonographic muscle monitoring during MV is promising. Changes in the diaphragmatic thickness during MV are common and weakly related to those of peripheral muscles. Early decreased muscle thickness heralds poor weaning and functional outcome.","Thabet, Duaa B; Makhlouf, Hoda A; Hasan, Ali A; Mekkawy, Ahmed I; Ghanem, Maha K",The clinical respiratory journal,234,1

Currently, health technology assessment (HTA) tends to be static and a priori: alternatives are compared before launch, and little evaluation occurs after implementation. We suggest a method that builds upon the current pre-launch HTA procedures by conceptualizing a mean-variance approach to the continuous evaluation of attainable portfolios of interventions in health systems. Our framework uses frontier analysis to identify the desirability of available health interventions so decision makers can choose diverse portfolios based upon information about expected returns and risks. This approach facilitates the extension of existing methods and assessments beyond the traditional concern with pre-adoption data, a much-needed innovation given the challenges posed by COVID-19.","Baines, Darrin; Disegna, Marta; Hartwell, Christopher A",Social science & medicine,234,27

However, several case-matched studies failed to demonstrate superiority of MIPD, and large registry studies from the USA even suggested increased mortality for MIPDs performed in low-volume (<10 MIPDs annually) centers. Randomized controlled multicenter trials are lacking but clearly required. We hypothesize that time to functional recovery is shorter after MIPD compared with open pancreatoduodenectomy, even in an enhanced recovery setting. METHODS/DESIGN LEOPARD-2 is a randomized controlled, parallel-group, patient-blinded, multicenter, phase 2/3, superiority trial in centers that completed the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group LAELAPS-2 training program for laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy or LAELAPS-3 training program for robot-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy and have performed ≥ 20 MIPDs. A total of 136 patients with symptomatic benign, premalignant, or malignant disease will be randomly assigned to undergo minimally invasive or open pancreatoduodenectomy in an enhanced recovery setting. After the first 40 patients (phase 2), the data safety monitoring board will assess safety outcomes (not blinded for treatment allocation) and decide on continuation to phase 3. Patients from phase 2 will then be included in phase 3. The primary outcome measure is time (days) to functional recovery. All patients will be blinded for the surgical approach, at least until postoperative day 5, but preferably until functional recovery has been attained. Secondary outcome measures are operative and postoperative outcomes, including clinically relevant complications, mortality, quality of life, and costs.

Our previous studies reported physiological and pathological roles for mMCP-4 in the maturation and synthesis of the vasoactive peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) from its precursor, big endothelin-1 (big ET-1). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of mast cell degranulation or stabilization on mMCP-4-dependent pressor responses following the administration of big ET‑1 or Angiotensin I (Ang I). In anesthetized mice, mast cell degranulation induced by Compound 48/80 (C48/80) or stabilization by cromolyn enhanced or repressed, respectively, the dose-dependent vasopressor responses to big ET-1 in wild-type (WT) mice but not in mMCP-4 knockout mice in a chymase inhibitor (TY‑51469)-sensitive fashion. In addition, mMCP-4 dependent hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was depleted or enhanced in peritoneal mast cells isolated from mice pre-treated with C48/80 or cromolyn, respectively. Furthermore, C48/80 or cromolyn markedly increased or abolished, respectively, ET-1 (1-31) conversion from exogenous big ET-1 in WT mice peritoneal fluid-isolated mast cells, in vitro. Finally, the vasopressor responses to Ang I were unaffected by mast cell activation or stabilization, whereas those induced by the Angiotensin-converting enzyme-resistant Ang I analogue, [Pro11, D-Ala12] Ang I, were potentiated by C48/80. Altogether, the present study shows that mast cell activation enhances the mMCP‑4 dependent vasoactive properties of big ET-1 but not Ang I in the mouse model. Significance Statement The current work demonstrates a significant role for mast cell stability in the cardiovascular pharmacology of big ET-1 but not Ang I in the murine systemic circulation. This study also demonstrate for the first time that an ACE-resistant Ang I analogue is susceptible to chymase-dependent activation in the mouse model.","Vincent, Laurence; Lapointe, Catherine; Lo, Modou; Gagnon, Hugo; Pejler, Gunnar; Takai, Shinji; Day, Robert; D'Orleans-Juste, Pedro",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,234,1

The Cape Town Declaration on Access to Cardiac Surgery in the Developing World was published in August 2018, signaling the commitment of the global cardiac surgery and cardiology communities to improving care for rheumatic heart disease patients. METHODS As the Cape Town Declaration formed the basis for which the Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance was formed, the purpose of this article is to describe the history of the Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance, its formation, ongoing activities, and future directions, including the announcement of selected pilot sites. RESULTS The Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance is an international alliance consisting of representatives from major cardiothoracic surgical societies and the World Heart Federation. Activities have included meetings at annual conferences, exhibit hall participation for advertisement and recruitment, and publication of selection criteria for cardiac surgery centers to apply for Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance support. Criteria focused on local operating capacity, local championing, governmental and facility support, appropriate identification of a specific gap in care and desire to engage in future research. Eleven applications were received for which three finalist sites were selected and site visits conducted.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether there is a relation between handedness and the depth of the olfactory sulcus (OS) and reinvestigate whether there is a lateralization of OS depth. METHODS Forty-two healthy volunteers (mean age 24.1 years; 23 right-handed and 19 left-handed) participated. The subjects' brains were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging to assess OS depth. Normal olfactory function was ascertained using the Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test. RESULTS There was no significant difference in OS depth between right- and left-handed participants (right-handed mean: right OS depth = 11.3 mm, left OS = 10.6 mm; left-handed mean: right OS = 11.3 mm, left OS = 11.0 mm). Across all subjects, OS depth was significantly larger on the right side compared to the left. CONCLUSION Handedness has no major influence on OS depth. The present study confirmed that the right OS is deeper compared to the left OS, possibly indicating a right-sided lateralization of the olfactory system. IMPLICATIONS The depth of the right OS is larger than that of the left OS. No major effect of handedness was observed.","Zang, Yunpeng; Whitcroft, Katie L; Glöckler, Carmina; Hummel, Thomas",ORL; journal for oto-rhino-laryngology and its related specialties,234,28

In the light of the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the most efficient tool to find therapeutic solution. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to summarize in vitro data of current agents used for the management of SARSCoV-2 all over the world. METHODS A literature search of articles from January 2000 until April 2020 was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library to assess in vitro data of current or putative therapies for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Although in vitro studies are scarce, data regarding chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, ivermectin, lopinavir, homoharringtonine and emetine seem promising. CONCLUSION Scientist all over the world should work together and increase their efforts in order to find feasible and efficient solutions against this new global viral threat.","Anastasiou, Ioanna A; Eleftheriadou, Ioanna; Tentolouris, Anastasios; Tsilingiris, Dimitrios; Tentolouris, Nikolaos",Current medicinal chemistry,234,16

The aims of the present study were to investigate the pathogenicity of M. gallisepticum in 14-day-old pheasants and evaluate the macrolide antibiotic tylvalosin (TVN) as a treatment for infectious sinusitis. The minimum inhibitory concentration of TVN for five isolates of M. gallisepticum taken from pheasants confirmed their susceptibility to TVN (range: 0.002 to 0.008 µg/ml). One of the isolates (G87/02) was inoculated intranasally into 72 pheasants (two groups of 36) at 14 days of age. Eight days later, when 18/72 (25%) of the pheasants showed clinical signs, one group was treated with 25 mg TVN/kg bodyweight daily in drinking water for three consecutive days. An uninfected, unmedicated control group (n=12) was also included. In contrast to the uninfected control group, a range of clinical signs typical of infectious sinusitis with varying severity was observed in challenged birds and M. gallisepticum was re-isolated from the infraorbital sinus and the eye/conjunctiva at necropsy, 22 days post challenge. In comparison with untreated birds, medication with TVN significantly reduced clinical signs and the re-isolation/detection of M. gallisepticum (P≤0.0021). The daily liveweight gain of treated birds was significantly increased in comparison with untreated birds (P=0.0002), and similar to daily liveweight gains observed in the uninfected control group. In conclusion, TVN at 25 mg/kg bodyweight daily for three consecutive days in drinking water was efficacious in the treatment of M. gallisepticum infection induced by challenging 14-day-old pheasants.","Forrester, C Anne; Bradbury, Janet M; Dare, Cynthia M; Domangue, Rickie J; Windsor, Helena; Tasker, John B; Mockett, A P Adrian",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,234,30

METHOD MBS item service data were extracted for COVID-19 psychiatrist video and telephone telehealth item numbers corresponding to the pre-existing in-person consultations for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Northern Territory (NT), South Australia (SA) and Tasmania. RESULTS The overall rate of consultations (face-to-face and telehealth) increased during March and April 2020, compared to the monthly face-to-face consultation average, excepting Tasmania. Compared to an annual monthly average of in-person consultations for July 2018-June 2019, total telepsychiatry consultations were higher for April than May. For total video and telephone telehealth consultations combined, video consultations were lower in April and higher in May. As a percentage of combined telehealth and in-person consultations, telehealth was greater for April and lower for May compared to the monthly face-to-face consultation average. CONCLUSIONS In the smaller states/territories, the private practice workforce rapidly adopted COVID-19 MBS telehealth items, with the majority of psychiatric consultation shifting to telehealth initially, and then returning to face-to-face. With a second wave of COVID-19 in Australia, telehealth is likely to remain a vital part of the national mental health strategy.","Looi, Jeffrey Cl; Allison, Stephen; Bastiampillai, Tarun; Pring, William",Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,234,1

The present study aimed to analyse the relationship between perceived mattering to family and friends, metastereotypes, and well-being among two minority groups: people living with HIV (PLWHA) and people with disabilities (PWDs). Of 100 participants, 39 were living with HIV and 61 were individuals with disabilities. Multiple regression analyses showed that positive (more than negative) metastereotypes could significantly predict perceived mattering and well-being among both groups. Mattering to both family and friends significantly predicted many dimensions of well-being among both PLWHA and PWDs. These findings show that perception of mattering is related to the well-being of minority group members. Interventions aimed at improving the well-being of individuals who belong to minority groups should focus on positive metastereotypes and the perception of being important to significant others, considering both friends and family members.","Matera, Camilla; Meringolo, Patrizia; Reino, Mattia","Psychology, health & medicine",234,24

To address this issue, we developed Proactive Integrated Care (Proactive iCare), a healthcare delivery model that couples integrated care with remote monitoring. Methods We conducted a prospective, quasi-randomized clinical trial in 511 patients with advanced COPD or a recent COPD exacerbation, to test whether Proactive iCare impacts patient-centered outcomes and healthcare utilization. Patients were allocated to Proactive iCare (n = 352) or Usual Care (n = 159), and were examined for changes in quality of life using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), symptoms, guideline-based care, and healthcare utilization. Findings Proactive iCare improved total SGRQ by 7 - 9 units (p < 0.0001), symptom SGRQ by 9 units (p < 0.0001), activity SGRQ by 6 - 7 units (p < 0.001) and impact SGRQ by 7 - 11 units (p < 0.0001) at 3, 6 and 9 months compared with Usual Care. Proactive iCare increased the 6-minute walk distance by 40 m (p < 0.001), reduced annual COPD-related urgent office visits by 76 visits per 100 subjects (p < 0.0001), identified unreported exacerbations, and decreased smoking (p = 0.01). Proactive iCare also improved symptoms, the BODE index and oxygen titration (p < 0.05). Mortality in the Proactive iCare group (1.1%) was not significantly different than mortality in the Usual Care group (3.8%; p = 0.08).

A Meta-analysis.,17.135653,9.376127,2021-05-31,"Healthcare waste is a rampant issue in Australian hospitals. The operating room (OR) contributes disproportionately to total hospital waste. There has been considerable research in the literature concentrating on strategies to improve OR and hospital waste accumulation, in an attempt to provide guidance and direction on how to reduce the healthcare ecological footprint. We reviewed the literature for leading greening initiatives currently utilised in the OR in Australia and internationally. This narrative literature review focuses on the trend of OR greening initiatives over the last 25 years, comparing different innovative approaches, the successes and setbacks, and the financial implications of initiatives. A variety of measures that hospital management, surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and other healthcare personnel can take to reduce the ecological footprint of their healthcare facility are outlined. Greening initiatives include reducing, recycling, reusing, rethinking and researching, as well as novel technology and smarter architectural design. We also evaluated the barriers to improving waste management, which include lack of leadership, misconceptions among staff, and an overall resistance to change. In conclusion, in a world where greenhouse gas emissions cause unprecedented climate change and landfill space is finite, it is incumbent upon hospitals to help reduce the environmental impact of their facility. Reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions would moderate the incidence of human disease, save money for the healthcare system and society as a whole, and contribute to a safer and healthier world we all would like to live in.","Wyssusek, Kerstin H; Keys, Maggie T; van Zundert, André A J","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",234,16

METHODS Gastric cancer cell lines MGC803 and BGC823 were treated by 0, 0.3%, 1%, 3% and 10% KAI for 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. The cell proliferation was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry. Interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The protein expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin E, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, p21, retinoblastoma (RB), protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT3 were detected by Western blot. RESULTS KAI inhibited the proliferation of MGC803 and BGC823 gastric cancer cells in dose- and time-dependent manner. After treated with KAI for 48 h, the proportion of G1 phase was increased, expression level of cyclin D1 and phosphorylation-RB were down-regulated, whereas the expression of p21 was up-regulated (all P<0.01). Furthermore, 48-h treatment with KAI decreased the phosphorylation level of STAT3, inhibited the mRNA and protein expressions of IL-6 (all P<0.01). IL-6 at dose of 10 ng/mL significantly attenuated the proliferative effect of both 3% and 10% KAI, and recovered KAI-inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 expression level (all P<0.01). CONCLUSION KAI exerted an anti-proliferative function by inhibiting IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway followed by the induction of G1 phase arrest in gastric cancer cells.","Zheng, Chun-Lei; Hou, Ke-Zuo; Wang, An-Qi; Fang, Wan-Xia; Yu, Shi-Tong; Liang, Jin-E; Qi, Hai-Yan; Qu, Xiu-Juan; Liu, Yun-Peng; Che, Xiao-Fang",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,234,1

The main limitation to widespread use is its dependence on the operator training and experience. COVID-19 lung ultrasound findings predominantly reflect a pneumonitis pattern, with pleural effusion being infrequent. However, pleural effusion is easy to detect and to quantify, therefore it was selected as the subject of this study, which aims to develop an automated system for the interpretation of LUS of pleural effusion. A LUS dataset was collected at the Royal Melbourne Hospital which consisted of 623 videos containing 99,209 2D ultrasound images of 70 patients using a phased array transducer. A standardized protocol was followed that involved scanning six anatomical regions providing complete coverage of the lungs for diagnosis of respiratory pathology. This protocol combined with a deep learning algorithm using a Spatial Transformer Network provides a basis for automatic pathology classification on an image-based level. In this work, the deep learning model was trained using supervised and weakly supervised approaches which used frame- and video-based ground truth labels respectively. The reference was expert clinician image interpretation. Both approaches show comparable accuracy scores on the test set of 92.4% and 91.1%, respectively, not statistically significantly different. However, the video-based labelling approach requires significantly less effort from clinical experts for ground truth labelling.","Tsai, Chung-Han; van der Burgt, Jeroen; Vukovic, Damjan; Kaur, Nancy; Demi, Libertario; Canty, David; Wang, Andrew; Royse, Alistair; Royse, Colin; Haji, Kavi; Dowling, Jason; Chetty, Girija; Fontanarosa, Davide",Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics,234,1

Countries worldwide have been affected by the recent outbreak caused by the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 virus. As with prior viral pandemics, health-care workers are at increased risk. Orthopaedic surgical procedures are common in health-care systems, ranging from emergency to elective procedures. Many orthopaedic surgical procedures are life or limb-saving and cannot be postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic because of potential patient harm. Our goal is to analyze how orthopaedic surgeons can perform medically necessary procedures during the pandemic and to help guide decision-making perioperatively. METHODS We performed a review of the existing literature regarding COVID-19 and prior viral outbreaks to help guide clinical practice in terms of how to safely perform medically necessary orthopaedic procedures during the pandemic for both asymptomatic patients and high-risk (e.g., COVID-19-positive) patients. We created a classification system based on COVID-19 positivity, patient health status, and COVID-19 prevalence to help guide perioperative decision-making. RESULTS We advocate that only urgent and emergency surgical procedures be performed. By following recommendations from the American College of Surgeons, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the recent literature, safe orthopaedic surgery and perioperative care can be performed. Screening measures are needed for patients and perioperative teams. Surgeons and perioperative teams at risk for contracting COVID-19 should use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), when risk of viral spread is high. When preparing for medically necessary orthopaedic procedures during the pandemic, our classification system will help to guide decision-making. A multidisciplinary care plan is needed to ensure patient safety with medically necessary orthopaedic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic can be performed safely when medically necessary but should be rare for COVID-19-positive or high-risk patients. Appropriate screening, PPE use, and multidisciplinary care will allow for safe medically necessary orthopaedic surgery to continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic Level V.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 54 patients who admitted to Tongji hospital from February 3, 2020 to February 24, 2020 and met the criteria of severe or critical conditions of COVID-19. The clinical characteristics and hospital mortality rate were analyzed and compared between the patients with or without myocardial injury, which was defined with 3 times higher serum cardiac troponin value. Results: The median age of the 54 patients was 68 (59.8, 74.3) years. Among all the patients, 24 (44.4%) patients were complicated with hypertension, 13 (24.1%) with diabetes, 8 (14.8%) with coronary heart disease, and 3 (5.6%) with previous cerebral infarction. During hospitalization, 24 (44.4%) of the patients were complicated with myocardial injury and 26 (48.1%) patients died in hospital. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with myocardial injury than in patients without myocardial injury (14 (60.9%) vs. 8 (25.8%), P=0.013). Moreover, the levels of C-reactive protein (153.6 (80.3, 240.7) ng/L vs. 49.8 (15.9, 101.9) ng/L) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (852.0 (400.0, 2 315.3) ng/L vs. 197.0 (115.3, 631.0) ng/L) were significantly higher than patients without myocardial injury (all P<0.01). Conclusions: Prevalence of myocardial injury is high among severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients. Severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury face a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The study suggests that it is important to monitor and manage the myocardial injury during hospitalization for severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients.","He, X W; Lai, J S; Cheng, J; Wang, M W; Liu, Y J; Xiao, Z C; Xu, C; Li, S S; Zeng, H S",Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi,234,9

DUB activity is usually assayed using full-length ubiquitin, and these enzymes generally show low activity towards small substrates that constitute the P4-P1 LRGG (Lys-Arg-Gly-Gly) C-terminal motif of ubiquitin. To gain insight into the C-terminal recognition region of ubiquitin by DUBs, we synthesized positional scanning libraries of fluorigenic tetrapeptides and tested them on three examples of human DUBs [OTU-1 (ovarian tumour 1), Iso-T (isopeptidase T) and UCH-L3 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3)] and one viral ubiquitin-specific protease, namely PLpro (papain-like protease) from SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus. In most cases the results show flexibility in the P4 position, very high specificity for arginine in the P3 position and glycine in the P2 position, in accord with the sequence of the natural substrate, ubiquitin. Surprisingly, screening of the P2 position revealed that UCH-L3, in contrast with all the other tested DUBs, demonstrates substantial tolerance of alanine and valine at P2, and a parallel analysis using the appropriate mutation of the full-length ubiquitin confirms this. We have also used an optimal tetrapeptide substrate, acetyl-Lys-Arg-Gly-Gly-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, to investigate the activation mechanism of DUBs by ubiquitin and elevated salt concentration. Together, our results reveal the importance of the dual features of (1) substrate specificity and (2) the mechanism of ubiquitin binding in determining deubiquitination by this group of proteases.","Drag, Marcin; Mikolajczyk, Jowita; Bekes, Miklos; Reyes-Turcu, Francisca E; Ellman, Jonathan A; Wilkinson, Keith D; Salvesen, Guy S",The Biochemical journal,234,5

Few data about prevalence, clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 among psoriatic patients were reported. The aims of this study were 1) to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 in psoriatic patients treated with biologic agents during the first phase of the emergency (22 February to 22 April 2020) in Italy, and 2) to report the clinical outcomes of patients who have been exposed to individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, aged ≥18 years and undergoing treatment with biologic agents as of 22 February 2020, were eligible to be included in PSO-BIO-COVID study. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients using any biologic for psoriasis treatment between 22 February and 22 April 2020 were registered. For all confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, data about concomitant disease, ongoing therapies, and comorbidities were also reported. Results A total of 12,807 psoriatic patients were included in the PSO-BIO-COVID study. In this cohort twenty-six patients (0.2%) had a swab confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eleven patients required hospitalization and two died. 125 of 12807 patients (1.0%) with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 under quarantine or active health surveillance, were reported. Conclusion The incidence of COVID-19 observed in our cohort of psoriatic patients (0.2%) is similar to that seen in the general population (0.31%) in Italy.

97719,97719,97719,Endovascular Thrombus Removal for Acute Iliofemoral Deep Vein Thrombosis.,16.667109,9.764066,2019,"BACKGROUND We sought to evaluate the performance in terms of absolute humidity (AH), relative humidity (RH), and temperature of different heated humidifiers (HH) and circuits that are commonly used to deliver high-flow oxygen therapy in conventional ranges (30-60 L/min) and unconventional ranges (70-100 L/min). METHODS In this prospective, observational study, an electronic thermohygrometer was used to obtain the required measurements. A mechanical ventilator was used as a source for high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. For active humidification, the following equipment was used: a HH with standard disposable water trap circuit, 3 servo-controlled HH, and 7 circuits with a heated wire. Data on environmental conditions (ie, temperature, RH, AH) were collected from the laboratory during each measurement; the temperature, RH, and AH resulting from the application of 8 flows (30-100 L/min) were also recorded. Variables were compared with analysis of variance for repeated measurements with Tukey post hoc tests. A value of P < .05 was assumed to be significant. RESULTS During the study, a statistically significant difference was found in the average AH for each flow for the different devices (P < .005). The highest AH values were recorded with the Fisher & Paykel MR850 and the Medtronic-DAR circuit (AH = 40.8 mg/L with flow of 50 L/min, P < .005), and the lowest AH values were recorded with the Flexicare FL9000 HH and the Flexicare circuit (AH = 11.4 mg/L with 100 L/min flow, P < .005). For flows > 50 L/min, the best performance for all flows in terms of AH was found with the Fisher & Paykel MR850 HH, regardless of the circuit used. CONCLUSIONS During oxygen therapy with very high gas flows, HH devices behave differently and in many cases are inefficient in delivering adequate humidification, even at conventional flows. Caution is therefore recommended when selecting the device and flow settings for the implementation of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy.","Plotnikow, Gustavo A; Villalba, Darío; Gogniat, Emiliano; Quiroga, Corina; Pérez Calvo, Eliana; Scapellato, José Luis",Respiratory care,234,1

A set of six LAMP primers was designed to amplify the target RNA by incubation with Bst DNA polymerase plus reverse transcriptase and the reaction was optimised at 65 degrees C for 60 min. Three different methods for detection of the amplified product by naked eye gave identical results to gel electrophoresis, which was run for confirmation. Negative results obtained with RNA from four other fish viruses confirmed the specificity of the test. The IPNV-RT-LAMP assay demonstrated superior analytical sensitivity compared to conventional RT-PCR conducted according to published methods (1:10(12) dilution of RNA extracted from an IPNV-infected cell culture supernatant vs. 1:10(6) for the conventional RT-PCR). The feasibility of the RT-LAMP assay for detection of IPNV RNA in clinical specimen was authenticated using kidney tissue samples from experimentally IPNV-infected Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) post-smolts. The results suggest that the RT-LAMP is a rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic assay for IPNV which lends itself well to use in aquaculture health management and disease control.","Soliman, Hatem; Midtlyng, Paul J; El-Matbouli, Mansour",Journal of virological methods,234,11

The pathogenesis of the disease is imbalance of α/β globin chains. The excess of α-globin chains will form hemichromes which can damage red blood cell membranes and lead to hemolysis, ineffective erythropoiesis, and secondary iron overload. Iron overload in turn can cause complications such as growth retardation, liver cirrhosis, cardiac insufficiency, and aggravate the disease phenotype. In recent decades, genes participating in iron metabolism have been discovered, and the mechanism of iron metabolism in the development of thalassemia has gradually been elucidated. Subsequently, by manipulating the expression of key genes in iron metabolism such as hepcidin and transferrin receptor, researchers have revealed that iron restriction can improve ineffective hematopoiesis and iron overload, which may provide a potential approach for the treatment of thalassemia. This article reviews the progress of research on iron metabolism-related genes and related pathways in β-thalassemia.","Chen, Diyu; Sun, Xiaofang",Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,234,31

BACKGROUND Factors affecting the recruitment and retention of suitable care workers in aged care are complex and influenced by personal, institutional and societal factors. METHODS A qualitative description study design. RESULTS In total, 32 staff participated in the study. Five main themes were identified: entering aged care with a passion for the job; entering aged care as it is the only employment option; factors attracting care workers to stay in aged care; factors influencing care workers to leave the job; and preferring to work in residential aged care rather than community aged care. CONCLUSION Issues relating to the attraction and retention of aged care workers are influenced by personal, institutional and societal factors. Critical shortages in the aged care workforce make the industry more susceptible to crises such as COVID-19 outbreaks. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING PRACTICE Aged care organizations need to create a positive psychosocial work environment for staff to improve the attraction and retention of skilled care workers. They also need to develop staff recruitment guidelines to ensure care workers with the appropriate skills and training and a passion for working with older adults are selected. Staff development programmes need to focus on learning activities that enable staff to build peers support in the work environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICY There is a need to mandate curriculum to enable nursing students to receive more gerontological education and exposure to aged care throughout their education. Aged care quality standards need to mandate transition support for new graduate nurses.","Xiao, Lily Dongxia; Harrington, Ann; Mavromaras, Kostas; Ratcliffe, Julie; Mahuteau, Stephane; Isherwood, Linda; Gregoric, Carolyn",International nursing review,234,27

Oncology patients are especially vulnerable. Novel point-of-care resources may be useful to rapidly disseminate peer-reviewed information from oncology experts nationwide. We describe our initial experience with distributing this information through a private, curated, virtual collaboration question-and-answer (Q&A) platform for oncologists. METHODS The Q&A database was queried for a 2-month period from March 12 to May 12, 2020. We collected the total number of views and unique viewers for the questions. We classified the questions according to their emphasis (practice management, clinical management, both) and disease type across radiation oncology, medical oncology, gynecologic oncology, and pediatric oncology. RESULTS Seventy-nine questions were approved, 67 of which were answered and generated 49,494 views with 5,148 unique viewers. Most discussions covered clinical management, with breast cancer being the most active disease site. Ten questions covered pediatric oncology and gynecologic oncology. Forty-seven percent of the 11,010 users of the platform visited the website during the 2-month period. CONCLUSION Discussions on the Q&A platform reached a substantial number of oncologists throughout the nation and may help oncologists to modify their treatment in real time with the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic.","Bejjani, Anthony; Burt, Lindsay; Washington, Christina; Terao, Michael; Housri, Samir; Housri, Nadine",JCO clinical cancer informatics,234,1

METHODS Local tumor progression, adverse events, and overall survival were compared in patients who underwent either RFA or SBRT for a single lung tumor measuring 5 cm or smaller. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of two institutions. Informed consent was waived. RESULTS During September 2009 to June 2012, 48 patients [30 males and 18 females, with a mean age ± standard deviation (SD) of 75.0 ± 7.5 years] underwent RFA at one institution and 47 patients (21 males and 26 females, with a mean age ± SD of 77.0 ± 7.5 years) underwent SBRT in another. The mean maximum tumor diameter ± SD was 2.0 ± 0.8 cm (range 0.6-3.9 cm) in the RFA group, and 2.1 ± 0.9 cm (range 0.8-4.7 cm, p = 0.539) in the SBRT group. The RFA and SBRT groups showed similar 3-year local tumor progression [9.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-23.9% vs. 7.0%, 95% CI 0.2-20.2%, p = 0.746] and overall survival rates (86.4%, 95% CI 69.2-94.3% vs. 79.6%, 95% CI 60.6-90.1%, p = 0.738). No factor significantly affected local tumor progression. A maximum tumor size of 2 cm was identified as a prognostic factor in both univariate and multivariate analyses. No death was related to treatment procedures. Major complication rates (Grade 3 adverse events) of the RFA (10.4%, 5/48) and SBRT (8.5%, 4/47, p > 0.999) groups were similar. CONCLUSION For lung tumor patients, lung RFA provided local tumor control and survival that were similar to those achieved using SBRT, with equal safety.","Ochiai, Satoru; Yamakado, Koichiro; Kodama, Hiroshi; Nomoto, Yoshihito; Ii, Noriko; Takaki, Haruyuki; Sakuma, Hajime",International journal of clinical oncology,234,1

These studies were based on old data that reflects outdated practices. In this paper, we wanted to assess the incidence of PE in current assisted reproductive technology (ART) practice. METHODS In this cohort study, we present the incidence of PE in all births in the province of Ontario, Canada, for the years 2013-2017 for FET, IVF-ET, and natural conceptions (NC). We also compare our findings to previous studies in a meta-analysis that includes over 4 million births. RESULTS The results of our study show that contemporary practice of ART results in comparable risk for PE between FET and IVF-ET; however, the risk is higher than NC.

The objective of this study was to analyze treatment feasibility, complications, and safety results in patients treated with the Woven EndoBridge Device Dual-Layer (WEB DL) and Woven EndoBridge Device Single-Layer/Single-Layer Sphere (WEB SL/SLS) in the French Observatory. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with bifurcation aneurysms were included in this prospective, multicenter good clinical practices study. A medical monitor independently analyzed procedural and clinical data. The study started with the WEB DL, and secondarily, the WEB SL/SLS was authorized in the study. RESULTS Between November 2012 and January 2014, 10 French centers included 62 patients with 63 aneurysms. Thirty patients with 31 aneurysms were treated with the WEB DL, and 32 patients with 32 aneurysms, with the WEB SL/SLS. The percentage of anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated with WEB SL/SLS was significantly higher (37.5%) compared with WEB DL (12.9%) (P = .04). The WEB SL/SLS was more frequently used in aneurysms of <10 mm than the WEB DL (respectively, 96.9% and 67.7%; P = .002). Morbidity was similar in both groups (WEB DL, 3.3%; WEB SL/SLS, 3.1%), and mortality was 0.0% in both groups. CONCLUSIONS This comparative study shows increased use of WEB treatment in ruptured, small, and anterior communicating artery aneurysms when using WEB SL/SLS. There was a trend toward fewer thromboembolic complications with the WEB SL/SLS. With both the WEB DL and WEB SL/SLS, the treatment was safe, with low morbidity and no mortality.","Pierot, L; Moret, J; Turjman, F; Herbreteau, D; Raoult, H; Barreau, X; Velasco, S; Desal, H; Januel, A-C; Courtheoux, P; Gauvrit, J-Y; Cognard, C; Soize, S; Molyneux, A; Spelle, L",AJNR.

Pattern recognition receptor proteins detect molecular signatures of virus infection and activate antiviral signaling cascades. The RIG-I-like receptors are cytoplasmic DExD/H box proteins that can specifically recognize virus-derived RNA species as a molecular feature discriminating the pathogen from the host. The RIG-I-like receptor family is composed of three homologous proteins, RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. All of these proteins can bind double-stranded RNA species with varying affinities via their conserved DExD/H box RNA helicase domains and C-terminal regulatory domains. The recognition of foreign RNA by the RLRs activates enzymatic functions and initiates signal transduction pathways resulting in the production of antiviral cytokines and the establishment of a broadly effective cellular antiviral state that protects neighboring cells from infection and triggers innate and adaptive immune systems. The propagation of this signal via the interferon antiviral system has been studied extensively, while the precise roles for enzymatic activities of the RNA helicase domain in antiviral responses are only beginning to be elucidated. Here, current models for RLR ligand recognition and signaling are reviewed.","Bruns, Annie M; Horvath, Curt M",Critical reviews in biochemistry and molecular biology,234,5

In this study, we used a transcriptomic approach and a germ-free (GF) fish model to determine the response of newly hatched zebrafish larvae after 24 h exposure to Pseudozyma sp. when compared to conventionally-raised (CR) larvae. We observed 59 differentially expressed genes in Pseudozyma-exposed GF zebrafish larvae compared to their naïve control siblings. Surprisingly, in CR larvae, there was not a clear transcriptome difference between Pseudozyma-exposed and control larvae. Differentially expressed genes in GF larvae were involved in host metabolic pathways, mainly peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, steroid hormone biosynthesis, drug metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis. We also observed a significant change in the transcript levels of immune-related genes, namely complement component 3a, galectin 2b, ubiquitin specific peptidase 21, and aquaporins. Nevertheless, we did not observe any significant response at the cellular level, since there were no differences between neutrophil migration or proliferation between control and yeast-exposed GF larvae.

Although pediatric COVID-19 patients have been relatively spared compared with adults, recent reports showed an increasing number of critically ill patients with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-c), with marked cardiovascular impairment. Nevertheless, little is known about the relationship between cardiac abnormalities and inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers. OBJECTIVES to investigate echocardiographic abnormalities in pediatric patients with COVID-19 admitted to tertiary hospital. METHODS this was a retrospective longitudinal study, based on the review of medical records and echocardiograms of patients (0-19 years) admitted to a tertiary hospital between March 30 and June 30, 2020. For statistical analysis, the significance level was set at 5% (p < 0.05). RESULTS Forty-eight patients were enrolled, 73% with preexisting diseases, 20 (41.7%) with MIS-c. Median age was 7.5 (0-18.6) years; 27 (56.2%) were male. Median duration of hospitalization was 15.4 (2-92) days and seven (14.6%) patients died. A total of 70 echocardiograms were performed; 66.7% patients were scanned only once and 33.3% multiple times. Twenty-three (48%) patients showed echocardiographic abnormalities: eight (16.6%) left ventricle (LV) systolic dysfunction, six (12.5%) right ventricle (RV) systolic dysfunction and 12 (25%) coronary dilatation (Z-score>+2.5). Echocardiographic abnormalities were significantly associated with MIS-c, admission to the pediatric intensive care unit, multiple organ dysfunction, ventilatory/vasoactive support, and death (p<0.05). Significantly higher d-dimer (ng/mL) levels were detected in patients with LV dysfunction [16733(4157-115668) vs. 2406.5(190-95040)], RV dysfunction [25769(3422-115668) vs. 2803.5(190-95040)] and coronary artery dilation [9652.5(921-115668) vs. 2724(190- 95040)] (p<0.05). CONCLUSION Echocardiographic abnormalities in COVID-19 pediatric patients were frequent and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Exacerbation of the inflammation and coagulation pathways may play an important role in cardiovascular injury in those patients.","Diniz, Maria de Fátima Rodrigues; Cardoso, Maira Freire; Sawamura, Karen Saori Shiraishi; Menezes, Carolina Rocha Brito; Lianza, Alessandro Cavalcanti; Pereira, Maria Fernanda Badue; Litvinov, Nadia; Ferranti, Juliana Ferreira; Forsait, Silvana; Watanabe, Andreia; Farhat, Sylvia Costa Lima; Aikawa, Nadia Emi; Campos, Lucia Maria Arruda; Delgado, Artur Figueiredo; Carneiro-Sampaio, Magda; Carvalho, Werther Brunow de; Silva, Clovis Artur; Leal, Gabriela Nunes",Arquivos brasileiros de cardiologia,234,1

However, evidence of an association between As exposure from food and hypertension risks is sparse. To quantify the association between daily As intake from both food (rice, wheat and potatoes) and drinking water (Aswater) along with total exposure (Astotal) and hypertension risks in a study population in Bihar, India, we conducted an individual level cross-sectional analysis between 2017 and 2019 involving 150 participants. Arsenic intake variables and three indicators of hypertension risks (general hypertension, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)) were derived, and any relationship was quantified using a series of crude and multivariable log-linear or logistic regression models. The prevalence of general hypertension was 40% for the studied population. The median level of HDL was 45 mg/dL while median value of LDL was 114 mg/dL. Apart from a marginally significant positive relationship between As intake from rice and the changes of LDL (p-value = 0.032), no significant positive association between As intake and hypertension risks could be ascertained. In fact, Astotal was found to be associated with lower risks of general hypertension and higher levels of HDL (p-value = 0.020 and 0.010 respectively) whilst general hypertension was marginally associated with lower Aswater (p-value = 0.043). Due to limitations regarding study design and residual confounding, all observed marginal associations should be treated with caution.","Xu, Lingqian; Suman, Sidharth; Sharma, Pushpa; Kumar, Ranjit; Singh, Shatrunjay Kumar; Bose, Nupur; Ghosh, Ashok; Rahman, Mohammad Mahmudur; Polya, David A; Mondal, Debapriya",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,234,31

Among these competing priorities is the issue of access to and affordability of prescription drugs. Here, we outline Biden's plan to directly lower prescription drug spending for payers and patients and to expand access to prescription medications through improved health insurance coverage. These policies could provide important financial protections for Americans against high prescription drug prices. Despite widespread public support for addressing prescription drug prices, many of Biden's plans rely on Congressional action, which will be complicated by the narrow majority held by Democrats in the House and an evenly divided Senate. However, there may be other opportunities to reduce prescription drug spending and improve health insurance enrollment among the uninsured. While directly lowering drug prices would provide the most widespread savings for payers and patients alike, any successful effort to increase the number of Americans enrolled in health insurance or render it more affordable will still likely effectively lower patients' out-of-pocket costs and improve access to prescription drugs.","Gavulic, Kyle A; Dusetzina, Stacie B","Journal of health politics, policy and law",234,5

METHODS Dorsal diaphragmatic excursion (DDE) and ventral diaphragmatic excursion (VDE) were measured using anatomic M-mode ultrasonography of the right hemidiaphragm as PEEP was randomized to -6, -3, +3, and +6 cm H2O from baseline to achieve a positive transpulmonary pressure. Inter-operator variability of DDE was assessed in 10 separate subjects. RESULTS A total of 14 subjects ventilated for ARDS were enrolled. Subjects had a mean age of 54 ± 12 y, mean P aO2 /F IO2 = 137 ± 54 mm Hg, and mean sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score = 14 ± 1). Transpulmonary pressure, DDE, and DDE/VDE ratio increased with incremental PEEP titration (-1.15 cm H2O vs 3.63 cm H2O, P < .001; 4.9 mm vs 8.2 mm, P < .001; and 62% vs 93%, P < .001, respectively). When transpulmonary pressure became positive, a visual increase in DDE and DDE/VDE ratio 0.60 to 0.93 was observed (from 0.48 cm to 0.82 cm, R 2 = 0.87, P = .02; and R 2 = 0.93, P = .006, respectively). There was high agreement in DDE measurements between 2 ultrasonographers (intra-class correlation 0.987, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS DDE was affected by incremental PEEP titration toward a positive transpulmonary pressure. The ultrasound assessment using anatomic M-mode allowed for specific measurement of regional diaphragmatic excursion. This pattern of motion in the dependent regions of the diaphragm during PEEP titration in subjects with ARDS achieving a positive transpulmonary pressure may reflect a potential target for future studies in the bedside assessment for lung recruitment.","Cho, Roy J; Adams, Alex; Ambur, Sum; Lunos, Scott; Shapiro, Robert; Prekker, Matthew E",Respiratory care,234,27

Materials and Methods 3T DW and T1- and T2-weighted imaging sequences were done in 34 patients with biopsy-proven primary HNC of 100 cervical LNs ≥1 cm in diameter. The mean ADC values were compared with histopathologically proven LNs using the independent t-test. ADC cutoff value was evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results The mean ADC value of reactive LN was 1.2933 × 10-3 mm2/s and metastatic LN was 0.908 × 10-3 mm2/s. An ADC cutoff value was 0.868 × 10-3 mm2/s with 84% sensitivity, 96% specificity, 93% accuracy, 87.5% positive predictive value, and 94.7% negative predictive value. A significant difference in mean ADC value between reactive and metastatic LNs was noted (P< 0.001). Conclusion 3T DW-MRI is useful in differentiating reactive and metastatic cervical LNs in HNC patients. However, studies with larger sample size have to be performed to validate ADC threshold value with 3T DW-MRI in differentiating between reactive and metastatic LNs for clinical practice.","Vijayalakshmi, K; Raghuram, P H; Saravanan, K; Krithika, C L; Kannan, A",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,234,12

The high degree of contagiousness as well as the diffusion of the virus through the air and droplets via respiratory transmission placed dental professionals at top-level risk of contracting and spreading the disease. General recommendations were announced in different countries, including patient distancing, air ventilation, surface and instrument sanitization, and the wearing of suitable masks and shields. However, many dental treatments are performed using lasers, and some specific precautions must be added to conventional procedures to ensure the advantages of this technology to patients because of the particular tissue-matter interaction effects of laser wavelengths. OBJECTIVES Based on the literature, the authors evaluated all of using laser wavelengths to analyze the risk and the benefits of using lasers in daily dental practice, and to provide safety recommendations during pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS An unrestricted search of indexed databases was performed. Laser use effects were categorized into: 1) explosive processes that produce tissue ablation and aerosol formation; 2) thermal actions that create vaporization and smoke plume; 3) photobiomodulation of the cells; and 4) enhanced chemical activity. RESULTS Knowledge of the device functions and choice of adequate parameters will reduce aerosol and plume formation, and the application of suction systems with high flow volume and good filtration close to the surgical site will avoid virus dissemination during laser use. In the categories that involve low energy, the beneficial effects of lasers are available and sometimes preferable during this pandemic because only conventional precautions are required. CONCLUSIONS Lasers maintain the potential to add benefits to dental practice even in the COVID-19 era, but it is necessary to know how lasers work to utilize these advantages. The great potential of laser light, with undiscovered limits, may provide a different path to face the severe health challenges of this pandemic.","Arnabat-Dominguez, Josep; Vecchio, Alessandro Del; Todea, Carmen; Grzech-Leśniak, Kinga; Vescovi, Paolo; Romeo, Umberto; Nammour, Samir",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,234,1

The aim of this systematic review is to assess the literature evidence about decorative tattoos complications, considering both infective and non-infective risks. METHODS This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement. We searched the following electronic bibliographic databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science (science and social science citation index). RESULTS The literature search resulted in 6473 studies. A total of 207 full articles were considered potentially relevant and were reviewed independently by researchers. After full-text evaluation, 152 of 207 articles were excluded, as they did not meet selection criteria. The remaining 55 studies were included in the systematic review and their quality assessment was performed. Ten studies reported microbiological complications, 37 reported non-microbiological effects and eight reported either microbiological and non-microbiological complications.

We compared 45 SOT vs 2427 non-SOT patients who were admitted with COVID-19 to our health-care system (3/1/20-8/21/20), evaluating hospital length-of-stay and inpatient mortality using competing risks regression. We compared trajectories of WHO COVID-19 severity scale using mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression, adjusting for severity score at admission. SOT and non-SOT patients had comparable age, sex, and race, but SOT recipients were more likely to have diabetes (60% vs. 34%, p < 0.001), hypertension (69% vs. 44%, p = 0.001), HIV (7% vs 1.4%, p = 0.024), and peripheral vascular disorders (19% vs. 8%, p = 0.018). There were no statistically significant differences between SOT and non-SOT in maximum illness severity score (p = 0.13), length-of-stay (sHR=0.9 1.11.4 , p = 0.5), or mortality (sHR:0.1 0.41.6 , p = 0.19), although the severity score on admission was slightly lower for SOT (median (IQR) 3 (3, 4)) than for non-SOT (median (IQR) 4 (3-4)), (p = 0.042) Despite a higher risk profile, SOT recipients had a faster decline in disease severity over time (OR=0.76 0.810.86 , p < 0.001) compared with non-SOT patients.

We tested the hypotheses that the generalised use of face masks to fight SARS-CoV2 dissemination could change this and sensitise people to respiratory health. METHODS General population polling (1012-person panel demographically representative of the adult French population -quota sampling method-; 517 women, 51%). 860 (85%) answered ""no"" to ""treated for a chronic respiratory disease"" (""respiratory healthy"", RH) and 152 ""yes"" (""respiratory disease"", RD). 14% of RH respondents reported having a close family member treated for a chronic respiratory disease (RH-family+ and RH-family-). Respondents described mask-related attitudes, beliefs, inconveniencies, dyspnoea, and changes in their respiratory health vision . RESULTS: Compliance with masks was high (94.7%). Dyspnoea ranked first among mask inconveniencies (RD 79.3%, RH 67.3%, p=0.013). ""Air hunger"" was the main sensory dyspnoea descriptor. Mask-related dyspnoea was independently associated with belonging to RH-family+ (Odds Ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.85 [1.16-2.98]) and removing masks to improve breathing (OR 5.21 [3.73-7.28]). It was negatively associated with considering masks effective to protect others (OR]: 0.42 [0.25-0.75]). Half the respondents were more concerned with their respiratory health since wearing masks; 41% reported better understanding patients' experiences. ANSWER TO THE QUESTION Wearing protective face masks leads to the mass discovery of breathing discomfort. It raises the public's awareness of what respiratory diseases involve and sensitises to the importance of breathing.

METHODS The study comprised 141 women who underwent TOT for clinically and urodynamically proved stress urinary incontinence. The postoperative ultrasound examination with an endovaginal biplane probe was performed before discharging the patients from hospital. The measurements obtained described the position of the tape relative to the urethra and pubic symphysis, as well as anatomical relationships in the anterior compartment. RESULTS Ninety-six (68.1 %) patients were cured, 27 (19.1 %) significantly improved, and in 18 cases (12.7 %), the surgery failed. The tape position under the midurethra (40-70th percentile of the urethral length) or distal urethra (>70th percentile) coincided with better results (cure rate 67.1 and 82.4 %, respectively) than the location in the proximity of the bladder neck (<40th percentile) (21.4 % cured, p = 0.0015 and p < 0.001, respectively). However, the risk of failure was the lowest when the tape was located under the distal urethra. Other ultrasonographic findings were not related to treatment results. CONCLUSIONS The highest failure rate for 'outside-in' TOT is associated with the location of the tape under the proximal third of the urethra. Both the middle and distal sections of the urethra may be regarded as targets for transobturator tape placement.","Bogusiewicz, Michał; Monist, Marta; Gałczyński, Krzysztof; Woźniak, Magdalena; Wieczorek, Andrzej P; Rechberger, Tomasz",World journal of urology,234,29

METHODS This multi-centre cohort study involved patients aged 18 years and older hospitalised with COVID-19, using routinely collected data. We used Cox regression analysis to assess the impact of age, frailty and delirium on the risk of inpatient mortality, adjusting for sex, illness severity, inflammation and co-morbidities. We used ordinal logistic regression analysis to assess the impact of age, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and delirium on risk of increased care requirements on discharge, adjusting for the same variables. RESULTS Data from 5,711 patients from 55 hospitals in 12 countries were included (median age 74, interquartile range [IQR] 54-83; 55.2% male). The risk of death increased independently with increasing age (>80 versus 18-49: hazard ratio [HR] 3.57, confidence interval [CI] 2.54-5.02), frailty (CFS 8 versus 1-3: HR 3.03, CI 2.29-4.00) inflammation, renal disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer, but not delirium. Age, frailty (CFS 7 versus 1-3: odds ratio 7.00, CI 5.27-9.32), delirium, dementia and mental health diagnoses were all associated with increased risk of higher care needs on discharge. The likelihood of adverse outcomes increased across all grades of CFS from 4 to 9. CONCLUSION Age and frailty are independently associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19. Risk of increased care needs was also increased in survivors of COVID-19 with frailty or older age.","Welch, Carly",Age and ageing,234,31

DESIGN Single-center, prospective, randomized study. SETTING Holding area and operating room at a single-center tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS The study comprised 22 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 3 or 4 patients with severe cardiac disease undergoing S-ICD implantation. INTERVENTIONS Patients received either a combination of serratus anterior plane block and transversus thoracis plane block or surgical infiltration of local anesthetics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Perioperative analgesic medication in the fascial plane block group versus the surgical wound infiltration group, visual analog pain scale score (0-10), intraoperative vital signs, total procedure time, and length of stay in the intensive care unit were measured. Total intraoperative fentanyl requirements (µg) were significantly less in the truncal block group versus the surgical infiltration group (45 [25-50] v 90 [50-100]; p = 0.026), and no patients had any adverse sequelae related to the study. Median intraoperative propofol use in the surgical infiltration group was 66.48 (47.30-73.73) µg/kg/min, and 65.95 (51.86-104.86) µg/kg/min for the truncal block group. This difference between the groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.293). CONCLUSIONS The performance of both the serratus anterior plane block and transversus thoracis plane blocks for S-ICD implantation are appropriate and may have the benefit of decreasing intraoperative opioid requirements.","Shariat, Ali; Ghia, Samit; Gui, Jane L; Gallombardo, Joseph; Bracker, Joseph; Lin, Hung-Mo; Mohammad, Asad; Mehta, Davendra; Bhatt, Himani",Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,234,24

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the psychosomatic effects and the fear of stigma which patients may face after the end of treatment and discharge from hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This was a non-intervention perspective study conducted in the Department of Infectious Diseases of University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis (Greece). Patients on the discharge day completed questionnaires in which 5 topics were evaluated: pain/discomfort, anxiety/distress, fear/worries, stigma and tolerance of treatment. The questionnaires were derived from similar Quality of Life Tools. The total score of each patient was normalized as percentage. RESULTS Females and younger than 40 years old had more worries and fears on discharge day. Significant factors were days of hospitalization, days of fever and need of oxygen therapy. Patients who hospitalized more than 10 days, particularly in isolation negative pressure rooms, with persistent fever more than 7 days and need of oxygen therapy had more anxiety, worries for their clinical condition and fear of stigma. The majority of patients (80%) were expecting to face moderate to severe problems with family members, friends and colleagues underlying the dimensions of stigma. CONCLUSIONS It is crucial to evaluate the psychosocial aspects of this infection and limit the stigma which patients may face returning to their daily routine. Further studies are needed with larger patient series and with the usage of psychometric instruments.","Theano, Penlioglou; Periklis, Panagopoulos; Vasilis, Petrakis; Elli, Kapetanidou; Dimitrios, Papazoglou",Psychiatria Danubina,234,1

We investigated the effect of COVID-19 infection and quarantine on seizure frequency in adult people with epilepsy (PwE) of Apulia and Basilicata regions, Southern Italy. METHODS This is an observational, retrospective study based on prospective data collection of 102 successive PWE. The frequency of seizures was evaluated during pre-quarantine (January- February), quarantine (March-April), and post-quarantine period (May-June), while PwE were divided into A) cases responding to treatment with ≤ 1 seizure per year; B) cases responding to treatment with 2-5 seizure per year; C) cases with drug-resistant epilepsy with ≤ 4 seizures per month; D) cases with drug-resistant epilepsy with 5-10 seizures per month. PwE underwent several self-report questionnaires regarding therapeutic compliance, mood, stress and sleep during quarantine period. RESULTS Approximately 50 % of PwE showed seizure frequency changes (22.55 % an increase and 27.45 % a reduction) during quarantine. Seizure frequency significantly (p < 0.05) increased in PwE responding to treatment with ≤ 1 seizure per year, while significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in PwE with drug-resistant epilepsy with 5-10 seizures per month. The data was not influenced by therapeutic adherence, sleep and depression. The analysis of anxiety showed a moderate level of anxiety in PwE responding to treatment with < 1 seizure per year, while moderate stress was perceived by all PwE. Seizure frequency changes were related to quarantine, but not to COVID-19 infection. In fact, unlike other regions of Italy, particularly Northern Italy, Apulia and Basilicata regions were less affected by COVID-19 infection, and almost all PwE recognized the quarantine as a stressful event. Emotional distress and anxiety due to social isolation, but also the relative reduction of triggers for epileptic seizures were the most important factors for changes in seizure frequency. CONCLUSIONS Our study adds to the growing concern that the indirect effects of COVID-19 pandemic will far outstrip the direct consequences of the infection.","d'Orsi, Giuseppe; Mazzeo, Francesca; Ravidà, Domenico; Di Claudio, Maria Teresa; Sabetta, Annarita; Lalla, Alessandra; Sbrizzi, Stefania; Avolio, Carlo",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,234,16

Myricetin (MYR) is a naturally occurring flavonol having powerful antioxidant activity. The current research was planned to examine the ameliorative role of MYR against NP-induced testicular damage. A total of 24 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 equivalent groups: control (0.1% DMSO), NP group (50 mg kg-1), NP + MYR group (50 mg kg-1; 100 mg kg-1), and MYR-treated group (100 mg kg-1). NP administration significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GSR), and protein content while significantly (p < 0.05) elevating the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Additionally, NP significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the sperm motility, gene expression of testicular steroidogenic enzymes (3β-HSD, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; 17β-HSD, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; StAR, steroidogenic-acute regulatory protein), level of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), plasma testosterone, and daily sperm production (DSP). On the other hand, it raised the testicular cholesterol, dead sperms, and head, midpiece, and tail abnormalities along with abnormal histomorphometry. However, MYR remarkably abrogated NP-induced damages. In conclusion, the outcomes of the study suggest that MYR can effectively alleviate the NP-induced oxidative stress and testicular damages.","Ijaz, Muhammad Umar; Anwar, Haseeb; Iqbal, Shabnoor; Ismail, Hammad; Ashraf, Asma; Mustafa, Shama; Samad, Abdul",Environmental science and pollution research international,234,31

Several strategies focusing on the binding grooves of the NHR trimer have been adopted to increase the antiviral activity of the CHR peptides. Here, we developed a novel and simple strategy to greatly enhance the potency of the existing peptide-based HIV fusion inhibitors. First, we identified a shallow pocket adjacent to the groove in the N-terminal region of NHR trimer as a new drug target, and then we designed several short artificial peptides to fit this target. After the addition of IDL (Ile-Asp-Leu) to the C terminus of CHR peptide WQ or MT-WQ, the conjugated peptides, WQ-IDL and MT-WQ-IDL, showed much more potent activities than WQ and T20, respectively, in inhibiting HIV-1 IIIB infection. WQ-IDL and MT-WQ-IDL were also more effective than WQ in blocking HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion and had higher levels of binding affinity with NHR peptide N46. We solved the crystal structure of the 6-HB formed by MT-WQ-IDL and N46 and found that, besides the N-terminal MT hook tail, the IDL tail anchor of MT-WQ-IDL also binds with the shallow hydrophobic pocket outside the groove of the NHR trimer, resulting in enhanced inhibition of HIV-1 fusion with the target cell. It is expected that this novel approach can be widely used to improve the potency of peptidic fusion inhibitors against other enveloped viruses with class I fusion proteins. IMPORTANCE The hydrophobic groove of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 NHR trimer has been known as the classic drug target to develop fusion inhibitors derived from the gp41 CHR. Here, we developed a novel and simple strategy to improve the existing peptide-based HIV fusion inhibitors. We identified a shallow pocket adjacent to the groove in the NHR trimer and added a short artificial peptide consisting of three amino acids (IDL) to the C terminus of a fusion inhibitor to fit this new target. The inhibition activity of this new conjugated peptide was significantly enhanced, by 77-fold, making it much more potent than T20 (enfuvirtide) and suggesting that the IDL tail can be adopted for optimizing existing HIV-1 CHR peptide fusion inhibitors. This new approach of identifying a potential binding pocket outside the traditional target and creating an artificial tail anchor can be widely applied to design novel fusion inhibitors against other class I enveloped viruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).","Su, Shan; Zhu, Yun; Ye, Sheng; Qi, Qianqian; Xia, Shuai; Ma, Zhenxuan; Yu, Fei; Wang, Qian; Zhang, Rongguang; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu",Journal of virology,234,31

Due to increased sensitivity, mass spectrometry has become the predominant method in modern glycomics.

However, its use enables the detection of key fragments indicative of certain sugar modifications such as sulfate, (methyl) phosphate, phosphoethanolamine, (methyl)aminoethylphosphonate, glucuronic, and sialic acid, thereby enabling certain isobaric glycan variations to be distinguished. As we also discuss in this review, complementary approaches such as negative-mode electrospray ionization-MS/MS, Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance MS, and ion mobility MS yield, respectively, cross-linkage fragments, high accuracy masses, and isomeric information, thus adding other components to complete the jigsaw puzzle when defining unusual glycan modifications from lower organisms.","Hykollari, Alba; Paschinger, Katharina; Wilson, Iain B H",Mass spectrometry reviews,234,1

By deletion of the carbohydrate-recognition domain region and mutation of crucial amino acids involved in carbohydrate-recognition of LSECtin and by inhibition of the N-linked glycosylation of CD44, we further demonstrated that the interaction between CD44 and LSECtin is dependent on protein-glycan recognition. Our findings indicate that CD44 is the first identified endogenous ligand of LSECtin, and similarly, that LSECtin is a novel ligand of CD44.

METHODS The initial 6 LESS donor nephrectomies were compared with a case-matched 6 SL donor nephrectomies within the same time period (June 2008 till March 2009). Patient characteristics (sex, age, body mass index, graft volume, and vascular anatomy), perioperative data (operative time, warm ischemia time [WIT], and estimated blood loss), and postoperative information (complications, length of stay, visual analog scale [VAS], and total morphine requirements) were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS In the LESS group, there were no conversions to SL or open. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of baseline characteristics (age, body mass index, allograft volume). However, SL group included more right-sided patients (three compared with one) and more venous anomalies (retrorenal veins in two patients and multiple veins in another). There was no significant difference between SL and LESS in terms of operative time (117 vs. 142 minutes), WIT (5 minutes in both groups), estimated blood loss (150 vs. 100 mL), median length of stay (2 days in both), and total morphine equivalents (42 vs. 83 mg). None of the patients received transfusions perioperatively. A patient in the SL group developed a wound infection requiring packing and antibiotics. There were no perioperative complications in the LESS group. Although VAS scores were lower in the LESS versus SL group at each of post-operative day (POD) #2 (1.5 vs. 4) and discharge (0 vs. 2), this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS In this small retrospective series, SL was associated with more complex renal anatomy. However, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of WIT, narcotic requirements, and VAS scores. Therefore, the advantages of LESS may only be cosmesis. To verify these results, both procedures need to be compared prospectively in a randomized fashion.","Andonian, Sero; Rais-Bahrami, Soroush; Atalla, Mohamed A; Herati, Amin S; Richstone, Lee; Kavoussi, Louis R",Journal of endourology,234,5

RECENT FINDINGS Avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses have continued to circulate widely in some poultry populations and infect humans sporadically. Sporadic human cases of avian A(H5N6), A(H10N8) and A(H6N1) have also emerged. Closure of live poultry markets in China has reduced the risk of A(H7N9) infection. Observational studies have shown that oseltamivir treatment for adults hospitalized with severe influenza is associated with lower mortality and better clinical outcomes, even as late as 4-5 days after symptom onset. Whether higher than standard doses of neuraminidase inhibitor would provide greater antiviral effects in such patients requires further investigation. High-dose systemic corticosteroids were associated with worse outcomes in patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 or A(H5N1). MERS-CoV has continued to spread since its first discovery in 2012. The mortality rates are high in those with comorbid diseases. There is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available. The exact mode of transmission from animals to humans remains unknown.

It is a mild central nervous system stimulant when used in recommended doses. However, it can be fatal if taken as an intentional or accidental overdose. We report a case of a 48-year-old lady with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder who consumed a significant overdose of caffeine, triggered by the stress that she had contracted coronavirus disease 19. This led to significant cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity. The condition was identified early and managed appropriately with early β-blockers and gastric decontamination, which saved her life. There are few studies with regard to such modalities on treatment for caffeine overdose; our patient responded rapidly and favourably to the treatment. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Caffeine overdose is uncommon but one that clinicians should be aware of. Early identification and intervention with β-adrenergic antagonists and activated charcoal is paramount in caffeine toxicity.","Ajjampur, Kishan; Subramaniam, Ashwin",Australian critical care : official journal of the Confederation of Australian Critical Care Nurses,234,1

Texas Rising Star (TRS), a voluntary QRIS, exceeds state licensing standards and meets some obesity prevention guidelines. This study examines differences in physical activity, screen time, and outdoor policies and practices by QRIS certification. DESIGN Cross-sectional. SETTING Online. SAMPLE After exclusion criteria, respondents were 431 Texas childcare centers. MEASURES 2016 survey of policies and Go NAPSACC best practices. ANALYSIS Chi-square and t-tests indicated differences in 1) practices and 2) policies by QRIS status. RESULTS TRS-certified centers reported more policies for physical activity (M = 4.57 ± 3.07 vs. 3.61 ± 2.95, p = 0.009) and screen time (M = 1.91 ± 1.84 vs. 1.28 ± 1.56, p < 0.001) than non-certified centers. TRS-certified centers reported significantly higher frequencies for 7 of 14 physical activity practices, however no significant differences for screen time practices were found. Additionally, TRS-certified centers reported more outdoor practices, including more classrooms/storage (p < 0.001) and vegetable gardens (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION TRS-certified centers reported more physical activity policies and practices, more screen time policies, and more outdoor practices. TRS certification was not associated with screen time practices. QRIS can be a practical way to insert obesity prevention in early care and education. Using items from a widely used survey enables comparisons, however future research is needed in larger-scale studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of true renal arterial aneurysms (TRAAs) treated using endovascular techniques over a period of 12 years and 10 months. The clinical presentations, aneurysm characteristics, endovascular techniques and outcomes are reported. RESULTS There were nine TRAA cases with a mean aneurysm size of 21.0 mm, located at the main renal arterial bifurcation in all cases. Onyx(®) was used as the embolic agent of choice (88.9 % cases), with concurrent balloon remodelling. The overall primary technical success rate was 100 %. Repeat intervention was carried out in 1 case, secondary to reperfusion >8 years post-initial treatment. Long-term clinical follow-up was available in 55.6 % of cases (mean 29.8 months; range 3.3-90.1 months). Early post-procedural renal function, as measured by serum creatinine, remained within the normal reference range. Renal parenchymal loss post-embolisation was ≤20 % in 77.8 % of cases, as estimated on imaging. Minor complications included non-target embolization of Onyx(®) with no clinical sequelae (n = 1), transient pain requiring only oral analgesia with no prolongation of hospital stay (n = 2). No major complications occurred as a consequence of embolisation. CONCLUSION Endovascular therapy is an effective and safe primary therapy for TRAA with high success rate and low morbidity, supplanting surgery as primary therapy. Current experience in the use of Onyx(®) in TRAA is primarily limited to individual case reports, and this represents the largest case series of Onyx(®)-treated TRAAs to date.","Chung, Raymond; Touska, Philip; Morgan, Robert; Belli, Anna-Maria",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,234,16

This review summarizes the implications of the pandemic on the health and wellness of surgeons and trainees, with a particular focus on those in vascular surgery (VS). A literature review was completed using common resource databases. We provide a brief history of burnout in VS and explore burnout and wellness in VS during this unprecedented pandemic. We then offer recommendations to address mental health needs by the VS workforce and highlight opportunities to address the gaps in the literature. The impact of COVID-19 on the professional and personal lives of surgeons and trainees in VS is notable. More than half of vascular surgeons reported some degree of anxiety. Factors associated with anxiety and burnout include COVID-19 exposure, moral injury, practice changes, and financial impacts. Trainees appeared to have more active coping strategies with dampened rates of anxiety compared to those in practice. Women appear to be disproportionately affected by the pandemic, with higher rates of anxiety and burnout. Groups underrepresented in medicine seemed to have more resilience when it came to burnout, but struggled with other inequities in the health care environment, such as structural racism and isolation. Strategies for addressing burnout include mindfulness practices, exercise, and peer and institutional support. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial mental health impact on the VS workforce globally, as shifts were made in patient care, surgical practice, and work-home life concerns.","Drudi, Laura M; Nishath, Thamanna; Ma, Xiya; Mouawad, Nicolas J; O'Banion, Leigh Ann; Shalhub, Sherene",Seminars in vascular surgery,234,1

Training and surgeon experience with this approach has not been assessed previously in America. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to characterize a structured training program and to determine the experience of delegate surgeons. DESIGN Data were assimilated from an anonymous, online survey delivered to attendees on course completion. Data on surgeon performance during hands-on cadaveric dissection were collected prospectively. SETTINGS This study was conducted at a single tertiary colorectal surgery referral center, and cadaveric hands-on training was conducted at a specialized surgeon education center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measurement was the use of the course and surgeon experience posttraining. RESULTS During a 12-month period, eight 2-day transanal total mesorectal excision courses were conducted. Eighty-one colorectal surgeons successfully completed the course. During cadaveric dissection, 71% achieved a complete (Quirke 3) specimen; 26% were near complete (Quirke 2), and 3% were incomplete (Quirke 1). A total of 9.1% demonstrated dissection in the incorrect plane, whereas 4.5% created major injury to the rectum or surrounding structures, excluding the prostate. Thirty eight (46.9%) of 81 surgeon delegates responded to an online survey. Of survey respondents, 94.6% believed training should be required before performing transanal total mesorectal excision. Posttraining, 94.3% of surgeon delegates planned to use transanal total mesorectal excision for distal-third rectal cancers, 74.3% for middle-third cancers, and 8.6% for proximal-third cancers. The most significant complication reported was urethral injury; 5 were reported by the subset of survey respondents who had performed this operation postcourse. LIMITATIONS The study was limited by inherent reporting bias, including observer and recall biases. CONCLUSIONS Although this structured training program for transanal total mesorectal excision was found to be useful by the majority of respondents, the risk of iatrogenic injury after training remains high, suggesting that this training pedagogy alone is insufficient.

For these patients, additional options need to be considered, including dietary, device, and surgical treatments. In addition, many complementary therapies can be considered as adjunctive treatment, with the intent of improving quality of life for persons with epilepsy and potentially allowing for improvement in seizure control. RECENT FINDINGS This review outlines established and developing treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy. Surgical treatments, including resective surgery and vagus nerve stimulation, have been routine care for several decades. In the last several years, new neurostimulation options have been approved (responsive neurostimulation and deep brain stimulation) or are under development (continuous subthreshold cortical stimulation). For patients with lesion or well-defined seizure-onset zones, less invasive options including laser ablation and ultrasound therapy provide the potential for faster recovery times and less morbidity. Not all therapies are in the pharmacological or surgical arenas. This review also explores the evidence for complementary treatments, including relaxation and meditation techniques, and art and music therapy. Despite the range of antiseizure medications available, they still provide inadequate for a large number of patients with epilepsy, either due to ongoing seizures or intolerable side effects. Complementary therapies, including diet, meditation techniques, and music therapy, provide compelling treatment options to improve quality of life while potentially improving seizure control. In appropriate patients, stimulation devices or surgical resection can offer options for significant seizure reduction or even cure. The full range of therapeutics should be considered for each patient with epilepsy when they are struggling with inadequate seizure control or side effects with traditional pharmacological treatment.","Dawit, Sara; Crepeau, Amy Z",Current neurology and neuroscience reports,234,33

Despite research showing potential prognostic utility, its uptake into the clinic has been limited, in part due to challenges associated with subjectivity, reproducibility, and quantification. We have recently proposed a simple, robust, and quantifiable high-contrast method of imaging intra- and peri-tumoural stroma based on polarized light microscopy. Here we report on its use to quantify TSR in human breast cancer using unstained slides from 40 patient samples of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Polarimetric results based on a stromal abundance metric correlated well with pathology designations, showing a statistically significant difference between high- and low-stroma samples as scored by two clinical pathologists. The described polarized light imaging methodology shows promise for use as a quantitative, automatic, and standardizable tool for quantifying TSR, potentially addressing some of the challenges associated with its current estimation.","Sprenger, Jillian; Murray, Ciara; Lad, Jigar; Jones, Blake; Thomas, Georgia; Nofech-Mozes, Sharon; Khorasani, Mohammadali; Vitkin, Alex",Biomedical optics express,234,16

This study was aimed to utilize the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) to report the completeness of COVID-19-related prognostic models and appraise its effectiveness in clinical practice. A systematic search of the Web of Science and PubMed was performed for studies published until August 11, 2020. All models were assessed on model development, external validation of existing models, incremental values, and development and validation of the same model. TRIPOD was used to assess the completeness of included models, and the completeness of each item was also reported. In total, 52 publications were included, including 67 models. Age, disease history, lymphoma count, history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, and platelet count were the commonly used predictors. The predicted outcome was death, development of severe or critical state, survival time, and length-of-hospital stay. The reported discrimination performance of all models ranged from 0.361 to 0.994, while few models reported calibration. Overall, the reporting completeness based on TRIPOD was between 31% and 83% [median, 67% (interquartile range: 62%, 73%)]. Blinding of the outcome to be predicted or predictors were poorly reported. Additionally, there was little description on the handling of missing data. This assessment indicated a poorly-reported COVID-19 prognostic model in existing literature. The risk of over-fitting may exist with these models. The reporting of calibration and external validation should be given more attention in future research.","Yang, Liuqing; Wang, Qiang; Cui, Tingting; Huang, Jinxin; Shi, Naiyang; Jin, Hui",Annals of translational medicine,234,1

It is a multi-dimensional construct that includes physical, mental, and social aspects. Frailty is reversible and can be attenuated by intervention; therefore, its early detection is important in primary and community care. The mainstream of disability prevention in Japan, which comprises the Japanese and local governments as well as healthcare workers, was a high-risk approach until 2014. Given the revision on Japan's long-term care insurance law, current ageing health policies have shifted to more population centric approach. Implements group activities called ""Kayoi-no-ba"" has been valued in Japan as disability prevention initiative.

However, a new 15-item questionnaire has been newly developed to identify frailty and other health-related problems in older people of 75 years and above. This will enable providing the necessary support to frail individuals at any healthcare facility in local communities. The increase in frailty prevalence in older people has been concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Home-based physical exercise programs are expected to be effective for frailty prevention. Utilization of information and communication technologies, social network services, and video calls has attracted attention for being effective tools to facilitate communication for older people during the pandemic.

Synthetic data can support data sharing to answer critical research questions to address the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE We aimed to (1) compare the results from analyses of synthetic data to those from original data, and (2) assess the strengths and limitations of leveraging computationally-derived data for research purposes. METHODS We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative's (N3C) instance of MDClone, a big-data platform with data-synthesizing capabilities (MDClone Ltd., Beer Sheva, Israel). We downloaded EHR data from 34 N3C institutional partners, and tested three use cases, including (1) exploring the distributions of key features of the COVID-positive cohort; (2) training and testing predictive models for assessing the risk of admission among these patients; and (3) determining geospatial and temporal COVID-related measures and outcomes, and constructing their respective epidemic curves. We compared the results from synthetic data to those from original data using traditional statistics, machine learning approaches, and temporal and spatial representations of the data. RESULTS For each use case, the results of the synthetic data analyses successfully mimicked those of the original data such that the distributions of the data were similar and the predictive models demonstrated comparable performance. While the synthetic and original data yielded overall nearly the same results, there were exceptions which included an odds ratio on either side of the null in multivariable analyses (0.97 versus 1.01) and differences in the magnitude of epidemic curves constructed for zip codes with low population counts. CONCLUSIONS This paper presents the results of each use case and outlines key considerations for the use of synthetic data, examining their role in collaborative research for faster insights.

We retrospectively analyzed 303 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and evaluated the clinical data of 240 patients who were discharged. The coagulation function of the two groups (mild and severe) was compared. Compared with the mild group, majority of patients in the severe group were male (76.9% vs. 49.8%) and elderly (median age 65 vs. 50), and the proportion with chronic underlying diseases was higher (73.1% vs. 36.1%). There were 209 abnormalities (69.0%) of coagulation parameters in 303 patients admitted to hospital. Comparison of various indexes of coagulation function between the two groups in admission, the proportion of abnormal coagulation indicators in the severe group was higher than that in the mild group (100% vs. 66.1%). The median coagulation parameters in the severe group were higher than those in the mild group: international normalized ratio (1.04 vs. 1.01), prothrombin time (13.8 vs. 13.4) seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (43.2 vs. 39.2) seconds, fibrinogen (4.74 vs. 4.33) g/L, fibrinogen degradation products (2.61 vs. 0.99) µg/mL, and D-dimer (1.04 vs. 0.43) µg/mL, the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Coagulation dysfunction is common in patients with COVID-19, especially fibrinogen and D-dimer elevation, and the degree of elevation is related to the severity of the disease. As the disease recovers, fibrinogen and activated partial thromboplastin time also return to normal.","Zou, Ying; Guo, Hongying; Zhang, Yuyi; Zhang, Zhengguo; Liu, Yu; Wang, Jiefei; Lu, Hongzhou; Qian, Zhiping",Bioscience trends,234,24

Advances in molecular methods have enhanced our understanding of the genomic structure of HRV and have led to the characterization of three genetically distinct HRV groups, designated groups A, B, and C, within the genus Enterovirus and the family Picornaviridae. HRVs are traditionally associated with upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and sinusitis. In recent years, the increasing implementation of PCR assays for respiratory virus detection in clinical laboratories has facilitated the recognition of HRV as a lower respiratory tract pathogen, particularly in patients with asthma, infants, elderly patients, and immunocompromised hosts. Cultured isolates of HRV remain important for studies of viral characteristics and disease pathogenesis. Indeed, whether the clinical manifestations of HRV are related directly to viral pathogenicity or secondary to the host immune response is the subject of ongoing research. There are currently no approved antiviral therapies for HRVs, and treatment remains primarily supportive. This review provides a comprehensive, up-to-date assessment of the basic virology, pathogenesis, clinical epidemiology, and laboratory features of and treatment and prevention strategies for HRVs.","Jacobs, Samantha E; Lamson, Daryl M; St George, Kirsten; Walsh, Thomas J",Clinical microbiology reviews,234,23

The current study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of CSMD1 in highly invasive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). METHODS We examined the antitumor action of CSMD1 in three TNBC cell lines overexpressing CSMD1, MDA-MB-231, BT-20 and MDA-MB-486, in vitro using scanning electron microscopy, proteome array, qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, proximity ligation assay, ELISA, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, tumorsphere formation assays and flow cytometric analysis. The mRNA expression pattern and clinical relevance of CSMD1 were evaluated in 3520 breast cancers from a modern population-based cohort. RESULTS CSMD1-expressing cells had distinct morphology, with reduced deposition of extracellular matrix components. We found altered expression of several cancer-related molecules, as well as diminished expression of signaling receptors including Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), in CSMD1-expressing cells compared to control cells. A direct interaction of CSMD1 and EGFR was identified, with the EGF-EGFR induced signaling cascade impeded in the presence of CSMD1. Accordingly, we detected increased ubiquitination levels of EGFR upon activation in CSMD1-expressing cells, as well as increased degradation kinetics and chemosensitivity. Accordingly, CSMD1 expression rendered tumorspheres pretreated with gefitinib more sensitive to chemotherapy. In addition, higher mRNA levels of CSMD1 tend to be associated with better outcome of triple negative breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that CSMD1 cross-talks with the EGFR endosomal trafficking cascade in a way that renders highly invasive breast cancer cells sensitive to chemotherapy. Our study unravels one possible underlying molecular mechanism of CSMD1 tumor suppressor function and may provide novel avenues for design of better treatment.","Gialeli, Chrysostomi; Tuysuz, Emre Can; Staaf, Johan; Guleed, Safia; Paciorek, Veronika; Mörgelin, Matthias; Papadakos, Konstantinos S; Blom, Anna M",Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,234,1

Interleukin-2 activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are important for cancer immunity. To identify markers of increased familial breast cancer risk, soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels and immunologic factors were investigated in familial breast cancer and non-familial breast cancer patients. Of 106 untreated breast cancer patients in this study, 24 had familial breast cancer and 82 had non-familial breast cancer. The patients' soluble interleukin-2 receptor, interleukin-10, vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-17, regulatory T cell, myeloid-derived suppressor cell, white blood cell, and C-reactive protein levels, and their neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios were measured, and their prognoses were compared according to the soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels. Additionally, postoperative tissues from the patients with high soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels were stained with programmed cell death ligand 1 and cluster of differentiation 8. The soluble interleukin-2 receptor level in the familial breast cancer patients was significantly higher, and it showed significantly stronger correlations with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and the interleukin-10, vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-17, regulatory T cell, myeloid-derived suppressor cell, white blood cell, and C-reactive protein levels, than in the non-familial breast cancer patients. The regulatory T cell and myeloid-derived suppressor cell levels were significantly higher in the patients with high soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels, and the overall survival and disease-free-survival rates were significantly worse for the familial breast cancer patients than for the non-familial breast cancer patients. Triple-negative breast cancer tissues from the familial breast cancer patients with high soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels stained well for programmed cell death ligand 1 and cluster of differentiation 8. Soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels can be used to predict the prognosis of familial breast cancer patients. Prospectively identifying patients who are less likely to have non-familial breast cancer is vital for improving their overall survival.","Gonda, Kenji; Horita, Shoichiro; Maejima, Yuko; Takenoshita, Seiichi; Shimomura, Kenju",Science progress,234,1

Seventy-six patients recovered from COVID-19, including 66 cases of moderate pneumonia and 10 cases of severe pneumonia were enrolled in the observation group. The control group consisted of 55 age-matched healthy subjects. The thickness and length of spleen were measured by using B-ultrasound and the levels of T lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry. Results showed that the mean length of spleen in the observation group was 89.57 ± 11.49 mm, which was significantly reduced compared with that in the control group (103.82 ± 11.29 mm, p < 0.001). The mean thicknesses of spleen between observation group and control group were 29.97 ± 4.04 mm and 32.45 ± 4.49 mm, respectively, and the difference was significant (p < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in the size of spleen between common pneumonia and severe pneumonia (p > 0.05). In addition, the decreased count of T lymphocyte was observed in part of recovered patients. The counts of T suppressor lymphocytes in patients with severe pneumonia were significantly decreased compared with those with moderate pneumonia (p = 0.005).

There have been suggestions that curiosity tends to decline with age. However, it was rarely studied under specific contexts, and there were relatively limited attempts to enhance OAs' curiosity. Under the theoretical framework of selective engagement theory, we examined age differences of curiosity in the context of learning a novel technology and investigated the moderating role of personal relevance. METHOD This study utilized a pretest-posttest experimental design with a total of 50 younger adults (YAs) and 50 OAs from Hong Kong to measure their trait curiosity, perceived personal relevance, and state curiosity toward robots after interacting with a robot. RESULTS OAs showed significantly lower trait curiosity than YAs, but OAs showed a higher level of state curiosity toward a robot than YAs when they perceived an increase in personal relevance after interacting with the robot. CONCLUSION Findings replicated previous findings that trait curiosity declined with age, but they also illustrated the distinctions between trait and state curiosity in the context of aging and highlighted the potential role of personal relevance in enhancing curiosity of OAs.","Chu, Li; Fung, Helene H",Gerontology,234,27

Autonomic neurons link the brain with the gastrointestinal tract and constitute a likely pathway for peripheral metabolic challenges to affect behaviors controlled by the brain. The activities of neurons along these pathways are regulated by glia, which exhibit phenotypic shifts in response to changes in their microenvironment. How glial changes might contribute to the behavioral effects of consuming a high-fat diet (HFD) is uncertain. Here, we tested the hypothesis that anxiogenic and depressive-like behaviors driven by consuming a HFD involve compromised duodenal barrier integrity and subsequent phenotypic changes to glia and neurons along the gut-brain axis. METHODS C57Bl/6 male mice were exposed to a standard diet or HFD for 20 weeks. Bodyweight was monitored weekly and correlated with mucosa histological damage and duodenal expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin at 0, 6, and 20 weeks. The expression of GFAP, TLR-4, BDNF, and DCX were investigated in duodenal myenteric plexus, nodose ganglia, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus at the same time points. Dendritic spine number was measured in cultured neurons isolated from duodenal myenteric plexuses and hippocampi at weeks 0, 6, and 20. Depressive and anxiety behaviors were also assessed by tail suspension, forced swimming, and open field tests. RESULTS HFD mice exhibited duodenal mucosa damage with marked infiltration of immune cells and decreased expression of ZO-1 and occludin that coincided with increasing body weight. Glial expression of GFAP and TLR4 increased in parallel in the duodenal myenteric plexuses, nodose ganglia, and hippocampus in a time-dependent manner. Glial changes were associated with a progressive decrease in BDNF, and DCX expression, fewer neuronal dendritic spines, and anxiogenic/depressive symptoms in HFD-treated mice. Fluorocitrate (FC), a glial metabolic poison, abolished these effects both in the enteric and central nervous systems and prevented behavioral alterations at week 20. CONCLUSIONS HFD impairs duodenal barrier integrity and produces behavioral changes consistent with depressive and anxiety phenotypes. HFD-driven changes in both peripheral and central nervous systems are glial-dependent, suggesting a potential glial role in the alteration of the gut-brain signaling that occurs during metabolic disorders and psychiatric co-morbidity.","Seguella, Luisa; Pesce, Mirella; Capuano, Riccardo; Casano, Fabrizio; Pesce, Marcella; Corpetti, Chiara; Vincenzi, Martina; Maftei, Daniela; Lattanzi, Roberta; Del Re, Alessandro; Sarnelli, Giovanni; Gulbransen, Brian D; Esposito, Giuseppe",Journal of neuroinflammation,234,31

Translocation by the Tat pathway is dependent on the products of genes which encode proteins possessing the binding site of the signal peptide and mediating the actual translocation event. In the fully virulent CO92 strain of Yersinia pestis, the tatA gene was deleted. The mutant was assayed for loss of virulence through various in vitro and in vivo assays. Deletion of the tatA gene resulted in several consequences for the mutant as compared to wild-type. Cell morphology of the mutant bacteria was altered and demonstrated a more elongated form. In addition, while cultures of the mutant strain were able to produce a biofilm, we observed a loss of adhesion of the mutant biofilm structure compared to the biofilm produced by the wild-type strain. Immuno-electron microscopy revealed a partial disruption of the F1 antigen on the surface of the mutant. The virulence of the ΔtatA mutant was assessed in various murine models of plague. The mutant was severely attenuated in the bubonic model with full virulence restored by complementation with the native gene. After small-particle aerosol challenge in a pneumonic model of infection, the mutant was also shown to be attenuated. In contrast, when mice were challenged intranasally with the mutant, very little difference in the LD50 was observed between wild-type and mutant strains. However, an increased time-to-death and delay in bacterial dissemination was observed in mice infected with the ΔtatA mutant as compared to the parent strain. Collectively, these findings demonstrate an essential role for the Tat pathway in the virulence of Y. pestis in bubonic and small-aerosol pneumonic infection but less important role for intranasal challenge.","Bozue, Joel; Cote, Christopher K; Chance, Taylor; Kugelman, Jeffrey; Kern, Steven J; Kijek, Todd K; Jenkins, Amy; Mou, Sherry; Moody, Krishna; Fritz, David; Robinson, Camenzind G; Bell, Todd; Worsham, Patricia",PloS one,234,1

The aim of this article is to describe how SH was able to adjust its services coping with the epidemiological stages of the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three periods can be identified; in each one the most important organizational modifications are analyzed (hospital activities, logistical changes, communication, surveillance on HCW). RESULTS The first period, after initial cases' identification, was characterized by the hospital isolation. In the second period the hospital reopened and it was divided into two completely separated areas, named COVID-19 and COVID-free, to prevent intra-hospital contamination. The last period was characterized by the re-organization of the facility as the largest COVID Hospital in Veneto, catching exclusively COVID-19 patients from the surrounding areas.

METHODS Sixty-seven patients underwent SILC. Of a cohort of 163 LC operated in the same time period, 67 patients were chosen for a matched pair analysis. Pairs were matched for age, gender, ASA, BMI, acuity, and previous abdominal surgery. In the SILC group, patient characteristics (gender, age, BMI, comorbidities, ASA, previous abdominal surgery, symptomatic cholecystolithiasis, cholecystitis) and perioperative data (surgeon, operation time, conversion rate and cause, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, reoperation rate, VAS at 24 h, VAS at 48 h, use of analgesics according to WHO class, and length of stay) were collected prospectively. RESULTS Follow-up in the SILC and LC group was completed with a minimum of 17 and a maximum of 26 months; data acquired were recovery time the patients needed until they were able to get back into the working process, long-term incidence of postoperative hernias, and satisfaction with cosmetic outcome. Operating time was longer for SILC (median 75 min, range 39-168 vs. 63, range 23-164, p = 0.039). There were no significant differences for SILC and LC with regard to postoperative pain measured by VAS at 24 h (median 3, range 0-8 vs. 2, range 0-8, p = 0.224), at 48 h (median 2, range 0-6 vs. 2, range 0-8, p = 0.571), use of analgesics, and length of stay (median 2 days, range 1-9 vs. 2, range 1-11, p = 0.098). There was no major complication in either group. The completion rate of SILC was 85.1% (57 of 67). Although there was a trend towards an earlier return to the working process in patients of the SILC group, this was not significant. The rate of incisional hernias was 1.9% (1/53) in the SILC and 2.1% (1/48) in the LC group indicating no significant difference. Self-assessment of satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome was not judged different by patients in both groups. CONCLUSION SILC is associated with longer operating time, but equals LC with respect to safety, postoperative pain, use of analgesics, length of stay, return to work, rate of incisional hernia, and cosmetic outcome.","Gangl, Odo; Hofer, Wolfgang; Tomaselli, Florian; Sautner, Thomas; Függer, Reinhold",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,234,25

As in vitro models for such studies, lung-on-a-chip (LOAC) devices can represent key physical and physiological aspects of alveolar tissues. However, widespread adoption of the LOAC device for NP testing has been hampered by low intra-laboratory and inter-laboratory reproducibility. To complement ongoing experimental work, we carried out finite-element simulations of the deposition of NPs on the epithelial layer of a well-established LOAC design. We solved the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid flow in a three-dimensional domain and studied the particle transport using Eulerian advection-diffusion for fine NPs and Lagrangian particle tracking for coarse NPs. Using Langmuir and Frumkin kinetics for surface adsorption and desorption, we investigated NP adsorption under different exercise and breath-holding patterns. Conditions mimicking physical exercise, through changes in air-flow volume and breathing frequency, enhance particle deposition. Puff profiles typical of smoking, with breath-holding between inhalation and exhalation, also increase particle deposition per breathing cycle. Lagrangian particle tracking shows Brownian motion and gravitational settling to be two key factors, which may cooperate or compete with each other for different particle sizes. Comparisons are made with experimental data where possible and they show qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement. These results suggest that computer simulations can potentially inform and accelerate the design and application of LOAC devices for analyzing particulate- and microbe-alveolar interactions.","Amin Arefi, S M; Tony Yang, Cheng Wei; Sin, Don D; Feng, James J",Biomicrofluidics,234,1

In each sheep, 3 implants were placed with a low torque (<25 N · cm, LT group) as a control, and 3 implants were placed with a high insertion torque (maximum torque, HT group). The sheep were killed after 8 and 12 weeks of healing, and the implants were examined for removal torque, resonance frequency analysis, and histologic analysis.The mean insertion torque in the LT group was 24 N · cm, whereas it was 105.6 N · cm in HT. All the implants osseointegrated and histologic analysis showed similar aspects of the peri-implant bone tissue for both groups and both healing times. Mean removal torque values for LT implants were 159.5 and 131.5 N · cm after 8 and 12 weeks, respectively, whereas those for the HT were 140 and 120 N · cm at 8 and 12 weeks, respectively. Implant stability quotient values were 26.6 and 76 for the LT group and 74 and 76 for the HT group at 8 and 12 weeks, respectively.It could be concluded that high implant insertion torque does not induce adverse reaction in cortical bone and does not lead to implant failure.","Consolo, Ugo; Travaglini, Domenico; Todisco, Marzio; Trisi, Paolo; Galli, Silvia",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,234,1

PURPOSE Cost savings achieved at an academic medical center by reformulating the institution's standard vasopressin infusions to reduce waste are described. SUMMARY After a retrospective review of vasopressin utilization over a 4-month period revealed that only approximately 40% of dispensed vasopressin units were actually administered to patients, pharmacy leaders determined that the institution's standard vasopressin concentration for continuous infusions (100 units in 100 mL of sodium chloride 0.9% injection) was resulting in substantial waste, as many infusion preparations were not needed within the 18- to 24-hour expiration window. A concentration of 20 units/100 mL was adopted as the new standard formulation for vasopressin continuous infusions, with use of alternative concentrations allowed on a restricted basis. A pre-post study to assess the impact of the formulation change indicated a 38.7% decrease in vasopressin utilization (from 21,900 to 8,480 units) relative to utilization in a retrospective sample of patients who received vasopressin infusions prior to the formulation change. This reduced utilization equated to a cost decrease of $55,656.20 (as calculated on the basis of 2017 cost estimates) or $77,214.23 (as calculated on the basis of 2019 cost estimates) for the time period collected. It was estimated that the new formulations could yield annual cost savings ranging from $222,625 to $308,857. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first description of cost savings following a change in formulation of vasopressin for continuous infusions. Other institutions could consider employing a similar approach in addition to the previously reported cost-saving interventions, such as lower vasopressin starting doses and vasopressin restriction policies.","Kelly, Courtney E; Miller, Christopher; Darko, William; Cwikla, Greg; Mogle, Bryan; Featherly, Julianna; Marcinak, Rebecca; Probst, Luke A; Seabury, Robert",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,234,1

OBJECTIVE Our objective was to identify health-related criterion-referenced cut-points for musculoskeletal fitness (MSF) among youth. METHODS A systematic search of two electronic databases (MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus) was conducted in September 2020. Only peer-reviewed studies that developed health-related criterion-referenced cut-points for MSF among youth were eligible provided they included (1) youth aged 5-17 years from the general population, (2) at least one quantitative assessment of MSF (e.g., muscular strength), (3) at least one quantitative assessment of health (e.g., cardiometabolic risk), (4) a criterion for health, and (5) a quantitative analysis [e.g., receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve] of at least one health-related cut-point for MSF. A narrative synthesis was used to describe the results of included studies. RESULTS Collectively, 13 studies that developed health-related criterion-referenced cut-points for MSF among 14,476 youth from 15 countries were included. Muscular strength demonstrated high discriminatory ability [median area under the curve (AUC) ≥ 0.71] for cardiometabolic risk/metabolic syndrome, sarcopenic obesity risk and bone health, and moderate discriminatory ability (median AUC 0.64-0.70) for asthma. Muscular power also demonstrated high discriminatory ability for bone health but only moderate discriminatory ability for cardiometabolic risk/metabolic syndrome and low discriminatory ability (median AUC 0.56-0.63) for cognition/academic performance. Both muscular endurance and flexibility demonstrated low discriminatory ability for musculoskeletal pain. Health-related cut-points for MSF that demonstrated significant discriminatory ability were generally higher for boys than for girls (for muscular strength and power) and generally increased with age for muscular strength and power but remained stable for flexibility. CONCLUSIONS Data remain insufficient to establish universal health-related cut-points for MSF among youth. Despite variations in the health-related discriminatory ability of different MSF tests, handgrip strength and standing broad jump emerged as the two tests with the highest discriminatory ability. More research, using standardized testing protocols and health-risk definitions, is required to better triangulate universal health-related cut-points for MSF among youth.

However, results of clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation have been inconclusive. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on incidence and severity of URTIs in healthy adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 322 healthy adults between February 2010 and November 2011 in Christchurch, New Zealand. INTERVENTION Participants were randomly assigned to receive an initial dose of 200,000 IU oral vitamin D3, then 200,000 IU 1 month later, then 100,000 IU monthly (n = 161), or placebo administered in an identical dosing regimen (n = 161), for a total of 18 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary end point was number of URTI episodes. Secondary end points were duration of URTI episodes, severity of URTI episodes, and number of days of missed work due to URTI episodes. RESULTS The mean baseline 25-OHD level of participants was 29 (SD, 9) ng/mL. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in an increase in serum 25-OHD levels that was maintained at greater than 48 ng/mL throughout the study. There were 593 URTI episodes in the vitamin D group and 611 in the placebo group, with no statistically significant differences in the number of URTIs per participant (mean, 3.7 per person in the vitamin D group and 3.8 per person in the placebo group; risk ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.85-1.11), number of days of missed work as a result of URTIs (mean, 0.76 days in each group; risk ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.81-1.30), duration of symptoms per episode (mean, 12 days in each group; risk ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.73-1.25), or severity of URTI episodes. These findings remained unchanged when the analysis was repeated by season and by baseline 25-OHD levels. CONCLUSION In this trial, monthly administration of 100,000 IU of vitamin D did not reduce the incidence or severity of URTIs in healthy adults.

The primary outcome was protocol feasibility, evaluated through recruitment feasibility, intervention acceptability, and adherence to study follow-up measures. Secondarily, postintervention EPDS scores and remission rates (EPDS < 10) were compared between groups. RESULTS Ninety-eight participants were randomized (n = 50 intervention; n = 48 control) and seventy-seven (78.6%) completed postintervention questionnaires. About 88% of the intervention group (n = 44) logged into Mother Matters. Almost all topics were rated highly for relevance, there was good group cohesion and good satisfaction with the intervention.

METHODS We apply a systematic and persuasive approach to reveal the underlying dynamical features of this variant. The approach utilises extracting the main features, which consist of 3-valued features, via the time-series data for new cases, 28-day deaths and 60-day deaths. The experimental samples chosen rely on the the rolling sets of regional data vectors whose dimensions are all 7 days. These data sets are projected onto the 3-valued features to yield the vector rejections. Then the minimal features are thus extracted by the minimal total norms. Then we map out the traces of the similarities between all the extracted time-varying features. RESULTS Our findings, no matter in preliminary or follow-up study, clearly show there is no consistent and substantial shift in the 3-valued features even after the occurrence of this new variant - this might validate the efficacy of the current vaccines against this variant. CONCLUSIONS Since the underlying features of the mutant is unchanged, and the leading feature of B1.1.7 is not yet present, it might help us make the lockdown decision ""choose the lesser of the two evils: pandemic and economic woes"", and validate vaccine developments or adopt preventive measures.","Chen, Ray-Ming",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,234,1

Twenty (7.6%) episodes resulted in transfer to hospital and 136 patients provided responses to feedback surveys and reported their experience as very good (61.7%, n=87) or good (34.8%, n=49). Implementation success was high, with the model widely accepted and adopted across the health service. The service delivery model was considered to be low-cost in comparison to inpatient hospital-based care.ConclusionsOverall, as a rapidly developed and implemented low-tech model of care, the virtual ward was found to provide an effective, accessible and low-cost solution to managing low-acuity COVID-19-positive patients in the community. This model should be considered in future pandemics as a hospital-avoidance response, with the ability to minimise patient-to-healthcare worker transmission, reduce personal protective equipment use and enhance patient adherence with isolation requirements. Targeted remote telemonitoring should be considered as a future modification to improve patient care.What is known about this topic?Virtual wards aim to reduce hospital demand by providing hospital-level care in community settings such as the patients' home. The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a rapid increase in the utilisation of virtual wards as an acute healthcare response that facilitates contactless care of infectious patients. Despite this rapid adoption, there is limited literature on the effectiveness of virtual ward models of care in a pandemic context.What does this paper add?This study provides a detailed description of the implementation of a virtual ward in a large metropolitan health service. It evaluates the effectiveness of the virtual ward as a COVID-19 response strategy and identifies opportunities for improvement and future applicability. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the COVID-19 healthcare response and virtual wards.What are the implications for practitioners?This study details the implementation of a virtual ward and highlights potential facilitators and barriers to successful implementation and sustained applicability. Findings provide a comparative benchmark for other health services implementing virtual wards as a pandemic response strategy.","Schultz, Katherine; Vickery, Helen; Campbell, Katrina; Wheeldon, Mary; Barrett-Beck, Leah; Rushbrook, Elizabeth",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,234,28

The noncriteria antibodies include, for example, antiphosphatidylserine antibodies (aPS), antiprothrombin antibodies (aPT), and antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin complex antibodies (aPS/PT). COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) represents a prothrombotic disorder, and there have been several reports of various aPL being present in COVID-19 patients. There have also been similarities drawn between some of the pathophysiological features of COVID-19 and APS, in particular, the most severe form, catastrophic APS (CAPS). In this review, we critically appraise the literature on aPL and COVID-19. This is a companion piece to a separate review focused on LA. In the current review, we primarily concentrate on the so-called solid phase identifiable aPL, such as aCL and aβ2GPI, but also reflect on noncriteria aPL. We conclude that aPL positivity may be a feature of COVID-19, at least in some patients, but in general, identified ""solid-phase"" aPL are of low titer and not able to be well-linked to the thrombotic aspects of COVID-19. Also, most publications did not assess for aPL persistence, and where persistence was checked, the findings appeared to represent transient aPL. Importantly, high-titer aPL or multiple aPL positivity (including double, triple) were in the minority of COVID-19 presentations, and thus discount any widespread presence of APS, including the most severe form CAPS, in COVID-19 patients.","Favaloro, Emmanuel J; Henry, Brandon Michael; Lippi, Giuseppe",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,234,5

Beginning in about 1504, Leonardo da Vinci began to model the ventricles of the brain in three dimensions. A few years later, Andreus Vesalius illustrated radically novel brain dissections. Thomas Willis' work, Cerebri Anatome (1664), illustrated by Christopher Wren, remarkably revealed the brain undersurface. Later, in the early 1800s, Charles Bell's accurate images of neural structures changed surgery. In the 1960s, Albert L. Rhoton Jr. (1932-2016) began to earn his place among the preeminent neuroanatomists by focusing his lens on microanatomy to harness a knowledge of microneurosurgery, master microneurological anatomy, and use it to improve the care of his patients. Although his biography and works are well-known, no analysis has been conducted to identify the progression, impact, and trends in the totality of his publications-and no study has assessed his work in historical context compared to the contributions of other celebrated anatomists. We analyzed 414 of 508 works authored by Rhoton; these studies were analyzed according to subjects discussed, including anatomical region, surgical approaches, subjects covered, anatomical methods used, forms of multimedia, and subspecialty. Rhoton taught detailed neuroanatomy from a surgical perspective using meticulous techniques that evolved as the technical demands of neurosurgery advanced, inspiring students and contemporaries. His work aligns him with renowned figures in neuroanatomy, arguably establishing him historically as the most influential anatomist of the neurosurgical era.","Farhadi, Dara S; Jubran, Jubran H; Zhao, Xiaochun; Houlihan, Lena Mary; Belykh, Evgenii; Meybodi, Ali Tayebi; Smith, Ronald L; Lawton, Michael T; Preul, Mark C",World neurosurgery,234,12

Oral anticoagulation for thromboembolism prophylaxis is a key component of managing AF in the general population and is recommended by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. However, assessment tools used to aid decision making about anticoagulation have not yet been validated in the critical care setting. There is a paucity of data assessing the impact of anticoagulation strategies on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with AF. We present a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of anticoagulation strategies for AF used specifically in critical care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review of the literature by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PubMed databases for articles published from January 1990 to October 2019. Studies reporting anticoagulation strategies for AF in adults (>18 years) admitted to a general critical care setting will be assessed for inclusion. Outcomes of interest will include (1) percentage of patients started on anticoagulation in critical care for AF, (2) incidence of thromboembolism, (3) incidence of bleeding events, (4) intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, (5) hospital mortality, (6) ICU length of stay and (7) hospital length of stay.

Caregivers also experience similar problems due to the increased burden placed on them. Support to address these difficulties encountered by those with VI and their caregivers may not always be accessible. An internet-based intervention may provide more accessible support. The aim of this study was to obtain consensus regarding the content and accessibility features required to design an internet-based intervention to promote wellbeing for people with VI and their caregivers. METHOD A three-round Delphi review was conducted with a panel of 30 stakeholders. Three stakeholder groups were included, namely individuals with vision loss, experts in the field of vision loss and mental health and carers of individuals with vision loss. Conceptual wellbeing ideas were examined in round 1, the intervention modules and module content were proposed in round 2 and refined in round 3. RESULTS Consensus of 75% or more was reached to include 18 modules into the intervention. These were divided into seven sections: understanding vision loss, emotional wellbeing, functional wellbeing, social wellbeing, physical wellbeing, wellbeing for carers and maintaining wellbeing. The accessibility features deemed most important were font size, colour and contrast options, compatibility with low vision aids and layout of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS The Delphi process positively informed the design of an internet-based intervention for individuals with acquired VI and their caregivers. Suggestions provided by stakeholders should now be incorporated into the intervention. Future evaluation of efficacy and cost-effectiveness of such an intervention are necessary.","Somani, Nurbanu; Beukes, Eldre; Latham, Keziah; Andersson, Gerhard; Allen, Peter M",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,234,32

We have revisited the use of this technology in the assessment of burns and aim to establish if high resolution, real-time technology can be practically used in conjunction with clinical examination to determine burn depth. 11 patients with burns affecting upper and lower limbs and the anterior and posterior trunk were included in this study. Digital and thermal images were recorded at between 42 h and 5 days post burn. When compared to skin temperature, full thickness burns were significantly cooler (p<0.001), as were deep partial thickness burns (p<0.05). Superficial partial thickness burns were not significantly different in temperature than non-burnt skin (p>0.05).

To address this, the psychobiotic strain Bifidobacterium breve CCFM1025 was investigated for its genomic features, metabolic features, and gut microbial and metabolic modulation effect. METHODS AND RESULTS Unlike Bifidobacterium breve FHLJDQ3M5, CCFM1025 significantly decreased the chronically stressed mice's depressive-like behaviors and neurological abnormalities. CCFM1025 has more genes encoding glycoside hydrolases when comparing to FHLJDQ3M5's genome, which means CCFM1025 has a superior carbohydrate utilization capacity and living adaptivity in the gut. CCFM1025 also produced higher levels of neuromodulatory metabolites, including hypoxanthine, tryptophan, and nicotinate. The administration of CCFM1025 reshaped the gut microbiome of chronically stressed mice. It resulted in higher cecal xanthine, tryptophan, short-chain fatty acid levels, and enhanced fatty acid and tryptophan biosynthesis capability in the gut-brain interaction (identified by in silico analyses) than FHLJDQ3M5-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS Genomic and metabolic features involving glycoside hydrolases and neuromodulatory metabolites may determine the antidepressant-like effect of Bifidobacterium breve CCFM1025. Psychobiotics' characterization in this manner may provide guidelines for developing novel psychopharmacological agents in the future. This article is protected by copyright.

Samples were printed at different combinations of laser powers and scanning speeds. Printed samples were sectioned, ground, and polished for porosity study. Imaging techniques captured the pore profile and distribution at different region for comparison: from inside to outside and from bottom to top of a sample. Although a linear energy density of 350 J/m significantly reduced porosity in a sample, choosing different combinations of power and scanning speed for the same energy density produced different results in porosity. Pore density at the periphery of a sample was about 3-20 times denser than that in the interior. Finish machining with at least 200 µm depth of cut was recommended to enhance surface finish, control dimension and tolerance while removing the high density porosity layer.","Wang, Fengyi; Bosque, Hernan Del; Hyder, James; Corliss, Mike; Hung, Wayne Nguyen",Procedia Manufacturing,234,16

Methods We fit a continuous time Markov multi-state model for youth (ages 12-17y) and adults ([≥]18y) in Waves 1-4.5 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal survey and estimated smoking and e-cigarette transition frequencies, including initiation, cessation, and relapse. We validated transition frequency results in a microsimulation model by projecting smoking and e-cigarette use prevalence over time. Results There was more volatility in smoking and e-cigarette use among youth than among adults. For youth never smokers, annual smoking initiation among never/current/former e-cigarette users occurred in 0.4% (95% CI 0.2-0.6%)/8.8% (7.0-10.7%)/3.1% (2.1-4.2%), and current e-cigarette users were more likely to quit e-cigarettes than to initiate smoking (absolute difference in annual probability 46.5%, 38.7-54.2%). For adult current smokers, annual smoking cessation among never/current/former e-cigarette users occurred in 22.6% (20.9-24.3%)/14.5% (11.5-17.4%)/15.1% (12.1-18.2%). For adult current dual users, 14.5% quit smoking and 49.5% quit e-cigarettes annually. For adult former smokers, annual smoking relapse among never/current/former e-cigarette users occurred in 17.7% (15.8-19.6%)/29.3% (23.8-34.7%)/32.8% (27.1-38.6%). Using these transition probabilities in a microsimulation model accurately projected smoking and e-cigarette use prevalence at 12 and 24 months compared to PATH empirical data (root-mean-square error <0.7%). Discussion PATH Waves 1-4.5 contain sufficient data to generate smoking and e-cigarette use transition frequency estimates for youth and adults in a microsimulation model.

However, in the vast majority of SEIR models and models derived from them transitions from one population group to another are described using the mass-action law which assumes population homogeneity. That causes some methodological limitations or even drawbacks, particularly inability to reproduce observable dynamics of key characteristics of infection such as, for example, the incubation period and progression of the disease's symptoms which require considering different time scales as well as probabilities of different disease trajectories. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to simulate the epidemic dynamics that is based on a system of differential equations with time delays to precisely reproduce a duration of infectious processes (e.g. incubation period of the virus) and competing processes like transition from infected state to the hospitalization or recovery. The suggested modeling approach is fundamental and can be applied to the study of many infectious disease epidemiology. However, due to the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic we have developed and calibrated the delay-based model of the epidemic in Germany and France using the BioUML platform. Additionally, the stringency index was used as a generalized characteristic of the non-pharmaceutical government interventions implemented in corresponding countries to contain the virus spread. The numerical analysis of the calibrated model demonstrates that adequate simulation of each new wave of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread requires dynamic changes in the parameter values during the epidemic like reduction of the population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions or enhancement of the infectivity parameter caused by an emergence of novel virus strains with higher contagiousness than original one.

The HFGL2 gene is approximately 7 kb in length with 2 exons. The putative promoter contains cis element consensus sequences that strongly suggest the inducibility of its expression. From the nucleotide sequence of the human gene, a 439-amino acid long protein is predicted. The overall identity between the murine fgl2 and hfgl2 coded proteins is over 70%. About 225 amino acids at the carboxyl end of these molecules are almost 90% identical, and correspond to a well-conserved fibrinogen-related domain. Both HFGL2 and FGL2 encode a type II transmembrane protein with a predicted catalytic domain toward the amino terminus of the protein. Transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a full-length cDNA of HFGL2 coding region resulted in high levels of prothrombinase activity. Livers from 8 patients transplanted for fulminant viral hepatitis were examined for extent of necrosis, inflammation, fibrin deposition, and HFGL2 induction. In situ hybridization showed positive staining of macrophages in areas of active hepatocellular necrosis. Fibrin stained positively in these areas and was confirmed by electron microscopy. These studies define a unique prothrombinase gene (HFGL2) and implicate its importance in the pathogenesis of fulminant viral hepatitis.","Levy, Gary A.; Liu, Mingfeng; Ding, Jinwen; Yuwaraj, Shankary; Leibowitz, Julian; Marsden, Philip A.; Ning, Qin; Kovalinka, Ana; Phillips, M.

Early diagnosis is a crucial step to begin treatment and prevent more infections. In this sense, early screening approaches have demonstrated that in chest radiology images, patients present abnormalities that distinguish COVID-19 cases. Recent studies based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), using radiology imaging techniques, have been proposed to assist in the accurate detection of COVID-19. Radiology images are characterized by the opacity produced by ""ground glass""which might hide powerful information for feature analysis. Therefore, this work presents a methodology to assess the overall performance of Resnet-34, a deep CNN architecture, for COVID-19 detection when pre-processing histogram equalization and color mapping are applied to chest X-ray images. Besides, to enrich the available images related to COVID-19 studies, data augmentation techniques were also carried out.

A high vaccine coverage can produce herd immunity, which confers protection upon the unvaccinated individuals within the population. Although some countries take a voluntary approach to vaccination policies, other countries have mandatory vaccination for specific pathogens. There is a clear inverse correlation between vaccine uptake and incidence of disease and in many countries a trivalent vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella is included in the vaccination schedule. Although naturally acquired immunity is gained from infection by the circulating wild-type virus, the live attenuated vaccine has an effect which wanes over a period of time. In recent years, there has been a global spike in the incidence of both measles and mumps and some authorities are using a third dose of the vaccine to inhibit the spread of any outbreaks which occur. Many factors, such as concerns over vaccine safety and susceptibility to disease have had an impact on vaccine uptake and media bias and misinformation have played a role. With the occurrence of a global pandemic of COVID-19 beginning in late 2019 and continuing for the duration of 2020, access to healthcare and routine vaccination have been affected and vaccine programmes interrupted because of the need for social distancing measures. This may have an impact on future generations, as a significant decline can reduce herd immunity, allowing diseases, which had obtained elimination status to re-emerge.

This study, by presenting a pedagogical case, explores the application of the online ICC training model, and focuses on how the online teaching can be established at the four teaching stages, namely, attitude development, knowledge construction, skills practice, and reflection. Attitude development is a pre-class activity to motivate students' learning curiosity. In the stage of knowledge construction, various kinds of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are selected as teaching resources for students to learn the key concepts and theories for the course. Skills practice requires students to make full use of WeChat or Bulletin Board System (BBS) to have online intercultural encounter, in this process students practice both their linguistic and intercultural communicative competence. The last stage provides chances for both students and teacher to rethink about their learning and teaching and move to the new circle of teaching stages.

During the surgery, the root of the right hepatic vein was injured. A 1.5-cm hole was accidentally made in the right hepatic vein, while mobilizing the right hepatic lobe laparoscopically. End-tidal CO2 dropped from 39 to 15.5 mmHg, and systemic blood pressure dropped from 121 to 45 mmHg, returning to normal with the administration of inotropes. The transesophageal echocardiography revealed numerous bubbles in the left atrium and ventricle. The Bispectral Index monitoring system showed low brain activity, suggesting cerebral infarction due to paradoxical gas embolism. The hepatectomy was completed by conversion to open laparotomy. The patient went into a coma and suffered quadriplegia after surgery, despite the cooling of his head and the administration of Thiamylal.

Viral infection is thought to be the cause in most cases. We have investigated the incidence, aetiology, and outcome of this condition. METHODS Previously well adults from a stable suburban population consulting over one year with a lower respiratory tract illness were studied. For the first six months detailed investigations identified predetermined direct and indirect markers of infection. Evidence of infection was assessed in relation to presenting clinical features, indirect markers of infection, antibiotic use, and outcome. RESULTS Consultations were very common, particularly in younger women (70/1000 per year in previously well women aged 16-39 years), mainly in the winter months; 638 patients consulted, of whom 316 were investigated. Pathogens were identified in 173 (55%) cases: bacteria in 82 (Streptococcus pneumoniae 54, Haemophilus influenzae 31, Moraxella catarrhalis 7), atypical organisms in 75 (Chlamydia pneumoniae 55, Mycoplasma pneumoniae 23), and viruses in 61 (influenza 23). Seventy nine (24%) had indirect evidence of infection. Bacterial and atypical infection correlated with changes in the chest radiograph and high levels of C reactive protein but not with (a) the GP's clinical assessment of whether infection was present, (b) clinical features other than focal chest signs, and (c) outcome, whether or not appropriate antibiotics were prescribed. CONCLUSIONS Over 50% of patients have direct and/or indirect evidence of infection, most commonly bacterial and atypical pathogens, but the outcome is unrelated to the identified pathogens. Many patients improve without antibiotics and investigations do not help in the management of these patients. GPs can reassure patients of the causes and usual outcome of this self-limiting condition.","Macfarlane, J; Holmes, W; Gard, P; Macfarlane, R; Rose, D; Weston, V; Leinonen, M; Saikku, P; Myint, S",Thorax,234,1

With optimum Ce content, the Ag(Ce)/AlPO4 catalyst exhibited strong bactericidal activity. The process of decomposition of the cell wall and cell membrane was directly observed by TEM. The different morphological changes of E. coli cells treated with the Ag(Ce)/AlPO4 catalyst and those treated with Ag+ suggested that the Ag+ eluted from the catalyst surface did not play an important role during the bactericidal process. Results of DMPO spin-trapping measurements by electron spin resonance (ESR) indicated the formation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) *OH and *O2-, which caused the considerable bactericidal activity. The formation of H2O2 acted as an important intermediate; this was confirmed by addition of catalase as the scavenger.

However, the vast majority of the protein therapeutics (or biopharmaceuticals) we use are from animal or human sources, and are produced commercially in microbial or mammalian bioreactor systems. Over the last few years, it has become clear that plants have great potential for the production of human proteins and other protein-based therapeutic entities. Plants offer the prospect of inexpensive biopharmaceutical production without sacrificing product quality or safety, and following the success of several plant-derived technical proteins, the first therapeutic products are now approaching the market. In this review, the different plant-based production systems are discussed and the merits of transgenic plants are evaluated compared with other platforms. A detailed discussion is provided of the development issues that remain to be addressed before plants become an acceptable mainstream production technology. The many different proteins that have already been produced using plants are described, and a sketch of the current market and the activities of the key players is provided. Despite the currently unclear regulatory framework and general industry inertia, the benefits of plant-derived pharmaceuticals are now bringing the prospect of inexpensive veterinary and human medicines closer than ever before.","Twyman, Richard M; Schillberg, Stefan; Fischer, Rainer",Expert opinion on emerging drugs,234,1

METHODS A 10-year-old girl sustained multiple systemic injuries in a motor vehicle accident, including an eCAD with pseudoaneurysm. She initially failed both aspirin and endovascular stenting with progressive enlargement of a traumatic cervical carotid pseudoaneurysm and stenosis. RESULTS Second-stage endovascular stent placement with coiling resulted in successful occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm. At 30-month imaging follow-up, the parent vessel remained patent with no evidence of the pseudoaneurysm. CONCLUSION In the setting of poly-trauma, management of eCAD can be complex especially in the pediatric population. There is little data on the endovascular treatment of eCAD in children. Failed endovascular therapies are extremely rare. Our report supports surveillance imaging as repeat endovascular treatment may be necessary.","Wang, Arthur; Santarelli, Justin G; Stiefel, Michael F",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,234,1

In this paper, we investigate the extent of social inequalities in depression in Eastern Europe, the relative importance of social position at different points of the life-course, and whether social patterning of depression differs between men and women. METHOD A cross-sectional study examined 12,053 men and 13,582 women in Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic. Depressive symptoms (16 or above on the CESD-20) were examined in relation to socio-economic circumstances at three phases of the life-course: childhood (household amenities and father's education); own education; current circumstances (financial difficulties and possession of household items). RESULTS Pronounced social differences in depression exist in men and women throughout Eastern Europe. Depression was largely influenced by current circumstances rather than by early life or education, with effects stronger in Poland and Russia. Odds ratios in men for current disadvantage were 3.16 [95% CI: 2.57-3.89], 3.16 [2.74-3.64] and 2.17 [1.80-2.63] in Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic respectively. Social variables did not explain the female excess in depression, which varied from 2.91 [2.58-3.27] in Russia to 1.90 [1.74-2.08] in Poland. Men were more affected by adult disadvantage than women, leading to narrower sex differentials in the presence of disadvantage. LIMITATIONS Cross-sectional data with recall of childhood conditions were used. CONCLUSION Current social circumstances are the strongest influence on increased depressive symptoms in countries which have recently experienced social changes.","Nicholson, Amanda; Pikhart, Hynek; Pajak, Andrzej; Malyutina, Sofia; Kubinova, Ruzena; Peasey, Anne; Topor-Madry, Roman; Nikitin, Yuri; Capkova, Nada; Marmot, Michael; Bobak, Martin",Journal of affective disorders,234,3

MATERIALS AND METHODS Brazilian dentists were invited to participate in an online survey with questions pertaining to COVID-19 and its repercussions in dental practice. Sample calculation was performed using the Survey Monkey software (www.surveymonkey.com). The minimum sample required to obtain a 95% confidence level (CI) and 1% margin of error was 4,214. The eligibility criteria were dental professionals, of any gender and age, who were working in dentistry in a public, private, or university environment, regardless of the time of experience in the profession, and agreed to participate in the study. The survey was structured such that all the Brazilian regions were touched upon, thereby aiming at covering and collecting the representative data of the region. Responses were analyzed using chi-square tests, t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance, with statistical significance at p <0.05. RESULTS A total of 15,813 dentists responded to the survey, representing all Brazilian regions. Complete social isolation was practiced by 96.21% of the respondents, and approximately 25% knew someone who had contracted COVID-19. Public health specialists were the most likely to provide emergency treatment (71.90%, p <0.001). In the Northeast region, 79.80% of respondents agreed that conventional personal protective equipment (PPE) was insufficient to prevent COVID-19 transmission, and 79.10% considered their biosecurity measures insufficient (p <0.001). In the North region, most dentists continued to perform elective dental procedures (p <0.001). CONCLUSION It is possible to conclude that Brazilian dentists demonstrated high knowledge of COVID-19's main symptoms and the risks of transmission through dental procedures. Most respondents practiced social isolation, although some did continue to provide emergency dental care. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE To improve infection control in dental care settings against COVID-19, it is necessary to educate and raise awareness among professionals.

We compared their profiles in six groups of participants-atopic cohort and nonatopic cohort (each including controls and asthmatic patients with or without steroid therapy). Plasma concentration of IP-10 was significantly lower while that of RANTES and the expression of CCR3 were higher in asthmatic patients (all p < 0.05). Plasma RANTES correlated positively with the GINA severity score in all asthmatic patients (r=0.27, p < 0.05), and with IL-13 in nonatopic asthmatic patients (r=0.46, p < 0.05). In asthmatic patients, the ex vivo release of IP-10 and MIG was attenuated in PBMC activated with allergen, mitogens and IL-18 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, plasma RANTES may be a surrogate marker for asthma and the diminished Th1 related CXC chemokine production may contribute to Th2 predominance in asthma.","Lun, Samantha W M; Wong, C K; Ko, Fanny W S; Ip, W K; Hui, David S C; Lam, Christopher W K",Journal of clinical immunology,234,26

The number of studies targeting Mpro for in silico screening has grown rapidly, and it would be of great interest to know in advance how well docking methods can reproduce the correct ligand binding modes and rank these correctly. Clearly, current attempts at designing drugs targeting Mpro with the aid of computational docking would benefit from a priori knowledge of the ability of docking programs to predict correct binding modes and score these correctly. In the current work, we tested the ability of several leading docking programs, namely, Glide, DOCK, AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, FRED, and EnzyDock, to correctly identify and score the binding mode of Mpro ligands in 193 crystal structures. None of the codes were able to correctly identify the crystal structure binding mode (lowest energy pose with root-mean-square deviation < 2 Å) in more than 26% of the cases for noncovalently bound ligands (Glide: top performer), whereas for covalently bound ligands the top score was 45% (EnzyDock). These results suggest that one should perform in silico campaigns of Mpro with care and that more comprehensive strategies including ligand free energy perturbation might be necessary in conjunction with virtual screening and docking.","Zev, Shani; Raz, Keren; Schwartz, Renana; Tarabeh, Reem; Gupta, Prashant Kumar; Major, Dan T",J. chem. inf. model,234,1

Shunt may be intrapulmonary, or extrapulmonary. Handheld devices are increasingly being used for point-of-care ultrasound, but their use to characterize shunt has not been reported. OBJECTIVES: Determine the feasibility of using handheld ultrasound to detect and characterize anatomical substrates of hypoxia and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with COVID-19 suspected to have severe shunt. METHODS: A handheld ultrasound device (iQ, Butterfly, USA) was used to perform lung ultrasound, vascular assessment for DVT, and limited transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with color Doppler and saline microbubble contrast in patients with COVID-19 suspected to have severe shunt. Images were reassessed by an independent reviewer. RESULTS: After screening 40 patients, six patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were identified. Two were excluded because palliation had been initiated. So, four patients were studied. Interpretable images were obtained in all cases. Interobserver agreement was good. All patients had abnormal lung ultrasound (lung ultrasound score range 17-22). Identified lung pathology included interstitial syndrome with light beams and small peripheral consolidation (4), lobar consolidation (1), and pleural effusion (1). Abnormal echocardiographic findings included interatrial shunt (2), intrapulmonary shunt (1), and dilated right ventricle with tricuspid valve regurgitation (1). Significant DVT was not detected. CONCLUSION: Use of handheld ultrasound to perform combined lung ultrasound, DVT ultrasound, and limited TTE with color Doppler and saline microbubble contrast is feasible, and may be able to characterize shunt in critically hypoxic patients. Serial studies could be used to monitor changes in shunt. Further studies are required to determine whether this can guide treatment to improve the outcomes of patients with refractory hypoxia.","Rajendram, Rajkumar; Hussain, Arif; Mahmood, Naveed; Kharal, Mubashar",Ultrasound J,234,1

Protein vaccines are safe, but conventional approaches for protein-based vaccines often fail to elicit potent and long-lasting immune responses. Nanoparticle vaccines designed to co-deliver protein antigens and adjuvants can promote their delivery to antigen-presenting cells and improve immunogenicity. However, it remains challenging to develop vaccine nanoparticles that can preserve and present conformational epitopes of protein antigens for induction of neutralizing antibody responses. Here, we have designed a new lipid-based nanoparticle vaccine platform (NVP) that presents viral proteins (HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 antigens) in a conformational manner for induction of antigen-specific antibody responses. We show that NVP was readily taken up by dendritic cells (DCs) and promoted DC maturation and antigen presentation. NVP loaded with BG505.SOSIP.664 (SOSIP) or SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) was readily recognized by neutralizing antibodies, indicating the conformational display of antigens on the surfaces of NVP. Rabbits immunized with SOSIP-NVP elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1. Furthermore, mice immunized with RBD-NVP induced robust and long-lasting antibody responses against RBD from SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest that NVP is a promising platform technology for vaccination against infectious pathogens.","Park, Kyung Soo; Bazzill, Joseph D; Son, Sejin; Nam, Jutaek; Shin, Seung Won; Ochyl, Lukasz J; Stuckey, Jeanne A; Meagher, Jennifer L; Chang, Louise; Song, Jun; Montefiori, David C; LaBranche, Celia C; Smith, Janet L; Xu, Jie; Moon, James J",J Control Release,234,22

Material and Methods: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were treated during the months of March and April 2020 at our institution were included. All patients were symptomatic and the thrombotic event objectively confirmed. Patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial thrombosis (PAT) were included. Survival curves for all groups were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier with Log Rank test, and Cox regression. Results: During the pandemic period from March-1 to April-30, 2943 patients were treated with confirmed COVID-19 in our center. 106 patients showed some symptomatic vascular thrombosis: 13 patients had PAT, 15 ischemic stroke, 20 DVT and 58 PE. 11 patients presented multiple vascular thrombosis. Although the mean age was 65 years, there were differences between groups being older those patients with arterial thrombosis. A 67.92% were men. In total, 25 patients died during their hospital admission (23.58%), with differences between groups, being more common in patients with PAT (9 patients out of 13) and ischemic stroke (8 patients out of 15), than in those with DVT (1 patient out of 20) or PE (7 patients out of 58). Conclusions: The venous thromboembolic risk in these patients is greater than the arterial, but arterial thrombosis when it occurs was associated with high mortality rates.

Dane County had the 12th known introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, but this did not lead to descendant community spread. Instead, the Dane County outbreak was seeded by multiple later introductions, followed by limited community spread.

However, the temperature of various surfaces differs and precise measurement and analyses are required to determine the “coolest” of these. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of surface temperature data based on thermal infrared (TIR) cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have recently been utilized for the spatial analysis of surface temperatures. Accordingly, we investigated land surface temperatures (LSTs) in green spaces, specifically those of different land cover types in an urban park in Korea. We compared and analyzed LST data generated by a thermal infrared (TIR) camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and LST data from the Landsat 8 satellite for seven specific periods. For comparison and evaluation, we measured in situ LSTs using contact thermometers. The UAV TIR LST showed higher accuracy (R2 0.912, root mean square error (RMSE) 3.502 °C) than Landsat TIR LST accuracy (R2 value lower than 0.3 and RMSE of 7.246 °C) in all periods. The Landsat TIR LST did not show distinct LST characteristics by period and land cover type;however, grassland, the largest land cover type in the study area, showed the highest accuracy. With regard to the accuracy of the UAV TIR LST by season, the accuracy was higher in summer and spring (R2 0.868–0.915, RMSE 2.523–3.499 °C) than in autumn and winter (R2 0.766–0.79, RMSE 3.834–5.398 °C). Some land cover types (concrete bike path, wooden deck) were overestimated, showing relatively high total RMSEs of 4.439 °C and 3.897 °C, respectively, whereas grassland, which has lower LST, was underestimated—showing a total RMSE of 3.316 °C. Our results showed that the UAV TIR LST could be measured with sufficient reliability for each season and land cover type in an urban park with complex land cover types. Accordingly, our results could contribute to decision-making for urban spaces and environmental planning in consideration of the thermal environment.","Kim, Dongwoo Yu Jaejin Yoon Jeongho Jeon Seongwoo Son Seungwoo",Remote Sensing,234,2

SUMMARY: A retrospective chart review of 8 adults on warfarin admitted to Michigan Medicine with COVID-19 infection was conducted and reported as a case series. Outcomes of interest were difference in average daily dose of warfarin prior to admission (PTA) and while inpatient (IP), warfarin sensitivity, time in therapeutic range (TTR), confirmed or suspected thromboembolic event, any major or clinically significant bleeding episodes, and in-hospital mortality. IP average daily warfarin doses were lower when compared to PTA average daily doses [1.3 mg (1.3) vs. 6.2 mg (4.1)]. The mean percentage decrease in dose was 68.8% (23) and the mean absolute dose difference was 4.8 mg (4.3). Mean IP percentage tests in range was 30.8% (24.6) and mean IP warfarin sensitivity was 4.2 (3.8), both of which differed from PTA TTR and warfarin sensitivity for those with data available (n = 3, n = 6, respectively). One patient was treated for suspected acute pulmonary embolism while on warfarin and one patient experienced clinically relevant bleeding. In-hospital mortality was zero, mean length of stay (LOS) was 17 days (14.4), and mean intensive care unit (ICU) LOS for the 3 patients requiring ICU level care was 14.3 days (4.5). CONCLUSION: Decreased warfarin dose requirements were evident in this group of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. These findings suggest lower doses of warfarin may be needed to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation while inpatient.","Irwin, Madison N; Adie, Sarah; Sandison, Katherine; Alsomairy, Sarah A; Brancaccio, Adamo",J Pharm Pract,234,29

We simulated the future trajectory of the epidemic under current conditions, projected the impact of policy interventions, and analyzed the implications for healthcare capacity. METHODS: Our study was based on the first month of publicly accessible data on new confirmed daily cases. A susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (SEIR) model for COVID-19 was employed to compare the current dynamics of the disease with those predicted under various scenarios. RESULTS: The fitted model for the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Bali indicated an effective reproduction number of 1.4. Interventions have decreased the possible maximum number of cases from 71 125 on day 86 to 22 340 on day 119, and have prolonged the doubling time from about 9 days to 21 days. This corresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in transmissions from cases of mild infections. There will be 2780 available hospital beds, and at the peak (on day 132), the number of severe cases is estimated to be roughly 6105. Of these cases, 1831 will need intensive care unit (ICU) beds, whereas the number of currently available ICU beds is roughly 446. CONCLUSIONS: The healthcare system in Bali is in danger of collapse; thus, serious efforts are needed to improve COVID-19 interventions and to prepare the healthcare system in Bali to the greatest extent possible.","Wirawan, I Md Ady; Januraga, Pande Putu",J Prev Med Public Health,234,16

The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand transmission of COVID-19 within this community. Methods We performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey between late-October and early December 2020 prior to the third national lockdown. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence stratified by age and sex. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated with infection and antibody titres. Findings A total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3% (95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres. Interpretation In this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date, which was markedly higher than the reported 10% seroprevalence in London at the time of the study. In the context of this high force of infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection. Actions to reduce the burden of disease in this and other minority populations are urgently required.

To describe characteristics of COVID-19 cases at child care facilities and facility adherence to guidance and recommendations, the District of Columbia (DC) Department of Health (DC Health) and CDC reviewed COVID-19 case reports associated with child care facilities submitted to DC Health and publicly available data from the DC Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) during July 1-December 31, 2020. Among 469 licensed child care facilities, 112 (23.9%) submitted 269 reports documenting 316 laboratory-confirmed cases and three additional cases identified through DC Health's contact tracers. Outbreaks associated with child care facilities, defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed and epidemiologically linked cases at a facility within a 14-day period (3), occurred in 27 (5.8%) facilities and accounted for nearly one half (156; 48.9%) of total cases.

SUMMARY: In the spring of 2020, New York City quickly became a hotspot for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, putting a strain on local healthcare systems. Antimicrobial stewardship programs faced diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties as well as healthcare resource challenges. With the lack of effective antivirals, antibiotic use in critically ill patients was difficult to avoid. Uncertainty drove antimicrobial use and thus antimicrobial stewardship principles were paramount. The dramatic influx of patients, drug and equipment shortages, and the need for prescribers to practice in alternative roles only compounded the situation. Establishing enhanced communication, education, and inventory control while leveraging the capabilities of the electronic medical record were some of the tools used to optimize existing resources. CONCLUSION: New York City was a unique and challenging environment during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Antimicrobial stewardship programs can learn from each other by sharing lessons learned and practice opportunities to better prepare other programs facing COVID-19 case surges.","Kubin, Christine J; Loo, Angela S; Cheng, Jennifer; Nelson, Brian; Mehta, Monica; Mazur, Shawn; So, Wonhee; Calfee, David P; Singh, Harjot K; Greendyke, William G; Simon, Matthew S; Furuya, E Yoko",Am J Health Syst Pharm,234,2

These effects were investigated against the background of the Health Belief Model (HBM). A convenience sample of N = 325 participants completed an online survey including an ad-hoc questionnaire measuring the HBM core factors: Perceived health threat (susceptibility and severity of getting infected), and perceived quarantine benefits and costs. Self-efficacy and perceived social pressure were also measured. Based on reviews regarding pandemic outbreaks, quarantine benefits were conceptualized as the perceived effectiveness and solidary contribution of self-isolating in line with the quarantine protocols. Quarantine ""psychosocial"" costs were conceptualized as a composite of perceived boredom, loneliness, and economic concerns. Findings revealed an asymmetrical pattern of results so that (i) people at higher risk were more distressed by the perceived severity of getting infected whereas people at lower risk were more distressed by the psychosocial costs. Moreover, (ii) resilience and optimism were more ""protective"" against distress within the lower and higher risk groups, respectively. In addition, (iii) quarantine benefits and self-efficacy promoted the intention to self-isolate within both groups. However, (iv) optimism hindered such intention. This finding is discussed in the light of links between dispositional optimism and optimistic bias;the underestimation of experiencing negative events, which can relax the perceived health risk. Based on these findings, communication campaigns should prioritize information about the effectiveness of the implemented preventive behaviors rather than the costs of not implementing them, and be cautionary in encouraging excessive optimism.","Cervera-Torres, S.; Ruiz-Fernandez, S.; Godbersen, H.; Masso, L.; Martinez-Rubio, D.; Pintado-Cucarella, S.; Banos, R.

This global public health threat drew the attention of the medical and scientific community to make the necessary research efforts to combat the spread of the virus. Predictors of preventive behaviors could be of considerable importance relevant to identifying high-risk groups to manage their behavior. We aimed to investigate the association between people's perception of COVID-19 adherence to preventive measures, susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, motivators, barriers, confidence, and information sources. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, enrolling 1,568 participants from WhatsApp groups, aged 16 years and above from March to April 2020 in Saudi Arabia. We prepared an online Arabic self-administered questionnaire, which consisted of (1) sociodemographic characteristics;(2) compliance to preventive measures, including the perception of susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, motivation, barriers to preventive measures, self-confidence;and (3) sources of COVID-19 information. Results Of the 1,568 participants, 60% (n = 1,004) were women, 54.1% (n = 459) were unmarried, and 80.2% (n = 1,258) had earned university degrees. Regarding compliance and perception toward preventive measures, 64% of participants washed hands with soap and water;50% followed the cough etiquette;17.5% avoided touching their eyes, nose, and mouth;and 34.6% never shook hands with others. Approximately 52.2%-69.7% avoided going to crowded places and wore facial masks as needed. In addition, 24.3% of people observed social distancing. However, 52.4% did not receive the annual flu vaccine. Approximately 83% used banknotes, 69.8% made online payments, and 51.8% avoided ATM/credit card use. The perception of susceptibility and the seriousness of COVID-19 infection accounted for 8.5% and 50% of participants, respectively. Perceived benefits and motivation reached more than 90%. Barriers for not being able to practice preventive measures were the fear of nasal swabs, forgetfulness, and negligence, which rated 39% and 66%, respectively. Confidence in practicing the preventive measures and distinguishing the symptoms of COVID-19 accounted for 80% and 60% of the participants, respectively. The most used sources to retrieve information were the Ministry of Health (MOH) news and reports and social media, representing 53.5% and 24.6%, respectively. Conclusions During the early phase of the pandemic, people's perception of susceptibility was low, which resulted in a lack of awareness of some citizens to take the COVID-19 infection seriously. Thus, the benefits of preventive measures did not fully translate into practice. The current successful decline of COVID-19 cases should be accompanied by continuing health promotion and disease prevention programs utilizing all avenues and opportunities to remind people of scientific, religious, and cultural practices of handwashing, coughing etiquette. The persistent use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as facial masks, gloves, and, for frontline workers, shields and protective garments is necessary. Family physicians and teams should play a vital role in this battle.","Alshammari, A. S.; Alshammari, H.; Alshammari, S.",Cureus,234,20

Experience with NIV as the ceiling of treatment in severely compromised novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients is lacking. METHODS: We evaluated 159 patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), 38 of whom with NIV as the ceiling of treatment, admitted to an ordinary ward and treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and respiratory physiotherapy. Treatment failure and death were correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters in the whole cohort and in patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment. RESULTS: Patients who had NIV as the ceiling of treatment were elderly, with a low BMI and a high burden of comorbidities, showed clinical and laboratory signs of multi-organ insufficiency on admission and of rapidly deteriorating vital signs during the first week of treatment. NIV failure occurred overall in 77 (48%) patients, and 27/38 patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment died. Congestive heart failure, chronic benign haematological diseases and inability/refusal to receive respiratory physiotherapy were independently associated to NIV failure and mortality. Need for increased positive end-expiratory pressures and low platelets were associated with NIV failure. Death was associated to cerebrovascular disease, need for CPAP cycles longer than 12h and, in the subgroup of patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment, was heralded by vital sign deterioration within 48 h.

For instance, in COVID-19, we want to forecast the number of infected and death cases but we do not know the count of susceptible and exposed people. While mechanics compartment models are widely-used in epidemic modeling, data-driven models are emerging for disease forecasting. As a case study, we compare these two types of models for COVID-19 forecasting and notice that physics-based models significantly outperform deep learning models. We present a hybrid approach, AutoODE-COVID, which combines a novel compartmental model with automatic differentiation. Our method obtains a 57.4% reduction in mean absolute errors for 7-day ahead COVID-19 forecasting compared with the best deep learning competitor. To understand the inferior performance of deep learning, we investigate the generalization problem in forecasting. Through systematic experiments, we found that deep learning models fail to forecast under shifted distributions either in the data domain or the parameter domain. This calls attention to rethink generalization especially for learning dynamical systems.","Wang, Rui; Maddix, Danielle; Faloutsos, Christos; Wang, Yuyang; Yu, Rose",,234,19

All-causes mortality in Portugal increased during March and April 2020 compared to previous years, but this increase is not explained by COVID-19 reported deaths. The aim of this study was to analyze and consider other criteria for estimating excessive all-cause mortality during the early COVID-19 pandemic period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Public data was used to estimate excess mortality by age and region between March 1 and April 22, proposing baselines adjusted for the lockdown period. RESULTS: An excess mortality of 2400 to 4000 deaths was observed. Excess mortality was associated with older age groups (over age 65) [corrected]. DISCUSSION: The data suggests a ternary explanation for early excess mortality: COVID-19, non-identified COVID-19 and decrease in access to healthcare. The estimates have implications in terms of communication of non-pharmaceutical actions, for research, and to healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: Despite the inherent uncertainty, the excess mortality occurred between March 1 and April 22 could be 3.5- to 5-fold higher than what can be explained by the official COVID-19 deaths [corrected].","Nogueira, Paulo Jorge; Nobre, Miguel De Araújo; Nicola, Paulo Jorge; Furtado, Cristina; Vaz Carneiro, António",Acta Med Port,234,26

The paper examines a) how often and of what type early childhood educators implemented digitally supported parental cooperation during the closure of day-care centres, b) which attitudes educators had towards general as well as digitally supported parental cooperation, and c) what role their qualifications, their attitudes and their perceived support through the centre played for their digital and non-digital parental cooperation during the closure of day-care centres. The study is based on a nationwide online survey of 3513 early childhood educators in day-care centres during corona closing time. The results show that educators' perceived importance of parental cooperation had a positive influence on whether or not educators had stayed in contact with the parents. Whether this contact occurs via digital media, in turn, depended on educators' attitudes towards digital media, the expected reaction of parents to this form of parental cooperation and the availability of technical support for implementing digital media in parental cooperation. The results are discussed with regard to the structural conditions of institutions and the professional skills of early childhood educators for a broad implementation of digital media in early childhood education practice.","Cohen, Franziska; Oppermann, Elisa; Anders, Yvonne",Z Erziehwiss,234,24

Chest computed Tomography (CT) has proven to be a useful supplement to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and has been shown to have high sensitivity to diagnose this condition. Therefore, radiological examinations are becoming crucial in early examination of COVID-19 infection. Currently, CT findings have already been suggested as an important evidence for scientific examination of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. However, classification of patient from chest CT images is not an easy task. Therefore, in this paper, a deep bidirectional long short-term memory network with mixture density network (DBM) model is proposed. To tune the hyperparameters of the DBM model, a Memetic Adaptive Differential Evolution (MADE) algorithm is used. Extensive experiments are drawn by considering the benchmark chest-Computed Tomography (chest-CT) images datasets. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed MADE-DBM model outperforms the competitive COVID-19 classification approaches in terms of various performance metrics. Therefore, the proposed MADE-DBM model can be used in real-time COVID-19 classification systems.","Pathak, Yadunath; Shukla, Piyush Kumar; Arya, K V",IEEE/ACM trans. comput. biol. bioinform.

Potential therapeutics include repurposed drugs, some with cardiac liabilities. We report on a chronic preclinical drug screening platform, a cardiac microphysiological system (MPS), to assess cardiotoxicity associated with repurposed hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) polytherapy in a mock phase I safety clinical trial. The MPS contained human heart muscle derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. The effect of drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements, such as QT interval (action potential duration) and drug-biomarker pairing. Chronic exposure (10 days) of heart muscle to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations and increased QT interval past 5 days. AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from day 7 onward, and arrhythmias were observed at days 8 and 10. Monotherapy results mimicked clinical trial outcomes. Upon chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 4-8. Interestingly, a decrease in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to monotherapy, in concordance with published clinical trials. Biomarkers, most of them measurable in patients' serum, were identified for negative effects of monotherapy or polytherapy on tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection. The cardiac MPS correctly predicted clinical arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation and rhythm instabilities. This high content system can help clinicians design their trials, rapidly project cardiac outcomes, and define new monitoring biomarkers to accelerate access of patients to safe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapeutics.","Charrez, Bérénice; Charwat, Verena; Siemons, Brian; Finsberg, Henrik; Miller, Evan W; Edwards, Andrew G; Healy, Kevin E",Clinical and translational science (Online),234,11

Timely contact tracing is particularly crucial to limit onwards transmission in settings without established community transmission. METHODS: We conducted an in-depth analysis of the response to a big flight-associated COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam in March 2020 that involved contact tracing, systematic testing and strict quarantine up to third generation contacts. RESULTS: 183 primary contacts from the flight as well as 1000 secondary and 311 third generation contacts were traced, tested, and quarantined across 15 provinces across Vietnam. The protracted confirmation of the index case at 3 days and 19 h after arrival resulted in isolation/quarantine delays of 6.8 days (IQR 6.3-6.8) and 5.8 days (IQR 5.8-7.0) for primary and secondary cases, respectively, which generated 84.0 and 26.4 person-days of community exposure from primary and secondary cases, respectively. Nevertheless, only 5 secondary cases occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A large flight-related COVID-19 cluster was successfully contained through timely, systematic and comprehensive public health responses despite delayed index case identification.

The rough idea is simple: use Bluetooth or other data-exchange technologies to record contacts between users, enable users to report positive diagnoses, and alert users who have been exposed to sick users. Of course, there are many privacy concerns associated with this idea. Much of the work in this area has been concerned with designing mechanisms for tracing contacts and alerting users that do not leak additional information about users beyond the existence of exposure events. However, although designing practical protocols is of crucial importance, it is essential to realize that notifying users about exposure events may itself leak confidential information (e.g. that a particular contact has been diagnosed). Luckily, while digital contact tracing is a relatively new task, the generic problem of privacy and data disclosure has been studied for decades. Indeed, the framework of differential privacy further permits provable query privacy by adding random noise. In this article, we translate two results from statistical privacy and social recommendation algorithms to exposure notification. We thus prove some naive bounds on the degree to which accuracy must be sacrificed if exposure notification frameworks are to be made more private through the injection of noise.","Hammoud, Abbas; Yu, Yun William",,234,24

Differential equations are commonly used in immune response mathematical models to help describe these complex and dynamic interactions within the immune system of the organism. Time delays in the immune system are common and are often disregarded due to the low-resolution of models, which provide limited description of the specific section of immune system being studied. The few models that incorporate time delays are mostly at the epidemiological level, to track the spread of the virus in the population.

To mitigate the crisis, the design of vaccines is a crucial solution. The frequent mutation of the virus demands generalized vaccine candidates, which would be effective for all mutated strains at present and for the strains that would evolve due to further new mutations in the virus. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to identify more frequently occurring mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2 and to suggest peptide vaccine candidates effective in common against the viral strains considered. METHOD: In this study, we have identified all currently prevailing mutated strains of SARS-CoV-2 through 2D Polar plot and Quotient Radiusã(qã_R) characterization descriptor. Then, by considering the top eight mutation strains, which are significant due to their frequency of occurrence, peptide regions suitable for vaccine design have been identified with the help of a mathematical model - 2D Polygon Representation, followed by the evaluation of epitope potential and ensuring that there is no case of any autoimmune threat. Lastly, in order to verify whether this entire approach is applicable for vaccine design against any other virus in general, we have made a comparative study between the peptide vaccine candidates prescribed for the Zika virus using the current approach and a list of potential vaccine candidates for the same already established in the past. RESULTS: We have finally suggested three generalized peptide regions which would be suitable as sustainable peptide vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of its currently prevailing strains as well any other variant of the same that may appear in the future. We also observed that during the comparative study using the case of E protein of Zika virus, the peptide regions suggested using the new approach matched with the already established results. CONCLUSION: The study, therefore, illustrates an approach that would help in developing peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by suggesting those peptide regions which can be targeted irrespective of any mutated form of this virus. The consistency with which this entire approach was also able to figure out similar vaccine candidates for Zika virus with utmost accuracy proves that this protocol can be extended for peptide vaccine design against any other virus in the future.","Biswas, Subhamoy; Manna, Smarajit; Dey, Tathagata; Chatterjee, Shreyans; Dey, Sumanta",Combinatorial chemistry &amp; high throughput screening (Online),234,1

Therefore, we aimed to elucidate best practices regarding infection control in mother-newborn dyads, and identify potential risk factors associated with transmission. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we identified all neonates born between March 22 and May 17, 2020, at three New York Presbyterian Hospitals in New York City (NY, USA) to mothers positive for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery. Mothers could practice skin-to-skin care and breastfeed in the delivery room, but had to wear a surgical mask when near their neonate and practice proper hand hygiene before skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and routine care. Unless medically required, neonates were kept in a closed Giraffe isolette in the same room as their mothers, and were held by mothers for feeding after appropriate hand hygiene, breast cleansing, and placement of a surgical mask. Neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by use of real-time PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs taken at 24 h, 5-7 days, and 14 days of life, and were clinically evaluated by telemedicine at 1 month of age. We recorded demographics, neonatal, and maternal clinical presentation, as well as infection control practices in the hospital and at home. FINDINGS: Of 1481 deliveries, 116 (8%) mothers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 120 neonates were identified. All neonates were tested at 24 h of life and none were positive for SARS-CoV-2. 82 (68%) neonates completed follow-up at day 5-7 of life. Of the 82 neonates, 68 (83%) roomed in with the mothers. All mothers were allowed to breastfeed; at 5-7 days of life, 64 (78%) were still breastfeeding. 79 (96%) of 82 neonates had a repeat PCR at 5-7 days of life, which was negative in all; 72 (88%) neonates were also tested at 14 days of life and none were positive. None of the neonates had symptoms of COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that perinatal transmission of COVID-19 is unlikely to occur if correct hygiene precautions are undertaken, and that allowing neonates to room in with their mothers and direct breastfeeding are safe procedures when paired with effective parental education of infant protective strategies.

We designed a controlled study to compare the role of different respiratory viruses and febrile response in FS. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study of 1899 pediatric emergency room patients aged 6 months-6 years with a positive respiratory virus multiplex PCR, we identified 225 patients with FSs. We first compared the distribution of respiratory viruses in age-stratified patients with FSs with that in other patients. In an embedded case-control study, we compared the febrile response in patients with FSs with that in the controls matched for age, season and the same respiratory virus. RESULTS: The relative risk for FS was the highest for coronavirus OC43, 229E, and NL63 infections [RR: 3.2, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.4-7.2) and influenza A and B [RR: 2.5, 95 % CI: 1.4-4.7] as compared to those with other respiratory viral infections. The patients with FSs had a stronger febrile response of 39.2 °C (difference: 0.8 °C, 95 % CI: 0.5-1.2) later during hospitalization after acute care than the controls matched for the same respiratory virus. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza and coronaviruses caused relatively more FS-related emergency room visits than other respiratory viruses. Furthermore, the febrile response was stronger in the patients with FSs than in the controls matched for the same respiratory virus. The results suggest that the pathomechanism of FSs includes modifiable pathogen-related and host-related factors with possible potential in the prevention of FSs.","Hautala, Maria; Arvila, Jukka; Pokka, Tytti; Mikkonen, Kirsi; Koskela, Ulla; Helander, Heli; Glumoff, Virpi; Rantala, Heikki; Tapiainen, Terhi",Seizure,234,14

Since the pandemic started at the beginning of 2020, infections have fluctuated drastically over time. It is difficult to predict how this situation will evolve in the coming months/years or when a return to some semblance of ’normal’ activity might occur. Because of global lock-up and distancing measures, the beaches, otherwise filled with tourists, first emptied and then had a reduced density of visitors owing to a wide variety of social-distancing measures. Therefore, new safety protocols need to include a wide range of aspects, such as epidemiological conditions, socioeconomic realities, and ecological contexts in which the pandemic occurs. Here, we propose new nature-based landscapes for sandy beaches to help maintain the social distancing of beach visitors while beaches and dunes are restored. When sufficient sediment is available, the maintenance and restoration of healthy beaches with incipient dunes and vegetation will help reduce contagion, promote human health, and recover natural ecosystems.","Moreno-Casasola, Patricia Martínez Marisa Luisa Lithgow Debora",Sustainability,234,14

Our objective was to assess the association between viral load and disease severity in COVID-19. In this single center observational study of adults with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2, the first positive in-hospital nasopharyngeal swab was used to calculate the log10 copies/ml [log10 copy number (CN)] of SARS-CoV-2. Four categories based on level of care and modified sequential organ failure assessment score (mSOFA) at time of swab were determined. Median log10CN was compared between different levels of care and mSOFA quartiles. Median log10CN was compared in patients who did and did not receive influenza vaccine, and the correlation between log10CN and D-dimer was examined. We found that of 396 patients, 54.3% were male, and 25% had no major comorbidity. Hospital mortality was 15.7%. Median mSOFA was 2 (IQR 0-3). Median log10CN was 5.5 (IQR 3.3-8.0). Median log10CN was highest in non-intubated ICU patients [6.4 (IQR 4.4-8.1)] and lowest in intubated ICU patients [3.6 (IQR 2.6-6.9)] (p value < 0.01). In adjusted analyses, this difference remained significant [mean difference 1.16 (95% CI 0.18-2.14)].

Outcomes pertained to all patients: rate of medical encounters, hospitalization-free survival, and overall survival, and hospitalized patients: discharge versus in-hospital death and readmission. Risk factors included patient age, sex, race, body mass index, and 29 comorbidity conditions. ResultsYounger, non-Black patients utilized healthcare resources at higher rates, while older, male, and Black patients had higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. Diabetes with complications, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and blood loss anemia were risk factors for these outcomes. Diabetes with complications, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and blood loss were associated with lower discharge and higher inpatient mortality rates. ConclusionsThis study found differences in healthcare utilization and adverse COVID-19 outcomes, as well as differing risk factors for short- and long-term outcomes throughout disease progression. These findings may inform providers in emergency departments or critical care settings of treatment priorities, empower healthcare stakeholders with effective disease management strategies, and aid health policy makers in optimizing allocations of medical resources.","Salerno, Stephen; Sun, Yuming; Morris, Emily L; He, Xinwei; Li, Yajing; Pan, Ziyang Pan; Han, Peisong; Kang, Jian; Sjoding, Michael W; Li, Yi",,234,30

In this commentary, we identify challenges and opportunities at human-primate interfaces in light of COVID-19, focusing on examples from Asia, and make recommendations for researchers working with wild primates to reduce zoonosis risk and leverage research opportunities. First, we briefly review the evidence for zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss risks of zoonosis at the human-primate interface. We then identify challenges that the pandemic has caused for primates, including reduced nutrition, increased intraspecific competition, and increased poaching risk, as well as challenges facing primatologists, including lost research opportunities. Subsequently, we highlight opportunities arising from pandemic-related lockdowns and public health messaging, including opportunities to reduce the intensity of problematic human-primate interfaces, opportunities to reduce the risk of zoonosis between humans and primates, opportunities to reduce legal and illegal trade in primates, new opportunities for research on human-primate interfaces, and opportunities for community education. Finally, we recommend specific actions that primatologists should take to reduce contact and aggression between humans and primates, to reduce demand for primates as pets, to reduce risks of zoonosis in the context of field research, and to improve understanding of human-primate interfaces. Reducing the risk of zoonosis and promoting the well-being of humans and primates at our interfaces will require substantial changes from ""business as usual.""

METHODS: Retrospective case series of patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 across a pediatric healthcare network, including the clinical features and outcomes of those with positive test results. RESULTS: Of 7,256 unique children tested for SARS-CoV-2, 424 (5.8%) tested positive. Patients 18-21 years of age had the highest test positive rate (11.2%) while those 1-5 years of age had the lowest (3.9%). By race, 10.6% (226/2132) of Black children tested positive vs. 3.3% (117/3592) of White children. Of those with an indication for testing, 21.1% (371/1756) of patients with reported exposures or clinical symptoms tested positive vs. 3.8% (53/1410) of those undergoing pre-procedural or pre-admission testing. Of the 424 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 182 (42.9%) had no comorbid medical conditions, 87 (20.5%) had asthma, 55 (13.0% had obesity, and 38 (9.0%) had mental health disorders. Overall, 52.1% had cough, 51.2% fever, and 14.6% shortness of breath. Seventy-seven (18.2%) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were hospitalized, of which 24 (31.2%) required any respiratory support.

It has already taken an enormous number of human lives and had a substantial negative economic impact. Traditional compartmental epidemiological models demonstrated limited ability to predict the scale and dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in different countries. In order to gain a deeper understanding of its behavior, we turn to chaotic dynamics, which proved fruitful in analyzing previous diseases such as measles. We hypothesize that the unpredictability of the pandemic could be a fundamental property if the disease spread is a chaotic dynamical system. Our mathematical examination of COVID-19 epidemic data in different countries reveals similarity of this dynamic to the chaotic behavior of many dynamics systems, such as logistic maps. We conclude that the data does suggest that the COVID-19 epidemic demonstrates chaotic behavior, which should be taken into account by public policy makers. Furthermore, the scale and behavior of the epidemic may be essentially unpredictable due to the properties of chaotic systems, rather than due to the limited data available for model parameterization.","Jones, Andrew; Strigul, Nikolay",Chaos Solitons Fractals,234,16

Lf blocks the early interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host cells by binding to specific cell receptors and has been proposed as a preventative and adjunct treatment for COVID-19. This preliminary report aimed to investigate concentrations of Lf in early milk of SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers versus non-infected controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a cohort of 13 SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and 15 controls, breast milk concentrations of Lf were determined by ELISA on day 3 postpartum. Additionally, colostrum samples of infected mothers were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG determination using RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: No differences were found in breast milk Lf concentrations between SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and controls. In a subgroup analysis, however, symptomatic mothers (n = 7) presented with lower breast milk Lf concentrations, as compared to asymptomatic mothers (p = .041) and healthy controls (p = .029). All milk samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Early human milk of infected mothers displayed IgA and IgG SARS-CoV-2 specific reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed a different early breast milk Lf ""profile"" between COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic mothers with the latter being at non-COVID levels (control group). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any breast milk sample. Early human milk Lf levels are potentially influenced by the severity of maternal COVID-19 infection during pregnancy.","Briana, Despina D; Papadopoulou, Anna; Syridou, Garyfallia; Marchisio, Edoardo; Kapsabeli, Eleni; Daskalaki, Anna; Papaevangelou, Vassiliki",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,234,16

However, data complexity issues like large volume, high-duplicate rate, and heterogeneity usually characterize these data sources, being required data management tools able to address the impact negatively of these issues on the knowledge graph creation process. In this paper, we propose the SDM-RDFizer, an interpreter of the RDF Mapping Language (RML), to transform raw data in various formats into an RDF knowledge graph. SDM-RDFizer implements novel algorithms to execute the logical operators between mappings in RML, allowing thus to scale up to complex scenarios where data is not only broad but has a high-duplication rate. We empirically evaluate the SDM-RDFizer performance against diverse testbeds with diverse configurations of data volume, duplicates, and heterogeneity. The observed results indicate that SDM-RDFizer is two orders of magnitude faster than state of the art, thus, meaning that SDM-RDFizer an interoperable and scalable solution for knowledge graph creation.

The objective of this study is to analyse clinical and epidemiological characteristics of a cohort of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and their newborns exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during gestation. METHODS: Multicentric observational study of Spanish hospitals from the GESNEO-COVD cohort, participants in RECLIP (Spanish Network of Paediatric Clinical Assays). Women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR and/or serology during pregnancy, diagnosed and delivering during the period 15/03/2020-31/07/2020 were included. Epidemiological, clinical, and analytical data was collected. RESULTS: A total of 105 pregnant women with a median of 34.1 years old (IQR: 28.8-37.1) and 107 newborns were included. Globally, almost 65% of pregnant women had some COVID-19 symptoms and more than 43% were treated for SARS-COV-2. Overall, 30.8% of pregnant women had pneumonia and 5 (4.8%) women were admitted to the intensive care unit needing invasive mechanical ventilation. There was a rate of 36.2% of caesarean sections, which was associated with pneumonia during pregnancy (OR: 4.203, CI 95%: 1.473-11.995) and lower gestational age at delivery (OR: 0.724, CI 95%: 0.578-0.906). The prevalence of preterm birth was 20.6% and prematurity was associated with pneumonia during gestation (OR: 6.970, CI95%: 2.340-22.750) and having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR at delivery (OR: 6.520, CI95%: 1.840-31.790). All nasopharyngeal PCR in newborns were negative at birth and one positivized at 15 days of life. Two newborns died, one due to causes related to prematurity and another of unexpected sudden death during early skin-to-skin contact after delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Although vertical transmission has not been reported in this cohort, the prognosis of newborns could be worsened by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy as COVID-19 pneumonia increased the risk of caesarean section deliveries and preterm births.","Carrasco, Itzíar; Muñoz-Chapuli, Mar; Vigil-Vázquez, Sara; Aguilera-Alonso, David; Hernández, Concepción; Sánchez-Sánchez, César; Oliver, Cristina; Riaza, Mónica; Pareja, Marta; Sanz, Olga; Pérez-Seoane, Beatriz; López, Juan; Márquez, Elena; Domínguez-Rodríguez, Sara; Hernanz-Lobo, Alicia; De León-Luis, Juan Antonio; Sánchez-Luna, Manuel; Navarro, María Luisa",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,234,1

Some reports of cats with SARS-CoV-2 showed self-limiting respiratory or gastrointestinal disease after suspected human-to-feline transmission via close contact with humans with SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we investigated a cat with SARS-CoV-2 that was presented to a private animal clinic in Northern Italy in May 2020 in a weak clinical condition due to an underlying intestinal B-cell lymphoma. The cat developed signs of respiratory tract disease, including a sneeze, a cough and ocular discharge, three days after an oropharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA using two real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays for the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detectable prior to the onset of clinical signs. Five and six months after positive molecular results, the serological testing substantiated the presence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the cat with the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies and neutralizing activity in a surrogate virus neutralization assay (sVNT). To the best of our knowledge, this extends the known duration of seropositivity of SARS-CoV-2 in a cat. Our study provides further evidence that cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 under natural conditions and strengthens the assumption that comorbidities may play a role in the development of clinical disease.","Klaus, Julia; Palizzotto, Carlo; Zini, Eric; Meli, Marina L; Leo, Chiara; Egberink, Herman; Zhao, Shan; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina",Viruses,234,1

The widely used human RNaseP internal control was modified to specifically co-amplify the RNaseP mRNA. The SORP triplex assay was tested on a cohort (n = 372; POS = 144/NEG = 228) of nasopharyngeal flocked swab (NPFS) specimens, previously tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using a PCR assay targeting E and RdRp genes. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the SORP assay was: 99.31% (95% CI: 96.22-99.98%), 100.0% (95% CI: 98.4-100%) respectively. The SORP assay could also detect a panel of variants of concern (VOC) from the B1.1.7 (UK) and B1.351 (SA) lineage. In summary, access to a repertoire of new SARS-CoV-2 LDT's would assist diagnostic laboratories in developing strategies to overcome some of the testing issues encountered during high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing.","Gadkar, Vijay J; Goldfarb, David M; Young, Virginia; Watson, Nicole; Al-Rawahi, Ghada N; Srigley, Jocelyn A; Tilley, Peter",Mol Cell Probes,234,22

258713,258713,258713,Corona Virus Disease-19 pandemic: The gastroenterologists' perspective,16.836569,9.619462,2020,"In March 2020, TTUHSC opened a new 20,000sf Institute of Anatomical Sciences for human gross anatomy. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck and many schools shifted from in person to online teaching, we hypothesized that if safety measures were used, in person cadaveric anatomy could be safely taught without a decrease in student performance. To test this, we reduced onsite attendance to less than 25% of room capacity. Masks were required at all times and students were instructed to social distance. Six students were assigned per cadaver, but only two students dissected at a time. The other four students reviewed and completed dissections and/or reviewed in groups of two at other allotted times. Thus, students dissected only every third lab. Dissection and lab review attendance was mandatory and students were nearly 100% compliant. Teaching assistants recorded dissected prosections reviews, and these videos were uploaded to password protected course files for independent learning. Students were provided iPads in the laboratory and access to three software packages for use on and off site. All students had access to multiple formative quizzes and exams, and three new online practice practical exams were created. To help reduce testing anxiety, a pass/fail system replaced categorical grading. However, all written and practical exams were conducted on site and in person. At TTUHSC, we have developed an exam question database to track historical student performance including a 25-question optional pre-block practice exam used to assess incoming student anatomical aptitude. In 2020, 90% of incoming students (93% in 2019) took the pre-block exam and scored an average of 28% (24% in 2019). In 2020, despite vastly different content delivery approaches (&gt;80% of lectures were on Zoom) and reduced in-person dissection requirements, students modestly outperformed their 2019 counterparts. Overall exam averages were 89% in 2020 compared to 87% in 2019. If a categorical system was in place, 66% of students would have earned Honors or High Pass in 2020 compared to 61% in 2019. Our formative assessments were highly predictive of summative exam performance, and students reported that they reduced exam stress. Furthermore, summative exam averages correlated strongly with NBME performance (p&lt;0.0001, r2=0.63). TTUHSC medical students estimated that a majority of their peers at other medical schools did not have any in person dissection in 2020. Our students ranked in person laboratory dissection as the most useful learning activity, 88% reported that our COVID-19 preparations were very good to outstanding, and 97% were satisfied with the quality of their anatomy education. We conclude that 1) When using appropriate precautions, in person cadaveric anatomy can be taught safely during a pandemic;2) cadaveric dissection is essential for mastery of anatomical concepts;and 3) coupling online learning modalities with rigorous formative assessments prevented a modest reduction in cadaveric dissection opportunities from negatively impacting student performance.","Davis, Vanessa Plata Gabrielle Gunter Brady Rodriguez Jaremy Wall John Dang Michael Gilbert Kerry Kaur Gurvinder Bishop Keith Schneider Brandt",The FASEB Journal,234,22

The aim of this retrospective study is to compare the clinical features and outcomes of patients admitted in different phases of the outbreak in a COVID-19 hospital hub, with a particular focus on age, multimorbidity, and functional dependency. The clinical records of 1264 patients with clinical and radiological features compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted in February-June, 2020, were analyzed, retrieving demographical, clinical, laboratory data, and outcomes. All variables were compared after stratification by the period of admission (first phase: rising slope of pandemic wave; second phase: plateau and falling slope), age, results of the first reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), multimorbidity (&#8805;2 chronic diseases), and presence of disability. Factors independently associated with hospital mortality were determined by multivariate forward-selection logistic regression. Patients admitted during the second phase were older, more frequently multimorbid, disabled, and of female gender. However, on admission they exhibited milder respiratory impairment (PaO2/FiO2 268, IQR 174-361, vs. 238, IQR 126-327 mmHg, p < 0.001) and lower mortality (22% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). Age, respiratory exchanges, positive RT-PCR test, number of chronic diseases (odds ratio (OR) 1.166, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.036-1.313, p = 0.011), and disability (OR 1.927, 95% CI 1.027-3.618, p = 0.022) were positively associated with mortality, while admission during the second phase exhibited an inverse association (OR 0.427, 95% CI 0.260-0.700, p = 0.001). In conclusion, older multimorbid patients were mainly hospitalized during the second phase of the pandemic wave. The prognosis was strongly influenced by the COVID-19 phenotype and period of admission, not just by age, multimorbidity, and disability.","Ticinesi, Andrea; Nouvenne, Antonio; Cerundolo, Nicoletta; Parise, Alberto; Prati, Beatrice; Guerra, Angela; Meschi, Tiziana",,234,2

Using standardized self-report measures, we examined differences in stress and sleep by comparing responses from three independent samples of undergraduates in the United States. Samples were obtained prior to COVID-19 (Spring 2019) and at two periods during the pandemic (Spring 2020 and Summer 2020) which corresponded to an increasing impact of COVID-19 at the local level. Within the combined sample of 1222 students, 94% identified as Hispanic. Contrary to our hypotheses, stress, sleep quality and insomnia were not significantly higher in the samples collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in support of our hypotheses, bedtime and waketime were significantly later during the pandemic, and sleep duration was significantly longer. Although scores on the global measure of sleep quality did not differ across semesters, supplemental exploratory analyses demonstrated a more complex picture of differences in sleep variables. Among the findings, there was evidence of greater sleep latency, greater sleep medication use and poorer sleep efficiency during the pandemic. Our results suggest that, within the US college student population, COVID-19's impact on stress and sleep may not be entirely negative.","Benham, Grant",Stress health (Online),234,26

Multilevel regression models were fitted with individual, household, and state-level covariates, in addition to state and census-region-level random effects. Living in state with the highest quartile of small business closures was associated with increased prevalence of GAD (OR: 1.06; CI: 1.03-1.11) compared to lowest quartile, but had no association with MDD. Living in the highest quartile of urban mobility was associated with lower prevalence of both GAD (OR: 0.88; CI: 0.85-0.93) and MDD (OR: 0.90; CI: 0.86-0.95) relative to the lowest quartile.

An online survey tool that included validated measures of adolescents' MVPA and socio-environmental, potential confounders was administered to youths (e.g., lack of classmates, motivation, possibility of choosing any physical exercise time, possibility of choosing your own exercises, home environment). The analytic sample comprised 127 adolescents aged 15.4 ± 0.5 years on average (52% girls and 48% boys). The results highlight that among adolescents who did not meet the WHO MVPA recommendations before the lockdown, 13.4% had an increased frequency of PA (from 2.9 to 5.4 day/week) (p = 0.01) during the lockdown. In the group who did meet these recommendations before the lockdown, 50% significantly decreased their level of MVPA below the WHO's recommendations (p = 0.01). Self-rated health for PA showed a significantly strong correlation with MVPA in the group of students who met the WHO recommendations before the pandemic (r = 0.76; p < 0.05) but failed to maintain that recommendation during the COVID-19 restriction. The results suggest a negative impact of the pandemic on PA undertaken by youths.

For many patients, a critical gap is the need for expert guidance to overcome barriers, set realistic goals, and provide personalized advice to optimize exercise uptake and adherence. The purpose of this case report is to describe a physical activity coaching program (Engage-PD) for individuals newly diagnosed with PD and to highlight rapid modifications made to this program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): Engage-PD is a single cohort implementation study of a coaching intervention grounded in self-determination theory being conducted at Columbia University Parkinson's Foundation Center of Excellence in New York City, NY (USA), the early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The project was uniquely positioned to be adapted to telehealth delivery and to address an immediate need for support and guidance in the home environment, including people with early-mid-stage PD. Participants completed baseline and follow-up (3 months) assessments and participated in up to 4 coaching sessions, all delivered via a telehealth platform. The intervention incorporated 1:1 coaching, goal-setting, physical activity monitoring, and use of a disease-specific workbook to promote and support safe exercise uptake. RESULTS: While the program is ongoing, 52 referrals were received and 27 individuals with PD enrolled in the first 2 months of the pandemic for a recruitment rate of 52%. Although direct comparisons with pre-coronavirus recruitment are difficult due to the recency of the Engage-PD implementation study, this recruitment rate was larger than expected, which may have been due to several factors (eg, most patients had limited, if any, access to in-person programs and therapy services during this time, so the Engage program filled an immediate need to provide exercise and activity guidance). There was a wide range of scores for both baseline physical activity and self-efficacy measures. CONCLUSION: Remotely delivered interventions may serve as a sustainable platform for physical activity coaching programs for people with PD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. IMPACT: With the uncertainty brought about by the current pandemic, this case report highlights the opportunity to shift the current model of care for individuals with neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.","Quinn, Lori; Macpherson, Chelsea; Long, Katrina; Shah, Hiral",Phys Ther,234,16

This systematic review aims to synthesize the extant literature reporting on barriers of telemental health (TMH) during the COVID-19 pandemic and how facilities have worked to overcome these barriers, to inform best practices for TMH delivery. RECENT FINDINGS: Most recent findings came from case studies from mental health professionals which reported on barriers related to institutional, provider and patient factors, and how these barriers were overcome. Common barriers identified in the literature include: technological difficulties;issues regarding safety, privacy and confidentiality;therapeutic delivery and the patient-provider relationship;and a loss of sense of community. Studies also reported on the benefits to TMH interventions/tools, as well as suggestions for improvements in the delivery of TMH services. SUMMARY: As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, mental healthcare providers continue to find creative and feasible solutions to overcome barriers to the delivery of TMH. Dissemination of these solutions is imperative to ensure the best quality of mental healthcare for patients across the globe.","Siegel, A.; Zuo, Y.; Moghaddamcharkari, N.; McIntyre, R.

In order the determine its role, we measured plasma levels of Chemokine (C{square}X{square}C motif) ligand 16 (CXCL16) in the plasma of COVID-19 hospitalized patients. CXCL16 interacts with CXCR6 promoting chemotaxis or cell adhesion. The CXCR6/CXCL16 axis mediates homing of T cells to the lungs in disease and hyper-expression is associated with localised cellular injury. To characterize the CXCR6/CXCL16 axis in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, plasma concentrations of CXCL16 collected at baseline from 115 hospitalized COVID-19 patients participating in ODYSSEY COVID-19 clinical trial were assessed together with a set of controls. We report elevated levels of CXCL16 in a cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Specifically, we report significant elevation of CXCL16 plasma levels in association with severity of COVID-19 (as defined by WHO scale) (P-value<0.02). Our current study is the largest thus far study reporting CXCL16 levels in COVID-19 hospitalized patients (with whole-genome sequencing data available). The results further support the significant role of the CXCR6/CXCL16 axis in the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and warrants further studies to understand which patients would benefit most from targeted treatments.","SMIESZEK, SANDRA P; Polymeropoulos, Vasilios M; Polymeropulos, Christos M; Przychodzen, Bartloemiej P; Birznieks, Gunther; Polymeropoulos, Mihael M",,234,1

The recent outbreak of Corona Virus disease 19 (COVID-19) highlighted the urgent need for effective treatment, and initiated rapid search for therapies, able to counter the most severe disease effects. Many aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis are unknown, but complex interplay of direct viral damage and immune response dysregulation is underline. Intensive research is undergoing for therapeutic targets of virus and high-efficiency and low toxicity targeted drugs. There is no available specific antiviral treatment of this disease, therefore repurposing of drugs already available for the treatment of other viral and autoimmune diseases has been a part of research efforts. Well known anti-inflammatory properties of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, agents widely used in dermatology, made them potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. We review pathogenesis and clinical characteristic of COVID-19, as well as treatment options that have been under evaluation in past several months.

These restrictions were justified on the basis the health system may be overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases and in order to prevent deaths. Governments are now considering how they may de-escalate these restrictions. This article argues that an appropriate approach may be to lift the general lockdown but implement selective isolation of the elderly. While this discriminates against the elderly, there is a morally relevant difference-the elderly are far more likely to require hospitalisation and die than the rest of the population. If the aim is to ensure the health system is not overwhelmed and to reduce the death rate, preventing the elderly from contracting the virus may be an effective means of achieving this. The alternative is to continue to keep everyone in lockdown. It is argued that this is levelling down equality and is unethical. It suggests that in order for the elderly to avoid contracting the virus, the whole population should have their liberty deprived, even though the same result could be achieved by only restricting the liberty of the elderly. Similar arguments may also be applied to all groups at increased risk of COVID-19, such as men and those with comorbidities, the obese and people from ethnic minorities or socially deprived groups. This utilitarian concern must be balanced against other considerations, such as equality and justice, and the benefits gained from discriminating in these ways must be proportionately greater than the negative consequences of doing so. Such selective discrimination will be most justified when the liberty restriction to a group promotes the well-being of that group (apart from its wider social benefits).","Savulescu, Julian; Cameron, James",J Med Ethics,234,26

This is of particular importance to pancreatic cancer, given that standard diagnostic modalities such as endoscopy may be restricted, and that disease biology precludes significant delays in treatment. In light of this, we sought consensus from UK clinicians with an interest in pancreatic cancer for management approaches that would minimise patient risk and accommodate for healthcare service restrictions.

During the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, people have been advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to maintain social distancing of at least 2 m to limit the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. We carry out a physics modeling study for SARS-CoV-2 transport in air. We show that if aerosols and droplets follow semi-ballistic emission trajectories, then their horizontal range is proportional to the particle's diameter. For standard ambient temperature and pressure conditions, the horizontal range of these aerosols remains safely below 2 m. We also show that aerosols and droplets can remain suspended for hours in the air, providing a health threat of airborne infection. The latter argues in favor of implementing additional precautions to the recommended 2~m social distancing, e.g. wearing a face mask when we are out in public.","Anchordoqui, Luis A.; Dent, James B.; Weiler, Thomas J.",,234,24

In contrast, change-focused metaphors may foster growth mindsets and self-efficacy-cornerstones of well-being and action. We randomly assigned participants to read one of two articles-either an article about coronavirus that focused on fighting the war or an article that highlighted the possibility of change. In Study 1 (N = 426), participants who read the war, relative to the change, message reported lower growth mindsets and self-efficacy and these in turn, predicted lower well-being and weaker intentions to engage in health behaviours. In Study 2, (N = 702), we sought to replicate findings and included a no treatment control. We failed to replicate the effects of message condition, although both messages predicted greater self-efficacy compared to the control. Similar to Study 1, growth mindsets predicted intentions to engage in recommended health behaviours and self-efficacy predicted both well-being and action.

This has led to clinicians having an increasing number of difficult conversations with patients and their relatives over the phone. There is a lack of published literature examining how to do this well, but it is recognised that phone communication does differ from face to face interactions, and requires specific training. What is most important to patients and their families when receiving bad news is privacy, adequate time without interruptions, clarity and honesty when delivering the information, and an empathetic and caring attitude. Much of the work done on breaking bad news has been done in oncology and focusses on face to face interaction; there has been an assumption that this is transferrable to the emergency department, and more recently that this is applicable to conversations over the phone. Multiple educational interventions to improve the delivery of bad news have been developed, with differing frameworks to help clinicians carry out this stressful task. Simulation is widely used to train clinicians to break bad news, and has solid theoretical foundations for its use. The psychological safety of participants must be considered, especially with emotive subjects such as breaking bad news. We believe there is a need for specific training in breaking bad news over the phone, and developed an innovative simulation-based session to address this. The training has been well received, and has also highlighted the need for a space where clinicians feel able to discuss the emotional impact of the difficult conversations they are having.","Collini, Anna; Parker, Helen; Oliver, Amy",Emerg. med. j,234,16

In the absence of specific antiviral treatments capable of neutralizing the etiological agent, one therapeutic approach is to control the cytokine storm responsible for the most severe forms of the disease. The characteristic cytokine profile of severely affected patients is increased levels of interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;). AREAS COVERED: This article discusses the pathogenesis of COVID-19 as a rationale for using the biological and targeted synthetic drugs used in rheumatology (anti-TNF, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 agents and baricitinib) to treat the disease, and provides key information concerning their potential benefits and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: Interleukin inhibition seems to be a promising means of treating COVID-19 patients when respiratory function declines (or even earlier) if there are laboratory data indicating the presence of a cytokine storm because the interleukins are key drivers of inflammation. However, it is important to consider the risks and benefits of biological agents carefully, and critically analyze the evidence concerning their use in COVID-19 patients.","Atzeni, Fabiola; Gerratana, Elisabetta; Giallanza, Manuela; La Corte, Laura; Nucera, Valeria; Miceli, Gianfranco; Sangari, Donatella; Masala, Ignazio Francesco",Expert Opin Biol Ther,234,10

However, in many settings of interest, agent utility functions themselves vary as a result of past agent choices. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic provides an example: a highly prevalent virus may incentivize individuals to wear masks, but extensive adoption of mask-wearing reduces virus prevalence which in turn reduces individual incentives for mask-wearing. This paper develops a general framework using probabilistic coupling methods that can be used to derive the stochastically stable states of log-linear learning in certain games which feature such game-environment feedback. As a case study, we apply this framework to a simple dynamic game-theoretic model of social precautions in an epidemic and give conditions under which maximally cautious social behavior in this model is stochastically stable.","Collins, Brandon C.; Hines, Lisa; Barboza, Gia; Brown, Philip N.",,234,28

Here, we show that anti-N immune protection is mediated by the cytosolic Fc receptor and E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. Exploiting LCMV as a model system, we demonstrate that TRIM21 uses anti-N antibodies to target N for cytosolic degradation and generate cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) against N peptide. These CTLs rapidly eliminate N-peptide-displaying cells and drive efficient viral clearance.

In addition to mucolytic effects, N-Acetylcysteine has antioxidant effects that we believe can help patients recover. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of N-Acetylcysteine in patients with severe COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, phase 3 controlled clinical trial with two arms (ratio 1:1) parallel-group design of 40 patients, using the placebo in the control group. PARTICIPANTS: All severe COVID-19 patients with at least one of the following five conditions: (respiration rate > 30 per minute), hypoxemia (O2 &#8804; saturation, arterial oxygen partial pressure ratio <300), pulmonary infiltration (> 50% of lung area during 24 48 h), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 245 U / l, Progressive lymphopenia, and admitted to the intensive care unit of Shahid Mohammadi Hospital in Bandar Abbas and have positive PCR test results for SARS-Cov-2 and sign the written consent of the study will be included. Patients will be excluded from the study if they have a history of hypersensitivity to N-Acetylcysteine, pregnancy, or refuse to participate in the study. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: After randomization, participants in the intervention group receive standard of care (SOC) according to the National Committee of COVID-19 plus N-acetylcysteine (EXI-NACE 200mg/mL, in 10mL ampules of saline for parenteral injection (EXIR pharmaceutical company)) at a dose of 300 mg/kg equivalent to 20 gr as a slow single intravenous injection on the first day of hospitalization. In the control group patients receive SOC and placebo ( Sterile water for injection as the same dose). The placebo is identical in appearance to the N-acetylcysteine injection (EXIR pharmaceutical company as well). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint for this study is a composite endpoint for the length of hospitalization in the intensive care unit and the patient's clinical condition. These outcomes were measured at the baseline (before the intervention) and on the 14th day after the intervention or on the discharge day. RANDOMISATION: Eligible participants (40) will be randomized in two arms in the ratio of 1: 1 (20 per arm) using online web-based tools and by permuted block randomization method. To ensure randomization concealment, random sequence codes are assigned to patients by the treatment team at the time of admission without knowing that each code is in the intervention or comparator group. BLINDING (MASKING): All participants will be informed about participating in the study and the possible side effects of medication and placebo. Patients participating in the study will not be aware of the assignment to the intervention or control group. The principal investigator, health care personnel, data collectors, and those evaluating the outcome are aware of patient grouping. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 40 patients participate in this study, which are randomly divided; 20 patients in the intervention group will receive SOC and N-acetylcysteine, 20 patients in the control group will receive SOC and placebo.

The research analyzed the reasoning of Fikih Kebencanaan and its actualization in Covid-19 mitigation. The medical health movement and the reconstruction of fiqh of worship during an emergency in particular, and how to deal with the disaster theologically in general. The results showed that the reasoning of Fikih Kebencanaan was expanded in terms of medical, theological, and educational movements. Medical movement is a health movement in the form of providing 74 Covid-19 Standby Hospitals capable of accommodating 3,917 patients or 36.15% of the total number of cases in Indonesia, followed by the distribution of masks, gloves, and foods to 401,209 Covid-19 affected victims.

In contrast, the Indonesian Council of Ulema (MUI) applied zoning. The educative movement was a preventive effort to counter narration stemming from micro-celebrity Da'i & Influencers (religious preachers) tried to circumvent religious provisions with their viral statements on social media. This effort was realized by developing neuroscience Islamic education with learning media in visualization that combined modern comics and contemporary cartoons with cinematic narratives. The neuroscience Islamic education movement tried not to use the dogmatic-monolithic approach as in classical education.","Nuryana, Zalik; Febriana Fauzi, Niki Alma",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,234,16

The energy conservation of the device during the temporary disconnection of the sensor node can play a vital role in the broader acceptance of this technology. Here, a probabilistic hidden Markov model (HMM) is used for energy conservation, a relatively less explored area of energy conservation approach within the field of wireless sensor networks. Since the vital signs of heart rate and blood pressure are highly correlated, the heart rate and blood pressure readings are taken for model development. The classification of normal and critical data is based on the probability of observation sequences in the particular model. The hidden states are estimated using the observation sequence and the HMM parameters during disconnection. Accuracy between 0.9 and 1.0 is obtained for different series. Dynamic threshold limits are included for more adaptability of the model for varying physiological conditions of the patients. The energy conservation possible using the model is discussed. This model presents a novel approach to energy conservation using HMM, which will help continuous home monitoring of vital parameters in geriatrics.","Pillai, R. R.; Lohani, R.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, comparative, and observational study. The patients who were newly or previously prescribed HCQ for an autoimmune disease were included. OCTA imaging was performed via OCT RT XR Avanti with AngioVue software (Optivue Inc, Freemont, CA). The study group had two groups: a control group (patients newly diagnosed and who were not taking any medication) and a treatment group (patients who were receiving HCQ treatment). The main outcome measure was OCTA parameters. RESULTS: A total of 102 eyes of 102 patients were included. There were 70 patients in the treatment group and 32 patients in the control group. All of the vascular density values were similar between the control and treatment groups (p > 0.05 for all). However, the superficial whole thickness, superficial parafoveal thickness, superficial perifoveal thickness, deep whole thickness, deep parafoveal thickness, and deep perifoveal thickness were thinner in the treatment group than the control group (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: Vascular density parameters did not differ between the control and treatment groups. However, the retinal thickness values were lower in the treatment group.","Tarakcioglu, Hatice Nur; Ozkaya, Abdullah; Yigit, Ulviye",Int. ophthalmol,234,15

However, coverage remains variable. In this mini-review we update findings from a 2015 systematic review to describe results from recent studies in high income countries on the uptake of influenza and pertussis vaccination in pregnancy, reasons for vaccine hesitancy and barriers to increasing uptake, from maternal and healthcare provider (HCP) perspectives. Studies reported highly variable uptake (from 0% to 78%). A main facilitator for uptake among pregnant women was receiving a recommendation from their HCP. However, studies showed that HCP awareness of guidelines did not consistently translate into them recommending vaccines to pregnant women. Safety concerns are a well-established barrier to uptake/coverage of maternal immunization; 7%-52% of unvaccinated women gave safety concerns as a reason but these were also present in vaccinated women. Knowledge/awareness gaps among pregnant women and lack of confidence among HCPs to discuss vaccination were both important barriers. Several studies indicated that midwives were more likely to express safety concerns than other HCPs, and less likely to recommend vaccination to pregnant women. Women who perceived the risk of infection to be low were less likely to accept vaccination in several studies, along with women with prior vaccine refusal. Findings highlight the importance of further research to explore context-specific barriers to vaccination in pregnancy, which may include lack of vaccine confidence among pregnant woman and HCPs, and policy and structural factors.","Qiu, Xiao; Bailey, Heather; Thorne, Claire",Front Immunol,234,33

In Europe, this is of particular relevance with ageing populations living with non-communicable diseases, multi-morbidity and frailty. Published estimates of Years Lived with Disability (YLD) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study help to characterise the extent of these effects. Our aim was to identify the countries across Europe that have populations at highest risk from COVID-19 by using estimates of population age structure and YLD for health conditions linked to severe illness from COVID-19. Methods: Population and YLD estimates from GBD 2017 were extracted for 45 countries in Europe. YLD was restricted to a list of specific health conditions associated with being at risk of developing severe consequences from COVID-19 based on guidance from the United Kingdom Government. This guidance also identified individuals aged 70 years and above as being at higher risk of developing severe health consequences. Study outcomes were defined as: (i) proportion of population aged 70 years and above; and (ii) rate of YLD for COVID-19 vulnerable health conditions across all ages. Bivariate groupings were established for each outcome and combined to establish overall population-level vulnerability. Results: Countries with the highest proportions of elderly residents were Italy, Greece, Germany, Portugal and Finland. When assessments of population-level YLD rates for COVID-19 vulnerable health conditions were made, the highest rates were observed for Bulgaria, Czechia, Croatia, Hungary and Bosnia and Herzegovina. A bivariate analysis indicated that the countries at high-risk across both measures of vulnerability were: Bulgaria; Portugal; Latvia; Lithuania; Greece; Germany; Estonia; and Sweden. Conclusion: Routine estimates of population structures and non-fatal burden of disease measures can be usefully combined to create composite indicators of vulnerability for rapid assessments, in this case to severe health consequences from COVID-19. Countries with available results for sub-national regions within their country, or national burden of disease studies that also use sub-national levels for burden quantifications, should consider using non-fatal burden of disease estimates to estimate geographical vulnerability to COVID-19.","Wyper, Grant M A; Assunção, Ricardo; Cuschieri, Sarah; Devleeschauwer, Brecht; Fletcher, Eilidh; Haagsma, Juanita A; Hilderink, Henk B M; Idavain, Jane; Lesnik, Tina; Von der Lippe, Elena; Majdan, Marek; Milicevic, Milena S; Pallari, Elena; Peñalvo, José L; Pires, Sara M; Plaß, Dietrich; Santos, João V; Stockton, Diane L; Thomsen, Sofie Theresa; Grant, Ian",Arch Public Health,234,1

Patients in certain major stereotyped subsets often display remarkably consistent clinicobiological profiles, suggesting that the study of BcR IG stereotypy in CLL has important implications for understanding disease pathophysiology and refining clinical decision-making. Nevertheless, several issues remain open, especially pertaining to the actual frequency of BcR IG stereotypy and major subsets, as well as the existence of higher-order connections between individual subsets. In order to address these issues, we investigated clonotypic IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene rearrangements in a series of 29,856 patients with CLL, by far the largest series worldwide. We report that the stereotyped fraction of CLL peaks at 41% of the entire cohort and that all 19 previously identified major subsets retained their relative size and ranking, while 10 new ones emerged; overall, major stereotyped subsets had a cumulative frequency of 13.5%. Higher-level relationships were evident between subsets, particularly for major stereotyped subsets with unmutated IGHV genes (U-CLL), for which close relations with other subsets, termed 'satellites', were identified. Satellite subsets accounted for 3% of the entire cohort. These results confirm our previous notion that major subsets can be robustly identified and are consistent in relative size, hence representing distinct disease variants amenable to compartmentalized research with the potential of overcoming the pronounced heterogeneity of CLL. Furthermore, the existence of satellite subsets reveals a novel aspect of repertoire restriction with implications for refined molecular classification of CLL.","Agathangelidis, Andreas; Chatzidimitriou, Anastasia; Gemenetzi, Katerina; Giudicelli, Veronique; Karypidou, Maria; Plevova, Karla; Davis, Zadie A; Yan, Xiao-Jie; Jeromin, Sabine; Schneider, Christof; Pedersen, Lone Bredo; Tschumper, Renee; Sutton, Lesley A; Baliakas, Panagiotis; Scarfò, Lydia; van Gastel, Ellen J; Armand, Marine; Tausch, Eugen; Biderman, Bella; Baer, Constance; Bagnara, Davide; Navarro, Alba; de Septenville, Anne; Guido, Valentina; Mitterbauer-Hohendanner, Gerlinde; Dimovski, Aleksandar; Brieghel, Christian; Lawless, Sarah; Meggendorfer, Manja; Stranska, Kamila; Ritgen, Matthias; Facco, Monica; Tresoldi, Cristina; Visentin, Andrea; Patriarca, Andrea; Catherwood, Mark; Bonello, Lisa; Sudarikov, Andrey; Vanura, Katrina; Roumelioti, Maria; Skuhrova Francova, Hana; Moysiadis, Theodoros; Veronese, Silvio M; Giannopoulos, Krzysztof; Mansouri, Larry; Karan-Djurasevic, Teodora; Sandaltzopoulos, Raphael; Bödör, Csaba; Fais, Franco; Kater, Arnon P",Blood,234,26

While intuitive, our understanding of such feedback loop is still limited. Before COVID-19 the literature on the subject was mainly theoretical and largely missed validation. The main issue was the lack of empirical data capturing behavioral change induced by diseases. Things have dramatically changed in 2020.

Assessing the effect of COVID-19 on liver injury is of great importance. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to establish the characteristics of liver function tests in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic search of publications from December 2019 up to April 2020 in Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline (via PubMed) databases was performed. Both cross-sectional and case series studies reporting an association between liver injury and COVID-19 infection were included. The data were analyzed using the STATA software (version 11.0) and the random-effects model for I²&gt;50% was used to pool the results. Results: In this meta-analysis, 42 articles comprising a total of 6,557 COVID-19 patients were studied. The prevalence of increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels was 30% and 21% in non-severe patients and 38% and 48% in severe patients, respectively. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection were 4.22, 4.96, and 4.13 times more likely to have elevated AST, ALT, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, respectively. Conclusion: Elevation in liver function tests was higher in patients with severe than non-severe COVID-19 infection. Given the widespread use of drugs that increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, healthcare providers should be aware of changes in liver enzymes in COVID-19 patients. The inclusion of other studies from outside China could confirm the pattern of elevation in liver function tests in COVID-19 patients across the globe.

Rapid antigen (AG) tests provide results within minutes;however, their accuracy has been questioned. The study aims to determine the accuracy and cost of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 AG test compared with RT-PCR. METHODS: Individuals 18 years or older with an appointment for a RT-PCR test on 26-31 December 2020 at a public test centre in Copenhagen, Denmark were invited to participate. An oropharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR analysis, followed by a nasopharyngeal swab examined by the AG test (SD Biosensor). The diagnostic accuracy of the AG test was calculated with RT-PCR as reference. Costs were evaluated for both tests. RESULTS: A total of 4,811 paired conclusive test results were collected (median age: 45 years, female: 53%). The RT-PCR test revealed 221 (4.6%) positive tests. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the AG test were 69.7% and 99.5%, respectively. Viral cycle threshold values were significantly higher in individuals with false negative AG tests than in individuals who were true positives. The RT-PCR test and AG test costs were 67.0 DKK (10.8 USD) and 35.0 DKK (5.7 USD), respectively, per positive case detected at 100,000 daily tests. CONCLUSIONS: The AG test enables mass testing and provides immediate results, which is important in SARS-CoV-2 screening. The AG test is a good and relevant supplement to RT-PCR testing in public SARS-CoV-2 screenings. FUNDING: This project received no external funding.

Taking a difference-in-differences approach, we find that receiving online education during the COVID-19 lockdown improved student academic results by 0.22 of a standard deviation, relative to pupils without learning support from their school. Not all online education was equal: students who were given recorded online lessons from external higher-quality teachers had higher exam scores than those whose lessons were recorded by teachers from their own school. The educational benefits of distance learning were the same for rural and urban students, but the exam performance of students who used a computer for online education was better than those who used a smartphone.

This architecture supplies a solution for realizing the dynamical programming on a one-way quantum computer and maximally taking advantage of quantum computing throughout the calculation. Moreover, our algorithm works on many physical platforms, and particularly the upsampling layer can use either conventional qubits or multiple-level systems.

SETTING: A nested case-control design using confirmed case reports released from the news or the national/provincial/municipal health commissions of China between 18 December 2019 and 8 March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, excluding asymptomatic patients, in mainland China outside of Hubei Province. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demographics, survival time and status, and history of comorbidities. METHOD: A total of 94 publicly reported deaths in locations outside of Hubei Province, mainland China, were included as cases. Each case was matched with up to three controls, based on gender and age ±1 year old (94 cases and 181 controls). The inverse probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard model was performed, controlling for age, gender and the early period of the outbreak. RESULTS: Of the 94 cases, the median age was 72.5 years old (IQR=16), and 59.6% were men, while in the control group the median age was 67 years old (IQR=22), and 64.6% were men. Adjusting for age, gender and the early period of the outbreak, poor health conditions were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (HR of comorbidity score, 1.31 [95% CI 1.11 to 1.54]; p=0.001). The estimated mortality risk in patients with pre-existing coronary heart disease (CHD) was three times that of those without CHD (p<0.001). The estimated 30-day survival probability for a profile patient with pre-existing CHD (65-year-old woman with no other comorbidities) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.82), while it was 0.85 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.91) for those without CHD. Older age was also associated with increased mortality risk: every 1-year increase in age was associated with a 4% increased risk of mortality (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Extra care and early medical interventions are needed for patients with pre-existing comorbidities, especially CHD.","Gu, Tian; Chu, Qiao; Yu, Zhangsheng; Fa, Botao; Li, Anqi; Xu, Lei; Wu, Ruijun; He, Yaping",BMJ Open,234,20

All English version studies that reported ethical challenges of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, from November 9, 2019, to November 9, 2020, were eligible for the review. The electronic databases used were PubMed, Google Scholar, JURN, Cochrane Library E-Journals, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL. Accordingly, 8 articles were included for further analysis and synthesis. The ethical challenges of nurses were categorized into three thematic areas: nurses' safety, role and moral distress, resource allocation, and client-nurse relationship. Thus, the lack of full protection of nurses across the health industry has raised ethical questions such as the extent of their duty, scarce resources, and the failure of personal protective equipment. In connection, a significant number of nurses were also facing moral distress because of prolonged pressure to maintain the resources needed to provide safe and high-quality nursing care. Furthermore, nurses were challenged to restrict many COVID-19 patients from having end-of-life communication with their families. Overall, nurses are still facing various ethical challenges across the globe.

In teaching, standardized patients (SPs) are increasingly being used to present conversation situations with students and provide feedback afterwards. In order to maintain this teaching concept under pandemic conditions, a digital model was developed that should offer both high security and high authenticity. Methodology: A total of 176 teaching units of 45 minutes each were conducted digitally from May to August 2020. During the teaching units, medical students conducted interviews with SPs portraying various patients. The online conference software ""HeiConf"" was used for this purpose. During the teaching units, a total of 354 students were able to practice conversation techniques such as NURSE and SPIKES. After the teaching units, feedback was provided by students and SPs. Results: The digital lessons about medical conversation with SPs received positive feedback from SPs and students. The authenticity of the role portrayal of SPs seemed to be unaffected by the new format. Students were successful in training and observing conversation techniques. However, aspects of non-verbal communication, atmosphere and group dynamics as well as further discussions could not be carried out to the same extent as in the usual classroom teaching. Conclusion: The conversion of SP-based teaching to a digital format was successful in a short period of time and was able to prevent a cancellation of teaching units about medical conversation. Concrete conversation techniques could be tried out digitally by students. Due to the deficits of digital teaching in terms of non-verbal communication and atmosphere, a blended-learning format is planned for the future. In the first instance, concrete conversation techniques will be learned online in order to focus more on profound aspects of communication and discussions in a later physical teaching unit with SPs, thus enabling a learning experience that is as authentic as possible.","Hartmann, Lilly; Kaden, Jens J; Strohmer, Renate",GMS J Med Educ,234,0

The aim of this research was to examine the influence of pre-pandemic sports participation and substance use and misuse (SUM) on PAL during the COVID­19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 661 high-school students from Bosnia and Herzegovina (aged 15-18 years, 292 females). The investigation included 2 testing waves: before the COVID­19 pandemic (baseline, January 2020) and during the COVID­19 lockdown (follow-up, April 2020). The variables included PAL as measured by the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents, sports factors, and SUM. RESULTS: Sports factors at baseline were positively correlated with PALs at both baseline and follow-up. Smoking tobacco negatively affected PALs at both baseline and follow-up. Alcohol consumption was positively correlated with PAL at baseline but had no effect on PAL at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the importance of sports participation in maintaining PAL during challenging situations, such as the COVID­19 lockdown. The substance-specific influence of SUM on PAL before and during the lockdown points to evident social and cultural aspects of SUM behaviors in adolescents. Further studies evidencing the cumulative effects of PAL decline during the lockdown are warranted.","Gilic, Barbara; Zenic, Natasa; Separovic, Vlatko; Jurcev Savicevic, Anamarija; Sekulic, Damir",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,234,14

We previously reported that failure of PR interval shortening with increasing heart rate (HR) in patients with COVID-19 is associated with adverse outcomes. Here, we report on heart rate variability (HRV) and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (cAF) hospitalized for COVID-19. Methods A retrospective review of admitted COVID-19 patients with cAF between 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020 was performed. HRV in cAF was compared during pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 admissions;we selected pre-COVID-19 ECGs with HRs that were within 10 beats per minute of the COVID-19 ECGs. Mean HR and each RR interval were recorded. Time-domain measurements of HR variability were then calculated (SDSD, RMSSD, pNN50). Clinical outcomes during COVID-19 were correlated to indices of HRV. Results A total of 184 ECGs (95 pre-COVID-19, 89 COVID-19) from 38 cAF in-patients were included. Mean age 78.6 ± 11.4 years, male 44.7%. The mean number of ECGs analyzed per patient pre-COVID-19 was 2.50 and during COVID-19 was 2.34. Comparing pre-COVID-19 versus COVID-19 ECGs showed: mean HR (95.9 ± 24.3 vs. 101.6 ± 22.8 BPM;P = .10), SDSD (109.0 ± 50.6 vs. 90.3 ± 37.2 ms;P &lt; .01), RMSSD (184.1 ± 80.4 vs. 147.3 ± 59.8 ms;P &lt; .01), pNN50 (73.8 ± 16.3 vs. 65.6 ± 16.6%;P &lt; .01).

Conclusion In patients with cAF, the HRV was reduced during COVID-19 compared with prior illnesses at similar average heart rates. Patients with the most depressed HRV as measured by pNN50 had an associated increase in mortality compared with patients whose HRV was preserved.","Junarta, Joey Riley Joshua M.; Pavri, Behzad B.",Journal of Arrhythmia,234,28

Coronavirus (COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) as a viral pneumonia causative agent, infects thousands of people in China and worldwide. There is currently no specific medicine or vaccine available and it is considered a threat to develop effective novel drug or anti-coronavirus vaccine treatment. However, natural compounds to treat coronaviruses are the most alternative and complementary therapies due to their diverse range of biological and therapeutic properties. METHODS: We performed an open-ended, English restricted search of Scopus database, Web of Science, and Pubmed for all available literature from Jan-March, 2020, using terms related to phytochemical compounds, medicinal plants and coronavirus. RESULTS: The view on anti-coronavirus (anti-CoV) activity in the plant derived phytochemicals and medicinal plants give the strong base to develop a novel treatment of corona virus activity. Various phytochemicals and medicinal plant extracts have been revised and considered to be the potential anti-CoV agents for effective control and future drug development. We discuss some important plants (Scutellaria baicalensis, Psorothamnus arborescens, Glycyrrhiza radix, Glycyrrhiza uralensis , Lycoris radiate, Phyllanthus emblica, Camellia sinensis, Hyptis atrorubens Poit, Fraxinus sieboldiana, Erigeron breviscapus, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, Amaranthus tricolor, Phaseolus vulgaris, Rheum palmatum, Curcuma longa and Myrica cerifera) emerged to have broad spectrum antiviral activity. CONCLUSION: Nigella sativa has potent anti-SARS-CoV activity and it might be useful souce for developing novel antiviral therapies for coronaviruses.","Idrees, Muhammad; Khan, Shamshad; Memon, Nazakat Hussain; Zhang, Zhiyong",Curr pharm. biotechnol,234,12

In this work, we have analyzed the topology of the active site regions in 146 three-dimensional structures of proteins belonging to the Papain-like Cysteine Proteinase (PCP) superfamily, which includes papain as a typical representative of this protein superfamily. All analyzed enzymes contain a unique structurally closed conformation - a ""PCP-Zone"" - which can be divided into two groups, Class A and Class B. Eight structurally conserved amino acids of the PCP-Zone form a common Structural Core. The Structural Core, catalytic nucleophile, catalytic base and residue Xaa - which stabilizes the side-chain conformation of the catalytic base - make up a PCP Structural Catalytic Core (PCP-SCC). The PCP-SCC of Class A and Class B are divided into 5 and 2 types, respectively. Seven variants of the mutual arrangement of the amino-acid side chains of the catalytic triad - nucleophile, base and residue Xaa - within the same fold clearly demonstrate how enzymes with the papain-like fold adapt to the need to perform diverse functions in spite of their limited structural diversity.

We hypothesized that colchicine, by counteracting proinflammatory pathways implicated in the uncontrolled inflammatory response of COVID-19 patients, reduces pulmonary complications, and improves survival. METHODS: This retrospective study included 71 consecutive COVID-19 patients (hospitalized with pneumonia on CT scan or outpatients) who received colchicine and compared with 70 control patients who did not receive colchicine in two serial time periods at the same institution. We used inverse probability of treatment propensity-score weighting to examine differences in mortality, clinical improvement (using a 7-point ordinary scale), and inflammatory markers between the two groups. RESULTS: Amongst the 141 COVID-19 patients (118 [83.7%] hospitalized), 70 (50%) received colchicine. The 21-day crude cumulative mortality was 7.5% in the colchicine group and 28.5% in the control group (P = 0.006; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.24 [95%CI: 0.09 to 0.67]); 21-day clinical improvement occurred in 40.0% of the patients on colchicine and in 26.6% of control patients (adjusted relative improvement rate: 1.80 [95%CI: 1.00 to 3.22]). The strong association between the use of colchicine and reduced mortality was further supported by the diverging linear trends of percent daily change in lymphocyte count (P = 0.018), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.003), and in C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.009). Colchicine was stopped because of transient side effects (diarrhea or skin rashes) in 7% of patients. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort study colchicine was associated with reduced mortality and accelerated recovery in COVID-19 patients. This support the rationale for current larger randomized controlled trials testing the safety/efficacy profile of colchicine in COVID-19 patients.","Manenti, Lucio; Maggiore, Umberto; Fiaccadori, Enrico; Meschi, Tiziana; Antoni, Anna Degli; Nouvenne, Antonio; Ticinesi, Andrea; Cerundolo, Nicoletta; Prati, Beatrice; Delsante, Marco; Gandoflini, Ilaria; Donghi, Lorenzo; Gentile, Micaela; Farina, Maria Teresa; Oliva, Vincenzo; Zambrano, Cristina; Regolisti, Giuseppe; Palmisano, Alessandra; Caminiti, Caterina; Cocchi, Enrico; Ferrari, Carlo; Riella, Leonardo V; Cravedi, Paolo; Peruzzi, Licia",PLoS One,234,16

The present study was designed to describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, and prognosis of 74 hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Clinical data of 74 COVID-19 patients were collected to analyze the epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data. Thirty-two patients were followed up and tested for the presence of the viral nucleic acid and by pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scan at 7 and 14âdays after they were discharged.Among all COVID-19 patients, the median incubation period for patients and the median period from symptom onset to admission was all 6âdays; the median length of hospitalization was 13âdays. Fever symptoms were presented in 83.78% of the patients, and the second most common symptom was cough (74.32%), followed by fatigue and expectoration (27.03%). Inflammatory indicators, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) of the intensive care unit (ICU) patients were significantly higher than that of the non-ICU patients (Pâ<â.05). However, 50.00% of the ICU patients had their the ratio of T helper cells to cytotoxic T cells (CD4/CD8) ratio lower than 1.1, whose proportion is much higher than that in non-ICU patients (Pâ<â.01).Compared with patients in Wuhan, COVID-19 patients in Anhui Province seemed to have milder symptoms of infection, suggesting that there may be some regional differences in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between different cities.","Yang, Jiazhao; Wu, Kerong; Ding, Ao; Li, Li; Lu, Hui; Zhu, Wanbo; Xie, Kai; Yao, Ziqin; Fang, Shiyuan",Medicine (Baltimore),234,16

Analytical sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus was determined for the RAD test using viral culture and RT-PCR as reference methods. The RAD test was further evaluated using respiratory samples collected from confirmed COVID-19 patients. The results were compared with RT-PCR test. RESULTS: The detection limits between RAD test, viral culture and RT-PCR varied hugely. RAD was 103 fold less sensitive than viral culture while RAD was 105 fold less sensitive than RT-PCR. The RAD test detected between 11.1 % and 45.7 % of RT-PCR-positive samples from COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the RAD test serves only as adjunct to RT-PCR test because of potential for false-negative results.","Mak, Gannon Ck; Cheng, Peter Kc; Lau, Stephen Sy; Wong, Kitty Ky; Lau, C S; Lam, Edman Tk; Chan, Rickjason Cw; Tsang, Dominic Nc",J Clin Virol,234,1

This chemokine is constitutively expressed in the respiratory tract, suggesting a role in lung defenses. However, little is known about the participation of CXCL17 against relevant respiratory pathogens in humans. Here, we evaluated the serum levels and lung tissue expression pattern of CXCL17 in a cohort of patients with severe pandemic influenza A(H1N1) from Mexico City. Peripheral blood samples obtained on admission and seven days after hospitalization were processed for determinations of serum CXCL17 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of CXCL17 was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHQ) in lung autopsy specimens from patients that succumbed to the disease. Serum CXCL17 levels were also analyzed in two additional comparative cohorts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients. Additionally, the expression of CXCL17 was tested in lung autopsy specimens from COVID-19 patients. A total of 122 patients were enrolled in the study, from which 68 had pandemic influenza A(H1N1), 24 had COVID-19, and 30 with PTB. CXCL17 was detected in post-mortem lung specimens from patients that died of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) and COVID-19. Interestingly, serum levels of CXCL17 were increased only in patients with pandemic influenza A(H1N1), but not COVID-19 and PTB. CXCL17 not only differentiated pandemic influenza A(H1N1) from other respiratory infections but showed prognostic value for influenza-associated mortality and renal failure in machine-learning algorithms and regression analyses. Using cell culture assays, we also identified that human alveolar A549 cells and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages increase their CXCL17 production capacity after influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus infection. Our results for the first time demonstrate an induction of CXCL17 specifically during pandemic influenza A(H1N1), but not COVID-19 and PTB in humans. These findings could be of great utility to differentiate influenza and COVID-19 and to predict poor prognosis specially at settings of high incidence of pandemic A(H1N1). Future studies on the role of CXCL17 not only in severe pandemic influenza, but also in seasonal influenza, COVID-19, and PTB are required to validate our results.","Choreño-Parra, Jose Alberto; Jiménez-Álvarez, Luis Armando; Ramírez-Martínez, Gustavo; Sandoval-Vega, Montserrat; Salinas-Lara, Citlaltepetl; Sánchez-Garibay, Carlos; Luna-Rivero, Cesar; Hernández-Montiel, Erika Mariana; Fernández-López, Luis Alejandro; Cabrera-Cornejo, María Fernanda; Choreño-Parra, Eduardo Misael; Cruz-Lagunas, Alfredo; Domínguez, Andrea; Márquez-García, Eduardo; Cabello-Gutiérrez, Carlos; Bolaños-Morales, Francina Valezka; Mena-Hernández, Lourdes; Delgado-Zaldivar, Diego; Rebolledo-García, Daniel; Guadarrama-Ortiz, Parménides; Regino-Zamarripa, Nora E; Mendoza-Milla, Criselda; García-Latorre, Ethel A; Rodiguez-Reyna, Tatiana Sofia; Cervántes-Rosete, Diana; Hernández-Cárdenas, Carmen M; Khader, Shabaana A; Zlotnik, Albert; Zúñiga, Joaquín",Front Immunol,234,26

We have tried to search the epitopic component of the S-protein that might be served as crucial targets for the vaccine development and also tried to understand the molecular mechanism of epitopes and TLR4/MD-2 complex for adaptive immunity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here we identified the antigenicity and the epitopic divergence of S-protein via immunoinformatics approach. The study was performed to identify the epitopes, composition of amino acids and its distribution in epitopic regions, composition of amino acid between the identified epitopes, secondary structure architecture of epitopes, physicochemical and biochemical parameters and molecular interaction between the identified epitope and TLR4/MD-2 complex. The SARS-CoV-2 can be possibly recognised by TLR4 of host immune cells that are responsible for the adaptive immune response. RESULTS: We identified four SARS-CoV-2 S-protein 9mer antigenic epitopes and observed that they bind with the TLR4/MD-2 complex by varied stable molecular bonding interactions. Molecular interaction between these characterized epitopes with TLR4/MD-2 complex might be indicated the binding affinity and downstream signalling of adaptive immune response. Different physicochemical and biochemical parameters such as O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation, Hydrophobicity, GRAVY were identified within epitopic regions of S-protein. These parameters help to understand the protein-protein interaction between epitopes and TLR4/MD-2 complex. The study also revealed different epitopic binding pockets of TLR4/MD-2 complex. CONCLUSIONS: The identified epitopes impart suitable prospects for the development of novel peptide-based epitopic vaccine for the control of COVID-19 infection.","Bhattacharya, Manojit; Sharma, Ashish Ranjan; Mallick, Bidyut; Sharma, Garima; Lee, Sang-Soo; Chakraborty, Chiranjib",Infect Genet Evol,234,22

In one patient hospitalized for COVID-19 (positive molecular testing), we did not detect any anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as in thirty-five other symptomatic patients considered as possible cases. CONCLUSIONS: Even if respiratory symptoms linked to CF are frequent and compatible with COVID-19, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected only in 3 asymptomatic patients. This reassuring study concerning the risk of COVID-19 in patients with CF illustrates the difficulty to distinguish COVID-19 symptoms from respiratory exacerbations and the need of generalized molecular testing to make a precise diagnosis.","Berardis, S; Verroken, A; Vetillart, A; Struyf, C; Gilbert, M; Gruson, D; Gohy, S",J. cyst. fibros,234,27

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the organizational and social commitments and related factors during the coronavirus pandemic of healthcare workers in northern Iran. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted in 2020 among 260 healthcare workers of Babol health centers by a stratified-random sampling method. Data were collected according to a valid and reliable questionnaire consisting of three parts: 8 questions about personal and job characteristics, 15 questions from Porter Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ), 15 questions from Carroll's social responsibility. Each question was scored on the Likert scale of organizational and social commitment questionnaires. Data were analyzed by chi-square and logistic regression. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: None of the healthcare workers belonged to the category of low organizational commitments. A portion of 27.7% of the healthcare workers had moderate organizational commitments and 72.3% had high organizational commitments. A portion of 9.2% of the healthcare workers had moderate social commitments and 90.8% had high social commitments. Chi-square showed that education (p = 0.001), job position (p = 0.001) and the area in which healthcare workers were present for service (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with organizational commitments. According to OR in the logistic regression model, healthcare workers with master's and doctoral education levels had 3.482 times more social commitments than others and the health group had 2.455 times more social commitments compared to the treatment group. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that at the time of the coronavirus outbreak, the healthcare workers in Babol had very positive and high organizational and social commitments. As the world struggles with the coronavirus pandemic, employee and organizational productivity may decline due to the fear and anxiety of healthcare workers in various organizations. It is expected that managers of health-related organizations, social, economic, and cultural organizations use the results of this study to identify factors affecting the organizational and social commitments of employees and strengthen them.","Aghalari, Zahra; Dahms, Hans-Uwe; Jafarian, Somayeh; Gholinia, Hemmat",Global Health,234,24

Limited research on socio-economic differences in mobility hampers our ability to understand whether inequalities in social distancing are occurring during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess how mobility patterns have varied across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify associations with socioeconomic factors of populations. METHODS: We used anonymized mobility data from tens of millions of devices to measure the speed and depth of social distancing at the county level in the United States between February and May 2020, the period during which social distancing was widespread in this country. Using linear mixed models, we assessed the associations between social distancing and socioeconomic variables, including the proportion of people in the population below the poverty level, the proportion of Black people, the proportion of essential workers, and the population density. RESULTS: We found that the speed, depth, and duration of social distancing in the United States are heterogeneous. We particularly show that social distancing is slower and less intense in counties with higher proportions of people below the poverty level and essential workers; in contrast, we show that social distancing is intensely adopted in counties with higher population densities and larger Black populations. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic inequalities appear to be associated with the levels of adoption of social distancing, potentially resulting in wide-ranging differences in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in communities across the United States. These inequalities are likely to amplify existing health disparities and must be addressed to ensure the success of ongoing pandemic mitigation efforts.","Garnier, Romain; Benetka, Jan R; Kraemer, John; Bansal, Shweta",J Med Internet Res,234,16

However, the risk factors for extrapulmonary organ injury are still unclear. We aim to explore the risk factors for extrapulmonary organ injury and the association between extrapulmonary organ injury and the prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We implemented a single-center, retrospective, observational study, in which a total of 349 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 25, 2020, to February 25, 2020, were enrolled. We collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data from electronic medical records. Potential risk factors for extrapulmonary organ injury of COVID-19 patients were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for survival analysis in the patients with extrapulmonary organ injury. Results: The average age of the included patients was 61.73±14.64 years. In the final logistic model, variables including aged 60 or older [odds ratio (OR) 1.826, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.060-3.142], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR 2.748, 95% CI: 1.051-7.185), lymphocytes count lower than 1.1×109/L (OR 0.478, 95% CI: 0.240-0.949), level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) greater than 7 pg/mL (OR 1.664, 95% CI: 1.005-2.751) and D-Dimer greater than 0.5 μg/mL (OR 2.190, 95% CI: 1.176-4.084) were significantly associated with the extrapulmonary organ injury. Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test showed that the probabilities of survival for patients with extrapulmonary organ injury were significantly lower than those without extrapulmonary organ injury. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that only myocardial injury (P=0.000, HR: 5.068, 95% CI: 2.728-9.417) and circulatory system injury (P=0.000, HR: 4.076, 95% CI: 2.216-7.498) were the independent factors associated with COVID-19 patients' poor prognosis. Conclusions: Older age, lymphocytopenia, high level of D-Dimer and IL-6, and the severity of lung injury were the high-risk factors of extrapulmonary organ injury in COVID-19 patients. Myocardial and circulatory system injury were the most important risk factors related to poor outcomes of COVID-19 patients.","Huang, F.; Ma, W.; Zheng, H.; Ye, Y.; Chen, H.; Su, N.; Li, X.; Wang, Y.; Jin, J.; Yu, Z.; Li, Y.; Wang, J.",Annals of Translational Medicine,234,16

METHODS: The prevalence of infectious COVID-19 cases by country was multiplied by expected monthly passenger volumes to predict the rate of arrivals. The rate of undetected infections entering the border following screening and quarantine was estimated. Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 countries were defined as those with an active COVID-19 prevalence of up to 1/105, 10/105 and 100/105, respectively. RESULTS: With 65,272 travellers per month, the number of undetected COVID-19 infections exiting quarantine is 1 every 45, 15 and 31 months for Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 countries, respectively. The overall rate of undetected active COVID-19 infections exiting quarantine is expected to increase from the current 0.40 to 0.50 per month, or an increase of one extra infection every 10 months. CONCLUSIONS: Loosening border restrictions results in a small increase in the rate of undetected COVID-19 infections exiting quarantine, which increases from the current baseline by one infection every 10 months. This information may be useful in guiding decision-making on selectively opening of borders in the COVID-19 era.","Smith, Benjamin J; Morris, Arthur J; Johnston, Ben; Child, Stephen; Thornley, Simon",N Z Med J,234,16

Although numerous data resources have been made openly available, the analytic and synthetic process that is essential in effectively navigating through the vast amount of information with heightened levels of uncertainty remains a significant bottleneck. We introduce a generic method that facilitates the data collection and sense-making process when dealing with a rapidly growing landscape of a research domain such as COVID-19 at multiple levels of granularity. The method integrates the analysis of structural and temporal patterns in scholarly publications with the delineation of thematic concentrations and the types of uncertainties that may offer additional insights into the complexity of the unknown.

Indian patients with HNSCC are mostly associated with tobacco usage and may have different genetic alterations compared with Western patients who are mostly associated with human papillomavirus infection. Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are correlated to individuals' susceptibility and progression of cancer. XRCC1 is a DNA repair enzyme. Materials and Methods: In the present prospective study, Indian population of HNSCC patients (n = 45) were screened for Arg399Gln variant of XRCC1 using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique, prospective evaluation of the patients was done after treatment, and the single-nucleotide polymorphism results were correlated to survival functions. Results: Out of 45 patients, 28 patients were Arg/Arg, 12 patients were Arg/Gln, and 5 patients were Gln/Gln. Overall survival for the entire cohort and Arg/Arg, Arg/Gln, and Gln/Gln cohort was 36.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 33-39.5), 38.6 (95% CI: 35.3-41.9), 35.8 (95% CI: 28.6-42.9), and 26.4 (95% CI: 13.7-39.1) months (P = 0.097), respectively.

The paper concludes by examining the current crisis in which a fragmented professoriate is facing market-driven working conditions, exacerbated by the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To study the impacts of 3PP entry, we build game-theoretic models in a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer and a 3PP, and derive the equilibrium in both the non-information sharing and information sharing cases. We show that the 3PP should make a reasonable commission rate which can lure the retailer to introduce the 3PP as well as maintain the 3PP's profitability. The 3PP entry allows the retailer to set a higher price without decreasing the demand. However, to seize all of the benefit of the 3PP entry, the first mover manufacturer increases the wholesale price to a large extent. As a result, the 3PP entry causes a win-lose situation for the manufacturer and the retailer. The supply chain can be better off from the 3PP entry if it can significantly decrease consumer price sensitivity or its fixed investment cost is low. Furthermore, we find that information sharing benefits the manufacturer and the 3PP but harms the retailer. While information sharing always decreases the expected profit for the supply chain without the 3PP, it may increase that for the supply chain with the 3PP. To improve the supply chain profitability, we suggest to provide incentives for retailer information sharing if the 3PP can significantly decrease consumer price sensitivity (i.e., the proportion of the 3PP users is higher, the grace period of credit consumption is lower, or the cash opportunity cost is lower).","Fan, Xiaojun; Zhao, Wenyu; Zhang, Ting; Yan, Endian",Ann Oper Res,234,9

We analyzed the published (pre)-clinical evidence. METHODS: preclinical: comparison of in vitro tests with validated host cell models to determine viral infectivity. Clinical: efficacy, proportion of users protected against virus (compared with non-users) and safety associated with trypsin/glycerol. RESULTS: preclinical data showed that exogenous trypsin enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and syncytia formation in host models, while culture passages in trypsin presence induce spike protein mutants. The manufacturer claims >98% SARS-CoV-2 deactivation, although clinically irrelevant as based on a tryptic viral digest, inserting trypsin inactivation before host cells exposure. Efficacy and safety were not adequately addressed in clinical studies or leaflets (no COVID-19 data). Protection was obtained among 9-39% of users, comparable to or lower than placebo-treated or non-users. Several potential safety risks (tissue digestion, bronchoconstriction) were identified. CONCLUSIONS: the current European MD regulations may result in insufficient exploration of (pre)clinical proof of action. Exogenous trypsin exposure even raises concerns (higher SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, mutations), whereas its clinical protective performance against respiratory viruses as published remains poor and substandard.","Huijghebaert, Suzy; Vanham, Guido; Van Winckel, Myriam; Allegaert, Karel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),234,21

Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted with COVID-19 and evaluated outcomes in those with and without COPD and/or emphysema. Patients were identified as having COPD if they had a diagnosis in the medical record and a history of airflow-obstruction on spirometry, or a history of tobacco use and prescribed long-acting bronchodilator(s). Computed tomography scans were evaluated by radiologists. Propensity matching was performed for age, body-mass index (BMI), and serologic data correlated with severity of COVID-19 disease (D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, absolute lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, and lactate dehydrogenase). Results: Of 577 patients admitted with COVID-19, 103 had a diagnosis of COPD and/or emphysema. The COPD/emphysema cohort was older (67 vs 58, p<0.0001) than the other cohort and had a lower BMI. Among unmatched cohorts those with COPD/emphysema had higher rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (35% vs 24.9%, p=0.036) and maximal respiratory support requirements, with more frequent invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 11.8%), but no significant difference in mortality. After propensity-matching there was no difference in ICU admission, maximal respiratory support requirements, or mortality. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses yielded similar results. Discussion: Our propensity-matched retrospective cohort study suggests that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that have COPD and/or emphysema may not have worse outcomes than those without these comorbid conditions.","Marron, Robert M; Zheng, Matthew; Fernandez Romero, Gustavo; Zhao, Huaqing; Patel, Raj; Leopold, Ian; Thomas, Ashanth; Standiford, Taylor; Kumaran, Maruti; Patlakh Jeffrey Stewart, Nicole; Criner, Gerard J",,234,24

A clinical risk score to predict 14-day occurrence of hypoxia, ICU admission, and death is unavailable. OBJECTIVE: Derive and validate a risk score to predict suitability for discharge from a monitored setting among an early cohort of patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Model derivation and validation in a retrospective cohort. We built a manual forward stepwise logistic regression model to identify variables associated with suitability for discharge and assigned points to each variable. Event-free patients were included after at least 14 days of follow-up. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis between March 1, 2020, and April 12, 2020, in 10 hospitals in Massachusetts, USA. MAIN MEASURES: Fourteen-day composite predicting hypoxia, ICU admission, and death. We calculated a risk score for each patient as a predictor of suitability for discharge evaluated by area under the curve. KEY RESULTS: Of 2059 patients with COVID-19, 1326 met inclusion. The 1014-patient training cohort had a mean age of 58 years, was 56% female, and 65% had at least one comorbidity. A total of 255 (25%) patients were suitable for discharge. Variables associated with suitability for discharge were age, oxygen saturation, and albumin level, yielding a risk score between 0 and 55. At a cut point of 30, the score had a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 82%. The respective c-statistic for the derivation and validation cohorts were 0.8939 (95% CI, 0.8687 to 0.9192) and 0.8685 (95% CI, 0.8095 to 0.9275). The score performed similarly for inpatients and emergency department patients. CONCLUSIONS: A 3-item risk score for patients with COVID-19 consisting of age, oxygen saturation, and an acute phase reactant (albumin) using point of care data predicts suitability for discharge and may optimize scarce resources.","Levine, David M; Lipsitz, Stuart R; Co, Zoe; Song, Wenyu; Dykes, Patricia C; Samal, Lipika",J. gen. intern. med,234,23

The study aimed to report the outcomes of planned urgent and cancer cases during the current pandemic using a multi-disciplinary prioritisation group. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of patients having urgent or cancer surgery at a NHS Trust from 1st March to 30th April 2020 who had been prioritised by a multi-disciplinary COVID Surgery group. Rates of post-operative PCR positive and suspected COVID-19 infections within 30 days, 30-day mortality and any death related to COVID-19 are reported. RESULTS: Overall 597 patients underwent surgery with a median age of 65 years (interquartile range (IQR) 54-74 years). Of these, 86.1% (514/597) had a current cancer diagnosis. During the period, 60.8% (363/597) of patients had surgery at the NHS Trust whilst 39.2% (234/597) had surgery at Independent Sector hospitals. The incidence of COVID-19 in the East Midlands was 193.7 per 100,000 population during the study period. In the 30 days following surgery, 1.3% (8/597) of patients tested positive for COVID-19 with all cases at the NHS site. Overall 30-day mortality was 0.7% (4/597). Following a PCR positive COVID-19 diagnosis, mortality was 25.0% (2/8). Including both PCR positive and suspected cases, 3.0% (18/597) developed COVID-19 infection with 1.3% at the independent site compared to 4.1% at the NHS Trust (p=0.047).

In this study, we longitudinally and quantitatively analysed antibody responses in RT-PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 convalescent adults during the first 250 days after onset of symptoms. Methods We measured antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein in 844 longitudinal samples from 151 RT-PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 convalescent adults. With a median of 5 (range 2?18) samples per individual, this allowed quantitative analysis of individual longitudinal antibody profiles. Kinetic profiles were analysed by mixed-effects modelling. Results All donors were seropositive at the first sampling moment, and only one donor seroreverted during follow-up analysis. Anti-RBD IgG and anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels declined with median half-lives of 62 and 59 days, respectively, 2?5 months after symptom onset, and several-fold variation in half-lives of individuals was observed. The rate of decline of antibody levels diminished during extended follow-up, which points towards long-term immunological memory. The magnitude of the anti-RBD IgG response correlated well with neutralisation capacity measured in a classic plaque reduction assay and in an in-house developed competitive assay.

Since de novo drug discovery is both expensive and time-consuming, drug repurposing approaches are believed to be of particular help. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is known to attach human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD). We screened 1930 FDA-approved ligands for the selection of optimal ones blocking this interaction. Virtual screening predicted top 25 ligands docking to any of the reported binding sites. After exclusion of those ligands which were unsuitable for systemic use, the remaining 69 RBD-ligand complexes were screened based on the masking capacity of the amino acid residues engaged in RBD-hACE2 interaction, excluding 47 RBD-ligand complexes. A short molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis identified 11 globally stable complexes with the lowest RMSD (root-mean-square deviation). Next, a moderately long MD analysis revealed those six RBD-ligand complexes with the lowest RMSD variation, as a measure of global stability. Finally, a long MD analysis revealed two select candidate ligands, including ritonavir and naloxegol, highly stabilizing those key residues engaged in RBD-hACE2 interaction. A similar MD analysis of a few antiviral drugs which are under clinical trials or approved for COVID-19 treatment showed them inferior to both select ligands in terms of stabilizing the RBD globally and locally at binding sites. Because of the crucial role of the S protein in virus virulence, our results highly propose ritonavir and naloxegol as the potentially helpful therapeutics against COVID-19, mandating appropriate clinical trials.

360501,360501,360501,Approach to Surgical Interventions during Coronavirus disease Pandemic in Turkey,16.668941,9.7540455,2020,"On 24 April 2021, a disastrous fire in an Iraqi hospital in April 2021 took the lives of 82 people. Since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, incidents of oxygen-related hospital fires in various countries around the world have caused over 200 deaths, the majority of whom were patients extremely ill with the novel Coronavirus. Fires involving medical oxygen are not a new phenomenon but are more common in the operating theatre where oxygen is routinely administered. In these settings, strict safety protocols are normally enforced and surgical staff are well trained in dealing with oxygen hazards. It appears that some hospitals may not have been fully prepared for the elevated risk of oxygen-related fire in intensive care units due to the high demand for oxygen therapy in severely ill Covid-19 patients. Indeed, gas producers and public health authorities were also slow to recognize and alert hospitals to the potential dangers. Oxygen is essential to life and generally makes up about 21% of the gases in the air we breathe. Pure oxygen reacts with common materials such as oil and grease to cause fires, and even explosions, when released at high pressures. A leaking valve or hose, and openings at interfaces of masks and tubes, when in a confined space or where air circulation is low, can quickly increase the oxygen concentration to a dangerous level. Even a small increase in the oxygen level in the air to 24% can create a fire hazard. In an oxygen-enriched environment, materials become easier to ignite and fires will burn hotter and more fiercely than in normal air. There is also a potentially heightened risk of using ethanol-based and organic solvents as cleaning agents in an oxygen rich atmospheres. This paper will provide an overview of oxygen accident scenarios that may be relevant for hospital intensive care units, with particular reference to recent events and similar accidents that have occurred in the past. The paper will recommend that hospitals recognize their chemical risks as part of their risk governance responsibility and assign chemical risk management a prominent role in their overall management. Investigation of dangerous events to extract causes and lessons learned should be utilized to highlight opportunities for prevention as well as emergency response. The industrial gas industry also needs to actively support hospitals in adoption of more rigorous risk management approaches, building on lessons learned in chemical process safety for managing flammable and explosive atmospheres.","Wood, Maureen Heraty; Hailwood, Mark; Koutelos, Konstantinos",,234,33

While in theory complementary, both PCR and serologic tests have practical shortcomings. A retrospective study was performed in order to further define these limitations in a clinical context and to determine how to best utilize these tests in a coherent fashion. A total of 3,075 patients underwent both PCR and serology tests at UCLA in the study period. Among these, 2731 (89%) had no positive tests at all, 73 (2%) had a positive PCR test and only negative serology tests, 144 (5%) had a positive serology test and only negative PCR tests, and 127 (4%) had positive PCR and serology tests. Approximately half of the patients with discordant results (i.e. PCR positive, serology negative or vice versa) had mistimed tests in reference to the course of their disease. PCR positive patients who were asymptomatic or pregnant were less likely to generate a detectable humoral immune response to SARS-Cov2. On a quantitative level, the log number of days between symptom onset and PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were positively correlated. However, there was no apparent relationship between PCR Ct and serologic AU/ml results.","Murad, Douglas; Chandrasekaran, Sukantha; Pillai, Ajaya; Garner, Omai B; Denny, Christopher T",J. clin. microbiol,234,16

Changes in daily living routines, reduction in physical activities, and changes in environmental indicators were suggested to positively impact pediatric asthma indicators in western cultures. Little is known about such impact in developing countries. This study investigating the potential impact of COVID-19 NPI measures on pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions in Northern Jordan. METHODS: Aggregate data from a pediatric hospital, Princess Rahma Pediatric Teaching Hospital, and King Abdulla University Teaching Hospital were utilized between 2018 and 2020. Number of pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions were calculated by week and compared by year, lockdown status, and weeks for lockdown (weeks 13 to 19). Stringency index was correlated with number of weekly pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions for 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,207 pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions were reported; 40.3%, 35.2%, and 24.5% in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The number of weekly admissions ranged between 1 and 13 pediatric asthma cases (mean (SD) = 7.6 (2.7)). In 2018 and 2019, respectively, the mean weekly admissions was 9.2 (1.9) and 8.0 (2.0) pediatric asthma cases, while in 2020 the mean was 5.6 (2.7) cases. Significant differences in mean weekly pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions were detected by year, with mean weekly admissions for 2020 being significantly lower than that for 2018 and 2019. During the lockdown (March 22nd to May 1st 2020), mean weekly admissions (2.6 (1.4)) was significantly lower than that before the lockdown (8.6 (2.0)) and after the lockdown (5.2 (2.0)). For the lockdown weeks only, the mean admissions for year 2020 was significantly lower than that for years 2019 and 2018. Stringency index negatively correlated with number of weekly admissions. CONCLUSION: NPI measures in Jordan seems to have positively impacted pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions. Further studies are needed to draw public health policies and fine-tune environmental and community policies.","Alsulaiman, Jomana W; Kheirallah, Khalid A; Ajlony, Mohammed-Jafar; Al-Tamimi, Taha; Khasawneh, Rawand A; Al-Natour, Lara",Int J Clin Pract,234,16

Making people adhere to restrictive measures is difficult. Even so, the Norwegian government largely succeeded in getting the population to comply and became the first European country to announce control over the situation. In this study, we ask what narratives the government put forth in their communication of the measures and how these measures were handled and made sense of in personal narratives at the general population level. We base our discussion on near daily government press conferences in March-April, as well as qualitative interviews with 16 individuals. Using a cultural narrative perspective on the data, we tie these meta-narratives and personal narratives together. Persuading people to comply with prevention and control measures in a crisis is crucial, and our study shows the importance of the selection of meta-narratives. There will be cultural differences in governance and receptiveness of the population across different settings, and our study suggests that governments will have to balance where on different continua they place their COVID-19 narratives, balancing freedom up against restrictions, hope against fear, and individualism against solidarity.","Moss, Sigrun Marie; Sandbakken, Ella Marie",Political psychology,234,20

Therapy is based on established recommendations issued for patients with acute lung injury (ARDS). Lung protective ventilation, prone position, restrictive fluid management and an adequate management of organ failures are the mainstays of therapy. In case of fulminant lung failure, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be used as a rescue in experienced centres.

Identification of patients at risk for clinical deterioration upon presentation would aid in triaging, prognostication, and allocation of resources and experimental treatments. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can we develop and validate a web-based risk prediction model for identification of patients who may develop severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or death? METHODS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed 415 patients admitted to a large urban academic medical center and community hospitals. Covariates included demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. The independent association of predictors with severe COVID-19 was determined using multivariable logistic regression. A derivation cohort (n=311, 75%) was used to develop the prediction models. The models were tested by a validation cohort (n=104, 25%). RESULTS: The median age was 66 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 54-77) and the majority were male (55%) and non-White (65.8%). The 14-day severe COVID-19 rate was 39.3%; 31.7% required ICU, 24.6% mechanical ventilation, and 21.2% died. Machine learning algorithms and clinical judgment were used to improve model performance and clinical utility, resulting in the selection of eight predictors: age, sex, dyspnea, diabetes mellitus, troponin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase. The discriminative ability was excellent for both the severe COVID-19 (training area under the curve [AUC]=0.82, validation AUC=0.82) and mortality (training AUC= 0.85, validation AUC=0.81) models. These models were incorporated into a mobile-friendly website. INTERPRETATION: This web-based risk prediction model can be used at the bedside for prediction of severe COVID-19 using data mostly available at the time of presentation.","Woo, Sang H; Rios-Diaz, Arturo J; Kubey, Alan A; Cheney-Peters, Dianna R; Ackermann, Lily L; Chalikonda, Divya M; Venkataraman, Chantel M; Riley, Joshua M; Baram, Michael",Am. j. med. sci,234,16

An improved 3D version of the U-Net model based on the dice loss function is utilized to predict the binding sites accurately. The performance of the proposed model on the independent test datasets and SARS-COV-2 shows the segmentation model could predict the binding sites with a more accurate shape than the recently published deep learning model, i.e. DeepSite.

Due to the current global emergency and the length of time required to develop specific antiviral agent(s) and a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the world health organization (WHO) adopted the strategy of repurposing existing medications to treat COVID-19. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) were previously approved by the US food and drug administration (FDA) for anemia treatment and studies have also demonstrated its antiviral activity in vitro. Therefore, we performed a docking study to explore the interaction of IONPs (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) with the spike protein receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 that is required for virus attachment to the host cell receptors. A similar docking analysis was also performed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) glycoproteins E1 and E2. These studies revealed that both Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 interacted efficiently with the SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD and to HCV glycoproteins, E1 and E2. Fe3O4 formed a more stable complex with S1-RBD whereas Fe2O3 favored HCV E1 and E2. These interactions of IONPs are expected to be associated with viral proteins conformational changes and hence, viral inactivation. Therefore, we recommend FDA-approved-IONPs to proceed for COVID-19 treatment clinical trials.","Abo-Zeid, Yasmin; Ismail, Nasser S M; McLean, Gary R; Hamdy, Nadia M",Eur J Pharm Sci,234,18

Accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular assays is critical for patient management and the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is an increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 viruses with mutations at the primer or probe binding sites, and these mutations may affect the sensitivity of currently available real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays targeting the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), and open reading frame 1a or 1b genes. Using sequence-independent single-primer amplification and nanopore whole-genome sequencing, we have found that the nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) gene, located at the 5' end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, was highly expressed in the nasopharyngeal or saliva specimens of 9 COVID-19 patients of different clinical severity. Based on this finding, we have developed a novel nsp1 real-time RT-PCR assay. The primers and probes are highly specific for SARS-CoV-2. Validation with 101 clinical specimens showed that our nsp1 RT-PCR assay has a sensitivity of 93.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 86.2%-97.2%), which was similar to those of N and E gene RT-PCR assays. The diagnostic specificity was 100% (95% CI: 92.9%-100%).

A critical step of the infection cycle is the binding of the virus spike S protein to the cellular ACE-2 receptor. This interaction involves a receptor binding domain (RBD) located at the center of the S trimer, whereas the lateral N-terminal domain (NTD) displays a flat ganglioside binding site that enables the virus to bind to lipid rafts of the plasma membrane, where the ACE-2 receptor resides. S protein binding to lipid rafts can be blocked by hydroxychloroquine, which binds to gangliosides, and by azithromycin, which binds to the NTD. Based on these data, we identified the NTD of SARS-CoV-2 as a promising target for both therapeutic and vaccine strategies, a notion later supported by the discovery, in convalescent Covid-19 patients, of a neutralizing antibody (4A8) that selectively binds to the NTD. The 4A8 epitope overlaps the ganglioside binding domain, denying any access of the virus to lipid rafts when the antibody is bound to the S protein. Thus, our data explain why antibody binding to the tip of the NTD results in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. The high level of conservation of the ganglioside binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 (100% identity in 584 of 600 isolates analyzed worldwide) offers unique opportunities for innovative vaccine/therapeutic strategies.","Fantini, Jacques; Chahinian, Henri; Yahi, Nouara",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,234,20

DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study used a gradient boosting algorithm to evaluate risk of COVID-19 infection (ie, presence of at least 1 confirmed COVID-19 resident) in NHs. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The model was trained on outcomes from 1146 NHs in Massachusetts, Georgia, and New Jersey, reporting COVID-19 case data on April 20, 2020. Risk indices generated from the model using data from May 4 were prospectively validated against outcomes reported on May 11 from 1021 NHs in California. METHODS: Model features, pertaining to facility and community characteristics, were obtained from a self-constructed dataset based on multiple public and private sources. The model was assessed via out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity in the training (via 10-fold cross-validation) and validation datasets. RESULTS: The mean AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the model over 10-fold cross-validation were 0.729 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.690â0.767], 0.670 (95% CI 0.477â0.862), and 0.611 (95% CI 0.412â0.809), respectively. Prospective out-of-sample validation yielded similar performance measures (AUC 0.721; sensitivity 0.622; specificity 0.713). The strongest predictors of COVID-19 infection were identified as the NH's county's infection rate and the number of separate units in the NH; other predictors included the county's population density, historical Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services cited health deficiencies, and the NH's resident density (in persons per 1000 square feet). In addition, the NH's historical percentage of non-Hispanic white residents was identified as a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A machine-learning model can help quantify and predict NH infection risk. The identified risk factors support the early identification and management of presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (eg, staff) entering the NH from the surrounding community and the development of financially sustainable staff testing initiatives in preventing COVID-19 infection.","Sun, Christopher L F; Zuccarelli, Eugenio; Zerhouni, El Ghali A; Lee, Jason; Muller, James; Scott, Karen M; Lujan, Alida M; Levi, Retsef",J.

We created an indicator-the COVID-19 bereavement multiplier-that estimates the average number of individuals who will experience the death of a close relative (defined as a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child) for each COVID-19 death. Using demographic microsimulation-based estimates of kinship networks in the United States, the clear age gradient in COVID-19 mortality seen across contexts, and several hypothetical infection prevalence scenarios, we estimate COVID-19 bereavement multipliers for White and Black individuals in the United States. Our analysis shows that for every COVID-19 death, approximately nine surviving Americans will lose a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child. These estimates imply, for example, that if 190,000 Americans die from COVID-19, as some models project, then â¼1.7 million will experience the death of a close relative. We demonstrate that our estimates of the bereavement multiplier are stable across epidemiological realities, including infection scenarios, total number of deaths, and the distribution of deaths, which means researchers can estimate the bereavement burden over the course of the epidemic in lockstep with rising death tolls. In addition, we provide estimates of bereavement multipliers by age group, types of kin loss, and race to illuminate prospective disparities. The bereavement multiplier is a useful indicator for tracking COVID-19's multiplicative impact as it reverberates across American families and can be tailored to other causes of death.","Verdery, Ashton M; Smith-Greenaway, Emily; Margolis, Rachel; Daw, Jonathan",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,234,24

Targeting host factor(s) which are critically involved in immune signaling pathways for modulation of host immunity offers to treat a broad range of infectious diseases. Upon pathogen-associated ligands binding to the Toll-like/ IL-1R family, and other cellular receptors, followed by recruitment of intracellular signaling adaptor proteins, primarily MyD88, trigger the innate immune responses. But activation of host innate immunity strongly depends on the correct function of MyD88 which is tightly regulated. Dysregulation of MyD88 may cause an imbalance that culminates to a wide range of inflammation-associated syndromes and diseases. Furthermore, recent reports also describe that MyD88 upregulation with many viral infections is linked to decreased antiviral type I IFN response, and MyD88-deficient mice showed an increase in survivability. These reports suggest that MyD88 is also negatively involved via MyD88-independent pathways of immune signaling for antiviral type I IFN response. Because of its expanding role in controlling host immune signaling pathways, MyD88 has been recognized as a potential drug target in a broader drug discovery paradigm. Targeting BB-loop of MyD88, small molecule inhibitors were designed by structure-based approach which by blocking TIR-TIR domain homo-dimerization have shown promising therapeutic efficacy in attenuating MyD88-mediated inflammatory impact, and increased antiviral type I IFN response in experimental mouse model of diseases. In this review, we highlight the reports on MyD88-linked immune response and MyD88-targeted therapeutic approach with underlying mechanisms for controlling inflammation and antiviral type I IFN response. HIGHLIGHTS: â¢ Host innate immunity is activated upon PAMPs binding to PRRs followed by immune signaling through TIR domain-containing adaptor proteins mainly MyD88. â¢ Structure-based approach led to develop small-molecule inhibitors which block TIR domain homodimerization of MyD88 and showed therapeutic efficacy in limiting severe inflammation-associated impact in mice. â¢ Therapeutic intervention of MyD88 also showed an increase in antiviral effect with strong type I IFN signaling linked to increased phosphorylation of IRFs via MyD88-independent pathway. â¢ MyD88 inhibitors might be potentially useful as a small-molecule therapeutics for modulation of host immunity against inflammatory diseases and antiviral therapy. â¢ However, prior clinical use of more in-depth efforts should be focused for suitability of the approach in deploying to complex diseases including COPD and COVID-19 in limiting inflammation-associated syndrome to infection.","Saikh, Kamal U",Immunol Res,234,16

METHODS: A cardiac phantom with a simulated PD was imaged under different R using different gamma cameras and reconstruction algorithms. The residual activity from precedent stress administration was simulated by modeling effective half-times in each compartment of the phantom and assuming a delay of 3 hours between the stress and rest studies. The net contrast (NC) of the PD in the rest study was assessed for different R, PD positions and scanner/software combinations. The optimal R will be the one that minimize the NC in the rest images RESULTS: The activity concentration ratio R, the position of the PD and the scanner/software combinations were all main effects with a statistically significant impact on the NC, in decreasing order of relevance. The NC diminished significantly only for R values up to 2. No further improvement was observed for NC for R values above 2 and up to 3. NC was significantly higher in anteroseptal than in posterolateral positions of the PD and higher for solid-state cameras. CONCLUSIONS: A rest-stress activity concentration ratio R of 2 in single-day stress-first myocardial perfusion imaging is enough to achieve the maximum net contrast in the PD.

RECENT FINDINGS: Studies of central nervous system (CNS) tissue in brain model systems and from adults with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection have begun to uncover potential mechanisms for neurological damage during COVID-19. These studies suggest that direct viral invasion of the CNS occurs in a subset of cases but does not frequently cause overt viral meningoencephalitis. Vascular abnormalities including microvascular thrombi and endothelial activation, as well as parainfectious processes, including CNS specific immune responses, may contribute to neurological symptoms during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. SUMMARY: Neuroimmune perturbations and vascular inflammation observed in people with COVID-19 may warrant investigation of immune-modulating interventions to ameliorate neurological complications associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The purpose of this article is to evaluate whether digital mammography (DM) is associated with persistent increased detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or has altered the upgrade rate of DCIS to invasive cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS. An institutional review board-approved retrospective search identified DCIS diagnosed in women with mammographic calcifications between 2001 and 2014. Ipsilateral cancer within 2 years, masses, papillary DCIS, and patients with outside imaging were excluded, yielding 484 cases. Medical records were reviewed for mammographic calcifications, technique, and pathologic diagnosis. Mammograms were interpreted by radiologists certified by the Mammography Quality Standards Act. The institution transitioned from film-screen mammography (FSM) to exclusive DM by 2010. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square test. RESULTS. Of 484 DCIS cases, 158 (33%) were detected by FSM and 326 (67%) were detected by DM. The detection rate was higher with DM than FSM (1.4 and 0.7 per 1000, respectively; p < .001). The detection rate of high-grade DCIS doubled with DM compared with FSM (0.8 and 0.4 per 1000, respectively; p < .001). The prevalent peak of DM-detected DCIS was 2.7 per 1000 in 2008. Incident DM detection remained double FSM (1.4 vs 0.7 per 1000). Similar proportions of high-grade versus low- to intermediate-grade DCIS were detected with both modalities. There was no significant difference in the upgrade rate of DCIS to invasive cancer between DM (10%; 34/326) and FSM (10%; 15/158) (p = .74). High-grade DCIS led to 71% (35/49) of the upgrades to invasive cancer. CONCLUSION. DM was associated with a significant doubling in DCIS and high-grade DCIS detection, which persisted after prevalent peak. The majority of upgrades to invasive cancer arose from high-grade DCIS. DM was not associated with decreased upgrade to invasive cancer.","Neal, Colleen H; Joe, Annette I; Patterson, Stephanie K; Pujara, Akshat C; Helvie, Mark A",AJR Am J Roentgenol,234,10

A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among HCPs via an online questionnaire. Out of 440 responses, a total of 385 complete responses were analyzed. The responders' mean age was 37.5±9.4 years, 215 (55.8%) of the participants were males. They included 77 (20%) confirmed COVID-19 cases; most of them had mild (58.6%) or moderate symptoms (30%), and (9.1%) were asymptomatic. Almost all sustained infection while on duty (97.4%). The sources of infection were either infected patients (39%), colleagues (22.1%), household contacts (5.2%) or uncertain (33.8%). The sources were symptomatic in only 62.3% of cases. Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic sources accounted for 37.7% of the cases. Exposure occurred during healthcare provision in 66.3% of the cases.

Here, we present a mathematical Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Granada, Spain, taking into account the uncertainty of the phenomenon. In the model, the patients moving throughout the hospital’s departments (intra-hospitalary circuit) are considered in order to help to optimize the use of a hospital’s resources in the future. Two main seasons, September–April (autumn-winter) and May–August (summer), where the hospital pressure is significantly different, have been included. The model is calibrated and validated with data obtained from the hospitals in Granada. Possible future scenarios have been simulated. The model is able to capture the history of the pandemic in Granada. It provides predictions about the intra-hospitalary COVID-19 circuit over time and shows that the number of infected is expected to decline continuously from May without an increase next autumn–winter if population measures continue to be satisfied. The model strongly suggests that the number of infected cases will reduce rapidly with aggressive vaccination policies.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act by regulating target genes and are involved in tumourigenesis. However, the role of lncRNAs in EBV-associated cancers is rarely reported. Understanding the role and mechanism of lncRNAs in EBV-associated cancers may contribute to diagnosis, prognosis and clinical therapy in the future. EBV encodes not only miRNAs, but also BART lncRNAs during latency and the BHLF1 lncRNA during both the latent and lytic phases. These lncRNAs can be targeted regulate inflammation, invasion, and migration and thus tumourigenesis. The products of EBV also directly and indirectly regulate host lncRNAs, including LINC00312, NORAD CYTOR, SHNG8, SHNG5, MINCR, lncRNA-BC200, LINC00672, MALATI1, LINC00982, LINC02067, IGFBP7-AS1, LOC100505716, LOC100128494, NAG7 and RP4-794H19.1, to facilitate tumourigenesis using different mechanisms. Additionally, lncRNAs have been previously validated to interact with microRNAs (miRNAs), and lncRNAs and miRNAs mutually suppress each other. The EBV-miR-BART6-3p/LOC553103/STMN1 axis inhibits EBV-associated tumour cell proliferation. Additionally, H. pylori-EBV co-infection promotes inflammatory lesions and results in EMT. HPV-EBV co-infection inhibits the transition from latency to lytic replication. KSHV-EBV co-infection aggravates tumourigenesis in huNSG mice. COVID-19-EBV co-infection may activate the immune system to destroy a tumour, although this situation is rare and the mechanism requires further confirmation. Hopefully, this information will shed some light on tumour therapy strategies tumourigenesis. Additionally, this strategy benefits for infected patients by preventing latency to lytic replication. Understanding the role and expression of lnRNAs in these two phases of EBV is critical to control the transition from latency to the lytic replication phase.

Data were drawn from a population-level study with the Middle Years Development Instrument (MDI) with grade 7 students in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The research was implemented in public school districts between 2014 and 2018. We found that adolescents who participated in extracurricular activities (e.g., sports, arts programs, community programs) were significantly less likely to engage in recreational screen-based activities (e.g., watching programs, browsing the internet, playing computer games) for 2 or more hours after school. Findings from Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling analyses showed that extracurricular participation was associated with higher levels of satisfaction with life and optimism, and lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. In contrast, longer screen time (&#8805;2â¯h/day) was associated with lower levels of satisfaction with life and optimism, and higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms; shorter screen time (<2â¯h/day) was associated with favorable mental health and wellbeing. For screen time, the effect was moderated by gender; the association between longer screen time and poorer mental health and wellbeing was significantly more pronounced for girls than boys. For both boys and girls, mental health and wellbeing were most favorable if they participated in extracurricular activities and reported less than 2â¯h of recreational screen time per day.","Oberle, Eva; Ji, Xuejun Ryan; Kerai, Salima; Guhn, Martin; Schonert-Reichl, Kimberly A; Gadermann, Anne M",Prev Med,234,1

Since then, this epidemic has spread worldwide; in Europe, Italy has been involved. Effective preventive and therapeutic strategies are absolutely required to block this serious public health concern. Unfortunately, few studies about SARS-CoV-2 concerning its immunopathogenesis and treatment are available. On the basis of the assumption that the SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to SARS-CoV (about 82 % of genome homology) and that its characteristics, like the modality of transmission or the type of the immune response it may stimulate, are still poorly known, a literature search was performed to identify the reports assessing these elements in patients with SARS-CoV-induced infection. Therefore, we have analysed: (1) the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV; (2) the clinical signs and symptoms and pathogenic mechanisms observed during the development of acute respiratory syndrome and the cytokine release syndrome; (3) the modification of the cell microRNome and of the immune response in patients with SARS infection; and (4) the possible role of some fat-soluble compounds (such as vitamins A, D and E) in modulating directly or indirectly the replication ability of SARS-CoV-2 and host immune response.","Fiorino, Sirio; Zippi, Maddalena; Gallo, Claudio; Sifo, Debora; Sabbatani, Sergio; Manfredi, Roberto; Rasciti, Edoardo; Rasciti, Leonardo; Giampieri, Enrico; Corazza, Ivan; Leandri, Paolo; de Biase, Dario",Br J Nutr,234,21

Using data collected from 3,031 urban residents during the COVID-19 lockdown of Wuhan, China’s earliest epicenter, this study investigates the relationship between neighborhoods’ social infrastructure and residents’ mental distress. Results of structural equation modeling estimation reveal that services provided by urban residents’ committees (cheng shi ju wei hui) and volunteer groups significantly decrease the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on residents’ mental health in a Chinese context, and social cohesion is one of the mechanisms underpinning this influence. Residents’ committees and volunteer groups are found to increase their support when neighborhoods are facing an escalated level of COVID-19 risk. The residents who receive more support from their neighborhood organizations perceive a higher level of social cohesion and experience less mental distress. The findings suggest that mobilizing neighborhoods’ organizational resources and fostering social cohesion are crucial strategies to minimizing residents’ mental distress during COVID-19 pandemic.","Miao, Jia; Zeng, Donglin; Shi, Zhilei",Chin.

MGAT1 is the GlcNAc-transferase that initiates complex and hybrid N-glycan synthesis. We show here that Drosophila MGAT1 was also inhibited by MGAT4D-L in S2 cells. In mammalian cells, expression of MGAT4D-L causes the substrate of MGAT1 (Man5GlcNAc2Asn) to accumulate on glycoproteins, a change that is detected by the lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA). Using GNA binding as an assay for the inhibition of MGAT1 in MGAT4D-L transfectants, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to determine requirements for MGAT1 inhibition. Deletion of 25 aa from the C-terminus inactivated MGAT4D-L, but deletion of 20 aa did not. Conversion of the five key amino acids (PSLFQ) to Ala, or deletion of PSLFQ in the context of full length MGAT4D-L, also inactivated MGAT1 inhibitory activity. Nevertheless, mutant, inactive MGAT4D-L interacted with MGAT1 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The PSLFQ sequence also occurs in MGAT4A and MGAT4B GlcNAc-transferases. However, neither inhibited MGAT1 in transfected CHO cells. MGAT4D-L inhibitory activity could be partially transferred by attaching PSLFQ or the 25 aa C-terminus of MGAT4D-L to the C-terminus of MGAT1. Mutation of each aa in PSLFQ to Ala identified both Leu and Phe as independently essential for MGAT4D-L activity. Thus, replacement of either Leu395 or Phe396 with Ala led to inactivation of MGAT4D-L inhibitory activity. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of inhibition of MGAT1 by MGAT4D-L, and for the development of small molecule inhibitors of MGAT1.","Akintayo, Ayodele; Mayoral, Joshua; Asada, Masahiro; Tang, Jian; Sundaram, Subha; Stanley, Pamela",J. biol. chem,234,33

These concerns were based on the experience of blood centres in previous pandemics where shortage of blood components was reported. The present study had tried to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on blood collection and demand as well as the impact of disaster planning in maintaining an adequate inventory. METHODS: Data related to blood supply and demand were collected retrospectively using blood bank management software for pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 time period and compared. Strategies adopted and effects of changes in existing disaster plans to maintain an adequate inventory were studied. RESULTS: A drastic fall in the red cell inventory was observed as compared to pre-COVID-19 time period was observed due to disproportionate decrease in blood collection (1/6 to 1/9 of the previous collection) and demand (1/2 of the previous demand). The buffer stock fell gradually over a period of three weeks with cancellation of planned blood donation drives. A buffer stock equivalent to 2-week inventory led to adequate inventory in the initial lockdown periods. Similar fall was observed in the platelet inventory with reduction in the blood collection but almost a proportionate reduction in the platelet demand led to adequate inventory. No increase in wastage was observed for both red cells and platelets during this period. DISCUSSION: A buffer stock of blood and blood components, strict adherence to the transfusion triggers, good coordination with the clinical staff and a prospective review of blood transfusion requests to ensure rational blood transfusion were some of the steps which helped us to successfully maintain transfusion requirements in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Use of first-in-first-out policy prevented any wastage due to outdating of blood.","Pandey, Hem Chandra; Coshic, Poonam; C S, Chippy; Arcot, Priyadarsini Jayachandran; Kumar, Karan",Vox Sang,234,1

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) enables sensitive detection of specific sequences of genes that encode the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins of the virus. Although RT-PCR tests have been widely used and many alternative assays have been developed, the current testing capacity and availability cannot meet the unprecedented global demands for rapid, reliable, and widely accessible molecular diagnosis. Challenges remain throughout the entire analytical process, from the collection and treatment of specimens to the amplification and detection of viral RNA and the validation of clinical sensitivity and specificity. We highlight the main issues surrounding molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, including false negatives from the detection of viral RNA, temporal variations of viral loads, selection and treatment of specimens, and limiting factors in detecting viral proteins. We discuss critical research needs, such as improvements in RT-PCR, development of alternative nucleic acid amplification techniques, incorporating CRISPR technology for point-of-care (POC) applications, validation of POC tests, and sequencing of viral RNA and its mutations. Improved assays are also needed for environmental surveillance or wastewater-based epidemiology, which gauges infection on the community level through analyses of viral components in the community's wastewater. Public health surveillance benefits from large-scale analyses of antibodies in serum, although the current serological tests do not quantify neutralizing antibodies. Further advances in analytical technology and research through multidisciplinary collaboration will contribute to the development of mitigation strategies, therapeutics, and vaccines.

The article discusses these civic innovation practices and their broader social implications by relating them to critical making theory. Methodologically, it is based on a digital ethnography approach, focusing on hacker and maker communities in the UK. Communities' DIY initiatives display characteristics of critical making and 'craftivism', as they assessed and counteracted politicised healthcare supply shortages. It is argued that their manufacturing activities during the COVID pandemic relate to UK austerity politics' effects on healthcare and government failure to ensure medical crisis supplies. Facilitated by open source design, communities' innovation enabled healthcare emergency equipment. At the same time, their DIY manufacturing raises practical as well as ethical issues concerning, among other things, efficacy and safety of use.","Richterich, Annika",Health Sociol Rev,234,24

In order to keep Covid-19, which has a very high propagation rate, under control, it is necessary to develop faster, low-cost and highly accurate methods, rather than costly Polymerase Chain Reaction test that can yield results in a few hours. In this study, a deep learning-based approach that can detect Covid-19 quickly and with high accuracy on X-ray images, which are common in every hospital and can be obtained at low cost, is proposed. Deep features are extracted from X-Ray images in RGB, CIE Lab and RGB CIE color spaces using DenseNet 121 and EfficientNet B0 pre-trained deep learning architectures and then obtained features are fed into a two-stage classifier approach. Each of the classifiers in the proposed approach performs binary classification. In the first stage, healthy and infected samples are separated, and in the second stage, infected samples are detected as Covid-19 or pneumonia. In the experiments, Bi-LSTM network and well-known ensemble approaches such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting were used as the classifier model and it was seen that the Bi-LSTM network had a superior performance than other classifiers with 92.489% accuracy.","Uçar, Emine; Atila, Ümit; Uçar, Murat; Akyol, Kemal",Biomed Signal Process Control,234,20

We discuss the role of hydrodynamic interactions for three different systems: (i) the deformation and orientation of sedimenting semiflexible polymers, (ii) the propulsion and force-rectification with a nano-machine realized by a rotating elastic rod, and (iii) the deformation of a brush made of grafted semiflexible polymers in shear flow. In all these examples deformable polymers are subject to various hydrodynamic flows and hydrodynamic interactions. Perfect stiff nano-cylinders are known to show no orientational effects as they sediment through a viscous fluid, but it is the coupling between elasticity and hydrodynamic torques that leads to an orientation perpendicular to the direction of sedimentation. Likewise, a rotating stiff rod does not lead to a net propulsion in the Stokes limit, but if bending is allowed an effective thrust develops whose strength and direction is independent of the sense of rotation and thus acts as a rectification device. Lastly, surface-anchored polymers are deformed by shear flows, which modifies the effective hydrodynamic boundary condition in a non-linear fashion. All these results are obtained with hydrodynamic Brownian dynamics simulation techniques, as appropriate for dilute systems. Scaling analyses are presented when possible. The common theme is the interaction between elasticity of soft matter and hydrodynamics, which can lead to qualitatively new effects.","Manghi, Manoel; Schlagberger, Xaver; Kim, Yong-Woon; Netz, Roland R",Soft Matter,234,24

Since time-sensitive thrombolysis is essential for reducing morbidity and mortality in acute stroke, any delays due to the pandemic can have serious consequences. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records for patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke at a comprehensive stroke center in March–April 2020 (the early months of COVID-19) and compared to the same time period in 2019. Stroke metrics such as incidence, time to arrival, and immediate outcomes were assessed. Results: There were 48 acute ischemic strokes (of which 7 were transfers) in March–April 2020 compared to 64 (of which 12 were transfers) in 2019. The average last known well to arrival time (±SD) for stroke codes was 1,041 (±1682.1) min in 2020 and 554 (±604.9) min in 2019. Of the patients presenting directly to the ED with a known last known well time, 27.8% (10/36) presented in the first 4.5 h in 2020, in contrast to 40.5% (15/37) in 2019. Patients who died comprised 10.4% of the stroke cohort in 2020 (5/48) compared to 6.3% in 2019 (4/64). Conclusions: During the first 2 months of COVID-19, there were fewer overall stroke cases who presented to our hospital, and of these cases, there was delayed presentation in comparison to the same time period in 2019. Recognizing how stroke presentation may be affected by COVID-19 would allow for optimization of established stroke triage algorithms in order to ensure safe and timely delivery of stroke care during a pandemic.","Nagamine, Masaki; Chow, Daniel S.; Chang, Peter D.; Boden-Albala, Bernadette; Yu, Wengui; Soun, Jennifer E.",Front.

Reporting radiographers provide a cost-effective and safe solution for managing CXR backlogs, but not all Trusts support this service development. This study aimed to establish the service enablers and challenges associated with training and employing radiographers to report CXR images in acute hospital sites in England, UK. METHODS: Approval for this electronic survey was granted in 84 of 146 (58%) Trusts approached. The survey was open for 10 weeks during August to October 2020, comprising of qualitative and quantitative questions. Data was exported in to an Excel spreadsheet where manual thematic analysis was performed. Descriptive statistics were also generated. RESULTS: Sample size was 75 (89% response rate). Thirty-three departments (44%) had at least one trainee. Most departments (n = 53, 71%) employ at least one CXR reporting radiographer. A total of 121/160 (76%) radiographers report CXRs. Number of reporting sessions shows progression. Factors enabling training and employment arise from service improvements, financial pressures, and developing the workforce. The main challenges relate to staffing issues with a number of associated sub-themes. A small faction indicated lack of radiographer interest to report CXRs due to litigation worries; possibly uncovering a new and emerging issue. CONCLUSION: Enablers and challenges associated with radiographers reporting CXRs are similar to previous studies. The growth of CXR reporting radiographers and reporting sessions indicates a continuing reliance on radiographers to contributing to managing CXR backlogs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is recommended that potential trainees are explicitly informed of the legal protection that will be provided, to prevent accountability concerns impacting on the continuing progression in this area of advanced practice.","Stevens, B J; Skermer, L; Davies, J","Radiography (Lond.

The anti-tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) demonstrates non-specific protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion. RESULTS: Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: History of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm if BCG vaccination can induced a protective effect against SARS-CoV2 infection.

In these models, the effect of climate and community behavior change on the reproductive number is modeled. A baseline scenario is also defined as letting the epidemic grow naturally, with no prevention/control interventions. Different levels of intervention are also defined based on the extent of population isolation. Outcomes of each scenario on the number of infected cases are computed. Modeling results shows that if effective isolation occurs in 10% of the population, 307,000 individuals will be infected with COVID-19 in Iran by May 20, 2020. For an isolation rate of 25%, started since March 10, 2020, cumulative number of deaths will be 13,450 individuals by May 20, 2020. If preventive efforts can reach a 32% effective isolation rate, a considerable decrease in the number of new cases would be expected during April and May, and the total number of deaths would decrease to 8,630. If the isolation rate increases to 40%, the total number of infected individuals is expected to be 6,030 individuals. It should be acknowledged that this model predicts the number of deaths of all COVID-19 cases, including those who will not be confirmed as COVID-19, because of non-testing or death prior to COVID-19 identification.

The stress and anxiety levels of respondents were also investigated. The survey obtained 1053 respondents. Additionally, environmental noise levels were measured over 24-h at two locations and compared with results before the pandemic. The results clearly exhibit that environmental noise levels and annoyance due to the noise levels dropped significantly. The annoyance drop was larger in previously noisier environments than previously tranquil locations. Noise annoyance due to neighbor noise did not change significantly; however, noise annoyance due to one's own dwelling increased. The results also confirmed an overall increase in dwelling satisfactions indicating a correlation between dwelling satisfaction and lower environmental noise levels. Although the results confirmed that noise annoyance was positively correlated with stress and anxiety levels, the change of annoyance between before and during lockdown was shown to be independent from the stress and anxiety level.","Sentop Dümen, Ayça; Saher, Konca",J Acoust Soc Am,234,24

Such events are typically seen as exogenous to the transition process, an assumption which is investigated in this paper. Using a qualitative system dynamics modelling approach we conceptualize transition pathways as sets of interacting sequences of events. This enables the analysis of event sequences that constitute the evolving pandemic as impacting on those pathways. We apply this approach to the provision of (auto)mobility and food in the UK. This shows the way in which the pandemic has had a differential effect on ongoing transitions in both systems, sometimes slowing them down, and sometimes accelerating them. In addition, it reveals how it has established new transition pathways. The empirical work further shows how qualitative modelling with system dynamics facilitates an explicit a systematic comparative analysis of transition case studies.","Boons, Frank Doherty Bob Köhler Jonathan Papachristos Georg Wells Peter",Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions,234,24

The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and needs of parents caring for a child with an intellectual disability during the first lockdown period in the Netherlands. METHOD: Five mothers caring for a child with an intellectual disability participated in this qualitative study. The participants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. The interviews lasted between 26 and 48 min. The interview recordings were transcribed verbatim, and the transcripts were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Three overarching themes emerged: (1) We need to stay healthy, which centres on the mother's urge to protect their child's well-being; (2) We make it work, which provides insight into how the mothers were handling the drastic changes in their family; and (3) My child's and family's place in the world, which focuses on the mothers' experienced position in the world around them. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides valuable insights into the experiences and needs of mothers caring for a child with an intellectual disability during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Embregts, P; Heerkens, L; Frielink, N; Giesbers, S; Vromans, L; Jahoda, A",J. intellect. dis. res,234,16

Using high-throughput methods, we assessed herein the serological response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus of 1847 participants working in three sites of an institution in Paris conurbation. In May-July 2020, 11% (95% CI: 9.7-12.6) of serums were positive for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins, and 9.5% (CI:8.2-11.0) were neutralizer in pseudo-typed virus assays. The prevalence of seroconversion was 11.6% (CI:10.2-13.2) when considering positivity in at least one assays. In 5% of RT-qPCR positive individuals, no systemic IgGs were detected. Among immune individuals, 21% had been asymptomatic. Anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) occurred in 52% of the IgG-positive individuals and in 3% of the negative ones. In contrast, 30% of the anosmia-ageusia cases were seronegative suggesting that the true prevalence of infection may have reached 16.6%. In sera obtained 4-8 weeks after the first sampling anti-N and anti-S IgG titers and neutralization activity in pseudo-virus assay declined by 31%, 17% and 53%, resulting thus in half-life of respectively 35, 87 and 28 days. The population studied is representative of active workers in Paris. The short lifespan of the serological systemic responses suggests an underestimation of the true prevalence of infection.

This study aimed to systematically review the available evidence in the literature for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in association with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify cases of COVID-19-associated CVT. The search period spanned 1 January 2020 to 1 December 2020, and the review protocol (PROSPERO-CRD42020214327) followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Identified studies were evaluated for bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A proportion meta-analysis was performed to estimate the frequency of CVT among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: We identified 57 cases from 28 reports. Study quality was mostly classified as low. CVT symptoms developed after respiratory disease in 90%, and the mean interval was 13 days. CVT involved multiple sites in 67% of individuals, the deep venous system was affected in 37%, and parenchymal hemorrhage was found in 42%. Predisposing factors for CVT beyond SARS-CoV-2 infection were present in 31%. In-hospital mortality was 40%. Using data from 34,331 patients, the estimated frequency of CVT among patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.08% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-0.5). In an inpatient setting, CVT accounted for 4.2% of cerebrovascular disorders in individuals with COVID-19 (cohort of 406 patients, 95% CI: 1.47-11.39). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral venous thrombosis in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a rare, although there seems to be an increased relative risk. High suspicion is necessary, because the diagnosis of this potentially life-threatening condition in COVID-19 patients can be challenging. Evidence is still scarce on the pathophysiology and potential prevention of COVID-19-associated CVT.","Baldini, Tommaso; Asioli, Gian Maria; Romoli, Michele; Carvalho Dias, Mariana; Schulte, Eva C; Hauer, Larissa; Aguiar De Sousa, Diana; Sellner, Johann; Zini, Andrea",Eur. j. neurol,234,26

Several sharding-based blockchain systems have been proposed to solve this limitation. Which blocks should be saved by nodes in the sharding-based blockchain system is a new problem. To solve this problem, the optimized data storage method is proposed in this paper. Five features of block popularity are presented, including the objective feature of a block, the objective feature of the block associated with the node, the historical popularity, the hidden popularity and the storage requirements. Then the ELM classifier is used in the optimized model due to its high performance of training and classification.

METHODS: This study consists of 17 head and neck cancer patient's treatment plans. Nine types of verification plans are created for all 17 clinically approved treatment plans by consecutively deleting different segments (up to eight) one by one from each field of the plan. Decrement factor (&#967;) is introduced in our study which illustrated the degree of decay of gamma passing rate when intentional errors are introduced.

We sought to determine the effectiveness of thermal screening as a key step in diagnosing COVID-19 in a resource-limited setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study based on a review of body temperature and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 test results records for truck drivers entering Uganda through Mutukula between 15th May and 30th July 2020. All records missing information for body temperature, age, gender, and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 status were excluded from the data set. A data set of 7,181 entries was used to compare thermal screening and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay test results using the diagnostic statistical test in STATAv15 software. The prevalence of COVID-19 amongst the truck drivers based on Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay results was determined. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive and negative Likelihood ratios were obtained using Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay as the gold standard. RESULTS: Based on our gold standard test, the proportion of persons that tested positive for COVID-19 was 6.7% (95% CI: 6.1-7.3). Of the 7,181 persons that were thermally screened, 6,844 (95.3%) were male. The sample median age was 38 years (interquartile range, IQR: 31-45 years). The median body temperature was 36.5°C (IQR: 36.3-36.7) and only n (1.2%) had a body temperature above 37.5°C. The sensitivity and specificity of thermal screening were 9.9% (95% CI: 7.4-13.0) and 99.5% (95% CI: 99.3-99.6) respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 57.8 (95% CI: 46.5-68.6) and 93.9 (95% CI: 93.3-94.4) respectively. The positive and negative Likelihood Ratios (LRs) were 19 (95% CI: 12.4-29.1) and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.88-0.93) respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study population, the use of Thermal screening alone is ineffective in the detection of potential COVID-19 cases at point of entry. We recommend a combination of screening tests or additional testing using highly sensitive molecular diagnostics such as Polymerase Chain Reaction.","Nsawotebba, Andrew; Ibanda, Ivan; Ssewanyana, Isaac; Ogwok, Patrick; Ocen, Francis; Okiira, Christopher; Kagirita, Atek; Mujuni, Dennis; Tugumisirize, Didas; Kabugo, Joel; Nyombi, Abdunoor; Majwala, Robert Kaos; Bagaya, Bernard Ssentalo; Kalyesubula-Kibuuka, Simeon; Ssengooba, Willy; Nabadda, Susan",PLoS One,234,24

Cambodia eased some COVID-19 mitigation measures in June and July 2020. On Aug 20th a cluster of respiratory illnesses among residents of a pagoda included persons that had tested positive for influenza A, and none that were positive for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: On Aug 25, a response team deployed. Persons with influenza-like illness (ILI) were asked questions on demographics, illness, personal prevention measures, and residential arrangements. Respiratory swabs were tested for influenza and SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR; viruses were sequenced. Sentinel surveillance data were analyzed to assess recent trends in influenza circulation in the community. RESULTS: Influenza A(H3N2) viruses were identified in sentinel surveillance in Cambodia in July 2020, prior to the reported pagoda outbreak. Among the 362 pagoda residents, 73(20.2%) ILI cases were identified; 40 were tested with 33/40 (82.5%) confirmed positive for influenza A(H3N2). All 40 were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Among 73 residents with ILI, none were vaccinated against influenza, 47 (64%) clustered in 3 of 8 sleeping quarters; 20 (27%) reported often wearing a mask; 27 (36%) reported often washing hands; and 11 (15%) reported practicing social distancing. All viruses clustered within clade 3c2.A1 close to strains circulating in Australia in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Circulation of influenza viruses began in the community following a relaxing of national COVID-19 mitigation measures, and prior to this outbreak in a pagoda with limited social distancing. Continued surveillance and influenza vaccination remain needed to limit the impact of influenza globally.","Sovann, Ly; Sar, B; Kab, V; Yann, S; Kinzer, M; Raftery, P; Albalak, R; Patel, S; Long Hay, P; Seng, H; Um, S; Chin, S; Chau, D; Khalakdina, A; Karlsson, E; Olsen, S J; Mott, J A",Int. j. infect. dis,234,6

Here, we describe the genomic structures and associated host factors important for flaviviruses genome circularization and summarize their functional roles. Flaviviruses are relatively small, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with genomes of approximately 11 kb in length. These genomes contain motifs at their 5' and 3' ends, as well as in other regions, that are involved in circularization. These motifs are highly conserved throughout the Flavivirus genus and occur both in mature virions and within infected cells. We provide an overview of these sequence motifs and RNA structures involved in circularization, describe their linear and circularized structures, and discuss the proteins that interact with these circular structures and that promote and regulate their formation, aiming to clarify the key features of genome circularization and understand how these affect the flaviviruses life cycle.","De Falco, Louis; Silva, Nelly M; Santos, Nuno C; Huber, Roland G; Martins, Ivo C",,234,1

The low number might be explained by the choice of most physicians to inform early in the pandemic about safety measures, to switch most of the IEI patients to home therapy and to remote assistance.

It dramatically affects people's health and daily life. Neurological complications are increasingly documented for patients with COVID-19. However, the effect of COVID-19 on the brain is less studied, and existing quantitative neuroimaging analyses of COVID-19 were mainly based on the univariate voxel-based morphometry analysis (VBM) that requires corrections for a large number of tests for statistical significance, multivariate approaches that can reduce the number of tests to be corrected have not been applied to study COVID-19 effect on the brain yet. In this study, we leveraged source-based morphometry (SBM) analysis, a multivariate extension of VBM, to identify changes derived from computed tomography scans in covarying gray matter volume patterns underlying COVID-19 in 120 neurological patients (including 58 cases with COVID-19 and 62 patients without COVID-19 matched for age, gender and diseases). SBM identified that lower gray matter volume (GMV) in superior/medial/middle frontal gyri was significantly associated with a higher level of disability (modified Rankin Scale) at both discharge and six months follow-up phases even when controlling for cerebrovascular diseases. GMV in superior/medial/middle frontal gyri was also significantly reduced in patients receiving oxygen therapy compared to patients not receiving oxygen therapy. Patients with fever presented significant GMV reduction in inferior/middle temporal gyri and fusiform gyrus compared to patients without fever. Patients with agitation showed GMV reduction in superior/medial/middle frontal gyri compared to patients without agitation. Patients with COVID-19 showed no significant GMV differences from patients without COVID-19 in any brain region. Results suggest that COVID-19 may affect the frontal-temporal network in a secondary manner through fever or lack of oxygen.","Duan, Kuaikuai; Premi, Enrico; Pilotto, Andrea; Cristillo, Viviana; Benussi, Alberto; Libri, Ilenia; Giunta, Marcello; Bockholt, H Jeremy; Liu, Jingyu; Campora, Riccardo; Pezzini, Alessandro; Gasparotti, Roberto; Magoni, Mauro; Padovani, Alessandro; Calhoun, Vince",Neurobiol Stress,234,26

AIM: This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of traumatic fractures in Yogyakarta Special Region (Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta [DIY]) during the COVID-19 emergency response period and compare the data with the similar period in the previous year. METHODS: This was a retrospective study involving five secondary referral hospitals and one tertiary referral hospital. We included all patients who presented to the emergency departments or orthopedic clinics who were then diagnosed with new-onset fractures. We compared the data during the emergency response period (COVID group) with a similar period in 2019 (control group). RESULTS: There were 1249 patients with 1428 fractures included in this study. There was 47.68% reduction of patients during the emergency response period. There was no significant difference in proportion of gender and mean of age (control group vs. COVID group: 55.9% vs. 54.8%, p = 0.717 for male gender;42.64 ± 24.03 years vs. 42.20 ± 23.34 years, p = 0.886 for mean of patients’ age). There were significant increases in the proportions of patients experiencing low-energy injuries (38.0% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.012), injuries occurring at home (34.0% vs. 23.8%, p = 0.001), and surgically treated closed fractures (51.8% vs. 45.3%, p = 0.038), along with decrease of patients’ referrals (1.6% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.018) during the pandemic. The difference in proportions of fracture type, osteoporotic fractures, and multiple trauma was not significant (control group vs. COVID group: 19.2% vs. 17.4%, p = 0.418 for open fracture;15.4% vs. 14.7%, p = 0.750 for osteoporotic fracture;and 9.0% vs. 7.0%;p = 0.217 for multiple trauma). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 emergency response period in DIY, there were nearly half reduction of patients with fractures, increased proportion of patients injured at home, reduced proportion of patients referred to another hospital, and increased proportion of surgically treated closed fractures. The knowledge about this epidemiological trend may help in developing preventive programs and treatment policy for fractures and other injuries during the current pandemic.","Hidayat, L.; Rahayu, B.

However, the field is so new that no consensus view has emerged guiding clinical decisions to employ imaging procedures such as radiography, computer tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging, and in what measure the risk of exposure of staff to possible infection could be justified by the knowledge gained. The insensitivity of current RT-PCR methods for positive diagnosis is part of the rationale for resorting to imaging procedures. While CT is more sensitive than genetic testing in hospitalized patients, positive findings of ground glass opacities depend on the disease stage. There is sparse reporting on PET/CT with [18F]-FDG in COVID-19, but available results are congruent with the earlier literature on viral pneumonias. There is a high incidence of cerebral findings in COVID-19, and likewise evidence of gastrointestinal involvement. Artificial intelligence, notably machine learning is emerging as an effective method for diagnostic image analysis, with performance in the discriminative diagnosis of diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia comparable to that of human practitioners.","Afshar-Oromieh, Ali; Prosch, Helmut; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia; Bohn, Karl Peter; Alberts, Ian; Mingels, Clemens; Thurnher, Majda; Cumming, Paul; Shi, Kuangyu; Peters, Alan; Geleff, Silvana; Lan, Xiaoli; Wang, Feng; Huber, Adrian; Gräni, Christoph; Heverhagen, Johannes T; Rominger, Axel; Fontanellaz, Matthias; Schöder, Heiko; Christe, Andreas; Mougiakakou, Stavroula; Ebner, Lukas",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,234,13

METHODS: Medical records of pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 15 to March 15, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The severity of disease, virus clearance time, and length of hospital stay were measured as the primary objective, while the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 was also assessed. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients (28 pregnant women, 54 reproductive-aged non-pregnant women) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Univariate regression indicated no association between pregnancy and severity of disease (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.08-5.15; p=0.76), virus clearance time (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.65-2.01; p=0.62), and length of hospital stay (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.66-1.84; p=0.71). Of the pregnant women, 22 delivered 23 live births, either by cesarean section (17, 60.7%) or vaginal delivery (5, 17.9%), and no neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2.

In an effort to extend platelet (PLT) shelf life and minimize waste, our institution transitioned room temperature to cold-stored PLTs for administration to bleeding patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We describe the administrative and technical processes involved in transitioning room temperature PLTs to cold storage in April 2020. Additionally, we describe the clinical utilization of cold-stored PLTs in the first month of this practice change, with a focus on changes in PLT counts after transfusion, hemostasis, and safety outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 61 cold-stored PLT units were transfused to 40 bleeding patients, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 1 (1-2) units per patient. The median age was 68 (59-73) years; 58% male. Median pretransfusion and posttransfusion PLTs counts were 88 (67-109) and 115 (93-145). A total of 95% of transfusions were administered in the operating room: 57% cardiac surgery, 20% vascular surgery, 8% general surgery, and 5% solid organ transplantation. Hemostasis was deemed to be adequate in all cases after transfusion. There were no transfusion reactions. One patient (3%) experienced a fever and infection within 5 days of transfusion, which was unrelated to transfusion. Median (IQR) hospital length of stay was 8.5 (6-17) days. Two patients (5%) died in the hospital of complications not related to transfusion. CONCLUSION: Cold-stored PLT utilization was associated with adequate hemostasis and no overt signal for patient harm. Conversion from room temperature to cold-stored PLTs may be one method of reducing waste in times of scarce blood inventories.","Warner, Matthew A; Kurian, Emil B; Hammel, Scott A; van Buskirk, Camille M; Kor, Daryl J; Stubbs, James R",Transfusion,234,13

It is different from other online learning studies where online courses are mostly a method of choice, with suitable support from institutions and expectation from instructors and students, rather than a contingency. Under this specific environment, we utilized an online survey to collect students’ feedback from eleven universities across Hong Kong. Using partial least squares for analysis on the 400 valid samples we received, we found that peer interactions and course design have the most salient impact on students’ attitude, whereas interactions with instructors has no effect at all on students’ attitude.

Considering that the autochthonous back muscles, responsible for straightening and stabilizing the spine, cannot be activated voluntarily, they can be strengthened only through specific training. The computer-supported test and training system (CTT) Centaur (BfMC GmbH, Leipzig, SN, Germany) seems well suited for this purpose. To show its potential as a reliable diagnostic and training tool, this study aimed to evaluate the test-retest reliability of this 3D spatial rotation device. METHODS: A prospective pilot study was conducted in 20 healthy volunteers of both sexes. For test-retest reliability analysis, three measurements were performed with a two-day interval between each measurement. Each measurement consisted of a one-minute endurance test performed in eight different positions (transverse plane). During the test, the subject was tilted by 90° in the sagittal plane from a neutral, upright position. Meanwhile, the subject's level of upper body stabilization along the body axis was assessed. All trunk movements (momentum values) were quantified by a multicomponent force sensor and standardized relative to the subject's upper body mass. The range of motion was assessed by 95% confidence ellipse analysis. Here, all position-specific confidence ellipses for each measurement were merged to a summarized quantity. Finally, ICC analysis using a single-rating, absolute agreement, two-way mixed-effects model and a Bland-Altman plot was performed to determine the reliability. RESULTS: Considering all measurements (t1, t2, t3), the ICC for reliability evaluation was 0.805, and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was [0.643, 0.910]. Moreover, the Bland-Altman plots for all three pairs of time points did not show significant differences. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that the CTT Centaur shows good test-retest reliability, indicating it can be used in clinical practice in the future.","Pfeifle, Christian; Edel, Melanie; Schleifenbaum, Stefan; Kühnapfel, Andreas; Heyde, Christoph-Eckhard",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,234,12

The first line of therapy is usually based on oral or intravenous iron supplementation; however, many patients remain anemic and do not respond. The key might lie in the pathogenesis of the anemia itself. Cancer-related anemia (CRA) is characterized by a decreased circulating serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation despite ample iron stores, pointing to a more complex problem related to iron homeostatic regulation and additional factors such as chronic inflammatory status. This review explores our current understanding of iron homeostasis in cancer, shedding light on the modulatory role of hepcidin in intestinal iron absorption, iron recycling, mobilization from liver deposits, and inducible regulators by infections and inflammation. The underlying relationship between CRA and systemic low-grade inflammation will be discussed, and an integrated multitarget approach based on nutrition and exercise to improve iron utilization by reducing low-grade inflammation, modulating the immune response, and supporting antioxidant mechanisms will also be proposed. Indeed, a Mediterranean-based diet, nutritional supplements and exercise are suggested as potential individualized strategies and as a complementary approach to conventional CRA therapy.","Natalucci, Valentina; Virgili, Edy; Calcagnoli, Federica; Valli, Giacomo; Agostini, Deborah; Zeppa, Sabrina Donati; Barbieri, Elena; Emili, Rita",Nutrients,234,16

However, their biosafety has not been evaluated, which could have been the first gateway to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. During 9-11 March 2020, the first comprehensive evaluation of the biosafety in all 89 labs qualified for conducting SARS-CoV-2 tests in Sichuan Province of China was conducted. The degree of compliance with 39 criteria in five categories was evaluated: biosafety requirements for lab activities (14 criteria), sample transfer, acceptance and management (6 criteria), waste management (9 criteria), personnel training and protection (4 criteria), and lab environmental disinfection, emergency plans and accident handling (6 criteria). Our results revealed that, although an overall median compliance rate of 94.6% for 39 criteria, only four of 89 labs met all of them. Criteria in personnel training and protection have been most satisfactorily met, followed by lab environmental disinfection, emergency plans and accident handling. The most severe risk was the lack of automatic doors at the main entrance or in core operation areas, especially among labs in CDC and hospitals. This risk, together with failure for keeping pressure in the core operation areas 25 ± 5 Pa (mainly among labs in the third-party testing agencies), may cause accidental exposure to biological agents from lab activities. Other severe risk included failure for standard labeling of SARS-CoV-2 wastes and lacking regular monitoring of sterilization effects. Our findings would provide experiences and lessons for strengthening lab biosafety in other Chinese provinces, and also serve as an important reference for many other countries where such labs are being or will be quickly built for fighting the COVID-19. The information of lab safety should be considered to be internally linked to the national intelligent syndromic surveillance system (NISSS), for better improving the safety of the labs at the greatest need and facilitating more comprehensive surveillance of risk for disease outbreak.","Yuan, Dan; Gao, Wenfeng; Liang, Shu; Yang, Shujuan; Jia, Peng",Environ Int,234,16

OBJECTIVES: To identify the cumulative incidence for ECMO use in the first pandemic wave and to describe the Nationwide Chilean cohort of ECMO-supported COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a population-based study from March 3 to August 31, 2020, using linked data from National agencies. Cumulative incidence of ECMO use and mortality risk of ECMO-supported patients were calculated and age-standardized. Additionally, a retrospective cohort was performed. Outcomes were 90-days mortality after ECMO initiation, ECMO-associated complications and hospital length of stay (LOS). Cox regression models were used to explore risk factors for mortality in a time-to-event analysis. MAIN RESULTS: 94 COVID-19 patients were supported with ECMO (0.42:100,000 population, 14.89:100,000 positive cases, and 1.2% of COVID-19 intubated patients); 85 were included in the cohort analysis: age 48 [41-55] years, 83.5% men, 42.4% obese. Pre-ECMO intubation days were 4 [2-7], PaO2:FiO2 86.8 [64-99] mmHg, 91.8% were prone-positioned; 14 had refractory respiratory acidosis. Main complications were infections (70.6%), bleeding (38.8%) and thromboembolism (22.4%); 52 patients were discharged home and 33 died. Hospital LOS was 50 [24-69] days. Lower respiratory system compliance and higher driving pressure before ECMO onset were associated with increased mortality. Duration of pre-ECMO intubation &#8805;10 days was not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Documenting nationwide ECMO needs may help planning ECMO provision for future COVID-19 pandemic waves. The 90-days mortality of the Chilean cohort of ECMO-supported COVID-19 patients (38.8%) is comparable to previous reports.

The chest X-ray (CXR) is one of the alternatives to achieve fast diagnosis, but the unavailability of large-scale annotated data makes the clinical implementation of machine learning-based COVID detection difficult. Another issue is the usage of ImageNet pre-trained networks which does not extract reliable feature representations from medical images. In this paper, we propose the use of hierarchical convolutional network (HCN) architecture to naturally augment the data along with diversified features. The HCN uses the first convolution layer from COVIDNet followed by the convolutional layers from well-known pre-trained networks to extract the features. The use of the convolution layer from COVIDNet ensures the extraction of representations relevant to the CXR modality. We also propose the use of ECOC for encoding multiclass problems to binary classification for improving the recognition performance. Experimental results show that HCN architecture is capable of achieving better results in comparison with the existing studies. The proposed method can accurately triage potential COVID-19 patients through CXR images for sharing the testing load and increasing the testing capacity.","Dev, Kapal; Khowaja, Sunder Ali; Bist, Ankur Singh; Saini, Vaibhav; Bhatia, Surbhi",Neural Comput Appl,234,1

The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. The reduction in international travel, social distancing measures and public health action have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Cases of COVID-19 continue to be notified by jurisdictions, albeit at a slowed rate. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. In the past reporting week new cases in Australia are mostly considered to be locally acquired, consistent with the drop in international travel. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years, with a third of these cases associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, cases continue to increase, with some areas such as Brazil and India showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have currently reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of disease occurrence.",,,234,16

Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, radiology, treatment, and progress are collected. Patients with COPD were selected and compared to patients without COPD. Factors associated with a poor prognosis were analyzed. Results: Of the 10,420 patients included in the SEMI-COVID registry as of May 21, 2020, 746 (7.16%) had a diagnosis of COPD. Patients with COPD are older than those without COPD (77 years vs 68 years) and more frequently male. They have more comorbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, kidney failure) and a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (2 vs 1, p<0.001). The mortality rate in COPD patients was 38.3% compared to 19.2% in patients without COPD (p<0.001). Male sex, a history of hypertension, heart failure, moderate-severe chronic kidney disease, presence of cerebrovascular disease with sequelae, degenerative neurological disease, dementia, functional dependence, and a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index have been associated with increased mortality due to COVID-19 in COPD patients.

Much research has focused on discussing the validity of New Public Management (NPM) as a paradigm, including the recognition of regional versions of a number of universal problems in the Public Governance, NPM, and Public Value areas. This debate is focused on the need to give concrete answers to the new management needs of policy makers and to the growing demands of citizens. Increasingly public administration is based on meeting two needs: society requires creative, flexible, and innovation-oriented approaches, whilst economic pressures and budget cuts are forcing uses and models oriented toward efficiency, competitiveness, and cost savings. As regard the changing requirements of the public government, the new organizational system needs to incorporate the creativity, innovation capacity, and flexibility necessary to achieve sustainability and public value. The purpose of this research is to offer an organizational model, which balances exploration activities with those of exploitation, thus being able to meet the changing needs within the Administration, and the actions envisaged for its operations. This article also introduces the requirements for a decision support system to measure regional performance and service quality. It is hoped that we add to our knowledge and understanding of coordinated public policy and good governance that is effective even in these radically demanding Covid-19 times.","Palmi, Pamela; Corallo, Angelo; Prete, M.

Such support should be informed by patient preferences and needs. The objective of this study was to gather information from individuals with tinnitus living in Europe to inform stakeholders of the (a) support they needed in relation to changes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) suggestions regarding tinnitus care for the future. METHODS: A cross-sectional mixed method study design was used using closed and open-ended questions via an online survey. Data were gathered from 710 adults experiencing tinnitus in Western Europe, with the majority living in The Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Those with tinnitus indicated the following support needs during the pandemic (a) support for tinnitus, (b) support for hearing-related difficulties, (c) social support and (d) pandemic-related support. Five directions for future tinnitus care were provided, namely, (a) need for understanding professional support and access to multidisciplinary experts, (b) greater range of therapies and resources, (c) access to more information about tinnitus, (d) prioritising tinnitus research and (e) more support for hearing protection and hearing loss prevention. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the need for accessible (remote), patient-centred, suitable and evidence-based tinnitus care. Insights from the current study can be used by various stakeholders including clinical practitioners and tinnitus support services to ensure those with tinnitus have access to the help and support required in order to reduce service provision insufficiencies.","Beukes, Eldré W; Lourenco, Matheus P C G; Biot, Lana; Andersson, Gerhard; Kaldo, Viktor; Manchaiah, Vinaya; Jacquemin, Laure",Int J Clin Pract,234,1

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a well described and documented condition that is associated with the active or recent COVID-19 infection. A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). With only very limited cases reported from the west, MIS-A is considered a rare and serious complication of COVID-19. However, it is not as uncommon as we think. Many cases go undiagnosed for lack of COVID -19 like symptoms and unawareness among treating clinicians about this newer clinical entity. Further, antibody testing and inflammatory markers are not easily available in many of the Indian hospitals especially in rural India where the second wave had been intense, thereby making it difficult for the diagnosis of MIS-A. Also, there is no clear treatment guideline for MIS-A unlike MIS-C where the treatment protocol is well laid out. Awareness about MIS-A among treating clinicians can thus help in further evaluation and increased identification of the syndrome at the early stages thereby helping in the early institution of treatment. Our tertiary COVID care hospital in South India which has handled about 5200 cases of COVID-19 is been able to identify 04 cases of MIS-A proving that this clinical entity is not as rare as it is thought but lacks reporting and prompt identification. Here we describe 04 cases of MIS-A and strive to bring in the various aspects of it, including the clinical presentation, laboratory markers, diagnostic criteria and treatment considerations in this post second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

A disciplinary challenge remains to map the variability in person-centred care with an aim to empirically clarify the invariant in person-centred care. Based on current research and practice, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, this article argues that the relational aspect of person-centred care is such an invariant, building on the socially constructive notion of ‘personhood’ being a standing or status that is bestowed on one human being by another in the context of relationship and social being. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, several of the key determinants of person-centred care are under threat due to health service responses and/or infection control measures, such as keeping older adults safe, imposing relationship restrictions, social distancing and isolation (or the lack thereof). Clinical examples from an Australian health service are used to show how recognizing the relational invariant of person-centred aged care facilitated supporting lives lived whilst also protecting lives saved. The relational invariant to person-centred care is who we are, constructed or deconstructed by and with others; something that may have become more visible through the relational restrictions imposed due to COVID-19. Protecting relationality in life and care and advocating for both safe and person-centred care for those who need it most is now more important than ever.","Edvardsson, David; Baxter, Rebecca; Birkett, Peter; Dunlop, Andrea",Nordic J.

COVID-19 affects predominantly the respiratory system, in addition to other organ systems, mainly the cardiovascular system. One of the hypotheses is that virus entering the target cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 affecting hypothalamic pituitary axis could lead to dysautonomia which is measured by heart rate variability (HRV). HRV is a non-invasive measure of autonomic function that facilitates identification of COVID-19 patients at the risk of developing cardiovascular complications. So, we aimed to assess HRV in COVID patients and compare between COVID patients and normal controls. METHODS: In a case control design, we compared 63 COVID-19 infected patients with 43 healthy controls matched for age and gender. Along with clinical characterization, heart rate variability was evaluated using ambulatory 5 min ECG in lead II and expressed in frequency and time domain measures. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0. RESULTS: Mean age of the study population was 49.1 ± 14.2 years and 71 (66.9%) were males. Frequency domain measures high (HF) and low (LF) frequency powers were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. HF/LF and LF/HF ratios were not different between groups. Time domain measures rMSSD (root mean square of successive RR interval differences) and SDNN (standard deviation of NN intervals) were significantly increased among COVID-19 subjects. COVID-19 infection was associated with increased parasympathetic activity as defined by rMSSD>40 {adjusted odds ratio 7.609 (95% CI 1.61-35.94); p=0.01} and SDNN>60 {adjusted odds ratio 2.620 (95% CI 1.070-6.44); p=0.035} after adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Our study results showed increased parasympathetic tone in COVID patients. Early diagnosis of autonomic imbalance in COVID patients is needed to plan management and limit progression of disease.","Kaliyaperumal, Deepalakshmi; Rk, Karthikeyan; Alagesan, Murali; Ramalingam, Sudha",J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol,234,32

However, exposure to fragranced cleaning products has been associated with adverse effects on human health. Products can emit a range of volatile chemicals, including some classified as hazardous, but relatively few ingredients are disclosed to the public. Thus, relatively little is known about the specific emissions from these products. This study investigates the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from ""pandemic products"" that are being used frequently and extensively in society. In addition, among these emissions, this study identifies potentially hazardous compounds, compares so-called green and regular versions of products, and examines whether ingredients are disclosed to the public. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, 26 commonly used pandemic products, including 13 regular and 13 so-called green versions, were analyzed for their volatile emissions. Product types included hand sanitizers, air disinfectants, multipurpose cleaners, and handwashing soap. All products were fragranced. The analyses found the products collectively emitted 399 VOCs with 127 VOCs classified as potentially hazardous. All products emitted potentially hazardous compounds. Comparing regular products and green products, no significant difference was found in the emissions of the most prevalent compounds. Further, among the 399 compounds emitted, only 4% of all VOCs and 11% of potentially hazardous VOCs were disclosed on any product label or safety data sheet. This study reveals that pandemic products can generate volatile emissions that could pose risks to health, that could be unrecognized, and that could be reduced, such as by using fragrance-free versions of products.","Steinemann, Anne; Nematollahi, Neda; Rismanchi, Behzad; Goodman, Nigel; Kolev, Spas D",Air Qual Atmos Health,234,32

This report describes the experience of a single US children's hospital (Children's Wisconsin, CW) in developing a universal pre-procedural COVID-19 testing protocol and reports early outcomes. METHODS: The CW pre-procedural COVID-19 response began with the creation of a multi-disciplinary taskforce that sought to develop a strategy for universal pre-procedural COVID-19 testing which (1) maximized patient safety, (2) prevented in-hospital viral transmission, (3) conserved resources, and (4) allowed for resumption of procedural care within institutional capacity. RESULTS: Of 11,209 general anesthetics performed at CW from March 16, 2020 to October 31, 2020, 11,150 patients (99.5%) underwent pre-procedural COVID-19 testing. Overall, 1.4% of pre-procedural patients tested positive for COVID-19. By June 2020, CW was operating at near-normal procedural volume and there were no documented cases of in-hospital viral transmission. Only 0.5% of procedures were performed under augmented COVID-19 precautions (negative pressure environment and highest-level personal protective equipment). CONCLUSION: CW successfully developed a multi-disciplinary pre-procedural COVID-19 testing protocol that enabled resumption of near-normal procedural volume within three months while limiting in-hospital viral transmission and resource use.","Bence, Christina M; Jarzembowski, Jason A; Belter, Lukas; Berens, Richard J; Henrickson, Kelly J; Hoffman, George M; Jackson, Felicia; Kehl, Karen Sue; Oldham, Keith T; Scott, John P; Tassone, J Channing; Woger, Nancy; Yale, Erin; Gourlay, David M",Pediatr. surg. int,234,22

METHODOLOGY: We compared POC-Ab with rRT-PCR results among patients in a tertiary hospital from January to March 2020 in Bandung, Indonesia. We selected presumptive COVID-19 patients with positive rRT-PCR consecutively and 20 patients with negative rRT-PCR results were selected randomly from the same group of patients as controls. We described the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) with corresponding 95% confidence interval using serum and capillary blood samples. We also tested POC-Ab using non-COVID-19 (confirmed dengue and typhoid) patients' sera. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with positive rRT-PCR result and 20 negative controls were included (68.1% males, mean age 46 (SD: 15.4)). Using the serum, the sensitivity of the POC-Ab was 63.0% (42.4-80.6), specificity was 95.0% (75.1-99.9), PPV was 94.4% (72.7-99.8), NPV was 65.5% (45.7-82.1). A subset of 20 patients was tested using a capillary blood sample. The accuracy of the capillary blood sample is lower compared to serum (50.0% vs. 78.7%). None of the non-COVID-19 sera tested were reactive. CONCLUSIONS: POC-Ab for COVID-19 has a high specificity with no false-positive result in non-COVID-19 sera. Therefore, it can be used to guide diagnostic among symptomatic patients in resource limited settings. Given its low sensitivity, patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 but non-reactive result should be prioritized for rRT-PCR testing.","Fauziah, Nisa; Koesoemadinata, Raspati C; Andriyoko, Basti; Faridah, Lia; Riswari, Silvita F; Widyatmoko, Leonardus; Prihatni, Delita; Ekawardhani, Savira; Fibriani, Azzania; Rachmawati, Emma; Ristandi, Ryan B; Alamanda, Cut Nc; Prodjosoewojo, Susantina; Lestari, Bony W; Santoso, Ida P",J Infect Dev Ctries,234,16

While the lockdown strategy is an essential step to curb the exponential rise of COVID-19 cases, it can have a significative impact on mental health on the population involved, that is still not well known and must be explored. The objective of the present research is to investigate the Quality of Life (QoL) and Symptoms of PTSD (PTSS) encountered during the quarantine period (April 2020) due to the spread of COVID-19 in Italy. Participants (N = 1839;1430 females and 409 males), who were volunteers and anonymous, adults (18-73 years), were drawn from a convenience sample of the general population and asked to fill out an online questionnaire, after giving an informed written consent.

Results showed that married people/cohabitants, non-workers, and those with a lower level of education perceived a better QoL and less PTSS. The most frequent emotions felt during the first month of quarantine and referred to by participants were sadness (72%), boredom (54.5%), impotence (52%), and anxiety (50%).

We determined SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children and adolescents from Arkansas over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsWe tested remnant serum samples from children from 1-18 years who visited Arkansas hospitals or clinics for non-COVID19-related reasons from April, 2020 through April, 2021 for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We used univariable and multivariable regression models to determine association between seropositivity and participant characteristics. ResultsAmong 2400 participants, seroprevalence rose from 7.9% in April/May 2020 (95% CI, 4.9-10.9%) to 25.8% in April 2021 (95% CI, 22.2-29.3%). Hispanic and black children had a significantly higher association with antibody positivity than white children in multiple sampling periods. ConclusionsBy spring 2021, most children in Arkansas had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, recognition of long-term effects of COVID-19, and the lack of an authorized pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, these results highlight the importance of including children in SARS-CoV-2 public health, clinical care, and research strategies.

However, adoption of COVID-19-related preventive behaviours remain relatively unknown. This study investigated predictors of preventive behaviours. METHODS: An analytical sample of 897 Singaporean adults who were quota sampled based on age, gender, and ethnicity were recruited through a web-enabled survey. Outcomes were adoption of, or increased frequency of preventive behaviours (avoiding social events; avoiding public transport; reducing time spent shopping and eating out; wearing a mask in public; avoiding hospitals/clinics; keeping children out of school, washing hands/using sanitisers; keeping surroundings clean; avoiding touching public surfaces; working from/studying at home). Public perceptions regarding COVID-19 (chances of getting COVID-19; perceived likelihood of COVID-19-related intensive care unit (ICU) admission; government trust; self-efficacy; perceived appropriateness of COVID-19 behaviours; response efficacy), anxiety, and demographic characteristics (age; ethnicity; marital status; education; chronic conditions; current living arrangements) were investigated as predictors of preventive behaviours adopted during COVID-19 in binomial and ordered logistic regressions. RESULTS: Though adoption of preventive behaviours among Singaporeans varied, it was, overall, high, and consistent with government recommendations. Nearly a quarter reported moderate to severe anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7-item - GAD-7 scores). Respondents who perceived higher COVID-19 risks, had higher government trust, higher self-efficacy, and perceived that others acted appropriately reported increased adoption/frequency of preventive measures. The strongest indicator of behavioural change was response efficacy. Respondents who were older, highly educated, anxious and married reported higher adoption/frequency of preventive measures. CONCLUSION: To successfully influence appropriate preventive behaviours, public health messages should highlight response efficacy, increase self-efficacy, and promote trust in governmental response. Focus should be on demographic segments with low adoptions, such as younger individuals and those with low education.","Ozdemir, Semra; Ng, Sean; Chaudhry, Isha; Finkelstein, Eric Andrew",Int. j. health policy manag,234,21

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there was an upsurge of reports of chilblain like lesions (CLL) especially in young patients possibly implicated to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Twelve clinically suspected and histopathologically confirmed cases of IP seen from November 2019 through February 2020 were retrospectively recruited. Clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathological characteristics of these were reviewed and compared with CLL reported in the literature. Mean age of patients was 26.58 ± 15.18 years with an equal male to female ratio. Characteristic histopathology findings were spongiosis (100%), dermal edema (100%), perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (100%) with peri-eccrine accentuation (66.7%), keratinocyte necrosis (50%), focal basal vacuolar damage (58.3%), and lymphocytic vasculitis (58.3%). Significant dermoscopy findings were variable background color ranging from dull red and violaceous to copper red and brown orange, coiled vessels (44.4%) and orange-red structureless areas (63.9%). Lesions over palms and soles preferentially had white dots/clods and lines (38.9%). There appears no exclusive histopathological as well as dermoscopy features of CLL and IP, yet certain clues can be appreciated.

We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of VR and AR technologies for improving knowledge and skills in medical students. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using Best Evidence in Medical Education (BEME) collaboration guidelines, we will search MEDLINE (via PubMed), Education Resources Information Center, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for English-language records, from January 1990 to March 2021. Randomised trials that studied the use of VR or AR devices for teaching medical students will be included. Studies that assessed other healthcare professionals, or did not have a comparator group, will be excluded. The primary outcome measures relate to medical students' knowledge and clinical skills. Two reviewers will independently screen studies and assess eligibility based on our prespecified eligibility criteria, and then extract data from each eligible study using a modified BEME coding form. Any disagreements will be resolved by discussion or, if necessary, the involvement of a third reviewer. The BEME Quality Indicators checklist and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool will be used to assess the quality of the body of evidence. Where data are of sufficient homogeneity, a meta-analysis using a random-effects model will be conducted. Otherwise, a narrative synthesis approach will be taken and studies will be evaluated based on Kirkpatrick's levels of educational outcomes and the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this systematic review as no primary data are being collected. We will disseminate the findings of this review through scientific conferences and through publication in a peer-reviewed journal.","Hussain, Zain; Ng, Dominic Mark; Alnafisee, Nouf; Sheikh, Zakariya; Ng, Nathan; Khan, Ateeb; Hussain, Amir; Aitken, Debbie; Sheikh, Aziz",BMJ Open,234,21

Initial efforts to evaluate changes in college drinking have not yet accounted for typical drinking patterns within a semester. METHODS: To fill this gap, we evaluated how college student drinking patterns changed with the onset of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic during spring 2020 relative to spring 2018 and 2019. Participants were 1,365 college students aged 19 and older, including 895 students who reported past-month alcohol use. Daily drinking data were extracted from an online Timeline Followback survey. RESULTS: Negative binomial hurdle models revealed that, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, college student drinkers did not increase their drinking frequency as was typical in late spring semester, and the number of drinks per occasion declined substantially (28% reduction), greater than the change observed from early to late spring 2018 (3% reduction) or spring 2019 (8% increase). This reduction in drinking quantity in spring 2020 was larger for college student drinkers who moved residences because of the pandemic (49% reduction) than students who did not move (21% reduction). Perceptions in pandemic-related changes in drinking also revealed that 83.5% of college student drinkers self-reported that their drinking stayed the same or decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that, on average, college students drank less-not more-during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of living situation in college student drinking behavior. More research is needed to assess alcohol use in other universities, as this information could be utilized in norms-based interventions to further reduce drinking in students who remain at risk.","Jaffe, Anna E; Kumar, Shaina A; Ramirez, Jason J; DiLillo, David",Alcohol Clin Exp Res,234,16

Despite these aims, ICT4D has been criticized because 1) although ICT and internet have positive effects on societies across the Global North, their positive impact on people's lives in the Global South cannot be easily proved; 2) ICT4D's primary focus seems to be on ICT's series of artefacts rather than on ICT's positive transformative potential of living conditions in the world; 3) the type of development ICT4D aims for could mask global hegemonic interests and seek neoliberal restructuring within less socioeconomically favoured communities within the Global South. For these reasons, claim scholars, ICT4D should be revised. By presenting ICT appropriations among Wixarika peoples in Mexico to protect their sacred land, this paper aims to 1) shed a light on the need for postcolonial critical frameworks on what 'development' associated with ICT should be and 2) to foster discussions on whether ICT can enable alternative voices from the Global South to be heard, despite tensions between traditional views and contemporary technologies.","P'erez-Garc'ia, Lorena",,234,20

In the Eurozone, this lack of coordination represents an important flaw, especially since the Eurozone is not an optimal currency area. Complementing monetary union with a transfer union represents one possible solution. This paper argues that the negative impact of post-2008 and post-Covid-19 unconventional monetary policy on income inequalities provides a second reason to coordinate fiscal and monetary policy. Among various institutional arrangements to implement such coordination, the paper defends the idea that the European Central Bank should be sensitive to distributive considerations when formulating its monetary policy. Such an arrangement would help both to contain the distributive side-effects of monetary policy and to at least partially remedy the flaw at the heart of the Eurozone as long as an outright transfer union remains unfeasible.","Dietsch, P.",Review of Social Economy,234,29

With approvals from the Federal Select Agent Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Institutional Biosecurity Board, we characterized the resistance profile of remdesivir by serially passaging Ebola virus under remdesivir selection; we generated lineages with low-level reduced susceptibility to remdesivir after 35 passages. We found that a single amino acid substitution, F548S, in the Ebola virus polymerase conferred low-level reduced susceptibility to remdesivir. The F548 residue is highly conserved in filoviruses but should be subject to specific surveillance among novel filoviruses, in newly emerging variants in ongoing outbreaks, and also in Ebola virus patients undergoing remdesivir therapy. Homology modeling suggests that the Ebola virus polymerase F548 residue lies in the F-motif of the polymerase active site, a region that was previously identified as susceptible to resistance mutations in coronaviruses. Our data suggest that molecular surveillance of this region of the polymerase in remdesivir-treated COVID-19 patients is also warranted.","Lo, Michael K; Albariño, César G; Perry, Jason K; Chang, Silvia; Tchesnokov, Egor P; Guerrero, Lisa; Chakrabarti, Ayan; Shrivastava-Ranjan, Punya; Chatterjee, Payel; McMullan, Laura K; Martin, Ross; Jordan, Robert; Götte, Matthias; Montgomery, Joel M; Nichol, Stuart T; Flint, Mike; Porter, Danielle; Spiropoulou, Christina F",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,234,23

Our analysis shows that 55% of infected neonates developed COVID-19; the most common symptoms were fever (44%), gastrointestinal (36%), respiratory (52%) and neurological manifestations (18%), and lung imaging was abnormal in 64% of cases. A lack of mother-neonate separation from birth is associated with late SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 4.94 (95% CI: 1.98-13.08), p = 0.0002; adjusted OR 6.6 (95% CI: 2.6-16), p < 0.0001), while breastfeeding is not (OR 0.35 (95% CI: 0.09-1.18), p = 0.10; adjusted OR 2.2 (95% CI: 0.7-6.5), p = 0.148).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of patients receiving urgent care at a university center for dental medicine (Basel, Switzerland) during the 6-week lockdown, pre-lockdown, and post-lockdown periods were retrospectively evaluated. Statistical analysis involved tests for equal proportions and logistic regression models. The level of significance was set at &#945;=0.05. RESULTS: The study comprised 3109 dental emergency visits in the period from February 2 to June 5, 2020. Daily caseloads increased during lockdown. Abscesses, orthodontic emergencies, and surgical follow-ups were more common during lockdown, whereas the number of dento-alveolar injuries declined (&#8804;0.048). Urgent dental care provision involved intraoral radiographs more frequently in the pre-lockdown period compared with the following weeks (p<0.001). Among all treatments, aerosol-generating procedures dropped from 56.1% (pre-lockdown) to 21.3% during lockdown (p<0.001), while teledentistry follow-ups became more frequent (p<0.001). Patients with comorbidities sought urgent dental care less frequently during the post-lockdown period (p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown significantly impacted the dental emergency service in terms of patients' diagnoses, treatment needs, and the characteristics of the urgent care that was delivered. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Access to essential dental care must be monitored and safeguarded throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond as deferred care entails risks for serious sequelae and persons with comorbidities may change their dental care-seeking behavior.","Eggmann, Florin; Haschemi, Asin Ahmad; Doukoudis, Dimitrios; Filippi, Andreas; Verna, Carlalberta; Walter, Clemens; Weiger, Roland; Zitzmann, Nicola U; Bornstein, Michael M",Clin. oral investig,234,16

While it is valuable to theorize about this possibility, it is also important to take note of the present state of work. For better or worse, it is what we are currently stuck with, and as the COVID-19 pandemic has ensured, much of that work is now taking place online. Though a 'return to normalcy' is on the horizon, part of that normalcy involves online work, which is itself a significant change in the lives of many workers. Here I develop an account of work on which work is teleologically structured. This gives the result that working is something we can fail at doing, even when we try, and we can also be unsure of whether we've succeeded or failed. The shift of certain work from in-person to online modes generates a persistent uncertainty for workers in affected professions. Because our ability to work is something we typically value, this uncertainty has significant negative consequences for a worker's self-conception. Indeed, it is analogous to disorders of agency and generates a kind of alienation. Copyright © The Royal Institute of Philosophy, 2021.","Kramer, M. F.",Philosophy,234,16

Germacrene D (GD), is another dominant volatile of T. cinerariifolium flowers and may modulate both defense and pollination. Here, we find that the increase in GD/EßF ratio at later developmental stages is correlated with the tissue distribution in the flower head: the total content of EßF and GD is similar, but GD accumulates comparatively more in the upper disk florets. Naphthol and N, N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (NADI)-stained purple ducts containing EßF and GD, were observed in the five petal lips of the corolla and two-lobed stigma of disk florets. By contrast in the peduncle, EßF accounts for nearly 80% of total terpenes, compared to 5% for GD. EßF is accumulated inside inner cortex cells and parenchyma cells of the pith in young peduncle. This is followed by the formation of terpene-filled axial secretory cavities parallel to the vascular bundles. In conclusion, the observed developmental and diurnal emissions of different EßF/GD ratios appear to be regulated by their tissue distribution.","Li, Jinjin; Hu, Hao; Chen, Yu; Xie, Jing; Li, Jiawen; Zeng, Tuo; Wang, Manqun; Luo, Jing; Zheng, Riru; Jongsma, Maarten A; Wang, Caiyun",Phytochemistry,234,24

The flow cytometry (FC) allows measuring leukocyte populations instantaneously. One of the better-studied molecules is the immunoglobulin-Fc fragment receptor I (FcγRI) or CD64. Its expression informs about the patient immune status. The aim of this study was to describe the CD64 expression in healthy children requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission because of SARS-COV-2 infection. Later, we compare it to previous viral or bacterial infections that caused PICU admission in our centre. METHODS: Prospective observational study (March 2020 to May 2020). The percentage of CD64-positive cells and the CD64 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on monocytes (mCD64) and neutrophils (nCD64) were determined. The FC was done on a blood sample obtained at PICU admission. Healthy children with positive serology (IgM) or nasopharyngeal swab using real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction were included. The values are expressed as median and range, p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Children from the SARS-CoV-2 group were older (p= 0,000), there were no other baseline differences. CONCLUSIONS: The CD64 expression was higher compared to other causes of PICU admission.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In an exposure study with 12 non-smoking participants, the complete urinary excretion of the metabolite 2,3-dihydroxypropylmercapturic acid (DHPMA, UHPLC-MS/MS) and of 2/3-MCPD (GC-MS) was measured on four consecutive days before and after consumption of 50 g glycidyl ester-rich palm fat or 12 g 2/3-MCPD ester-rich hazelnut oil. After controlled exposure, urinary excretion rates of 2/3-MCPD per hour strongly increased, followed by a decrease with average half-lives of 5.8 h (2-MCPD) and 3.6 h (3-MCPD). After consumption of hazelnut oil, mean excretion rates were 14.3 % (2-MCPD) and 3.7 % (3-MCPD) of the study doses. The latter rate was significantly higher (4.6 %) after consumption of palm fat, indicating partial conversion (about 5 %) of glycidol to 3-MCPD under the acidic conditions in the stomach. The average daily ""background"" exposure was estimated to be 0.12 and 0.32 µg/kg bw for 2-MCPD and 3-MCPD, respectively. The relatively high and constant urinary excretion of DHPMA did not reflect the controlled exposure. CONCLUSION: Urinary excretion of 2- and 3-MCPD is suitable as biomarker for the external exposure to the respective fatty acid esters. This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we show that the ultralow interfacial tension in fluid-fluid demixed colloid-polymer systems, which is roughly one million times smaller than in ordinary liquids, manifests itself in a wide variety of interface characteristics and processes. Discussed are the interfacial wetting behaviour close to a hard wall, the thermal capillary waves at the free interface and the process of droplet coalescence and breakup.

METHOD: The SmartDoc project was established to guarantee continuity of healthcare services for patients with lung cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The project was promoted within the National Health System to create a regulatory framework to authorize and reimburse telemedicine in its care delivery for all patients. At the end of the virtual meeting, patients were asked to answer an online survey. RESULTS: From June 19 to December 1, 2020, 83 patients participated in the SmartDoc project and received a teleconsultation. The majority of patients were older than 65 years. Among the 83 televisits, 14 (16.9%) were new visits, 2 (2.4%) second opinions, 4 (4.8%) 30-day postsurgery controls, and 63 (75.9%) long-term follow-up visits. A ""complete satisfaction"" score (5 out of 5 points) was reported in 70.59% of all the respondents; most patients (76.5%) preferred video-consulting and defined it as better than or comparable to an in-person visit.

We finally obtained 608 complete and valid questionnaire forms from all participants. Their intentions of visiting UGSs were investigated based on the extended theory of planned behavior model. Structural equation modeling was employed to test the hypothesized psychological model. The results have shown good estimation performance on risk perception and perceived knowledge to explain the variances in their attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavior control. Among these three endogenous variables, the perceived behavior control owns the greatest and positive influence on the behavioral intention, inferring that controllability is crucial for students to make decisions of visiting green spaces in a post-pandemic context.","Liu, Jiayi; Peng, Zhikai; Cai, Xiaoxi; Peng, You; Li, Jiang; Feng, Tao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,234,20

But the bioactive compounds and potential mechanisms of TJQW for COVID-19 prevention and treatment are unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential therapeutic mechanism of TJQW in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on an integrated network pharmacology approach. METHODS: TCMSP were used to search and screen the active ingredients in TJQW. The Swiss TargetPrediction was used to predict the potential targets of active ingredients. Genes co-expressed with ACE2 were considered potential therapeutic targets on COVID-19. Venn diagram was created to show correlative targets of TJQW against COVID-19. Cytoscape was used to construct a “drug-active ingredient-potential target” network, STRING were used to construct protein-protein interaction network, and cytoHubba performed network topology analysis. Enrichment of biological functions and signaling pathways of core targets was performed by using the clusterProfiler package in R software and ClueGO with CluePedia plugins in Cytoscape. RESULTS: A total of 156 active ingredients were obtained through oral bioavailability and drug-likeness screenings. Two hundred twenty-seven potential targets of TJQW were related to COVID-19. The top ten core targets are EGFR, CASP3, STAT3, ESR1, FPR2, F2, BCL2L1, BDKRB2, MPO, and ACE. Based on that, we obtained 19 key active ingredients: umbelliprenin, quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, praeruptorin E, stigmasterol, and oroxylin A. And the enrichment analysis obtained multiple related gene ontology functions and signaling pathways. Lastly, we constructed a key network of “drug-component-target-biological process-signaling pathway”. Our findings suggested that TJQW treatment for COVID-19 was associated with elevation of immunity and suppression of inflammatory stress, including regulation of inflammatory response, viral process, neutrophil mediated immunity, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, Complement and coagulation cascades, and HIF-1 signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered the pharmacological mechanism underlying TJQW treatment for COVID-19. These results should benefit efforts for people around the world to gain more knowledge about Chinese medicine TJQW in the treatment of this vicious epidemic COVID-19, and help to address this pressing problem currently facing the world.","Huang, Ying; Zheng, Wen-jiang; Ni, Yong-shi; Li, Mian-sha; Chen, Jian-kun; Liu, Xiao-hong; Tan, Xing-hua; Li, Ji-qiang",BioData Min,234,26

Therefore, the aim is to investigate the extent of Covid-19 exposure, anxiety, stress experience, and coping abilities among psychiatrists in private practice compared to physicians in psychiatric and psychosomatic hospitals. METHODS: E-mail-based questionnaires with 13 items were used to assess anxiety and stress experience. A total of 105 practicing psychiatrists, and 73 physicians and psychologists from four clinics (including the Clinic for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy) were surveyed between early April and mid-May 2020. RESULTS: Compared to hospital psychiatrists, psychiatrists in private practice more often felt severely restricted (52.4 vs. 32.9% p=0.010), at risk of infection (35.2 vs. 13.7%, p<0.001) and financially threatened (24.7 vs. 6.9%, p=0.002). The proportion of well-informed practicing psychiatrists was lower (47.6 vs. 63.0%, p=0.043) and the proportion with lack of protective equipment was higher (27.6 vs. 4.1%, p<0.001). At the same COVID-19 exposure level (8.6 vs. 8.2%), office-based psychiatrists were more likely to report high anxiety, although not significantly, compared to hospital psychiatrists (18.1 vs. 9.6%, p=0.114). Risk factors for experiencing anxiety in both groups were feeling restricted (OR=5.52, p=0.025) and experienced risk of infection (OR=5.74, p=0.005). Exposure level, clinic or practice affiliation, age, gender, and other dimensions of threat experience and coping behavior had no influence. DISCUSSION: Psychiatrists in private practice felt more stressed and threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic compared with hospital-based colleagues. The experience of anxiety was dependent on feeling constrained and at risk of exposure, but not on exposure, protective equipment. Objective indicators seem to play less of an important role in the expression of anxiety than subjective experience.","Bohlken, Jens; Kostev, Karel; Bartels, Claudia; Wiltfang, Jens; Broschmann, Daniel; Lemke, Matthias; Lempert, Thomas; Michalowsky, Bernhard; Riedel-Heller, Steffi",Fortschr.

The present case series aims at reporting the spontaneous regression of some vocal fold polyps during the Italian lockdown for SARS-CoV2 pandemic. METHODS: 5 patients with voice complaints presenting to a tertiary referral center and diagnosed with vocal fold polyps before the lockdown were included. Because of the lockdown restrictive measures, planned elective surgical procedures were suspended. The patients were re-assessed immediately after lockdown. Multidimensional voice assessments were conducted before and after the lockdown period through laryngostroboscopies, perceptual voice evaluations, electroacoustic analysis and self assessments. RESULTS: The patients included in the present case series experienced a complete or nearly complete remission of symptoms. Videolaryngostroboscopies documented a complete or nearly complete regression of the polyps. Voices considerably improved both perceptually and electroacoustically. Self assessments showed a reduction of voice-related complaints.

However, COVID-19 is an emerging and evolving disease and each day brings in more data, new figures, and findings from the field of clinical practice. The role of hematologists has been increasingly recognized during the current pandemic because of several reasons. Most important of them are the characteristic hematological findings of COVID-19 patients that also have prognostic implications and that were not seen in other viral infections. The treatment of hematological complications in COVID-19 patients is very challenging given the critical care setting. There are interim and limited guidelines thus far due to the novelty of the disease. As this remains to be a quite fluid situation, all the appropriate medical societies including the major hematology bodies are proposing initial and interim guidelines (e.g. ASH guideline). This puts a hematologist on consult service in a dubious position where, he/she must tailor the recommendations on case to case basis.

The recovered class is denoted by [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] is the concentration of COVID-19 virus in the area. The computational study shows us that the spread will be continued for long time and the recovery reduces the infection rate.

Based on conditional value at risk (CoVaR) and single index model (SIM) quantile regression technique, we analyse the tail risk connectedness and find that during market crashes, stock market exposes to more systemic risk and more connectedness. Further, the orthogonal pulse function shows that Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of edges has a significant positive effect on systemic risk, but the impact shows a certain lagging feature. Besides, the directional connectedness of sectors shows that systemic risk receivers and transmitters vary across time, and we adopt PageRank index to identify systemically important sector released by utilities and financial sectors. Finally, by block model we find that the tail risk network of Chinese sectors can be divided into four different spillover function blocks. The role of blocks and the spatial spillover transmission path between risk blocks are time-varying. Our results provide useful and positive implications for market participants and policy makers dealing with investment diversification and tracing the paths of risk shock transmission.","Zhang, Weiping; Zhuang, Xintian; Wang, Jian; Lu, Yang",,234,9

Can certain messages shift attitudes toward masks? We investigate the effect of value-consistent messages within a mask-skeptical population: White evangelicals in the United States. An experiment within a national survey of White evangelicals (n = 1,212) assigned respondents to one of three conditions: One group was given a religious message equating mask use with loving your neighbor, another was given a message by Donald Trump saying mask use is patriotic, and a control group received no message. Those exposed to the religious message were more likely to see mask use as important and were more supportive of mask mandates. Republican evangelicals exposed to the patriotism message had similar responses. These findings show that messages that align with individuals’ core values—in this case, religious tenets and patriotism—can shift certain views on mask use and government mask policies to combat COVID-19, even among a comparatively mask-resistant group.","DeMora, Stephanie L.; Merolla, Jennifer L.; Newman, Brian; Zechmeister, Elizabeth J.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,234,1

In order to understand better eukaryotic viruses in the gut, this project focused on evaluating alternative methods to purify and concentrate viral particles, which do not involve the use of density gradients, for generating viral metagenome data. In this study, the sequence outcomes of three tissue processing methods have been evaluated and a data analysis pipeline has been established for RNA viruses from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, with the use of the best method and increased sequencing depth, a glimpse of the RNA viral community in the gastrointestinal tract of a clinically normal 5-week old turkey is presented. The viruses from the Reoviridae and Astroviridae families together accounted for 76.3% of total viruses identified. The rarefaction curve at the species level further indicated that majority of the species diversity was included with the increased sequencing depth, implying that viruses from other viral families were present in very low abundance.","Shah, Jigna D.; Baller, Joshua; Zhang, Ying; Silverstein, Kevin; Xing, Zheng; Cardona, Carol J.",Journal of Virological Methods,234,16

The objectives of this work were to characterise the kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) concentration in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and the antibody response in patients with (D(+)) and without (D(-)) dexamethasone treatment. METHODS: Data and biosamples from hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19, enrolled between March 4(th) and December 11(th), 2020, in a prospective observational study, were analysed. SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration in serial URT samples was measured using RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2-specific Immunoglobulin A and G (IgA and IgG) were measured in serum samples using S1-ELISA. RESULTS: We compared 101 immunocompetent patients who received dexamethasone according to the inclusion criteria and dosage determined in the RECOVERY trial to 93 immunocompetent patients with comparable disease severity from the first months of the pandemic, who had not been treated with dexamethasone or other glucocorticoids. We found no inter-group differences in virus concentration kinetics, duration of presence of viral loads >10(6) viral copies/mL (D(+): median 17 days (IQR 13-24), D(-): 19 days (IQR 13-29)), or time from symptom onset until seroconversion (IgA: D(+): median 11.5 days (IQR 11-12), D(-): 14 days (IQR 11.5-15.75); IgG: D(+): 13 days (IQR 12-14.5), D(-): 12 days (IQR 11-15)).

A scoping review has the objective to review the information available in pregnant women infected with the MERS-CoV, SARSCoV, SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses to assess the similarities in terms of and differences in the clinical characteristics of the mothers and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: We carried out a bibliographic search (scoping review) according to the PRISMA guidelines between March and April 2020 in the MEDLINE, SciELO, and CUIDEN databases and the Elsevier COVID-19 Information Center. RESULTS: We analyzed 20 articles with a total of 102 cases.9 of MERS-CoV, 14 of SARS-CoV and 79 of SARS-CoV-2. Fever (75.5%) and pneumonia (73.5%) were the most frequent symptoms in infected pregnant women. The most frequent obstetric complications were the threat of premature delivery (23.5%) and caesarean section (74.5%). No vertical transmission was documented in any of the infants. CONCLUSIONS: All three coronaviruses produce pneumonia with very similar symptoms, being milder in the case of SARSCoV2. Despite documented obstetric complications, neonatal outcomes are mostly favorable. Increased knowledge is needed to improve and prevent obstetric and neonatal complications from these infections in pregnant women.","Rodríguez-Blanco, Noelia; Vegara-Lopez, Irene; Aleo-Giner, Loreto; Tuells, José",Rev Esp Quimioter,234,16

Indigenous populations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States experience greater health inequities than non-Indigenous populations. There is increasing support for Indigenous-governed and culturally accessible primary health care services which meet the needs of Indigenous populations. There is some support for primary health care mobile clinics implemented specifically for Indigenous populations to improve health service accessibility. The purpose of this review is to scope the literature for evidence of mobile primary health care clinics implemented specifically for Indigenous populations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. METHODS: This review was undertaken using the Joanna Brigg Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology. Review objectives, inclusion criteria and methods were specified in advance and documented in a published protocol. The search included five academic databases and an extensive search of the grey literature. RESULTS: The search resulted in 1350 unique citations, with 91 of these citations retrieved from the grey literature and targeted organisational websites. Title, abstract and full-text screening was conducted independently by two reviewers, with 123 citations undergoing full text review. Of these, 39 citations discussing 25 mobile clinics, met the inclusion criteria. An additional 14 citations were snowballed from a review of the reference lists of included citations. Of these 25 mobile clinics, the majority were implemented in Australia (n = 14), followed by United States (n = 6) and Canada (n = 5). No primary health mobile clinics specifically for Indigenous people in New Zealand were retrieved. There was a pattern of declining locations serviced by mobile clinics with an increasing population. Furthermore, only 13 mobile clinics had some form of evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: This review identifies geographical gaps in the implementation of primary health care mobile clinics for Indigenous populations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. There is a paucity of evaluations supporting the use of mobile clinics for Indigenous populations and a need for organisations implementing mobile clinics specifically for Indigenous populations to share their experiences. Engaging with the perspectives of Indigenous people accessing mobile clinic services is imperative to future evaluations.

Majority of studies center around its epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Information regarding secondary bacterial infections is limited. This retrospective observational study was done to determine the prevalence and characteristics of bloodstream infections in COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary care center in Jaipur. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All blood cultures received from COVID-19 positive patients admitted in designated COVID care ICUs and wards were included in the study. A predesigned pretested questionnaire was used to collect relevant data. Blood cultures were done using BD BACTEC™ FX40, and identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates were done by VITEK® 2 COMPACT. RESULTS: One thousand five hundred seventy-eight (1578) COVID-19 positive patients were admitted in center during 5-month study period from whom 158 blood cultures were received. Out of these, 15 (9.4%) were positive. Median age of patients with positive blood culture was 54 years and included 10 males and 5 females. Ten (67%) patients needed intensive care in ICU. Significant correlation of blood culture positivity was found with parameters like ICU admission, presence of an indwelling device, underlying comorbidity, raised biochemical markers, and adverse clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of bloodstream infections is low for COVID-19 patients. Antibiotic prophylaxis needs to be used with caution, and prompt discontinuation should be done based on clinical judgment.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield of bacteriological tests, including blood and sputum cultures, and the association of multiple biomarkers and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) with clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This is a substudy of a large observational cohort study (PredictED study). The PredictED included adult patients from whom a blood culture was drawn at the ED of Haga Teaching Hospital, The Netherlands. For this substudy, all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in March and April 2020 were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of bacterial coinfection. We used logistic regression analysis for associations of procalcitonin, C reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lymphocyte count and PSI score with a severe disease course, defined as intensive care unit admission and/or 30-day mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) quantified the discriminatory performance. RESULTS: We included 142 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. On presentation, the median duration of symptoms was 8 days. 41 (29%) patients had a severe disease course and 24 (17%) died within 30 days. The incidence of bacterial coinfection was 2/142 (1.4%). None of the blood cultures showed pathogen growth while 6.3% was contaminated. The AUCs for predicting severe disease were 0.76 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.84), 0.70 (0.61 to 0.79), 0.62 (0.51 to 0.74), 0.62 (0.51 to 0.72) and 0.72 (0.63 to 0.81) for procalcitonin, CRP, ferritin, lymphocyte count and PSI score, respectively. CONCLUSION: Blood cultures appear to have limited value while procalcitonin and the PSI appear to be promising tools in helping physicians identify patients at risk for severe disease course in COVID-19 at presentation to the ED.","Kaal, Anna; Snel, Lars; Dane, Martijn; van Burgel, Nathalie; Ottens, Thomas; Broekman, Winifred; el Bouazzaoui, Lahssan; Kolfschoten, Nikki; Schippers, Emile; Steyerberg, Ewout; Meziyerh, Soufian; van Nieuwkoop, Cees",Emerg Med J,234,3

Using the vector autoregression (VAR) model, this study analyzes the impact of urbanization on pollution-related agricultural input intensity in Hubei, China. Results of an impulse response function analysis reveal that pesticide use intensity continues to rise following shocks from the urban population proportion and the secondary and tertiary industry proportion. Responses of chemical fertilizer intensity first decrease and then increase subjected to the shocks from the urban population proportion and secondary and tertiary industry proportion. The intensity of agricultural plastic film use first increases and then decreases when receives the shocks from the urban population proportion which is the opposite to the response to the shock from the secondary and tertiary industry proportion. In addition, the responses of pesticide use intensity, chemical fertilizer use intensity and agricultural plastic film use intensity trend decrease following their own shocks after positive initial responses. The variance decomposition results demonstrate that the shocks due to pesticide use intensity, chemical fertilizer use intensity and agricultural plastic film use intensity generally explain the largest proportion of their own variation over the 10-year horizon. However, an increase in the urban population proportion plays a critical role in determining the variations of pesticide use intensity in late periods, it account for 56.88% the variations in the tenth period. And the contribution of the urban population proportion to the variations in agricultural plastic film use intensity increases consistently, it account for 33.74% of the variations in the tenth period. Therefore, the hidden drivers of these phenomena need to be further understood regarding the relationships between urbanization and diffuse pollution from agricultural production.","You, Heyuan",Ecol Indic,234,27

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study in a pediatric emergency department of 265 infants aged 2 to 23 months with radiographs showing either airway disease only (simple bronchiolitis), airway and airspace disease (complex bronchiolitis), and inconsistent diagnoses (eg, lobar consolidation). RESULTS: The rate of inconsistent radiographs was 2 of 265 cases (0.75%; 95% CI 0-1.8). A total of 246 children (92.8%) had simple radiographs, and 17 radiographs (6.9%) were complex. To identify 1 inconsistent and 1 complex radiograph requires imaging 133 and 15 children, respectively. Of 148 infants with oxygen saturation >92% and a respiratory disease assessment score <10 of 17 points, 143 (96.6%) had a simple radiograph, compared with 102 of 117 infants (87.2%) with higher scores or lower saturation (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.3-14.3). Seven infants (2.6%) were identified for antibiotics pre-radiography; 39 infants (14.7%) received antibiotics post-radiography (95% CI, 8-16). CONCLUSIONS: Infants with typical bronchiolitis do not need imaging because it is almost always consistent with bronchiolitis. Risk of airspace disease appears particularly low in children with saturation higher than 92% and mild to moderate distress.","Schuh, Suzanne; Lalani, Amina; Allen, Upton; Manson, David; Babyn, Paul; Stephens, Derek; MacPhee, Shannon; Mokanski, Matthew; Khaikin, Svetlana; Dick, Paul",J Pediatr,234,12

We find establishments paying the lowest average wages and the lowest wage workers had the steepest decline in employment and experienced the most persistent losses. We disentangle the extent to which the effect observed for low wage workers is due to these workers being concentrated within a few low wage sectors of the economy versus the pandemic affecting low wage workers in a number of sectors across the economy. Our results indicate that the experience of low wage workers is not entirely due to these workers being concentrated in low wage sectors — for many sectors, the lowest wage quintiles in that sector also has had the worst employment outcomes. From April 2020 to May 2021, between 23% and 46% of the decline in employment among the lowest wage establishments was due to within-industry changes. Another important finding is that even for those who remain employed during the pandemic, the probability of becoming part-time for economic reasons increased, especially for low-wage workers.

Therefore, establishing a healthy and active lifestyle during childhood is even more important for individuals with a disability. However, the factors that influence habitual PA in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy remain unknown. The present protocol outlines a prospective cohort study with the aim of investigating potential predictors of habitual PA in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy in order to provide evidence for optimising PA levels and associated overall health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective cohort study will enrol participants with cerebral palsy between the ages of 8 and 15 years at Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I–III. Using a modified version of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health model as a conceptual analytical framework, the analysis will be divided into six components and will provide predictors for habitual PA measured by accelerometry. The potential predictive variables are registry data on physical function (Danish Cerebral Palsy Follow-Up Programme); validated proxy-reported questionnaires on quality of life (Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory), overall health, pain and participation in daily activities (Paediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument) and supplementary questions regarding sleep, screen time and socioeconomic status.

As an early intervention for axial-length-related myopia, correcting lenses have been developed (such as Defocus Incorporated Multiple Segment (DIMS) lenses), which have been shown to be effective in slowing myopia progression. Beyond this direct effect, however, it is not known whether such lenses also affect other aspects important to the wearer, such as eye fatigue, and how such effects may differ across age, as these lenses so far are typically only tested with adolescents. In the present work, we therefore investigated perceived fatigue levels according to lens type (normal vs DIMS) and age (adolescents vs adults) in a demanding visual search task (“Finding Wally”) at two difficulty levels (easy vs difficult). Whereas age and difficulty did not result in significant differences in eye fatigue, we found a clear reduction of fatigue levels in both age groups when wearing the correcting lenses. Hence, the additional accommodation of these lens types may result in less strain in a task requiring sustained eye movements at near viewing distances.","Ryu, Hyeongsuk; Ju, Uijong; Wallraven, Christian",PLoS One,234,24

The specificity and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are known to vary and very few studies have addressed the performance of these tests in COVID-19 patient groups at different time points. We here compared the sensitivity and specificity of seven commercial (SNIBE, Epitope, Euroimmun, Roche, Abbott, DiaSorin, Biosensor) and two in-house LIPS assays (LIPS N and LIPS S-RBD) IgG/total Ab tests in serum samples from 97 COVID-19 patients and 100 controls, and correlated the results with the patients’ clinical data and the time-point the test was performed. We found a remarkable variation in the sensitivity of antibody tests with the following performance: LIPS N (91.8%), Epitope (85.6%), Abbott and in-house LIPS S-RBD (both 84.5%), Roche (83.5%), Euroimmun (82.5%), DiaSorin (81.4%), SNIBE (70.1%), and Biosensor (64.9%). The overall agreement between the tests was between 71–95%, whereas the specificity of all tests was within 98–100%. The correlation with patients’ clinical symptoms score ranged from strongest in LIPS N (ρ = 0.41; p<0.001) to nonsignificant in LIPS S-RBD. Furthermore, the time of testing since symptom onset had an impact on the sensitivity of some tests. Our study highlights the importance to consider clinical symptoms, time of testing, and using more than one viral antigen in SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Our results suggest that some antibody tests are more sensitive for the detection of antibodies in early stage and asymptomatic patients, which may explain the contradictory results of previous studies and should be taken into consideration in clinical practice and epidemiological studies.","Naaber, Paul; Hunt, Kaidi; Pesukova, Jaana; Haljasmägi, Liis; Rumm, Pauliina; Peterson, Pärt; Hololejenko, Jelena; Eero, Irina; Jõgi, Piia; Toompere, Karolin; Sepp, Epp",PLoS One,234,24

To evaluate their post-pandemic environmental impacts, five categories of drugs were detected in lakes and WWTP-river-estuary system near hospitals of Jinyintan, Huoshenshan and Leishenshan in the three regions (J, H and L) (Regions J, H and L) in Wuhan, China. The total amount of PPCPs (ranging from 2.61 to 1122 ng/L in water and 0.11 to 164 ng/g dry weight in sediments) were comparable to historical reports in Yangtze River basin, whereas the detection frequency and concentrations of ribavirin and azithromycin were higher than those of historical studies. The distribution of concerned drugs varied with space, season, media and water types: sampling sites located at WWTPs-river-estuary system around two hospitals (Regions L and J) usually had relatively high waterborne contamination levels, most of which declined in autumn; lakes had relatively low waterborne contamination levels in summer but increased in autumn. The potential risks of detected PPCPs were further evaluated using the multiple-level ecological risk assessment (MLERA): sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin were found to pose potential risks to aquatic organisms according to a semi-probabilistic approach and classified as priority pollutants based on an optimized risk assessment. In general, the COVID-19 pandemic did not cause serious pollution in lakes and WWTPs-river-estuary system in Wuhan City. However, the increased occurrence of certain drugs and their potential ecological risks need further attention.

We aimed to evaluate overall and variant-specific effectiveness of BNT162b2 (tozinameran, Pfizer–BioNTech) against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions by time since vaccination among members of a large US health-care system. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed electronic health records of individuals (≥12 years) who were members of the health-care organisation Kaiser Permanente Southern California (CA, USA), to assess BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions for up to 6 months. Participants were required to have 1 year or more previous membership of the organisation. Outcomes comprised SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tests and COVID-19-related hospital admissions. Effectiveness calculations were based on hazard ratios from adjusted Cox models. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04848584. FINDINGS: Between Dec 14, 2020, and Aug 8, 2021, of 4 920 549 individuals assessed for eligibility, we included 3 436 957 (median age 45 years [IQR 29–61]; 1 799 395 [52·4%] female and 1 637 394 [47·6%] male). For fully vaccinated individuals, effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections was 73% (95% CI 72–74) and against COVID-19-related hospital admissions was 90% (89–92). Effectiveness against infections declined from 88% (95% CI 86–89) during the first month after full vaccination to 47% (43–51) after 5 months. Among sequenced infections, vaccine effectiveness against infections of the delta variant was high during the first month after full vaccination (93% [95% CI 85–97]) but declined to 53% [39–65] after 4 months. Effectiveness against other (non-delta) variants the first month after full vaccination was also high at 97% (95% CI 95–99), but waned to 67% (45–80) at 4–5 months. Vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions for infections with the delta variant for all ages was high overall (93% [95% CI 84–96]) up to 6 months. INTERPRETATION: Our results provide support for high effectiveness of BNT162b2 against hospital admissions up until around 6 months after being fully vaccinated, even in the face of widespread dissemination of the delta variant. Reduction in vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections over time is probably primarily due to waning immunity with time rather than the delta variant escaping vaccine protection.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of adults tested for SARS-CoV-2 at a tertiary healthcare system. Cognitive impairment was identified utilizing diagnosis codes (mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, vascular, and other dementias) or cognitive impairment-specific medication use. Propensity score (PS) matched analyses were utilized to report odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for association of cognitive impairment with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 mortality. Results: Between March-3rd and December-11th, 2020, 179,979 adults were tested, of whom 21,607 (12.0%) tested positive. We identified 6,364 individuals with preexisting cognitive impairment (mean age: 78.5 years, 56.8% females), among whom 843 (13.2%) tested positive and 139 (19.5%) of those hospitalized died. In the pre-PS matched cohort, cognitive impairment was significantly associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility (OR, CI: 1.12, 1.04–1.21) and COVID-19 mortality (OR, CI: 2.54, 2.07–3.12). One-to-one matches were identified for 6,192 of 6,364 (97.3%) individuals with prior cognitive impairment and 687 of 712 (96.5%) hospitalized patients with prior cognitive impairment. In the fully balanced post-matched cohort, preexisting cognitive impairment was significantly associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR, CI: 1.51, 1.35–1.70); however, cognitive impairment did not confer higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR, CI: 0.96, 0.73–1.25). Discussion: To mitigate the effects of healthcare catastrophes such as the COVID-19 pandemic, strategies for targeted prevention and risk-stratified comorbidity management are warranted among the vulnerable sub-population living with cognitive impairment.","Pan, Alan P.; Meeks, Jennifer; Potter, Thomas; Masdeu, Joseph C.; Seshadri, Sudha; Smith, Matthew Lee; Ory, Marcia G.; Vahidy, Farhaan S.",Front Neurol,234,29

Adverse event monitoring is essential in phase I trials to assess toxicity and safety. In phase II, the focus is also on efficacy but robust data on adverse events continue to inform the safety and the adverse event profile. Standard, clinician-led monitoring has been shown to underestimate patients’ symptoms. Hence, patient-reported adverse event monitoring has been argued to complement and improve the information on adverse events in early phase clinical trials. With advances in information technology, real-time patient self-reported adverse events in trials are feasible. This study explored the experiences and procedures for reporting adverse events in early phase trials among patients, clinical staff, and trial staff, and their views on using an electronic patient-reported outcome adverse event system in this setting. METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients, purposively sampled across ages, gender, and different phases of trials, and with clinical and trial-related staff involved in early phase trials (e.g. consultants, research nurses, hospital-based trial assistants/data managers, trial unit management staff). Interviews explored patient experiences and views on current adverse event reporting processes and electronic patient-reported outcome adverse event reporting. Framework analysis techniques were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Interviewees were from two hospital trusts with early phase portfolios in England and a trial unit, and included sixteen patients, five consultants, four research nurses, five hospital-based trial staff, and two trial unit staff. Interviews identified three key themes (patient experiences, data flow, and views on electronic patient-reported outcome adverse event reporting). Stakeholders emphasised the intensity of trials for patients and the importance of extensive information provision within the uncertainty of early phase trial drugs. Regular face-to-face appointments for patients supplemented by telephone contact aimed to capture any adverse events. Delayed or under-reporting of mild- or low-severity symptoms was evident among patients. Hospital-based staff highlighted the challenges of current data collection including intense timescales, monitoring by trial sponsors, and high workload. Positive views on electronic patient-reported outcome adverse events highlighted that this could provide a more comprehensive and accurate view on the side effects of new drugs. Clinical staff emphasised patient safety and the need for clear responsibilities for monitoring. The need for careful decision-making about data flow and symptom attribution was highlighted; with trial unit staff emphasising the need for clinician review. CONCLUSION: Technology advances mean it is timely to explore the benefits and challenges of electronic patient-reported outcome adverse event reporting. This is a complex area warranting further consideration within the trial community. We have developed an online patient self-reporting tool and a small pilot with early phase trial patients is underway.","Kennedy, Fiona; Shearsmith, Leanne; Ayres, Michael; Lindner, Oana C; Marston, Lewis; Pass, Alison; Danson, Sarah; Velikova, Galina",Clin Trials,234,20

Therapeutic implementation of these antibodies has been challenged by emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutated spike versions. Consequently, re-assessment of previously identified mAbs is of high priority. Four previously selected mAbs targeting non-overlapping epitopes are now evaluated for binding potency to mutated RBD versions, reported to mediate escape from antibody neutralization. In vitro neutralization potencies of these mAbs, and two NTD-specific mAbs, are evaluated against two frequent SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, the B.1.1.7 Alpha, and the B.1.351 Beta. Furthermore, we demonstrate therapeutic potential of three selected mAbs by treatment of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice two days post infection with each virus variant. Thus, despite the accumulation of spike mutations, the highly potent MD65 and BL6 mAbs retain their ability to bind the prevalent viral mutants, effectively protecting against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.","Makdasi, Efi; Zvi, Anat; Alcalay, Ron; Noy-Porat, Tal; Peretz, Eldar; Mechaly, Adva; Levy, Yinon; Epstein, Eyal; Chitlaru, Theodor; Tennenhouse, Ariel; Aftalion, Moshe; Gur, David; Paran, Nir; Tamir, Hadas; Zimhony, Oren; Weiss, Shay; Mandelboim, Michal; Mendelson, Ella; Zuckerman, Neta; Nemet, Ital; Kliker, Limor; Yitzhaki, Shmuel; Shapira, Shmuel C.; Israely, Tomer; Fleishman, Sarel J.; Mazor, Ohad; Rosenfeld, Ronit",Cell Rep,234,19

The position paper describes the management of cancer patients, especially those receiving anticancer treatment, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dyspnea is a common emergency presentation in patients with cancer with a wide range of differential diagnoses, including pulmonary embolism, pleural disease, lymphangitis, and infection, of which SARS-CoV-2 is now a pathogen to be considered. Screening interviews to determine whether patients may be infected with COVID-19 are imperative to prevent the spread of infection, especially within healthcare facilities. Cancer patients testing positive with no or minimal symptoms may be monitored from home. Telemedicine is an option to aid in following patients without potential exposure. Management of complications of systemic anticancer treatment, such as febrile neutropenia (FN), is of particular importance during the COVID-19 pandemic where clinicians aim to minimize patients’ risk of infection and need for hospital visits. Outpatient management of patients with low-risk FN is a safe and effective strategy. Although the MASCC score has not been validated in patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2, it has nevertheless performed well in patients with a range of infective illnesses and, accordingly, it is reasonable to expect efficacy in the clinical setting of COVID-19. Risk stratification of patients presenting with FN is a vital tenet of the evolving sepsis and pandemic strategy, necessitating access to locally formulated services based on MASCC and other national and international guidelines. Innovative oncology services will need to utilize telemedicine, hospital at home, and ambulatory care services approaches not only to limit the number of hospital visits but also to anticipate the complications of the anticancer treatments.","Cooksley, Tim; Font, Carme; Scotte, Florian; Escalante, Carmen; Johnson, Leslie; Anderson, Ronald; Rapoport, Bernardo",Support Care Cancer,234,26

Access to social media in low- and middle-income countries has increased exponentially in recent years due to technological advances. Despite this growth, the use of social media in low- and middle-income countries is less well-researched than in high-income countries. OBJECTIVE: To identify, explore and summarize the current state of the literature on the use of social media for health in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted on literature available to December 2017. Six databases were searched, and grey literature was identified through the Google and Google Scholar search engines. Literature was considered for inclusion if it (1) was published in English, (2) was conducted in or in relation to a low or middle-income country, (3) reported on as least one type of social media or social media use generally for health purposes, and (4) reported on at least one aspect of human health. Content analysis was performed to identify themes. RESULTS: Forty articles met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-one were research articles, and nine were review/discussion/descriptive and evaluative reports. Since 2010, when the first article was published, most of the literature has focused on Asian (n = 15) and African (n = 12) countries. Twitter (n = 11) and Facebook (n = 10) were the most frequently discussed individual social media platforms. Four themes were identified: (1) use for health education and influence (sub-themes were health behaviour and health education); (2) use within infectious disease and outbreak situations; (3) use within natural disaster, terrorism, crisis and emergency response situations; and (4) producers and consumers of social media for health (sub-themes were misinformation, organizational challenges, users’ expectations, and challenges of unique sub-populations). Most studies addressed more than one theme. CONCLUSION: Social media has the ability to facilitate disease surveillance, mass communication, health education, knowledge translation, and collaboration amongst health providers in low- and middle-income countries. Misinformation or poorly communicated information can contribute to negative health behaviours and adverse health outcomes amongst consumers, as well as hysteria and chaos. Organizations using social media should provide accurate and readable information. Promotion of credible social media sites by governments, health care professionals and researchers, as well as education on the appropriate use of social media, could help to lessen the effect of misinformation. This is a nascent body of literature and future research should investigate the relative effectiveness of various platforms for different users, other potential uses, and pursue a broader geographical focus.","Hagg, Emily; Dahinten, V.

To fill the data gap for vaccine immunogenicity in NH residents, we examined antibody levels after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to spike, receptor binding domain (RBD) and for virus neutralization in 149 NH residents and 111 health care worker controls. SARS-CoV-2-naive NH residents mount antibody responses with nearly 4-fold lower median neutralization titers and half the anti-spike level compared to SARS-CoV-2-naive healthcare workers. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2-recovered vaccinated NH residents had neutralization, anti-spike and anti-RBD titers similar to SARS-CoV-2-recovered vaccinated healthcare workers. NH residents’ blunted antibody responses have important implications regarding the quality and durability of protection afforded by neoantigen vaccines.

However, the significant potential health and societal costs of poor mental health in relation to air quality are not represented in the WHO report due to limited evidence. We aimed to test the hypothesis that long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with poor mental health. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal population-based mental health survey was conducted of 1698 adults living in 1075 households in South East London, from 2008 to 2013. High-resolution quarterly average air pollution concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and oxides (NO(x)), ozone (O(3)), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 10 μm (PM(10)) and < 2.5 μm (PM(2.5)) were linked to the home addresses of the study participants. Associations with mental health were analysed with the use of multilevel generalised linear models, after adjusting for large number of confounders, including the individuals’ socioeconomic position and exposure to road-traffic noise. RESULTS: We found robust evidence for interquartile range increases in PM(2.5), NO(x) and NO(2) to be associated with 18–39% increased odds of common mental disorders, 19–30% increased odds of poor physical symptoms and 33% of psychotic experiences only for PM(10). These longitudinal associations were more pronounced in the subset of non-movers for NO(2) and NO(x). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that traffic-related air pollution is adversely affecting mental health. Whilst causation cannot be proved, this work suggests substantial morbidity from mental disorders could be avoided with improved air quality.

This exploratory study utilized a community-based participatory research approach to investigate barriers and facilitators to promoting resilience to HIV/AIDS, specifically among racial and ethnic minority, middle-aged and older MSMLWH, a population that continues to be significantly impacted by HIV/AIDS today. This collaborative, qualitative study recruited participants who identified as racial or ethnic minority MSMLWH, were aged 40 or older, and resided in Ontario, Canada. Participants (n = 24) discussed in their interviews barriers and facilitators to promoting resilience to HIV/AIDS, which they recognized from their lived experiences. Utilizing thematic analysis, themes related to barriers and facilitators to promoting resilience to HIV/AIDS were identified. Themes related to identified barriers included: (1) language proficiency, (2) racism, (3) pernicious norms in North American gay culture, and (4) HIV stigma. Themes related to identified facilitators included: (1) compartmentalization, (2) perseverance, and (3) community-based health and social services.

The global outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 has been an international public health threat. Quick diagnostic tests and specific treatments for SARS are not yet available; thus, prevention is of paramount importance to contain its global spread. This study aimed to determine factors associating with individuals' practice of the target SARS preventive behavior (facemask wearing). Methods. A total of 1329 adult Chinese residing in Hong Kong were surveyed. The survey instrument included demographic data, measures on the five components of the Health Belief Model, and the practice of the target SARS preventive behavior. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine rates and predictors of facemask wearing. Results. Overall, 61.2% of the respondents reported consistent use of facemasks to prevent SARS. Women, the 50–59 age group, and married respondents were more likely to wear facemasks. Three of the five components of the Health Belief Model, namely, perceived susceptibility, cues to action, and perceived benefits, were significant predictors of facemask-wearing even after considering effects of demographic characteristics. Conclusions. The Health Belief Model is useful in identifying determinants of facemask wearing. Findings have significant implications in enhancing the effectiveness of SARS prevention programs.","Tang, Catherine So-kum; Wong, Chi-yan",Prev Med,234,15

While only a few in vitro studies have pointed to some efficacy of these drugs as a prophylactic against COVID-19, to date, there are no clinical studies that have established any clinical efficacy of these drugs as a prophylactic. These drugs are commonly used for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) because of its immunomodulatory effects. Previously, we have evaluated the genetic toxicology of different drugs and chemicals including antimalarial drug CQ both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we recognize the need to critically review the mutagenic, genotoxic, and immunomodulatory effects of these drugs, to find out whether it is safe to use as a prophylactic drug against COVID-19. Existing literature suggests that CQ can induce mutagenic and genotoxic effects in multiple test systems and both the drugs have immunomodulatory effects. There was no data available to evaluate the mutagenicity and genotoxicity for HCQ. However, during metabolism about 60% of both the drugs remain unchanged and about 40% of the drugs are metabolized into two metabolites, desethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine by the action of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the liver. Both HCQ and CQ are immunomodulatory drugs and have the potential to suppress normal immune system activation. In this review, we have elucidated the mechanism of immunomodulation by both HCQ and CQ and highlighted the mutagenic and genotoxic effects from the available literature. This article is written with the sole objective that the reader will be able to recognize the adverse effects of these drugs when consumed by healthy individuals as a prophylactic.

Significant health-related lifestyle changes are often difficult to implement and functional ingredients that can reduce glycaemic and insulaemic responses may help at risk populations. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a mulberry leaf extract could lower the glycaemic and insulinaemic responses to 75 g sucrose in healthy individuals. METHODS: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover design trial was conducted by the Oxford Brookes Centre for Nutrition and Health. Thirty-eight participants were recruited into the trial and, after an overnight fast, were given 75 g sucrose + white mulberry leaf extract, or 75 g sucrose alone. Capillary blood samples were collected at 15-min intervals in the first hour and at 30-min intervals over the second hour to determine glucose and plasma insulin levels. Data analysis was conducted using a paired samples T test or a Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: The addition of mulberry leaf extract to sucrose resulted in a significantly lower glycaemic response and insulinaemic response compared to a matched placebo (sucrose alone). The change in blood glucose measurements were significantly lower at 15 min (p < 0.001), 30 min (p < 0.001), 45 min (p = 0.008), and 120 min (p < 0.001) and plasma insulin measurements were significantly lower at 15 min (p < 0.001), 30 min (p < 0.001), 45 min (p < 0.001), 60 min (p = 0.001) and 120 min (p < 0.001).

Unlike pre‐HCT detection of other respiratory viruses, it is not known whether RV detection, with or without clinical symptoms, is associated with worse outcomes in children post‐HCT. In a retrospective study of children undergoing allogeneic HCT from January 2009 to February 2015, 91 children underwent allogeneic HCT, and 62 children had RPP testing within 30 days pre‐HCT. Fifty‐six (90%) children had either no pathogen (n = 34, 55%) or single RV detection (n = 22, 35%), which was the most common pathogen identified. Compared with virus negative children, children with pre‐HCT RV detection were not more likely to require ventilated support and did not have longer length of stay, higher mortality, or less days alive and out of the hospital within the first 100 days post‐HCT. In a secondary analysis of all 56 patients with RPP testing and no pathogen or RV alone detected, the seven children with LRTI had less days alive and out of the hospital within the first 100 days post‐HCT compared with the 49 children who were either asymptomatic or had URTI (10 vs 60 days, P = 0.002). In a bootstrapped regression model, presence of LRTI, not RV detection, was significantly associated with decreased days alive and out of the hospital within the first 100 days post‐HCT. Thus, pre‐HCT detection of RV, without associated LRTI, does not always warrant HCT delay.","Mowrer, Clayton; Lee, Brian R.; Goyal, Rakesh; Selvarangan, Rangaraj; Schuster, Jennifer E.",Pediatr Transplant,234,1

Unlike RT-qPCR, SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Sequencing (cWGS) has the added advantage of identifying cryptic origins of the virus, and the extent of community-based transmissions versus new viral introductions, which can in turn influence public health policy decisions. However, practical and cost considerations of cWGS should be addressed before it can be widely implemented. Methods We performed shotgun transcriptome sequencing using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19, and compared it to targeted SARS-CoV-2 full genome amplification and sequencing with respect to virus detection, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. To track virus origin, we used open-source multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tools to compare the assembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes to publicly available sequences. Results We show a significant improvement in whole genome sequencing data quality and viral detection using amplicon-based target enrichment of SARS-CoV-2. With enrichment, more than 99% of the sequencing reads mapped to the viral genome compared to an average of 0.63% without enrichment. Consequently, a dramatic increase in genome coverage was obtained using significantly less sequencing data, enabling higher scalability and significant cost reductions. We also demonstrate how SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences can be used to determine their possible origin through phylogenetic analysis including other viral strains. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is a practical, cost-effective, and powerful approach for population-based surveillance and control of viral transmission in the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Harilal, Divinlal; Ramaswamy, Sathishkumar; Loney, Tom; Suwaidi, Hanan Al; Khansaheb, Hamda; Alkhaja, Abdulmajeed; Varghese, Rupa; Deesi, Zulfa; Nowotny, Norbert; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi; Tayoun, Ahmad Abou",bioRxiv,234,24

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic test- or symptom-based guidelines. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of Vidant Health system, Eastern North Carolina, was conducted. Length of stay, days in isolation unit, and date appropriate for discharge or isolation discontinuation based on the symptom-based strategy were recorded. RESULTS: Of 196 COVID hospitalized patients, 34 had repeated COVID PCR tests 3 or more days from their first positive test result. Half of these patients experienced delays in release from transmission-based precautions because of repeated positive PCR test results and use of the test-based approach. This resulted in an additional 166 days of hospitalization, costing an estimated $415,000. Furthermore, 2 subjects had a combined 16-day delay in necessary medical procedures. Most of the COVID PCR platforms yield quantitative results in the form of cycle threshold (Ct) values, the number of cycles needed to detect the genome. These values have also been used to assess whether patients are likely to remain contagious. None of our patients who met the criteria for symptom-based strategy for transmission-based precaution discontinuation had positive PCR test results with Ct values lower than 25, but 4 had Ct values lower than 30. CONCLUSIONS: Concerns surround immunocompromised patients and those treated with steroids who might be delayed or incapable of stopping viral replication and thus remain contagious. Our results suggest that clinicians use all available data including Ct values to evaluate the safety of discontinuation of transmission precautions.","Jiwani, Rahim A.; Mao, Yuxuan; Pona, Adrian; Bradner, Evan; Hussain, Jaffer; Stalls, J.

Such models only require a small number of parameters to describe epidemic growth patterns. They can be expressed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the type [Formula: see text] for [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , where [Formula: see text] is time, [Formula: see text] is the total size of the epidemic (the cumulative number of cases) at time [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] is the initial number of cases, [Formula: see text] is a model-specific incidence function, and [Formula: see text] is a vector of parameters. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a scenario for which such models are of obvious importance. In Bürger et al. (2019) it is demonstrated that some PGMs are better at fitting data of specific epidemic outbreaks than others even when the models have the same number of parameters. This situation motivates the need to measure differences in the dynamics that two different models are capable of generating. The present work contributes to a systematic study of differences between PGMs and how these may explain the ability of certain models to provide a better fit to data than others. To this end a so-called empirical directed distance (EDD) is defined to describe the differences in the dynamics between different dynamic models. The EDD of one PGM from another one quantifies how well the former fits data generated by the latter. The concept of EDD is, however, not symmetric in the usual sense of metric spaces. The procedure of calculating EDDs is applied to synthetic data and real data from influenza, Ebola, and COVID-19 outbreaks.","Bürger, Raimund; Chowell, Gerardo; Lara-Díaz, Leidy Yissedt",Math Biosci,234,26

Studies on virus structure, receptor utilization and mechanisms of entry have led to new insights into how these viruses interact in an active way with cells to ensure the nuclear delivery and expression of their genomes. Critical work on virus entry has led to the discovery of a pH neutral endocytic compartment that accepts cargo from caveolae and to novel roles for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated factors in virus uncoating and penetration of ER membranes. This review will summarize the major findings and compare and contrast the mechanisms used by these viruses to infect cells.","Neu, Ursula; Stehle, Thilo; Atwood, Walter J.",Virology,234,17

Methods: Retrospective study including consecutive patients admitted to an onco-hematology intensive care unit (ICU) for severe COVID-19. Replication of EBV, CMV, and HSV was evaluated. Competing risk analyses were used to assess the cumulative risk of viral reactivation, and time-dependent Cox and Fine and Gray models to assess risk factors for viral reactivation. Results: Among 100 patients, 38 were immunocompromised. Sixty-three patients presented viral reactivation (12% for HSV, 58% EBV and 19% CMV). Symptomatic patients received treatment. Overall cumulative incidence of viral reactivation was 56.1% [55.9-56.4] at 10 days. After adjustment, a preexisting hematological malignancy (sHR [95%CI]=0.31 [0.11-0.85]) and solid organ transplantation (sHR [95% CI]=2.09 [1.13-3.87]) remained independently associated with viral reactivation. Viral reactivation (P=0.34) was not associated with mortality. Conclusions: Incidence of herpesvirus reactivation in patients admitted to the ICU for severe COVID-19 was high, but rarely required antiviral treatment.","Saade, A; Moratelli, G; Azoulay, E; Darmon, M",Infect Dis Now,234,21

As one moves forward with different methods to reduce the infection and mortality rates, it is critical to continue to study the impact that national and local “social distancing” policies have on the daily lives of individuals. The aim of this study was to examine loneliness in relation to risk assessment, measures taken against risks, concerns, and social media use, while adjusting for sociodemographic variables. The cross-sectional study collected data from 3474 individuals from the USA, the UK, Norway, and Australia. Loneliness was measured with the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Multiple linear regression was used in the analysis of associations between variables. The results showed that concerns about finances were more strongly associated with social loneliness, while concerns about the future was more strongly associated with emotional loneliness. Longer daily time spent on social media was associated with higher emotional loneliness. In conclusion, pandemic-related concerns seem to affect perceptions of loneliness. While social media can be used productively to maintain relationships, and thereby prevent loneliness, excessive use may be counterproductive.","Bonsaksen, Tore; Schoultz, Mariyana; Thygesen, Hilde; Ruffolo, Mary; Price, Daicia; Leung, Janni; Geirdal, Amy Østertun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,234,1

DESIGN: Open-source age-structured variant of a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered compartmental mathematical model. Latin hypercube sampling and maximum likelihood estimation were used to calibrate to cumulative cases and cumulative deaths. SETTING: SW at a time considered early in the pandemic, where National Health Service authorities required evidence to guide localised planning and support decision-making. PARTICIPANTS: Publicly available data on patients with COVID-19. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The expected numbers of infected cases, deaths due to COVID-19 infection, patient occupancy of acute and IC beds and the reproduction (‘R’) number over time. RESULTS: SW model projections indicate that, as of 11 May 2020 (when ‘lockdown’ measures were eased), 5793 (95% credible interval (CrI) 2003 to 12 051) individuals were still infectious (0.10% of the total SW population, 95% CrI 0.04% to 0.22%), and a total of 189 048 (95% CrI 141 580 to 277 955) had been infected with the virus (either asymptomatically or symptomatically), but recovered, which is 3.4% (95% CrI 2.5% to 5.0%) of the SW population. The total number of patients in acute and IC beds in the SW on 11 May 2020 was predicted to be 701 (95% CrI 169 to 1543) and 110 (95% CrI 8 to 464), respectively. The R value in SW was predicted to be 2.6 (95% CrI 2.0 to 3.2) prior to any interventions, with social distancing reducing this to 2.3 (95% CrI 1.8 to 2.9) and lockdown/school closures further reducing the R value to 0.6 (95% CrI 0.5 to 0.7). CONCLUSIONS: The developed model has proved a valuable asset for regional healthcare services. The model will be used further in the SW as the pandemic evolves, and—as open-source software—is portable to healthcare systems in other geographies.","Booton, Ross D; MacGregor, Louis; Vass, Lucy; Looker, Katharine J; Hyams, Catherine; Bright, Philip D; Harding, Irasha; Lazarus, Rajeka; Hamilton, Fergus; Lawson, Daniel; Danon, Leon; Pratt, Adrian; Wood, Richard; Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Turner, Katherine M E",BMJ Open,234,1

Although the Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) uncovered the static atomic details of ACE2 homodimers, there is still a lack of research on the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of these full-length structures. This information is helpful to understand and interpret the role of ACE2 in the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. In order to obtain this information, we performed microsecond-scale conventional and accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of full-length all-atomic systems of the RBD-ACE2 complex, the normal and torsional conformations of the apo-ACE2 homodimer. The comparative analysis of these systems showed that there were differences in their allosteric signal pathways and motion trends. These results may be helpful to further explore the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the binding free energy and hydrogen bond distribution analysis of RBD-ACE2 binding interface provided the binding motifs that may be critical to allosteric signal transmission and RBD binding. These multi-conformational binding motifs can be used as targets or templates for the inhibitor design of the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2.","Liu, Qing; Wang, Yuwei; Lai-Han Leung, Elaine; Yao, Xiaojun",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,234,33

The Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test (AlereLAM) is a point‐of‐care test and the only lateral flow lipoarabinomannan assay (LF‐LAM) assay currently commercially available and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). A 2019 Cochrane Review summarised the diagnostic accuracy of LF‐LAM for tuberculosis in people living with HIV. This systematic review assesses the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on mortality and other patient‐important outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on mortality in adults living with HIV in inpatient and outpatient settings. To assess the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on other patient‐important outcomes in adults living with HIV, including time to diagnosis of tuberculosis, and time to initiation of tuberculosis treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (Ovid); Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), BIOSIS Previews, Scopus, LILACS; ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the WHO ICTRP up to 12 March 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials that compared a diagnostic intervention including LF‐LAM with diagnostic strategies that used smear microscopy, mycobacterial culture, a nucleic acid amplification test such as Xpert MTB/RIF, or a combination of these tests. We included adults (≥ 15 years) living with HIV. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, extracted data, and analysed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized studies. We contacted study authors for clarification as needed. We used risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a fixed‐effect model except in the presence of clinical or statistical heterogeneity, in which case we used a random‐effects model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials, two in inpatient settings and one in outpatient settings. All trials were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa and assessed the impact of diagnostic strategies that included LF‐LAM on mortality when the test was used in conjunction with other tuberculosis diagnostic tests or clinical assessment for clinical decision‐making in adults living with HIV. Inpatient settings In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy likely reduces mortality in people living with HIV at eight weeks compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (pooled RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.94; 5102 participants, 2 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence). That is, people living with HIV who received LF‐LAM had 15% lower risk of mortality. The absolute effect was 34 fewer deaths per 1000 (from 14 fewer to 55 fewer). In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy probably results in a slight increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (pooled RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.69; 5102 participants, 2 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence). Outpatient settings In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality in people living with HIV at six months compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11; 2972 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence). Although this trial did not detect a difference in mortality, the direction of effect was towards a mortality reduction, and the effect size was similar to that in inpatient settings. In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may result in a large increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (RR 5.44, 95% CI 4.70 to 6.29, 3022 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence). Other patient‐important outcomes Assessment of other patient‐important and implementation outcomes in the trials varied. The included trials demonstrated that a higher proportion of people living with HIV were able to produce urine compared to sputum for tuberculosis diagnostic testing; a higher proportion of people living with HIV were diagnosed with tuberculosis in the group that received LF‐LAM; and the incremental diagnostic yield was higher for LF‐LAM than for urine or sputum Xpert MTB/RIF. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic testing strategy likely reduces mortality and probably results in a slight increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. The reduction in mortality may be due to earlier diagnosis, which facilitates prompt treatment initiation. In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality and may result in a large increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. Our results support the implementation of LF‐LAM to be used in conjunction with other WHO‐recommended tuberculosis diagnostic tests to assist in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis in people living with HIV.","Nathavitharana, Ruvandhi R; Lederer, Philip; Chaplin, Marty; Bjerrum, Stephanie; Steingart, Karen R; Shah, Maunank",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,234,33

These pathways, encoding cytoprotective vitagenes, include heat shock proteins, such as heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), as well as glutathione redox system to protect against cancer initiation and progression. Phytochemicals exhibit biphasic dose responses on cancer cells, activating at low dose, signaling pathways resulting in upregulation of vitagenes, as in the case of the Nrf2 pathway upregulated by hydroxytyrosol (HT) or curcumin and NAD/NADH-sirtuin-1 activated by resveratrol.

The aim of this study was to investigate if disinfection of calf pens with hydrated lime would reduce contamination of C. parvum oocysts and improve calf health in herds with C. parvum associated diarrhea problems. Four dairy herds with ongoing C. parvum associated calf diarrhea problems each participated in the study over six to seven months. During the study period, all pens/huts for young calves were cleaned according to the usual farm routine before a new calf entered. Hydrated lime was then used to disinfect half of the pens/huts. Diarrhea incidence was recorded by the farmers and by veterinarians, who clinically examined the calves every second month. In total, 402 calves participated in the study. The farmers detected diarrhea in 214 (53%) calves, with similar proportions in calves kept in lime disinfected and control pens. Age at diarrhea onset was significantly higher in lime disinfected pens than in control pens, 9.0 days and 7.6 days, respectively. There was no difference between the groups regarding duration or severity index recorded by the farmers. The body condition score in 6–8 week old calves was significantly higher in calves that had been kept in lime disinfected pens during their first weeks of life, indicating that calves in disinfected pens/huts were less affected by their infections. Faecal samples from 5 to 21 day old calves, were collected on four occasions at each farm (n = 95). Cryptosporidium positive samples were found at all samplings in all four herds. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in 79 (83%) samples with no difference between lime disinfected and control pens. C. parvum was the dominant species. Two different C. parvum subtypes were found; IIaA16G1R1b in three herds and IIaA16G1R1b_variant in one herd. Only one subtype was found in each herd. Disinfection of calf pens with slaked lime delayed onset of diarrhea and improved the body condition in the calves, but did not affect diarrhea incidence or duration. Although lime disinfection alone will not be sufficient to control Cryptosporidium associated diarrhea in herds with extensive calf diarrhea problems, these results suggest that it can be a valuable complement to other measures.","Björkman, Camilla; von Brömssen, Claudia; Troell, Karin; Svensson, Catarina",Vet Parasitol,234,26

In this study, we aim to understand the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research and identify the issues that may cause recruitment difficulty or reduce study generalizability. METHODS: We analyzed 3,765 COVID-19 studies registered in the largest public registry - ClinicalTrials.gov, leveraging natural language processing and using descriptive, association, and clustering analyses. We first characterized COVID-19 studies by study features such as phase and tested intervention. We then took a deep dive and analyzed their eligibility criteria to understand whether these studies: (1) considered the reported underlying health conditions that may lead to severe illnesses, and (2) excluded older adults, either explicitly or implicitly, which may reduce the generalizability of these studies to the older adults population. RESULTS: Our analysis included 2295 interventional studies and 1470 observational studies. Most trials did not explicitly exclude older adults with common chronic conditions. However, known risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension were considered by less than 5% of trials based on their trial description. Pregnant women were excluded by 34.9% of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: Most COVID-19 clinical studies included both genders and older adults. However, risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and pregnancy were under-represented, likely skewing the population that was sampled. A careful examination of existing COVID-19 studies can inform future COVID-19 trial design towards balanced internal validity and generalizability. LAY SUMMARY: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020, thousands of clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various types of treatments and vaccines in human. COVID-19 clinical studies play a crucial role in controlling the virus. Yet it is unclear what types of patients were considered by these studies. This study analyzed 3,765 COVID-19 clinical study summaries downloaded from a major clinical trial registry ClinicalTrials.gov. We employed natural language processing techniques to parse the study description and eligibility criteria of these studies and then performed descriptive and clustering analysis on the parsing results. We found that older adults were not systematically excluded but pregnant women were often excluded. It was also found that the known risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and asthma, which may lead to serious illnesses, were considered by less than 5% of the studies according to their study description and eligibility criteria. This study provides an evidence that natural language processing can be applied to examine the design of clinical studies and identify issues that may cause delays in patient recruitment and the lack of real-world population representativeness.","He, Zhe; Erdengasileng, Arslan; Luo, Xiao; Xing, Aiwen; Charness, Neil; Bian, Jiang",JAMIA Open,234,8

Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited. Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable “choke points” for pharmacologic interventions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate patient outcomes. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce and iteratively refine a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung tissue. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and an online interactive model in under 12 hours, and community domain expertise is driving rapid refinements with a two-to-four week release cycle.

METHODS: This is a case study of official healthcare informatics programs and applications (apps) developed in Saudi Arabia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The qualitative content analysis (QCA) method was used. Data collection consisted of two components: a desktop review of documents and actual testing of the programs. According to the QCA method, we developed a matrix for abstracting information on different apps and programs in order to categorize the data. The compilation of information and discussion were based on information summarized in the matrix. RESULTS: Six apps in total were developed before the COVID-19 pandemic. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, three of the apps, SEHA, Mawid, and Sehaty were modified to address different aspects of the pandemic. Both SEHA and Mawid included information about COVID-19 awareness. During the COVID-19 pandemic, three official apps were developed: Tawakkalna, Tetamman, and Tabaud. The Tawakkalna app is mandatory for all citizens and residents to activate when visiting stores and institutions. It has a wide range of COVID-19 and other health-related functions. The Tetamman app provides COVID-19 test results and allows one to check his or her daily symptoms. It also has an educational content library and provides alerts. The Tabaud app notifies individuals if they have been exposed to COVID-19. The features, advantages, and disadvantages of all of the apps were examined.

However, not all recovered patients develop adequate antibody titers for donation and the relationship between avidity and neutralizing titers is currently not well understood. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG titers and avidity were measured in a longitudinal cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients (n=16 individuals) and a cross-sectional sample of convalescent plasma donors (n=130). Epidemiologic correlates of avidity were examined in donors by linear regression. The association of avidity and a high neutralizing titer (NT) were also assessed in donors using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: Antibody avidity increased over duration of infection and remained elevated. In convalescent plasma donors, higher levels of anti-spike avidity was associated with older age, male sex, and hospitalization. Higher NTs had a stronger positive correlation with anti-spike IgG avidity (spearman’s rho=0.386;p&0.001), than with anti-nucleocapsid IgG avidity (spearman’s rho=0.211;p=0.026). Increasing levels of anti-spike IgG avidity were associated with high NT(≥160) (adjusted prevalence ratio=1.58[95%CI=1.19-2.12]), independent of age, sex, and hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 antibody avidity correlated with duration of infection and higher neutralizing titers, suggesting a potential alternative screening parameter for identifying optimal convalescent plasma donors.","Benner, Sarah E; Patel, Eshan U; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Pekosz, Andrew; Littlefield, Kirsten; Eby, Yolanda; Fernandez, Reinaldo E; Miller, Jernelle; Kirby, Charles S; Keruly, Morgan; Klock, Ethan; Baker, Owen R; Schmidt, Haley A; Shrestha, Ruchee; Burgess, Imani; Bonny, Tania S; Clarke, William; Caturegli, Patrizio; Sullivan, David; Shoham, Shmuel; Quinn, Thomas C; Bloch, Evan M; Casadevall, Arturo; Tobian, Aaron A R; Redd, Andrew D",J Infect Dis,234,0

The main operational problem in the author's LRDI approach is selecting the most important concepts from extremely large volumes of potential discovery retrieval. This is contrary to most published LRDI research, where the discovery focus is searching for rare events. ⁎. It is important to have topical specialist(s) working closely with information technologist(s); the topical specialist(s) applies judgment in selecting the most important concepts. ⁎. A functional form of the information retrieval query with proximity searching capability provides highly selective filtering for discovery retrieval and core prevention/treatment retrieval; the functional form of the query with proximity searching capability allows the use of full-text for discovery and core prevention/treatment. ⁎. Bibliographic coupling (identifying papers that share common references) combined with text-based relationships strengthens selection for potential discovery further. ⁎. Having ‘skin-in-the-game’ (being affected personally) relative to the medical outcome is a strong incentive to do whatever is necessary to solve the research problem. ⁎. Hormesis is critical to healing; relatively modest doses of stimuli tend to be beneficial, whereas relatively large doses may be harmful. The synergy of hormetic treatment doses produces effects larger than combinations of individual doses and requires smaller doses when combined; the synergy of hormetic doses allows conversion of megadoses of nutrients typically reported in lab/clinical studies to physiological (food-level) doses and associated increased safety. ⁎. Co-promoters (combinations of toxic stimuli required to produce disease symptoms) are extremely important for explaining seemingly conflicting results; if true co-promotion is present, elimination of one of the co-promoters may be adequate for removing symptoms, even though the overall problem persists. ⁎. Prior art (potential treatments already published in the literature but not pursued by mainline medicine) may have much to contribute to potentially solve many serious medical problems; much of prior art is overlooked, especially low-tech prior art (e.g., foods, food extracts, herbs, etc.). ⁎. Systemic and focused treatments are both necessary components of healing, but neither will be fully, or many times even partially, effective until the cause(s) is identified and removed. Any medical approach that involves administering treatments for chronic and infectious diseases without addressing the cause(s) results in a broad range of outcomes mainly involving substitution of one set of symptoms for another. ⁎. Past results of LRDI medical studies showed much overlap among preventatives/systemic treatments for different diseases. Differences will arise mainly in focused treatments, especially those involving high technology. ⁎. The central parameters to healing in much medical research are never identified nor reported. Many treatments require a combination of skilled practitioners, cause removal, and immune/neural/endocrine/circulatory systems to be healthy for full effectiveness, yet practitioner skill, degree of cause removal, and immune system et al. health are never reported. A lack of this information does not allow efficacy of different treatments to be compared. Reviews and meta-analyses that compare and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of these different treatments without the above critical information being reported are of extremely limited value and credibility. ⁎. Finally, the most important deficiency for fully reversing chronic and infectious diseases, as well as rapidly accelerating healing of injuries and wounds, is the credibility and integrity of the medical literature itself, especially in areas that concern commercial and government/political sensitivities. In the evaluation of many concepts that deviated from the norm, it was difficult to ascertain whether the difference was based on solid high-quality research, poor research, or deliberately skewed research.","Kostoff, Ronald N.",Technol Forecast Soc Change,234,24

Twenty-eight percent of these cases were in the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa Region, where the annual case detection rate was 281 per 100 000 population—more than double the global average of 133 per 100 000. Of the 9.6 million people who developed TB, an estimated 1.2 million (12%) were HIV-positive, and the Africa Region accounted for 74% of these cases. Three million people with TB remain undiagnosed and untreated. Globally, an estimated 480 000 had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Whilst of the African countries, only South Africa has reported a high prevalence of MDR-TB, it is likely that all of Sub-Saharan Africa has an unreported high load of drug-resistant TB. Tragically, in 2014, only 48% of individuals diagnosed with MDR-TB had successful treatment and an estimated 190 000 people died of MDR-TB. Of the global TB funding gap of US$ 0.8 billion, the largest funding gap was in the Africa Region, amounting to US$ 0.4 billion in 2015. The MDR-TB pandemic in particular now threatens to devastate entire regions and may fundamentally alter the life-expectancy and demographic profile of many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The theme designated for this year's World TB Day, March 24, 2016, is ‘Unite to End TB’. From the Africa Region, there is an urgent need to seriously address the political, economic, and social factors that influence host–Mycobacterium tuberculosis interactions and result in disease. Recent political and funder initiatives that provide renewed hope for the alleviation of Africa's TB and TB/HIV problems are discussed.","Ntoumi, Francine; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Macete, Eusebio; Mfinanga, Sayoki; Chakaya, Jeremiah; Yeboah-Manu, Dorothy; Bates, Matthew; Mwaba, Peter; Maeurer, Markus; Petersen, Eskild; Zumla, Alimuddin",Int J Infect Dis,234,16

Methods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources. Results: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end. Conclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.","Bu, Jin; Peng, Dong-Dong; Xiao, Hui; Yue, Qian; Han, Yan; Lin, Yu; Hu, Gang; Chen, Jing",,234,16

With significant barriers preventing access to food, homeless persons remain at risk for experiencing long-term food insecurity. As such, the primary intent of this paper was to examine specific hypotheses that explored the impact of both risks/stressors and resources on the reported food insecurity among homeless adults. Using a stratified quota sample, data were collected from homeless adults residing in two counties in Northwest Arkansas. One hundred and sixty-eight face-to-face interviews were conducted with homeless persons living in sheltered and unsheltered environments. We found a strong positive association with persons who had been arrested and reported food insecurity; anxiety symptoms and physical health symptoms were both positively related to food insecurity. Additionally, there were significant resources (access to medical services, and community connectedness) that were negatively related to food insecurity among homeless adults. Findings are discussed in the context of how important it is for service providers to have a clear picture of the health and well-being of their clientele, particularly as they work towards minimizing service disruption and maximizing client access to sustainable food sources.","Fitzpatrick, Kevin M.; Willis, Don E.",Food Secur,234,17

We investigated prognostic factors for an adverse outcome among children admitted to the Hôpital d’Enfants de Rabat, Morocco with World Health Organization-defined clinically severe pneumonia (CSP). METHODS: Children aged 2–59 months admitted to the hospital and fulfilling the CSP definition were recruited into this 13-month prospective study. A poor prognosis was defined as death, a need for intensive care, or a Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) score ≥3. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to ascertain independent predictive factors for a poor prognosis. RESULTS: Of the 689 children included in this analysis, 55 (8.0%) required intensive care and 28 died (4.0%). Five hundred and two (72.8%) children were classified as having a good prognosis and 187 (27.2%) as having a poor prognosis.

Although it is not a zoonosis, its spread may have severe socio-economic and public health consequences. The activities of veterinary services are essential for controlling ASF outbreaks within a country, but also for diminishing its threat of spread to neighbouring countries, and for recognizing its entry into countries that are currently free. ASF requires quick responses and permanent monitoring to identify outbreaks and prevent spread, and both aspects can be heavily undercut during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper analyses changing patterns of the main drivers and pathways for the potential introduction of ASFV into the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, including international movements of people, swine products and by-products. Data on commercial flights and merchant ships was used as a proxy to indirectly assess the flow of illegal products coming from ASF affected countries. Results from this study highlight a decreasing trend in the legal imports of swine products and by-products from ASF affected countries (Sen's slope = -99, 95% CI: -215.34 to -21.26, p-value < 0.05), while no trend was detected for confiscations of illegal products at ports of entry. Additionally, increasing trends were detected for the monthly number of merchant ships coming from ASF affected countries (Sen's slope = 0.46, 95%CI 0.25-0.59), the monthly value of imported goods ($) through merchant ships (Sen's slope = 1513196160, 95%CI 1072731702-1908231855), and the monthly percentage of commercial flights (Sen's slope = 0.005, 95%CI 0.003-0.007), with the majority of them originating from China.

DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: We used pseudonymised medical record data provided by six general hospitals from the HM Hospitales group in Spain. OUTCOME MEASURES: Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify variables associated with mortality and the composite of mortality or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in the overall population, and stratified for the presence or absence of DM. Spline analysis was conducted on the entire population to investigate the relationship between glucose levels at admission and outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 1621 individuals without DM and 448 with DM were identified in the database. Patients with DM were on average 5.1 years older than those without. The overall in-hospital mortality was 18.6% (N=301), and was higher among patients with DM than those without (26.3% vs 11.3%; p<0.001). DM was independently associated with death, and death or IMV (OR=2.33, 95% CI: 1.7 to 3.1 and OR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.6 to 2.8, respectively; p<0.001). In subjects with DM, the only variables independently associated with both outcomes were age >65 years, male sex and pre-existing chronic kidney disease. We observed a non-linear relationship between blood glucose levels at admission and risk of in-hospital mortality and death or IMV. The highest probability for each outcome (around 50%) was at random glucose of around 550 mg/dL (30.6 mmol/L), and the risks flattened above this value. CONCLUSION: The results confirm the high burden associated with DM in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 infection, particularly among men, the elderly and those with impaired kidney function. Moreover, hyperglycaemia on admission was strongly associated with poor outcomes, suggesting that personalised optimisation could help to improve outcome during the hospital stay.","Ortega, Emilio; Corcoy, Rosa; Gratacòs, Mònica; Cos Claramunt, Francesc Xavier; Mata-Cases, Manel; Puig-Treserra, Ramon; Real, Jordi; Vlacho, Bogdan; Castelblanco, Esmeralda; Domingo, Pere; Khunti, Kamlesh; Franch-Nadal, Josep; Mauricio, Didac",BMJ Open,234,18

We scanned more than 182,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes for selective sweep signatures and found that a distinct footprint of positive selection is located around a non-synonymous change (A1114G; T372A) within the Receptor-Binding Domain of the Spike protein, which likely played a critical role in overcoming species barriers and accomplishing interspecies transmission from animals to humans. Structural analysis indicated that the substitution of threonine with an alanine in SARS-CoV-2 concomitantly removes a predicted glycosylation site at N370, resulting in more favorable binding predictions to human ACE2, the cellular receptor. Using a novel bacteria-free cloning system for manipulating RNA virus genomes, we experimentally validated that this SARS-CoV-2-unique substitution significantly increases replication in human cells relative to its putative ancestral variant. Notably, this mutation’s impact on virus replication in human cells was much greater than that of the Spike D614G mutant, which has been widely reported to have been selected for during human-to-human transmission2,3.","Kang, Lin; He, Guijuan; Sharp, Amanda K.; Wang, Xiaofeng; Brown, Anne M.; Michalak, Pawel; Weger-Lucarelli, James",bioRxiv,234,1

NaCl depolarizes the plasma membrane causing a low energy state (high ADP/ATP concentration ratio) without impairing mitochondrial function, supposedly associated with the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Membrane depolarization and intracellular energy deprivation are possible mechanisms by which the hypertonic saline solution efficiently prevents virus replication in vitro assays.","Machado, Rafael R.

The cough reflex can be triggered by nociceptive neurons innervating the lungs, and some bacteria produce neuron-targeting molecules. However, how pulmonary Mtb infection causes cough remains undefined, and whether Mtb produces a neuron-activating, cough-inducing molecule is unknown. Here, we show that an Mtb organic extract activates nociceptive neurons in vitro and identify the Mtb glycolipid sulfolipid-1 (SL-1) as the nociceptive molecule. Mtb organic extracts from mutants lacking SL-1 synthesis cannot activate neurons in vitro or induce cough in a guinea pig model. Finally, Mtb-infected guinea pigs cough in a manner dependent on SL-1 synthesis. Thus, we demonstrate a heretofore unknown molecular mechanism for cough induction by a virulent human pathogen via its production of a complex lipid.","Ruhl, Cody R.; Pasko, Breanna L.; Khan, Haaris S.; Kindt, Lexy M.; Stamm, Chelsea E.; Franco, Luis H.; Hsia, Connie C.; Zhou, Min; Davis, Colton R.; Qin, Tian; Gautron, Laurent; Burton, Michael D.; Mejia, Galo L.; Naik, Dhananjay K.; Dussor, Gregory; Price, Theodore J.; Shiloh, Michael U.",Cell,234,33

We proposed, validated, and evaluated a risk management tool that stratifies LTHC patients by LACE predictive score for readmission risk, which can further help home care providers intervene with individualized preventive plans. Method: A before-and-after study was conducted by a LTHC unit in Taiwan. Patients with acute hospitalization within 30 days after discharge in the unit were enrolled as two cohorts (Pre-Implement cohort in 2017 and Post-Implement cohort in 2019). LACE score performance was evaluated by calibration and discrimination (AUC, area under receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve). The clinical utility was evaluated by negative predictive value (NPV). Results: There were 48 patients with 87 acute hospitalizations in Pre-Implement cohort, and 132 patients with 179 hospitalizations in Post-Implement cohort. These LTHC patients were of older age, mostly intubated, and had more comorbidities. There was a significant reduction in readmission rate by 44.7% (readmission rate 25.3% vs. 14.0% in both cohorts). Although LACE score predictive model still has room for improvement (AUC = 0.598), it showed the potential as a useful screening tool (NPV, 87.9%; 95% C.I., 74.2–94.8). The reduction effect is more pronounced in infection-related readmission. Conclusion: As real-world evidence, LACE score-based risk management tool significantly reduced readmission by 44.7% in this LTHC unit. Larger scale studies involving multiple homecare units are needed to assess the generalizability of this study.","Su, Mei-Chin; Chen, Yu-Chun; Huang, Mei-Shu; Lin, Yen-Hsi; Lin, Li-Hwa; Chang, Hsiao-Ting; Chen, Tzeng-Ji",Int J Environ Res Public Health,234,28

METHODS: By searching literature and reports related to the COVID-19 prevention of China, we compared the prevention effectiveness with the prevention policies in the process of the COVID-19 prevention. RESULTS: China's public health system can effectively combine national power to maximize the effectiveness of pandemic prevention. It improved the pandemic prevention ability of communities continuously and promoted the fairness of prevention. Traditional Chinese Medicine has also been used in pandemic prevention, which reduces the drug resistance of the virus. At the same time, the combination of the disease diagnosis and the Internet has reduced the spread speed of the pandemic. China's public health system also has some problems in response to the COVID-19, such as the shortage of medical resources, insufficient alerts, the low efficiency of reporting to superior government and the shortage of reward and punishment system for pandemic prevention.

Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to thrombosis is crucial for developing more appropriate prophylaxis and treatment strategies. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess fibrinolytic activity and thrombin generation in 78 Covid‐19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty eight patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and 30 patients admitted to the internal medicine department were included in the study. All patients received thromboprophylaxis. We measured fibrinolytic parameters (tPA, PAI‐1, TAFI, alpha2 anti‐plasmin, and tPA‐modified ROTEM), thrombin generation, and other coagulation tests (D‐dimer, fibrinogen, FVIII, antithrombin). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We observed two key findings: a high thrombin generation capacity which remained within normal values despite heparin therapy and a hypofibrinolysis mainly associated with increased PAI‐1 levels. A modified ROTEM (TEM‐tPA) is able to detect both hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis simultaneously in Covid‐19 patients with thrombosis.","Nougier, Christophe; Benoit, Remi; Simon, Marie; Desmurs‐Clavel, Helene; Marcotte, Guillaume; Argaud, Laurent; David, Jean Stephane; Bonnet, Aurelie; Negrier, Claude; Dargaud, Yesim",J Thromb Haemost,234,9

Given the limited supply of professional respirators and face masks, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended home-made cloth face coverings for use by the general public. While there have been several studies on aerosol filtration performance of household fabrics, their effectiveness at blocking larger droplets has not been investigated. Here, we ascertained the performance of 11 common household fabrics at blocking large, high-velocity droplets, using a commercial medical mask as a benchmark. We also assessed the breathability (air permeability), texture, fiber composition, and water absorption properties of the fabrics. We found that most fabrics have substantial blocking efficiency (median values >70%). In particular, two layers of highly permeable fabric, such as T-shirt cloth, blocks droplets with an efficiency (>94%) similar to that of medical masks, while being approximately twice as breathable. The first layer allows about 17% of the droplet volume to transmit, but it significantly reduces their velocity. This allows the second layer to trap the transmitted droplets resulting in high blocking efficacy. Overall, our study suggests that cloth face coverings, especially with multiple layers, may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections. Furthermore, face coverings made from materials such as cotton fabrics allow washing and reusing, and can help reduce the adverse environmental effects of widespread use of commercial disposable and non-biodegradable facemasks.","Aydin, Onur; Emon, Bashar; Cheng, Shyuan; Hong, Liu; Chamorro, Leonardo P.; Saif, M.

However, the huge CT data make it difficult for radiologist to fully exploit them on the diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a computer-aided diagnosis system that can automatically analyze CT images to distinguish the COVID-19 against to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The proposed system is based on an unsupervised pulmonary opacity detection method that locates opacity regions by a detector unsupervisedly trained from CT images with normal lung tissues. Radiomics based features are extracted insides the opacity regions, and fed into classifiers for classification. We evaluate the proposed CAD system by using 200 CT images collected from different patients in several hospitals.

These medications have been postulated to influence susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The objective of this study was to assess a possible association between prescription of RAS inhibitors and the incidence of COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. Methods We conducted a propensity-score matched cohort study to assess the incidence of COVID-19 among patients with hypertension who were prescribed ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared to patients treated with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in a large UK-based primary care database (The Health Improvement Network). We estimated crude incidence rates for confirmed/suspected COVID-19 among those prescribed ACE inhibitors, ARBs and CCBs. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to produce adjusted hazard ratios for COVID-19 comparing patients prescribed ACE inhibitors or ARBs to those prescribed CCBs. We further assessed all-cause mortality as a secondary outcome and a composite of accidents, trauma or fractures as a negative control outcome to assess for residual confounding. Results In the propensity score matched analysis, 83 of 18,895 users (0.44%) of ACE inhibitors developed COVID-19 over 8,923 person-years, an incidence rate of 9.3 per 1000 person-years. 85 of 18,895 (0.45%) users of CCBs developed COVID-19 over 8,932 person-years, an incidence rate of 9.5 per 1000 person-years. The adjusted hazard ratio for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 for users of ACE inhibitors compared to CCBs was 0.92 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). 79 out of 10,623 users (0.74%) of ARBs developed COVID-19 over 5010 person-years, an incidence rate of 15.8 per 1000 person-years, compared to 11.6 per 1000 person-years among users of CCBs. The adjusted hazard ratio for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 for users of ARBs compared to CCBs was 1.38 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.95). There were no significant associations between use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and all-cause mortality, compared to use of CCBs. We found no evidence of significant residual confounding with the negative control analysis. Conclusion Current use of ACE inhibitors was not associated with the risk of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 whereas use of ARBs was associated with a statistically non-significant 38% relative increase in risk compared to use of CCBs. However, no significant associations were observed between prescription of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs and all-cause mortality during the peak of the pandemic.","Haroon, S.; Subramanian, A.; Cooper, J.; Anand, A.; Gokhale, K.; Byne, N.; Dhalla, S.; Acosta-Mena, D.; Taverner, T.; Okoth, K.; Wang, J.; Chandan, J.

Our aim was to examine the impact of neuromorphologic and vascular correlates as well as clinical factors on acute symptom severity in LVO stroke. Methods: We selected LVO stroke patients with known onset time from a consecutive cohort which underwent multiparametric CT including non-contrast CT, CT angiography and CT perfusion (CTP) before thrombectomy. Software-based quantification was used to calculate CTP total ischemic and ischemic core volume. Symptom severity was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) upon admission. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine independent associations of admission NIHSS with imaging and clinical parameters. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were used to examine performance of imaging parameters to classify symptom severity. Results: We included 142 patients. Linear and ordinal regression analyses for NIHSS and NIHSS severity groups identified significant associations for total ischemic volume [β = 0.31, p = 0.01; Odds ratio (OR) = 1.11, 95%-confidence-interval (CI): 1.02–1.19], clot burden score (β = −0.28, p = 0.01; OR = 0.76, 95%-CI: 0.64–0.90) and age (β = 0.17, p = 0.04). No association was found for ischemic core volume, stroke side, collaterals and time from onset. Stroke topography according to the Alberta Stroke Program CT Score template did not display significant influence after correction for multiple comparisons. AUC for classification of the NIHSS threshold ≥6 by total ischemic volume was 0.81 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: We determined total ischemic volume, clot burden and age as relevant drivers for baseline NIHSS in acute LVO stroke. This suggests that not only mere volume but also degree of occlusion influences symptom severity.

This study was carried out to determine the diagnostic accuracy of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in ambulatory children. METHODS: From 1(st)-23(rd) October 2020, we recruited a population-based sample of children presenting for COVID-19 screening in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Each child provided paired nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR N, E and RdRp genes detection. RESULTS: Paired NP swab and saliva samples were obtained from 476 children with mean (±SD) age of 10.8 years (±3.9) and 58.1% were male (n/N=277/476). Nine participants were sampled twice, hence 485 pairs of NP swab/saliva were tested. Viral detection in at least one specimen type was reported in 17.9% (n/N=87/485), with similar detection in NP swab (16.7%; n/N=81/485) and saliva (15.9%; n/N=77/485). Sensitivity and specificity of saliva RT-PCR was 87.7% (95% CI 78.5%-93.9%) and 98.5% (95% CI 96.8%-99.5%). The positive and negative predictive values were 92.2% (95% CI 84.2%-96.3%) and 97.6% (95% CI 95.7%-98.6%) with Kappa coefficient 0.879 (95% CI 0.821-0.937). Concordance of findings between NP swab and saliva did not differ by age (p=0.67) or gender (p=0.29). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were significantly higher in NP swab/saliva pairs with discordant findings compared to those with both specimens positive. CONCLUSION: In light of these findings, we recommend saliva as a diagnostic specimen for COVID-19 screening in children.","Al Suwaidi, Hanan; Senok, Abiola; Varghese, Rupa; Deesi, Zulfa; Khansaheb, Hamda; Pokasirakath, Sabeel; Chacko, Bino; Abufara, Ibrahim; Loney, Tom; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi",Clin Microbiol Infect,234,17

For evaluation and verification, emotional recognition and wayfinding types were analyzed according to types in the groups (gender, age, and spatial familiarity) of experimental participants. There were two research questions: “Will the length of movement patterns in the experiment environment vary depending on the types of the participant group?” and “Is there any moderating effect in the interaction between spatial familiarity and the types of the participant groups?” A total of 28 participants were recruited with consideration of gender, age, and familiarity with spatial experience, which were used to analyze the participant groups. The experiment was conducted at a train station, and a vignette was presented to the participants to record the route and pattern of their wayfinding, followed by providing a questionnaire to record their spatial perception. SPSS was used to conduct a T-test, factor analysis, and multidimensional scaling (MDS). The differences in spatial perception were arranged in visual positioning based on emotional vocabulary, and average movement distances in the participant groups were compared in accordance with the type of wayfinding and interaction effect by ANOVA. The results showed that there was a difference in spatial perception depending on the negative emotional vocabulary and type of participant. An emotional positioning map for average comparison was prepared for each participant group (gender, age, and spatial familiarity) by using the factors extracted in the factor analysis (emotional factor, management factor, and aesthetic factor). Female and unfamiliar groups displayed negative results in the emotional factor (F = 7.202, p < 0.05). In addition, male and familiar groups displayed negative results in the management factor (F = 3.058, p < 0.10). In wayfinding, there was an interaction between gender and the resident group based on the status of their spatial familiarity. Through this, it was possible to extract negative emotional evaluations according to the type of participant and the interaction factors for the type and length of the wayfinding.","Kim, Ju Yeon; Choi, Jin Kyung; Han, Won Hee; Kim, Jong Ha",Sensors (Basel),234,5

Although most patients with COVID-19 exhibit mild clinical manifestations, in approximately 5% of these patients, the disease eventually progresses to severe lung injury or even multiorgan dysfunction. This situation represents various challenges to hepatology. In the context of liver injury in patients with COVID-19, several key problems need to be solved. For instance, it is important to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly invade liver, especially when ACE2 appears to be negligibly expressed on hepatocytes. In addition, the mechanisms underlying liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients are not fully understood, which are likely multifactorial and related to hyperinflammation, dysregulated immune responses, abnormal coagulation and drugs. Here, we systematically describe the potential pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated liver injury and propose several hypotheses about its etiopathogenesis.","Li, Dongxiao; Ding, Xiangming; Xie, Meng; Tian, Dean; Xia, Limin",J Gastroenterol,234,16

Limited previous evidence is based primarily on virologic testing, which disproportionately misses mild and asymptomatic infections. Serologic measures are more likely to capture all previously infected individuals. Objective: Estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from household and community exposures, and identify key risk factors for transmission and infection. Design: Household serosurvey and transmission model. Setting: Population-based serosurvey in Geneva, Switzerland Participants: 4,524 household members five years and older from 2,267 households enrolled April-June 2020. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infected (seropositive) household members and background risk of community transmission. Main outcomes and measures: Past SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed through anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by ELISA. Chain-binomial models based on the number of infections within households were used to estimate extra-household infection risk by demographics and reported extra-household contacts, and infection risk from exposure to an infected household member by demographics and infector's symptoms. Infections attributable to exposure to different types of infectious individuals were estimated. Results: The chance of being infected by a single SARS-CoV-2 infected household member was 17.2% (95%CrI 13.6-21.5%) compared to a cumulative extra-household infection risk of 5.1% (95%CrI 4.5-5.8%). Infection risk from an infected household member increased with age, from 7.5% (95%CrI 1.3-20.3%) among 5-9 years to 30.2% (95%CrI 14.3-48.2%) among those [≥]65 years. Working-age adults (20-49 years) had the highest extra-household infection risk. Seropositive household members not reporting symptoms had 74.8% lower odds (95%CrI 43.8-90.3%) of infecting another household member compared to those reporting symptoms, accounting for 19.6% (95%CrI 12.9-24.5%) of all household infections. Conclusions and Relevance: The risk of infection from exposure to a single infected household member was four-times that of extra-household exposures over the first wave of the pandemic. Young children had a lower risk from infection from household members. Asymptomatic infections are far less likely to transmit than symptomatic ones but do cause infections. While the small households in Geneva limit the contribution of household spread, household transmission likely plays a greater role in other settings.","Bi, Q.; Lessler, J.; Eckerle, I.; Lauer, S.

Recent research shows that many TFPs are highly nutritious as they contain health beneficial metabolites, vitamins, mineral elements and other nutrients. Excessive reliance on the mainstream staple crops has its own disadvantages. Traditional food plants are nowadays considered important crops of the future and can act as supplementary foods for the burgeoning global population. They can also act as emergency foods in situations such as COVID-19 and in times of other pandemics. The current situation necessitates locally available alternative nutritious TFPs for sustainable food production. To increase the cultivation or improve the traits in TFPs, it is essential to understand the molecular basis of the genes that regulate some important traits such as nutritional components and resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses. The integrated use of modern omics and gene editing technologies provide great opportunities to better understand the genetic and molecular basis of superior nutrient content, climate-resilient traits and adaptation to local agroclimatic zones. Recently, realizing the importance and benefits of TFPs, scientists have shown interest in the prospection and sequencing of TFPs for their improvements, cultivation and mainstreaming. Integrated omics such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and ionomics are successfully used in plants and have provided a comprehensive understanding of gene-protein-metabolite networks. Combined use of omics and editing tools has led to successful editing of beneficial traits in several TFPs. This suggests that there is ample scope for improvement of TFPs for sustainable food production. In this article, we highlight the importance, scope and progress towards improvement of TFPs for valuable traits by integrated use of omics and gene editing techniques.","Kumar, Ajay; Anju, Thattantavide; Kumar, Sushil; Chhapekar, Sushil Satish; Sreedharan, Sajana; Singh, Sonam; Choi, Su Ryun; Ramchiary, Nirala; Lim, Yong Pyo",Int J Mol Sci,234,20

As during infection by other viruses, host sensing of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces several antiviral pathways. These include interferon (IFN), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L, and protein kinase R (PKR). Coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, potently suppress the activation of these pathways, inducing only modest host responses. Our study describes the functions of two accessory proteins unique to MERS-CoV and related viruses, NS4a and NS4b, during infection in human airway epithelium-derived A549 cells. NS4a has been previously characterized as a dsRNA binding protein, while NS4b is a 2′,5′-phosphodiesterase with structural and enzymatic similarity to NS2 encoded by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). We found that deletion of NS4a results in increased interferon lambda (IFNL1) expression, as does mutation of either the catalytic site or nuclear localization sequence of NS4b. All of the mutant viruses we tested exhibited slight decreases in replication. We previously reported that, like MHV NS2, NS4b antagonizes OAS-RNase L, but suppression of IFN is a previously unidentified function for viral phosphodiesterases. Unexpectedly, deletion of NS4a does not result in robust activation of the PKR or OAS-RNase L pathways. Therefore, MERS-CoV likely encodes other proteins that contribute to suppression or evasion of these antiviral innate immune pathways that should be an important focus of future work. This study provides additional insight into the complex interactions between MERS-CoV and the host immune response.","Comar, Courtney E.; Goldstein, Stephen A.; Li, Yize; Yount, Boyd; Baric, Ralph S.; Weiss, Susan R.",mBio,234,20

To date, COVID-19 cases have been reported in 54 out of 55 African countries. However, due to limited severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) testing capacity and scarcity of testing reagents, it is probable that the total number of cases could far exceed published statistics. In this viewpoint, using Ghana, Malawi, South Africa, and Zimbabwe as examples of countries that have implemented different testing strategies, we argue that the implementation of sample pooling for rRT-PCR over antibody rapid diagnostic testing could have a greater impact in assessing disease burden. Sample pooling offers huge advantages compared to single test rRT-PCR, as it reduces diagnostic costs, personnel time, burnout, and analytical run times. Africa is already strained in terms of testing resources for COVID-19; hence, cheaper alternative ways need to be implemented to conserve resources, maximize mass testing, and reduce transmission in the wider population.","Nyazika, Tinashe K.; Kaela, Rabelani; Mugoni, Mathias; Musomekwa, Kudakwashe; Kyei-Baafour, Eric; Chiwanda, Simbarashe; Mapondera, Prichard T.; Makawa, Tatenda S.; Sithole, Elliot M.; Mavunganidze, George; Manasa, Justen; Jambo, Kondwani C.; Musarurwa, Cuthbert",mSphere,234,20

However, numerous local species are traded and given less consideration despite their importance. Hence, we observed the local markets in the Feuang and Mad districts of Vientiane Province in summer and winter seasons to determine the species for trade, as well as their volume and conservation status. Altogether, 602 specimens corresponding to 23 genera and 22 species were identified. Among them, the highest number of species were mammals, followed by birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects. Six species are listed in threatened categories according to the IUCN and nine under CITES categories. The species in trade varied between seasons, as winter was the main poaching season for mammals and birds, and summer was for amphibians, reptiles, and insects. This study revealed that food, traditional medicine, and curio production were the main reasons for wildlife trade. The lack of strong regulations, monitoring and law enforcement, and poverty are the major reasons for wildlife trade. Therefore, strong law enforcement, creating alternate income sources, and participatory conservation programs are required to effectively control wildlife trade in the Lao PDR.","Banjade, Maniram; Adhikari, Pradeep; Oh, Hong-Shik",Journal of Asia-Pacific biodiversity,234,12

The patient showed signs of hemodynamic instability, elevated cardiac troponin I and altered coagulation. On further assessment, a thrombotic mass near the apex of the right ventricle was detected. Moreover, the apex and the anteroseptal wall of the right ventricle appeared akinetic. Following the administration of a therapeutic dose of unfractionated heparin over a forty-eight hour period, re-evaluation of the right chambers showed that the thrombotic mass had resolved entirely.

In this study, we estimated the BRN 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after societal lockdown of Denmark during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. METHOD: We implemented the SEIR dynamical system for disease spread without vital dynamics. The BRN was modulated using a sigmoid function. Model parameters were estimated on number of admitted patients, number of patients in intensive care and cumulative number of deaths using the simulated annealing Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are presented with 95% prediction intervals (PI). RESULTS: We were unable to determine any reliable estimate of the BRN at 7 days following lockdown. The BRN had stabilised at day 14 throughout day 28, with the estimate ranging from 0.95 (95% PI: 0.92–0.98) at day 7 to 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92–0.93) at day 28. We estimated the BRN prior to lockdown to be 3.32 (95% PI: 3.31–3.33). The effect of the lockdown was occurring over a period of a few days centred at March 18th (95% PI: 17th-18th) 2020.

As universities around the world decide whether to remain open or to close their campuses because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they often are doing so without objective information on the preferences and risk tolerance of their students. Objectives. To quantify: 1) risk tolerance for in-person instruction; 2) willingness to pay for in-person instruction versus online-only instruction; and 3) risk-tolerance for social activities held off campus among knowledgable students. Design, Setting, and Participants. We developed an automated survey tool that administered a standard gamble exercise grounded in game theory to 46 Columbia University public health graduate students who were knowledgeable about COVID-19 and who had experience with both online and offline coursework. Students were asked to trade between the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and: 1) attending classes in-person versus online and 2) attending parties in the greater New York City area. We also assessed their willingness to pay for online only tuition, and plans to travel off campus. Main Outcome Measures. The decision point in iterative trade-offs between risk of infection with COVID-19 and a desired goal (taking classes in-person or attending social events). Results. On average, students were willing to accept a 23% (standard error [SE]: 4%) risk of infection on campus over the semester in exchange for the opportunity to attend classes in-person. Students were willing-to-pay only 48% (SE: 3%) of typical in-person tuition were courses held exclusively online, and no students were willing to pay full price for online-only instruction. Students planned to leave campus an average of 3.6 times per week (SE: 0.54), and 15% of the students would be willing to attend a party in the community surrounding the university even if the prevalence of circulating COVID-19 were high. Conclusions and Relevance. Students with a strong knowledge of COVID-19 transmission and risks are an enigma: they are willing to pay only around 50% for online classes but likely to engage in activities that present significant barriers to holding in-person classes. This enigma underscores the conundrum facing universities.","Zafari, Zafar; Goldman, Lee; Korvizhkin, Katia; Muennig, Peter",,234,3

A prospective series of 100 consecutive patients admitted to the Spedali Civili University Hospital in Brescia (Italy) between March 9th and March 20th with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS requiring ventilatory support was analyzed to determine whether intravenous administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, was associated with improved outcome. Tocilizumab was administered at a dosage of 8 mg/kg by two consecutive intravenous infusions 12 h apart. A third infusion was optional based on clinical response. The outcome measure was an improvement in acute respiratory failure assessed by means of the Brescia COVID Respiratory Severity Score (BCRSS 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating higher severity) at 24–72 h and 10 days after tocilizumab administration. Out of 100 treated patients (88 M, 12 F; median age: 62 years), 43 received TCZ in the intensive care unit (ICU), while 57 in the general ward as no ICU beds were available. Of these 57 patients, 37 (65%) improved and suspended noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (median BCRSS: 1 [IQR 0–2]), 7 (12%) patients remained stable in NIV, and 13 (23%) patients worsened (10 died, 3 were admitted to ICU). Of the 43 patients treated in the ICU, 32 (74%) improved (17 of them were taken off the ventilator and were discharged to the ward), 1 (2%) remained stable (BCRSS: 5) and 10 (24%) died (all of them had BCRSS≥7 before TCZ). Overall at 10 days, the respiratory condition was improved or stabilized in 77 (77%) patients, of whom 61 showed a significant clearing of diffuse bilateral opacities on chest x-ray and 15 were discharged from the hospital. Respiratory condition worsened in 23 (23%) patients, of whom 20 (20%) died. All the patients presented with lymphopenia and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, ferritin and IL-6 indicating a HIS.

There is a greater accent on Virtual communication. This paper aims to establish a relationship between Emotional intelligence and the effectiveness of Virtual communication on Decision making. This empirical study is based on a sample drawn from 296 working professionals at five different levels of organizational hierarchy. A standardized questionnaire (ɑ = 0.824) was used to collect the responses of Emotional intelligence, Virtual communication, and Decision-making effectiveness. Hierarchical regression using PROCESS Macro model 1 was used to identify the moderating effect of Emotional intelligence on Virtual communication and Decision making effectiveness. Since the p-value (p ≤ .007) is found significant, Emotional intelligence acts as a moderator that affects the strength of the relationship between Virtual communication effectiveness and Decision making. Validation of Task Technology fit theory is the theoretical implication of the study. Manipulation of individual dimensions in the model can reduce the dependence on technology for task completion with enhanced performance effectiveness. The findings are relevant to educators, consultants, and any professional who need to adapt Virtual communication platforms on an ongoing basis. Since work-life balance is projected as a constraint in this study, policymakers can consider policy amendments to reduce the stress caused due to Virtual communication which intrudes into their personal space. This empirical study is the first of its kind to benchmark the organizational practice of Emotional intelligence training to enhance Virtual communication and Decision making effectiveness during unprecedented times of pandemic.","Warrier, Uma; Shankar, Anand; Belal, H.

AIM: To evaluate the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on glycemic control among Egyptian children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted through an online questionnaire. The participants were patients with type 1 diabetes and/or their caregivers RESULTS: A total of 115 valid responses to the questionnaire were received. During the lockdown, almost 64% of patients showed worsening of their HbA1C with significant increment of HbA1c after the lockdown (p < 0.001). Synchronous simple telemedicine service was initiated through phone calls and social media applications, and 97% of the patients and their families were successfully able to continue follow-up. Almost 76% of the patients/caregivers showed moderate stress which was significantly correlated with HbA1C (p < 0.05). Fear of hospital admission and fear from shortage of medical supplies were the main COVID-19-related worries. CONCLUSION: The lockdown negatively impacted glycemic control and initiated a set of COVID-19 worries and stress among patients and their caregivers in Egypt. Telemedicine service, even simple tools, is effective and important for the continuity of care among patients. The limited availability and the fear of shortage of medical supply forced patients to ration glucose monitoring.

The survey included questions regarding perceived changes in PA compared to the previous year, the “Rating of Perceived Capacity” scale and “Life Satisfaction Questionnaire-11”. A change in PA was reported by 65% of participants. More participants reported an increase (36%) than a decrease (29%), however a decrease in PA was significantly more often considered to be due to the pandemic. The highest odds of decreased PA was found in the oldest age group (70+ years) (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.4–5.7). Those who reported decreased levels of PA reported lower life satisfaction and aerobic capacity than the other groups (p > 0.001).

It is a type 1 viral fusion protein that characteristically contains two heptad repeat regions, denoted HR-N and HR-C, that form coiled-coil structures within the ectodomain of the protein. Previous studies have shown that the two heptad repeat regions can undergo a conformational change from their native state to a 6-helix bundle (trimer of dimers), which mediates fusion of viral and host cell membranes. Here we describe the biophysical analysis of the two predicted heptad repeat regions within the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus S protein. Our results show that in isolation the HR-N region forms a stable α-helical coiled coil that associates in a tetrameric state. The HR-C region in isolation formed a weakly stable trimeric coiled coil. When mixed together, the two peptide regions (HR-N and HR-C) associated to form a very stable α-helical 6-stranded structure (trimer of heterodimers). Systematic peptide mapping showed that the site of interaction between the HR-N and HR-C regions is between residues 916–950 of HR-N and residues 1151–1185 of HR-C. Additionally, interchain disulfide bridge experiments showed that the relative orientation of the HR-N and HR-C helices in the complex was antiparallel. Overall, the structure of the hetero-stranded complex is consistent with the structures observed for other type 1 viral fusion proteins in their fusion-competent state.","Tripet, Brian; Howard, Megan W.; Jobling, Michael; Holmes, Randall K.; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Hodges, Robert S.",J Biol Chem,234,30

In this era of technology, healthcare providers especially in lower income countries should have at least basic digital competency if a successful application of technology is to be achieved. The aim of this study was to assess digital competency of healthcare providers among seven public health centers in North-West Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was applied to assess the basic digital competency of healthcare providers working in seven public health centers in North-west Amhara regional state, Ethiopia. Self-administered questionnaire adopted from the European commission’s digital competency framework for assessing digital competency were used. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with basic digital competency with p-value< 0.05 as a rule out for statistical significance. The strength of association was explained in terms of coefficient estimate, adjusted odds ratio and a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULT: From the total of 193 healthcare providers included in the study, 167 of them responded which is a response rate of 86.5%. The majority of respondents 88 (52.7%) were males and the mean age was 28.2 years with a standard deviation of 5.5 years. The result indicated that all items demonstrated an adequate level of internal consistency with Cronbach alpha > 0 .7. Healthcare providers in those public health centers reported that problem solving, safety and communication are the most common challenges encountered. The multivariable logistic regression model indicated that factors such as sex, educational status, profession type, monthly income and years of experience are statistically significant predictors. CONCLUSION: Basic digital competency level of healthcare providers working in public health centers in this setting is relatively low.

Biochemical studies revealed that the active form of the drug targets the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and causes delayed chain-termination. Delayed chain-termination is incomplete, but the continuation of RNA synthesis enables a partial escape from viral proofreading. Remdesivir becomes embedded in the copy of the RNA genome that later serves as a template. Incorporation of an incoming nucleotide triphosphate is now inhibited by the modified template. Knowledge on the mechanism of action matters. Enzymatic inhibition links to antiviral effects in cell cultures, animal models and viral load reduction in patients, which provides the logical chain that is expected for a direct acting antiviral. Hence, remdesivir also serves as a benchmark in current drug development efforts that will hopefully lead to orally available treatments to the benefit of a broader population.","Matthias, Götte",Curr Opin Virol,234,16

The design of manufacturing processes to produce subunit vaccines depends, however, on the inherent biophysical traits presented by an individual antigen of interest. New candidate antigens typically require developing custom processes for each one and may require unique steps to ensure sufficient yields without product-related variants. RESULTS: We describe a holistic approach for the molecular design of recombinant protein antigens—considering both their manufacturability and antigenicity—informed by bioinformatic analyses such as RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and sequence-based prediction tools. We demonstrate this approach by engineering the product sequences of a trivalent non-replicating rotavirus vaccine (NRRV) candidate to improve titers and mitigate product variants caused by N-terminal truncation, hypermannosylation, and aggregation. The three engineered NRRV antigens retained their original antigenicity and immunogenicity, while their improved manufacturability enabled concomitant production and purification of all three serotypes in a single, end-to-end perfusion-based process using the biotechnical yeast Komagataella phaffii. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that molecular engineering of subunit antigens using advanced genomic methods can facilitate their manufacturing in continuous production. Such capabilities have potential to lower the cost and volumetric requirements in manufacturing vaccines based on recombinant protein subunits.

Trust in government and population risk of exposure may influence public perception of the response. Other population-level characteristics, such as country socio-economic development, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and degree of democratic government, may influence perception. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a novel ten-item instrument that asks respondents to rate key aspects of their government’s response to the pandemic (COVID-SCORE). We examined whether the results varied by gender, age group, education level, and monthly income. We also examined the internal and external validity of the index using appropriate predefined variables. To test for dimensionality of the results, we used a principal component analysis (PCA) for the ten survey items. We found that Cronbach’s alpha was 0.92 and that the first component of the PCA explained 60% of variance with the remaining factors having eigenvalues below 1, strongly indicating that the tool is both reliable and unidimensional. Based on responses from 13,426 people randomly selected from the general population in 19 countries, the mean national scores ranged from 35.76 (Ecuador) to 80.48 (China) out of a maximum of 100 points. Heterogeneity in responses was observed across age, gender, education and income with the greatest amount of heterogeneity observed between countries. National scores correlated with respondents’ reported levels of trust in government and with country-level COVID-19 mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-SCORE survey instrument demonstrated satisfactory validity. It may help governments more effectively engage constituents in current and future efforts to control COVID-19. Additional country-specific assessment should be undertaken to measure trends over time and the public perceptions of key aspects of government responses in other countries.","Lazarus, Jeffrey V.; Ratzan, Scott; Palayew, Adam; Billari, Francesco C.; Binagwaho, Agnes; Kimball, Spencer; Larson, Heidi J.; Melegaro, Alessia; Rabin, Kenneth; White, Trenton M.; El-Mohandes, Ayman",PLoS One,234,26

We assessed the real‐time effects of the lockdown on disease expression and lifestyle modifications in pediatric patients with chronic respiratory disorders. METHODS: An anonymous electronic questionnaire was distributed during lockdown (March–May 2020) to caregivers of patients with chronic respiratory disorders. The primary outcome was change in disease expression and the secondary outcomes were changes in lifestyle and caregivers’ emotional status. RESULTS: The clinical status of one‐third of the 445 participating patients (age 0–18 years) reportedly improved, including decreased respiratory symptoms (n = 133, 33%), exacerbation frequency (n = 147, 35%), and use of reliever medications (n = 101, 27.4%). The condition of ~10% of the patients worsened. Clinical improvement was noted mostly in young patients <5 years (p = .001), asthmatic patients (p = .033), and patients with multiple underlying respiratory disorders (p = .015). Patients whose condition significantly worsened were more likely to be >5 years (p < .001), had increased screen time, decreased physical activity, and shorter sleep duration compared to their younger counterparts (p = .008, <.001, and .001, respectively). Caregivers’ reports (n = 236 [58%]) of their own anxiety levels and perceptions of the patients’ elevated health risk were increased, regardless of the children's actual clinical status. CONCLUSION: COVID‐19 lockdown was associated with clinical improvement/stability for most of the surveyed children; however, their caregivers' anxiety level was heightened. An increased sedentary lifestyle was reported mostly in older children.","Cahal, Michal; Amirav, Israel; Diamant, Nir; Be'er, Moria; Besor, Omri; Lavie, Moran",Pediatr Pulmonol,234,16

The high level of mutations of the IB virus (IBV) leads to the emergence of new serotypes and genotypes, and limits the efficacy of routine prevention. Medicinal plants, or substances derived from them, are being tested as options in the prevention of infectious diseases such as IB in many countries. The objective of this study was to investigate extracts of 15 selected medicinal plants for anti-IBV activity. RESULTS: Extracts of S. montana, O. vulgare, M. piperita, M. officinalis, T. vulgaris, H. officinalis, S. officinalis and D. canadense showed anti-IBV activity prior to and during infection, while S. montana showed activity prior to and after infection. M. piperita, O. vulgare and T. vulgaris extracts had > 60 SI. In further studies no virus plaques (plaque reduction rate 100%) or cytopathogenic effect (decrease of TCID(50) from 2.0 to 5.0 log(10)) were detected after IBV treatment with extracts of M. piperita, D. canadense and T. vulgaris at concentrations of extracts ≥0.25 cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) (P < 0.05). Both PFU number and TCID(50) increased after the use of M. piperita, D. canadense, T. vulgaris and M. officinalis extracts, the concentrations of which were 0.125 CC(50) and 0.25 CC(50) (P < 0.05).

Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with mental health outcomes. Result: The results of this survey revealed that symptoms of depression, anxiety, and acute stress were highly prevalent symptoms in the psychiatric patient group. Respondents who were female, unmarried or highly educated were significantly more likely to have the above symptoms. In the family member group, more than half of them felt that the burden of nursing had increased during the epidemic. Subjects with a high degree of burden of care were significantly more likely to exhibit the above mental health symptoms, while females were significantly more likely to have acute stress. Conclusions: The results of this survey revealed a high prevalence of mental health disorder symptoms among psychiatric patients and an increased burden of nursing among their family members after the COVID-19 outbreak in China.

The universal primers and specific TaqMan probes for each of the three genotypes, genotypes 1, 2, and 3, were designed within the 3′-UTR of the CSFV. Non-CSFV swine virus and clinical samples from specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were both demonstrated to be CSFV-negative by RT-MRT-PCR. The diagnostic sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR was determined to be 1 viral copy/μl for each genotype of standard plasmid. For the analytical sensitivity experiment, 100 samples of 14 CSFV genotype 1 strains and 86 samples from CSFV outbreak farms were all detected as CSFV-positive by RT-MRT-PCR, and the genotype results were consistent with the results of sequencing from a previous study. The intra-assay and inter-assay variations of RT-MRT-PCR were below 3% in all experiments. The sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR was the same as the reverse transcription nested PCR (RT-nPCR) and higher than reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and viral isolation from clinical samples. This assay was used further to evaluate the duration of viremia of wild-type CSFV in vaccinated exposed pigs. The results indicated that pigs vaccinated with the E2 subunit vaccine had longer viremia than pigs given the C-strain vaccine, which is compatible with the findings of previous studies. Thus, the new RT-MRT-PCR is a rapid, reproducible, sensitive, and specific genotyping tool for CSFV detection.","Huang, Yu-Liang; Pang, Victor Fei; Pan, Chu-Hsiang; Chen, Tsu-Han; Jong, Ming-Hwa; Huang, Tien-Shine; Jeng, Chian-Ren",J Virol Methods,234,1

We posit current infection control guidelines generally protect HCP from SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthcare setting. METHODS: In this retrospective case series, we use viral genomics to investigate the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCP at a major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest of the United States between 25 March - 27 December, 2020. We obtain limited epidemiological data through informal interviews and review of the electronic health record. We combine epidemiological information with healthcare-associated viral sequences and with viral sequences collected in the broader community to infer the most likely source of infection in HCP. RESULTS: We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 95 HCP and 137 possible patient contact sequences. The majority of HCP infections could not be linked to a patient or co-worker (55/95; 57.9%) and were genetically similar to viruses circulating concurrently in the community. We found 10.5% of infections could be traced to a coworker (10/95). Strikingly, only 4.2% of HCP infections could be traced to a patient source (4/95). CONCLUSIONS: Infections among HCP add further strain to the healthcare system and put patients, HCP, and communities at risk. We found no evidence for healthcare-associated transmission in the majority of HCP infections evaluated here. Though we cannot rule out the possibility of cryptic healthcare-associated transmission, it appears that HCP most commonly becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2 via community exposure. This emphasizes the ongoing importance of mask-wearing, physical distancing, robust testing programs, and rapid distribution of vaccines.","Braun, Katarina M; Moreno, Gage K; Buys, Ashley; Somsen, Elizabeth D; Bobholz, Max; Accola, Molly A; Anderson, Laura; Rehrauer, William M; Baker, David A; Safdar, Nasia; Lepak, Alexander J; O’Connor, David H; Friedrich, Thomas C",Clin Infect Dis,234,1

This limits the understanding of the underlying biology of depression and raises questions about the transferability of findings between populations. Objective: To investigate the genetics of depression among individuals of East Asian and European descent living in different geographic locations, and with different outcome definitions for depression. Design, Setting, and Participants: Genome-wide association analyses followed by meta-analysis, which included data from 9 cohort and case-control data sets comprising individuals with depression and control individuals of East Asian descent. This study was conducted between January 2019 and May 2021. Exposures: Associations of genetic variants with depression risk were assessed using generalized linear mixed models and logistic regression. The results were combined across studies using fixed-effects meta-analyses. These were subsequently also meta-analyzed with the largest published GWAS for depression among individuals of European descent. Additional meta-analyses were carried out separately by outcome definition (clinical depression vs symptom-based depression) and region (East Asian countries vs Western countries) for East Asian ancestry cohorts. Main Outcomes and Measures: Depression status was defined based on health records and self-report questionnaires. Results: There were a total of 194â¯548 study participants (approximate mean age, 51.3 years; 62.8% women). Participants included 15â¯771 individuals with depression and 178â¯777 control individuals of East Asian descent. Five novel associations were identified, including 1 in the meta-analysis for broad depression among those of East Asian descent: rs4656484 (ß = -0.018, SE = 0.003, P = 4.43x10-8) at 1q24.1. Another locus at 7p21.2 was associated in a meta-analysis restricted to geographically East Asian studies (ß = 0.028, SE = 0.005, P = 6.48x10-9 for rs10240457). The lead variants of these 2 novel loci were not associated with depression risk in European ancestry cohorts (ß = -0.003, SE = 0.005, P = .53 for rs4656484 and ß = -0.005, SE = 0.004, P = .28 for rs10240457). Only 11% of depression loci previously identified in individuals of European descent reached nominal significance levels in the individuals of East Asian descent. The transancestry genetic correlation between cohorts of East Asian and European descent for clinical depression was r = 0.413 (SE = 0.159). Clinical depression risk was negatively genetically correlated with body mass index in individuals of East Asian descent (r = -0.212, SE = 0.084), contrary to findings for individuals of European descent. Conclusions and Relevance: These results support caution against generalizing findings about depression risk factors across populations and highlight the need to increase the ancestral and geographic diversity of samples with consistent phenotyping.","Giannakopoulou, Olga; Lin, Kuang; Meng, Xiangrui; Su, Mei-Hsin; Kuo, Po-Hsiu; Peterson, Roseann E; Awasthi, Swapnil; Moscati, Arden; Coleman, Jonathan R I; Bass, Nick; Millwood, Iona Y; Chen, Yiping; Chen, Zhengming; Chen, Hsi-Chung; Lu, Mong-Liang; Huang, Ming-Chyi; Chen, Chun-Hsin; Stahl, Eli A; Loos, Ruth J F; Mullins, Niamh; Ursano, Robert J; Kessler, Ronald C; Stein, Murray B; Sen, Srijan; Scott, Laura J; Burmeister, Margit; Fang, Yu; Tyrrell, Jess; Jiang, Yunxuan; Tian, Chao; McIntosh, Andrew M; Ripke, Stephan; Dunn, Erin C; Kendler, Kenneth S; Walters, Robin G; Lewis, Cathryn M; Kuchenbaecker, Karoline","JAMA psychiatry (Chic.

In the present study, we investigated the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, which plays a major role in susceptibility to viral infections, and the mortality of COVID-19. Methods: data of allele frequencies of HLA-A, -B and -C and COVID-19 mortality were obtained for 74 countries from the Allele Frequency Net Database and worldometer.info. Association between allele frequency of each HLA and mortality was assessed by linear regression followed by multivariable regression. Subsequently, association of HLA-C*05 to its receptor KIR2DS4fl, expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, and differential mortality to historic pandemics were analyzed. Results: HLA-A*01, -B*07, -B*08, -B*44 and -C*05 were significantly associated with the risk of deaths (adjusted p = 0.040, 0.00081, 0.047, 0.0022, 0.00032, respectively), but only HLA-C*05 remained statistically significant (p = 0.000027) after multivariable regression. A 1% increase in the allele frequency of HLA-C*05 was associated with an increase of 44 deaths/million. Countries with different mortality could be categorized by the distribution of HLA-C*05 and its receptor KIR2DS4fl, which in combination cause NK cell-induced hyperactive immune response. Countries with similar ethnic and/or geographic background responded in a similar pattern to each pandemic. Conclusions: we demonstrated that allele frequency of HLA-C*05 and the distribution pattern with its receptor KIR2DS4fl strongly correlated with COVID-19 mortality. Host genetic variance of innate immunity may contribute to the difference in mortality among various countries and further investigation using patient samples is warranted.","Sakuraba, Atsushi; Haider, Haider; Sato, Toshiro",Viruses,234,20

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved with endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkablely, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1 did not affect endothelial activation. These findings are well consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.","Qian, Yisong; Lei, Tianhua; Patel, Parth S.; Lee, Chi H; Monaghan-Nichols, Paula; Xin, Hong-Bo; Qiu, Jianming; Fu, Mingui",bioRxiv,234,21

In this article, we provide a preliminary phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis of this new virus. A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using the 29 available whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV and two whole genome sequences that are highly similar sequences from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus available in GeneBank. We are able to clarify the mechanism of transmission among the countries which have provided the 2019-nCoV sequence isolates from their patients. The Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that the 2019–2020 nCoV most probably originated from the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the Rhinolophus bat family.

Other viruses in the same phylogenetic group have been responsible for previous regional outbreaks, including SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin, similar to the causative viruses of these previous outbreaks. The repetitive introduction of animal viruses into human populations resulting in disease outbreaks suggests that similar future epidemics are inevitable. Therefore, understanding the molecular origin and ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 will provide critical insights for preparing for and preventing future outbreaks. A key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is its propensity for genetic recombination across host species boundaries. Consequently, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 harbors signatures of multiple recombination events, likely encompassing multiple species and broad geographic regions. Other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome show the impact of purifying selection. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which enables the virus to enter host cells, exhibits signatures of both purifying selection and ancestral recombination events, leading to an effective S protein capable of infecting human and many other mammalian cells. The global spread and explosive growth of the SARS-CoV-2 population (within human hosts) has contributed additional mutational variability into this genome, increasing opportunities for future recombination.","Singh, Devika; Yi, Soojin V.",Exp Mol Med,234,1

Virtual platforms have potential advantages such as accessibility and availability but simply transferring educational material to the online environment may not ensure high quality learning. Clinical examination is a fundamental principle of medical assessment, and this study aimed to assess the role of technology in teaching these skills. AIMS/OBJECTIVES: To determine whether three teaching modalities were of equal efficacy in teaching examination of the shoulder joint to naïve medical students. METHODS: Sixty-seven pre-clinical medical students naïve to large joint examination were recruited. Participants completed a learning style questionnaire and were then block randomised to three study: textbook study, face-to-face seminar, or video tutorial via online platform. The same examination technique was taught in all groups, with the intervention being the method of delivery All second year students were eligible for inclusion. The single exclusion criteria was previous exposure to clinical examination teaching. Students were assessed using a standardised scoring system at baseline (pre-intervention), and days 5 and 19 post-intervention (maximum score 30). Assessors were blinded to group allocation. The primary outcome was assessment score at day 5 post intervention. RESULTS: There was no difference between the three groups at baseline assessment (mean scores 2.4 for textbook, 2.8 for face-to-face, and 3.1 for video; p = 0.267). Mean post-intervention scores were 16.5 textbook, 25.5 face-to-face, and 22.4 video (p < 0.001, η(2) = .449). There was no change between day 5 and day 19 post-intervention assessment scores in any group (p = 0.373), Preferred learning style did not affect scores (p = 0.543). CONCLUSION: Face-to-face teaching was the most effective method for teaching clinical examination of the shoulder. Technology can potentially increase accessibility and remove geographic barriers, but is not as effective if teaching techniques are simply mirrored in an online format. Online platforms allow in depth data analysis of how learners interact with educational material and this may have value in improving the design of online educational materials, and is a potential area for further research.

Emerging data indicate that phase II antioxidant enzyme pathways could play a role in virus-associated inflammation and immune clearance. While Nrf2-dependent gene expression is known to modify inflammation, a mechanistic role in viral susceptibility and clearance has yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we utilized differentiated human nasal epithelial cells (NEC) and an enzymatic virus-like particle entry assay, to examine the role Nrf2-dependent gene expression has on viral entry and replication. Herein, lentiviral vectors that express Nrf2-specific short hairpin (sh)-RNA effectively decreased both Nrf2 mRNA and Nrf2 protein expression in transduced human NEC from healthy volunteers. Nrf2 knockdown correlated with a significant increase in influenza virus entry and replication. Conversely, supplementation with the potent Nrf2 activators sulforaphane (SFN) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) significantly decreased viral entry and replication. The suppressive effects of EGCG on viral replication were abolished in cells with knocked down Nrf2 expression, suggesting a causal relationship between EGCG-induced activation of Nrf2 and ability to protect against viral infection. Interestingly, the induction of Nrf2 via nutritional supplements SFN and EGCG, increased antiviral mediators/responses; RIG-I, IFN-β, and MxA at baseline in the absence of infection. Our data indicate that there is an inverse relationship between the levels of Nrf2 expression, and viral entry/replication. We also demonstrate that supplementation with Nrf2-activating antioxidants inhibit viral replication in human NEC, which may prove to be an attractive therapeutic intervention. Taken together, these data indicate potential mechanisms by which Nrf2-dependent gene expression regulates susceptibility to influenza in human epithelial cells.","Kesic, Matthew J.; Simmons, Steven O.; Bauer, Rebecca; Jaspers, Ilona",Free Radical Biology and Medicine,234,9

Upon analysis of published and proprietary data, we concluded that these three medical gases can manipulate the neuroendocrine system, by modulating the production or release of hormones via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid, hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes, or the gastrointestinal pathway. With repeated administration of the gases over time, these modulations become a predictable consequence of conditioned homeostatic reflexes, resulting in regulation of physiological activity. For example, the regular activation of the unconditioned defense reflex in response to repeated intoxication by ozone leads to the formation of an anticipatory stable conditioned response, which counteracts the toxic action of O(3). The concept of a Pavlovian conditioned reflex (or hormoligosis) is a brief metaphor for the understanding the therapeutic effect of systemic ozone therapy.","Nazarov, Eugene Iv.; Khlusov, Igor Alb.; Noda, Mami",Med Gas Res,234,2

This manuscript explored FPV molecular epidemiology at both Italian and international levels and the possible association between viral phylogeny and disease severity. Sequences from clinical cases of feline panleukopenia in Italy were obtained from 2011 to 2019, and the etiological agent was characterized, distinguishing FPV from CPV. Phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses were conducted on Italian and international sequences. Moreover, the association between the viral sequence and clinical variables was evaluated on a group of highly characterized patients. After its origin in the 1920s, FPV showed a constant population size until a more recent expansion since 2000. Few long-distance introduction events characterized FPV spreading, however, most of its evolution occurred locally. Although without a strong statistical association, several clinical variables appeared influenced by viral phylogeny, suggesting a differential virulence potentially characterizing FPV strains. These results stress the importance of the continuous study of viral evolution and its repercussions on the disease clinical aspects.","Tucciarone, Claudia Maria; Franzo, Giovanni; Legnardi, Matteo; Lazzaro, Elena; Zoia, Andrea; Petini, Matteo; Furlanello, Tommaso; Caldin, Marco; Cecchinato, Mattia; Drigo, Michele",Viruses,234,1

The assumption is that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is still circulating and that occasional or seasonal outbreaks will occur. They recommend that the first step should be to assess how many patch tests each clinic can handle and review the waiting list to prioritize cases according to disease severity and urgency. Digital technologies can, where possible, be used to send and receive the documentation necessary for the patch test (information, instructions, informed consent, etc.). If the necessary infrastructure is available, patients can be offered the option of a remote initial consultation. Likewise, in selected cases, the patch test results can be read in a virtual visit using photographs taken by the patient or a video visit can be scheduled to allow the physician to evaluate the site of application remotely. These measures will reduce the number of face-to-face visits required, but will not affect the time spent on each case, which must be scheduled in the normal manner. All of these recommendations are suggestions and should be adapted to the needs and possibilities of each health centre.","Carrascosa, J M; Pastor-Nieto, M A; Ruiz-Gonzalez, I; Silvestre, J F; Borrego, L; Gatica-Ortega, M E; Gimenez-Arnau, A Mº",Actas Dermosifiliogr,234,22

On January 17, 2021, a COVID-19 clustered outbreak caused by B.1.1.7 variant occurred in a community in Daxing District, Beijing, China. Three weeks prior, another non-variant (lineage B.1.470) COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Shunyi District, Beijing. This study aimed to investigate the clinical features of B.1.1.7 variant infection. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted on COVID-19 cases admitted to Ditan hospital since January 2020. Data of 74 COVID-19 cases from two independent COVID-19 outbreaks in Beijing were extracted as study subjects from a Cloud Database established in Ditan hospital, which included 41 Shunyi cases (Shunyi B.1.470 group) and 33 Daxing cases (Daxing B.1.1.7 group) that have been hospitalized since December 25, 2020 and January 17, 2021, respectively. We conducted a comparison of the clinical characteristics, RT-qPCR results and genomic features between the two groups. Findings: Cases from Daxing B.1.1.7 group (15 [45.5%] male; median age, 39 years [range, 30.5, 62.5]) and cases from Shunyi B.1.470 group (25 [61.0%] male; median age, 31 years [range, 27.5, 41.0]) had a statistically significant difference in median age (P =0.014). Seven clinical indicators of Daxing B.1.1.7 group were significantly higher than Shunyi B.1.470 group including patients having fever over 38 (14/33 [46.43%] in Daxing B.1.1.7 group vs. 9/41 (21.95%) in Shunyi B.1.470 group [P = 0 .015]), C-reactive protein ([CRP, mg/L], 4.30 [2.45, 12.1] vs. 1.80, [0.85, 4.95], [P = 0.005]), Serum amyloid A ([SAA, mg/L], 21.50 [12.50, 50.70] vs. 12.00 [5.20, 26.95], [P = 0.003]), Creatine Kinase ([CK, U/L]), 110.50 [53.15,152.40] vs. 70.40 [54.35,103.05], [P = 0.040]), D-dimer ([DD, mg/L], 0.31 [0.20, 0.48] vs. 0.24 [0.17,0.31], [P = 0.038]), CD4+ T lymphocyte ([CD4+ T, mg/L], [P = 0.003]) , and Ground-glass opacity (GGO) in lung (15/33 [45.45%] vs. 5/41 [12.20%], [P =0.001]). After adjusting for the age factor, B.1.1.7 variant infection was the risk factor for CRP (P = 0.045, Odds ratio [OR] 2.791, CI [1.025, 0.8610]), SAA (0.011, 5.031, [1.459, 17.354]), CK (0.034, 4.34, [0.05, 0.91]), CD4+ T ( 0.029, 3.31, [1.13, 9.71]), and GGO (0.005, 5.418, [1.656, 17.729]) of patients. The median Ct value of RT-qPCR tests of the N-gene target in the Daxing B.1.1.7 group was significantly lower than the Shunyi B.1.470 group (P=0.036). The phylogenetic analysis showed that only 2 amino acid mutations in spike protein were detected in B.1.470 strains while B.1.1.7 strains had 3 deletions and 7 mutations. Interpretation: Clinical features including a more serious inflammatory response, pneumonia and a possible higher viral load were detected in the cases infected with B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. It could therefore be inferred that the B.1.1.7 variant may have increased pathogenicity.","Song, Y.; Ge, Z.; Cui, S.; Tian, D.; Wan, G.; Zhu, S.; Wang, X.; Wang, Y.; Zhao, X.; Xiang, P.; Xu, Y.; Zhang, T.; Liu, L.; Liu, G.; Tan, J.; Zhang, W.; Xu, W.; Chen, Z.",,234,21

A total of 216 participants (men: n = 112, women: n = 114) were included in the present study. They were divided into three groups [i.e., inactive group (IG): less than 600 metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs), n = 131; minimally active group (MAG): from 600 to 2,999 METs, n = 49; and health-enhancing PA group (HEPAG): 3,000 + METs, n = 36] based on their habitual PA level in the period of confinement. WHO Quality of Life Instrument-Short Form (WHOQOL-BREF) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire-BREF (IPAQ-BREF) questionnaires were used to assess QoL and PA intensities. The main findings of the present study showed that MAG and HEPAG have better total PA, physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL domains scores than IG (all, p < 0.01). Small to large correlations (r ranging from 0.14 to 0.72) were also observed between total PA, total walking activity, total moderate-intensity PA, total vigorous-intensity PA, and QoL domains (all, p < 0.01). PA with light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensities can be well recommended to decrease the negative psychosocial effect of confinement. However, longitudinal studies are needed to draw causal inferences and underpin more robust and evidence-based and informed recommendations.","Slimani, Maamer; Paravlic, Armin; Mbarek, Faten; Bragazzi, Nicola L.; Tod, David",Front Psychol,234,1

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the change in children’s and adolescents’ prevention and vaccination behaviors amid China’s COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in mid-March 2020 using proportional quota sampling in Wuhan (the epidemic epicenter) and Shanghai (a nonepicenter). Data were collected from 1655 parents with children aged 3 to 17 years. Children’s and adolescents’ prevention behaviors and regular vaccination behaviors before and during the epidemic were assessed. Descriptive analyses were used to investigate respondents’ characteristics, public health prevention behaviors, unproven protection behaviors, and vaccination behaviors before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. Univariate analyses were performed to compare differences in outcome measures between cities and family characteristics, using chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests (if expected frequency was <5) and analyses of variance. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify the factors and disparities associated with prevention and vaccination behaviors. RESULTS: Parent-reported prevention behaviors increased among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic compared with those before the epidemic. During the epidemic, 82.2% (638/776) of children or adolescents always wore masks when going out compared with 31.5% (521/1655) before the epidemic; in addition, 25.0% (414/1655) and 79.8% (1321/1655) had increased their frequency and duration of handwashing, respectively, although only 46.9% (776/1655) went out during the epidemic. Meanwhile, 56.1% (928/1655) of the families took unproven remedies against COVID-19. Parent-reported vaccination behaviors showed mixed results, with 74.8% (468/626) delaying scheduled vaccinations and 80.9% (1339/1655) planning to have their children get the influenza vaccination after the epidemic. Regarding socioeconomic status, children and adolescents from larger families and whose parents had lower education levels were less likely to improve prevention behaviors but more likely to take unproven remedies. Girls were less likely than boys to always wear a mask when going out and wash their hands. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention behaviors and attitudes toward influenza vaccination have improved during the COVID-19 epidemic. Public health prevention measures should be continuously promoted, particularly among girls, parents with lower education levels, and larger families. Meanwhile, misinformation about COVID-19 remains a serious challenge and needs to be addressed by public health stakeholders.","Hou, Zhiyuan; Song, Suhang; Du, Fanxing; Shi, Lu; Zhang, Donglan; Lin, Leesa; Yu, Hongjie",JMIR Public Health Surveill,234,21

More than 35% reported 76% to 100% of their caseload transitioned to telehealth. Most respondents perceived that telehealth was somewhat or very effective for caregivers (90.3%) and children (77.1%) and felt somewhat or very confident providing telehealth (73.2%). However, those practicing in school-based settings rated perceived effectiveness and confidence lower than PTs in other settings. Ultimately, 76.1% of respondents would consider providing telehealth in the future.

Several clinical variants of SCD have been elucidated, all driven by two fundamental pathophysiologic processes: RBC hemolysis and intermittent vaso-occlusive vasculopathy resulting in tissue ischemia/infarction. These two processes underscore the many complications and eventual multi-organ damage that may develop in patients with the most severe types of SCD. Cardiopulmonary complications including heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and acute chest syndrome (ACS) are major drivers of morbidity and mortality among patients with SCD. With regards to ACS, patients often present with fever, cough and shortness of breath caused by vaso-occlusive crisis affecting the lungs. This is particular concerning in view of its similar features to symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Methods We retrospectively identified SCD patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to Beaumont hospitals in Michigan between March 1st 2020 and July 1st 2020. Data was abstracted using the ICD 10 code of U07. 1 for COVID-19, ICD 9 and 10 codes of 282.60 and D57 for sickle cell disease. We excluded patients with sickle cell trait. Data regarding the demographics, presentation, management and outcomes were abstracted. Results A total of eleven patients with sickle cell disease were identified as having a positive SARS-Cov19 polymerase chain reaction test (Table I). All were African American and predominantly female (64%) with a mean age of 44 (22-60) years and mean BMI of 30.2 kg/m2. Genotypes identified were HbSS in 5 (45%) patients, HbSC in 4 (36%), HbS/beta-thalassemia in 1 (9%) and HbS/alpha-thalassemia in 1 (9%). All of the patients had seen a haematologist since their diagnosis but none of the patients were on hydroxyurea, voxeloter, L-glutamine or crizanlizumab at admission. The predominant clinical presentation was fever, chest pain, chills, exertional shortness of breath and cough but this was not consistent across all patients. All the patients were managed with intravenous hydration, pain management as well as hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin per institutional guideline at that time. Three patients (cases 1-3) had recurrent visits to the hospital for similar symptoms and new bone pain crises. Case 1 had a pulmonary embolus which was evident on re-admission. Two patients (cases 3 and 10) succumbed to COVID-19. Two patients (cases 5 and 7) presented with bone pain crisis and no respiratory symptoms, but chest imaging was suggestive of COVID-19 infection necessitating treatment with antibiotics, possibly indicating that the virus can trigger vaso-occlusive crises without respiratory symptoms. Case 8 had a high Charlson comorbidity index and age over 60, had the lengthiest hospital stay complicated by renal failure and polyneuropathy, and was discharged to a long-term acute care facility: an outcome which is consistent with current data showing that the elderly and unfit patients are more likely to have a higher morbidity and mortality with COVID-19. Conclusion To date, there no compelling evidence to provide guidelines for the management of SCD patients with COVID-19. However, following existing recommendations in managing acute chest syndrome and those for COVID-19 symptomatic infection, is a good place to start. We continue to seek to improve management of these patients as new evidence of successful treatment emerges, and also encourage patients to participate in clinical trials.

Given reports of GI involvement and viral shedding in the stool, it is unsurprising there are concerns that endoscopic equipment may be a potential vector of viral transmission. Here, we provide an overview of existing practices for endoscope reprocessing, recent developments in the field, and challenges in the COVID-19 environment. Current multi-society guidelines do not advise any change to endoscope disinfection protocols but emphasize strict adherence to recommended practices. However, endoscopy reprocessing staff may benefit from supplemental personal protective equipment measures, especially in high risk situations. Because thorough endoscope reprocessing is highly operator dependent, adequate training of personnel is critical for proper manual cleaning and disinfection of endoscopes that have potential to harbor virus. Bacterial contamination of duodenoscopes has caused outbreaks of infection from multidrug resistant organisms, highlighting vulnerable areas. The emphasis of current studies is on optimization of disinfection and drying, minimization of simethicone use, and on quality control of endoscope reprocessing with sampling and microbiological culturing. Recent advances include novel approaches to endoscope sterilization, infection barrier methods, and design of partially or fully disposable duodenoscopes. Overall, the available data indicate that, when correctly executed, current reprocessing practices are sufficient in preventing SARS-COV-2 transmission.","Chua, Tiffany; Halim, Nasir; Reicher, Sofiya",Tech Innov Gastrointest Endosc,234,26

We quantified T cells reactive to structural proteins (M, NP, and Spike) using ELISpot and cytokine secretion in whole blood. Frequencies of SARS-CoV-2–specific T cells were similar between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, but the former showed an increased IFN-γ and IL-2 production. This was associated with a proportional secretion of IL-10 and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) only in asymptomatic infection, while a disproportionate secretion of inflammatory cytokines was triggered by SARS-CoV-2–specific T cell activation in symptomatic individuals. Thus, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals are not characterized by weak antiviral immunity; on the contrary, they mount a highly functional virus-specific cellular immune response.","Le Bert, Nina; Clapham, Hannah E.; Tan, Anthony T.; Chia, Wan Ni; Tham, Christine Y.L.; Lim, Jane M.; Kunasegaran, Kamini; Tan, Linda Wei Lin; Dutertre, Charles-Antoine; Shankar, Nivedita; Lim, Joey M.E.; Sun, Louisa Jin; Zahari, Marina; Tun, Zaw Myo; Kumar, Vishakha; Lim, Beng Lee; Lim, Siew Hoon; Chia, Adeline; Tan, Yee-Joo; Tambyah, Paul Anantharajah; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Lye, David; Low, Jenny G.H.; Wang, Lin-Fa; Wan, Wei Yee; Hsu, Li Yang; Bertoletti, Antonio; Tam, Clarence C.",J Exp Med,234,17

The endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) of glomerular endothelial cells has been reported to play a crucial role in DN. As a specific form of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, EndMT and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition may exhibit mutual modulators. Profilin 2 (PFN2) has been reported to participate in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ets1) and lysine methyltransferase 5A (KMT5A) have been reported to contribute to high glucose-mediated endothelial injury and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In this study, we hypothesize ets1 associates with KMT5A to modulate PFN2 transcription, thus participating in high glucose-mediated EndMT in glomerular endothelial cells. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect protein levels in the kidney tissues and/or aorta tissues of human subjects and rats. Western blot, qPCR and immunofluorescence were performed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and dual luciferase assays were performed to assess transcriptional activity. The difference between the groups was compared by two-tailed unpaired t-tests or one-way ANOVAs. RESULTS: Our data indicated that vimentin, αSMA, S100A4 and PFN2 levels were increased, and CD31 levels were reduced in glomerular endothelial cells of DN patients and rats. Our cell experiments showed that high glucose induced EndMT by augmenting PFN2 expression in HUVECs. Moreover, high glucose increased ets1 expression. si-ets1 suppressed high glucose-induced PFN2 levels and EndMT. ets1 overexpression-mediated EndMT was reversed by si-PFN2. Furthermore, ets1 was determined to associate with KMT5A. High glucose attenuated KMT5A levels and histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me1), one of the downstream targets of KMT5A. KMT5A upregulation suppressed high glucose-induced PFN2 levels and EndMT. sh-KMT5A-mediated EndMT was counteracted by si-PFN2. Furthermore, H4K20me1 and ets1 occupied the PFN2 promoter region. sh-KMT5A cooperated with ets1 overexpression to activate PFN2 promoter activity. Our in vivo study demonstrated that KMT5A was reduced, while ets1 was augmented, in glomerular endothelial cells of DN patients and rats. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that ets1 cooperated with KMT5A to transcribe PFN2, thus contributing to hyperglycemia-induced EndMT in the glomerular endothelial cells of DN patients and rats.

To prevent and mitigate these disasters it is critical to rapidly and accurately identify the characteristics of the contaminant sources. Although remarkable achievements have been made in identifying a single indoor contaminant source in recent years, the issues related to multiple contaminant sources are still challenging. This study presents a method for identifying the exact locations, emission rates, and release time of multiple indoor contaminant sources simultaneously released at constant rates, by considering sensor thresholds and measurement errors. The method uses a two-stage procedure for rapid source identification. Before the release of contaminants, only a limited number of time-consuming computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations need to be conducted. After the release of contaminants, the method can be executed in real-time. Through case studies in a three-dimensional office the method was numerically demonstrated and validated, and the results show that the method is effective and feasible. The effects of sensor threshold, measurement error and total sampling time on the source identification performance were analysed, and the limitations and applicability of the method were also discussed.","Cai, Hao; Li, Xianting; Chen, Zhilong; Wang, Mingyang",Build Environ,234,26

Adopting a mixed-methods design, we worked across three music education hubs in the UK, with a total 13 virtual music groups. These included a range of mainstream ensembles, inclusive ensembles targeting young people with special educational needs and/or disabilities, and inclusive music production spaces, targeting young people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Reported progress in intra- and inter-personal psychological outcomes was investigated using quantitative and qualitative staff session reports, which were collected since before the pandemic (n1 for in-person sessions = 87, n2 for virtual sessions = 68), and surveys distributed to tutors, young people, and their parents during the first and second United Kingdom (UK) national lockdowns (n3 for qualitative responses = 240, n4 for quantitative responses = 96). Satisfaction of three basic psychological needs of self-determination theory and their relation to joint music-making in virtual spaces was also observed in real time by the researchers performing quantitative checklist observations on 16 separate occasions. Findings indicated that virtual music groups represented a meaningful psychological resource for the participating children and young people, especially considering the lack of opportunities offered by their schools and other extra-curricular activities. Through their participation with virtual group music-making activities, young people used music as a tool for self-expression and emotion management, restored lost musical identities and confidence, and preserved treasured social connections. Virtual alternatives to group music-making appear to indirectly nurture the sense of belongingness, mediated by supportive staff behaviors, but their direct connection, which has been widely reported for in-person group music-making experiences, has not been observed in virtual music groups.","Levstek, Maruša; Barnby, Rubie Mai; Pocock, Katherine L.; Banerjee, Robin",Front Psychol,234,18

This mission will be implemented through the development, integration and application of single-cell multi-omics and imaging, artificial intelligence and patient-derived experimental disease models during the progression from health to disease. The analysis of large molecular and clinical datasets will identify molecular mechanisms, create predictive computational models of disease progression, and reveal new drug targets and therapies. The timely detection and interception of disease embedded in an ethical and patient-centred vision will be achieved through interactions across academia, hospitals, patient associations, health data management systems and industry. The application of this strategy to key medical challenges in cancer, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, and infectious, chronic inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases at the single-cell level will usher in cell-based interceptive medicine in Europe over the next decade.","Rajewsky, Nikolaus; Almouzni, Geneviève; Gorski, Stanislaw A.; Aerts, Stein; Amit, Ido; Bertero, Michela G.; Bock, Christoph; Bredenoord, Annelien L.; Cavalli, Giacomo; Chiocca, Susanna; Clevers, Hans; De Strooper, Bart; Eggert, Angelika; Ellenberg, Jan; Fernández, Xosé M.; Figlerowicz, Marek; Gasser, Susan M.; Hubner, Norbert; Kjems, Jørgen; Knoblich, Jürgen A.; Krabbe, Grietje; Lichter, Peter; Linnarsson, Sten; Marine, Jean-Christophe; Marioni, John C.; Marti-Renom, Marc A.; Netea, Mihai G.; Nickel, Dörthe; Nollmann, Marcelo; Novak, Halina R.; Parkinson, Helen; Piccolo, Stefano; Pinheiro, Inês; Pombo, Ana; Popp, Christian; Reik, Wolf; Roman-Roman, Sergio; Rosenstiel, Philip; Schultze, Joachim L.; Stegle, Oliver; Tanay, Amos; Testa, Giuseppe; Thanos, Dimitris; Theis, Fabian J.; Torres-Padilla, Maria-Elena; Valencia, Alfonso; Vallot, Céline; van Oudenaarden, Alexander; Vidal, Marie; Voet, Thierry",Nature,234,17

Methods: Primers showing optimal in-silico features were subjected to analytical sensitivity and specificity to assess the limit of detection (LOD) and cross-reaction with closely- and distantly-related viral species, and clinically prominent bacterial and fungal species. In order to evaluate the clinical utility, our RT-LAMP was subjected to a large number of clinical samples, including 213 negative and 47 positive patients, relative to two commercial quantitative RT-PCR assays. Results: The analytical specificity and sensitivity of our assay was 100% and 500 copies/ml when serial dilution was performed in both water and sputum. Subjecting our RT-LAMP assay to clinical samples showed a high degree of specificity (99.5%), sensitivity (91.4%), positive predictive value (97.7%), and negative predictive value (98.1%) when used relative to qRT-PCR. Our RT-LAMP assay was two times faster than qRT-PCR and is storable at room temperature. A suspected case that later became positive tested positive using both our RT-LAMP and the two qRT-PCR assays, which shows the capability of our assay for screening purposes. Conclusions: We present a rapid RT-LAMP assay that could extend the capacity of laboratories to process two times more clinical samples relative to qRT-PCR and potentially could be used for high-throughput screening purposes when demand is increasing at critical situations.","Jiang, Minghua; Pan, Weihua; Arasthfer, Amir; Fang, Wenjie; Ling, Liyan; Fang, Hua; Daneshnia, Farnaz; Yu, Jian; Liao, Wanqing; Pei, Hao; Li, Xiaojing; Lass-Flörl, Cornelia",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,234,24

Coinfections of respiratory viruses and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens are common. AIM: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of co-infection between respiratory pathogens including viruses, bacteria and atypical bacteria in a sample of Egyptian children presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. METHODS: This one-year prospective cohort study conducted in Abo El Rish Pediatric Hospital, Cairo University over one year included children presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Enrolled children were subjected to nasopharyngeal swabs or throat swabs and then processed to detect viral, bacterial and atypical bacterial causative agents by culture), retrotranscription polymerase, Monoplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Viral etiological agents were detected in 20 cases (20.8%), while 76 patients (79.2%) had no definite viral aetiology. The most abundant virus detected was Rhinovirus in 36 (27.3%), followed by 21 (15.9%) were positive for RSV, 12 (9.1%) were positive for HMPV, 6 (4.5%) were positive for adenovirus and 3 (2.3%) were positive for influenza B. For Atypical bacterial causes Mycoplasma were positive for 9 (6.8%) cases and one case was positive for Bordetella parapertussis. Viral and atypical bacteria Co infection were detected in 14 (10.6%) of cases. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that coinfection with bacteria or atypical bacteria in children with acute respiratory tract infection is common and this co-infection can induce serious illness. The multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction should become an essential tool for epidemiological studies and can fill the gap between clinical presentation and definitive diagnosis.","Baroudy, Nevine R.

AIM: To assess the effect of the pandemic on antibiotic prescribing, accounting for changes in consultations for respiratory and urinary tract infections (RTIs/UTIs). DESIGN AND SETTING: Population-based cohort study using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database from January 2017 to September 2020. METHOD: Interrupted time-series analysis evaluated changes in antibiotic prescribing and RTI/UTI consultations adjusting for age, sex, season, and secular trends. The authors assessed the proportion of COVID-19 episodes associated with antibiotic prescribing. RESULTS: There were 253 655 registered patients in 2017 and 232 218 in 2020, with 559 461 antibiotic prescriptions, 216 110 RTI consultations, and 36 402 UTI consultations. Compared with prepandemic months, March 2020 was associated with higher antibiotic prescribing (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.16). Antibiotic prescribing fell below predicted rates between April and August 2020, reaching a minimum in May (ARR 0.73; 95% CI = 0.71 to 0.75). Pandemic months were associated with lower rates of RTI/UTI consultations, particularly in April for RTIs (ARR 0.23; 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.25). There were small reductions in the proportion of RTI consultations with antibiotic prescribed and no reduction for UTIs. Among 25 889 COVID-19 patients, 2942 (11%) had antibiotics within a COVID-19 episode. CONCLUSION: Pandemic months were initially associated with increased antibiotic prescribing, which then fell below expected levels during the national lockdown. Findings are reassuring that antibiotic stewardship priorities have not been neglected because of COVID-19. Research is required into the effects of reduced RTI/UTI consultations on incidence of serious bacterial infections.","Rezel-Potts, Emma; L’Esperance, Veline; Gulliford, Martin C",British Journal of General Practice,234,20

Few studies have documented the relationship between the absence of labour companions and mistreatment of women during childbirth in low-income and middle-income countries using a standardised tool. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the WHO multi-country study on how women are treated during childbirth, where a cross-sectional community survey was conducted with women up to 8 weeks after childbirth in Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Myanmar. Descriptive analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine whether labour companionship was associated with various types of mistreatment. RESULTS: Of 2672 women, about half (50.4%) reported the presence of a labour companion. Approximately half (49.6%) of these women reported that the timing of support was during labour and after childbirth and most of the labour companions (47.0%) were their family members. Across Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria, women without a labour companion were more likely to report physical abuse, non-consented medical procedures and poor communication compared with women with a labour companion. However, there were country-level variations. In Guinea, the absence of labour companionship was associated with any physical abuse, verbal abuse, or stigma or discrimination (adjusted OR (AOR) 3.6, 1.9–6.9) and non-consented vaginal examinations (AOR 3.2, 1.6–6.4). In Ghana, it was associated with non-consented vaginal examinations (AOR 2.3, 1.7–3.1) and poor communication (AOR 2.0, 1.3–3.2). In Nigeria, it was associated with longer wait times (AOR 0.6, 0.3–0.9). CONCLUSION: Labour companionship is associated with lower levels of some forms of mistreatment that women experience during childbirth, depending on the setting. Further work is needed to ascertain how best to implement context-specific labour companionship to ensure benefits while maintaining women’s choices and autonomy.","Balde, Mamadou Dioulde; Nasiri, Khalidha; Mehrtash, Hedieh; Soumah, Anne-Marie; Bohren, Meghan A; Diallo, Boubacar Alpha; Irinyenikan, Theresa Azonima; Maung, Thae Maung; Thwin, Soe Soe; Aderoba, Adeniyi K; Vogel, Joshua P; Mon, Nwe Oo; Adu-Bonsaffoh, Kwame; Tunçalp, Özge",BMJ Glob Health,234,18

Understanding the characteristics of pain symptoms is crucial for a better clinical approach. METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed as having COVID-19 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included in the study. Patients were asked to complete a 51-item questionnaire via a phone interview, which included questions on demographics, acute COVID-19 symptoms, the presence of pain symptoms, and their characteristics in the acute phase of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 222 out of 266 patients with COVID-19 participated in the study, yielding a response rate of 83.5%. A total of 159 patients reported at least one kind of pain syndrome with a prevalence of 71.6%. Myalgia was reported in 110 (49.6%) patients, headache in 109 (49.1%), neuropathic pain in 55 (24.8%), and polyarthralgia in 30 (13.5%) patients. A total of 66 patients reported only one type of pain, 46 reported two types, 42 reported three types, and five patients reported all four types of pain. Logistic regression analysis showed that there were significant associations between these pain syndromes and a strong association was found between neuropathic pain and headache. CONCLUSION: Pain is a frequently observed symptom of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. There are significant relationships between pain syndromes in COVID-19, which may be due to a sequence of common etiologic factors. SIGNIFICANCE: This study described the main pain syndromes associated acute phase of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and its associated features.

The human respiratory tract spans from the nostrils to the lung alveoli and is inhabited by niche-specific communities of bacteria. The microbiota of the respiratory tract probably acts as a gatekeeper that provides resistance to colonization by respiratory pathogens. The respiratory microbiota might also be involved in the maturation and maintenance of homeostasis of respiratory physiology and immunity. The ecological and environmental factors that direct the development of microbial communities in the respiratory tract and how these communities affect respiratory health are the focus of current research. Concurrently, the functions of the microbiome of the upper and lower respiratory tract in the physiology of the human host are being studied in detail.

Various theses and recommendations on what optimal practice is have emerged, as evidenced by surveys, webinars, and recent publications. ART specialists are faced with dilemmas in light of the lack of concrete scientific evidence required to pave the way towards future safe practice. Meanwhile, infertile couples were similarly left in limbo unable to exercise their reproductive autonomy unlike fertile couples—where achieving a pregnancy via natural conception is a matter of decision. ART treatment being classified as non-essential has only recently re-started, facing new challenges while enabling pregnancy at a time of uncertainty. This article highlights matters of bioethical nature to be considered in the ART world at the time of COVID-19 while presenting an all-inclusive critique of the current status. When pursuing pregnancy through IVF treatment during the pandemic, distancing and caution have the lead role in an effort to defend the health of the intended parents and future children.

The mortality rate across countries had ranged from 1% up to more than 10% and it is underestimated in some countries. Advanced age is the most frequently reported factor associated to mortality. Other factors were the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. Several models for mortality prediction had been developed to assist in improving the prognosis. The aim of our study was to assess the factors related to mortality among COVID-19 patients and develop a prediction model based on these factors. Methods: A retrospective cohort study assessed the factors related to the mortality among COVID-19 patients who attended Imperial Hospital isolation centre on November- December, 2020, Khartoum, Sudan. Statistical tests performed were chi-square test, odds ratio and regression to develop the prediction model. Tests were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Results: 105 patients were studied. 29% of the patients were deceased, while, 71% were discharged alive. A statistically significant association was found between the age and severity with regards to mortality rate (p=0.034, 0.018 respectively). The model equation for mortality prediction: Mortality = -14.724+ (1.387* Age) + (-0.323* Gender) + (1.814* Admission) + ( 0.193* Ischemic Heart Disease) + ( -0.369* Fever) + ( 1.595* Cough) + ( 1.953* Complications) + ( 0.149* Duration of hospitalization) + ( 0.999* Enoxaparin dose). Conclusions: Age, admission ward, cough and enoxaparin dose were statistically significant predictors for COVID-19 mortality ( p= 0.014, 0.011, 0.015, 0.006 respectively).","Abd El-Raheem, G. O.
