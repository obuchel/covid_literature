1045,1045,1045,Clinical use of exhaled volatile organic compounds in pulmonary diseases: a systematic review,16.35522,8.458936,2012-12-21,"There is an increasing interest in the potential of exhaled biomarkers, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to improve accurate diagnoses and management decisions in pulmonary diseases. The objective of this manuscript is to systematically review the current knowledge on exhaled VOCs with respect to their potential clinical use in asthma, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), and respiratory tract infections. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane database, and reference lists of retrieved studies. Controlled, clinical, English-language studies exploring the diagnostic and monitoring value of VOCs in asthma, COPD, CF, lung cancer and respiratory tract infections were included. Data on study design, setting, participant characteristics, VOCs techniques, and outcome measures were extracted. Seventy-three studies were included, counting in total 3,952 patients and 2,973 healthy controls. The collection and analysis of exhaled VOCs is non-invasive and could be easily applied in the broad range of patients, including subjects with severe disease and children. Various research groups demonstrated that VOCs profiles could accurately distinguish patients with a pulmonary disease from healthy controls. Pulmonary diseases seem to be characterized by a disease specific breath-print, as distinct profiles were found in patients with dissimilar diseases. The heterogeneity of studies challenged the inter-laboratory comparability. In conclusion, profiles of VOCs are potentially able to accurately diagnose various pulmonary diseases. Despite these promising findings, multiple challenges such as further standardization and validation of the diverse techniques need to be mastered before VOCs can be applied into clinical practice.","van de Kant, Kim DG; van der Sande, Linda JTM; Jöbsis, Quirijn; van Schayck, Onno CP; Dompeling, Edward",Respir Res,260,27
4126,4126,4126,Predictors of Hematoma Enlargement in Patients with Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage Treated with Rapid Administration of Antifibrinolytic Agents and Strict Conservative Management,16.191113,8.533939,2019-09-11,"OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is caused by the rupture of small blood vessels and other health problems. In ICH patients, hematoma enlargement is the most critical risk factor for poor outcomes. Tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been used to reduce hematoma expansion. We analyzed the risk factors for hematoma expansion in ICH patients and compared the predictability of hematoma expansion in ICH patients with the use of tranexamic acid. METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of ICH patients who underwent follow-up computed tomography scans from October 2008 to October 2018. Of the 329 included patients, 67 who received tranexamic acid and 262 who did not receive tranexamic acid were compared. We also analyzed the risk factors of 45 and 284 patients who did and did not experience hematoma expansion, respectively. RESULTS: Hematoma expansion was observed in 7 (10.4%) of 67 patients in the tranexamic acid group and 38 (14.5%) of the 262 patients who did not receive tranexamic acid. There was no statistically significant difference between patients who did and did not received tranexamic acid (p=0.389). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors for hematoma expansion, spot sign and a maximal diameter of 40 mm were identified as risk factors. CONCLUSION: We could not confirm the effect of tranexamic acid on hematoma expansion in ICH patients. Spot sign and the maximal diameter of hematomas were confirmed as risk factors of hematoma expansion. If the maximal diameter is greater than 40 mm, the hematoma should be closely monitored.","Kim, Chang Hyeun; Lee, Sang Weon; Kim, Young Ha; Sung, Soon Ki; Son, Dong Wuk; Song, Geun Sung",Korean J Neurotrauma,260,1

The evolution of cooperation has been widely studied, but almost all theories focused on the cooperating individual and its genes. We suggest a different approach, taking into account the microbes carried by the interacting individuals. Accumulating evidence reveals that microbes can affect their host's well-being and behaviour, yet hosts can evolve mechanisms to resist the manipulations of their microbes. We thus propose that coevolution of microbes with their hosts may favour microbes that induce their host to cooperate. Using computational modelling, we show that microbe-induced cooperation can evolve and be maintained in a wide range of conditions, including when facing hosts' resistance to the microbial effect. We find that host–microbe coevolution leads the population to a rock–paper–scissors dynamics that enables maintenance of cooperation in a polymorphic state. Our results suggest a mechanism for the evolution and maintenance of cooperation that may be relevant to a wide variety of organisms, including cases that are difficult to explain by current theories. This study provides a new perspective on the coevolution of hosts and their microbiome, emphasizing the potential role of microbes in shaping their host's behaviour.","Lewin-Epstein, Ohad; Hadany, Lilach",Proc Biol Sci,260,1

Symptoms and signs of the common cold, influenza or croup, the occurrence of conjunctivitis in some adenoviral infections, generalised lymph-adenopathy and splenomegaly in glandular fever or the presence of vesicles characteristic of herpangina (Coxsackie A virus) or of herpes simplex infection, occasionally enable a clinical diagnosis and avoid the need for antibiotic therapy. In the case of treatable conditions a typical membrane may suggest diphtheria, a scarlatiniform rash infection due to Streptococcus pyogenes or to Corynebacterium haemolyticum, and a cherry-red epiglottis Haemophilus influenzae type b. Associated atypical pneumonia suggests infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae Pharyngitis due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae may be accompanied by infection at other sites or by other sexually transmitted diseases. Candidal infection, in the appropriate clinical circumstance, should suggest HIV infection. Surgical drainage is required in the case of peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess. Noninfectious cases of sore throat, e.g. thyroiditis, are relatively uncommon considerations in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile pharyngitis. The most common problem is to recognise streptococcal pharyngitis, which requires antibiotic treatment for 10 days to avoid the risk of rheumatic fever","Lang, S. D. R.; Singh, K.",Drugs,260,1
6425,6425,6425,An Approach to the Management of High Risk Asthmatic Patients,16.266079,8.340065,2012-11-03,"We wished to retrospectively evaluate the effects of permissive hypercapnia (PHY) on barotrauma, mortality and length of stay when applied to ventilated infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. Nineteen control infants with RSV induced respiratory failure were treated with conventional ventilation (April 1991–January 1994), after which time PHY was adopted as unit policy. A further 28 infants were then treated with PHY (January 1994–April 1996). Demographic and physiological data were collected from admission, and outcome variables including length of stay, barotrauma and mortality were recorded. The PHY group showed a significantly higher mean pCO(2) (7.6 vs 5.2 kPa), a lower mean pH (7.34 vs 7.40), and a reduction in maximal peak inspiratory pressures (25 vs 30 cmH(2)O). Mortality, barotrauma, use of neuromuscular blockade and nosocomial infection did not differ between groups. There was a trend towards increased length of ventilation in the PHY group (median 7 vs 5 days). Conclusion Based on this retrospective data we can show no benefit for the use of permissive hypercapnia as a ventilatory strategy in this patient group. A prospective randomised controlled trial is warranted to accurately assess the outcome variables and cost implications of this strategy.","Tibby, S. M.; Cheema, I.

An intervention to deal with each problem was also introduced by a single sentence. Some respondents were asked to indicate their willingness to pay for the interventions by voluntary contributions. Others indicated their opinion of the intervention on a conventional rating scale, rated the personal satisfaction of contributing to it, or rated the importance of the problem. Group averages of these response measures were obtained for a large set of issues. Computed over issues, the rank-order correlations between the different measures were very high, suggesting that group averages of WTP and of other opinion statements are measures of the same public attitudes. Observed preference reversals and violations of monotonicity in contributions are better explained by a concept of attitude than by the notion of economic value that underlies the contingent valuation method. Contributions and purchases do not follow the same logic. Possible implications for the contingent valuation method are discussed.","Kahneman, Daniel; Ritov, Ilana",J Risk Uncertain,260,1

6754,6754,6754,Mechanical ventilation of mice,16.34309,8.813132,2000,"Glutathione (GSH) is an essential tripeptide present in most eukaryotic cells. Because of its sulfhydryl group, GSH is a versatile molecule capable of protecting cells against oxidants and toxic xenobiotics. However, it also plays key roles in multiple metabolic pathways, such as the synthesis of certain leukotrienes, proteins, and DNA precursors as well as the activation of enzymes, the regulation of immune responses and others. Not only is GSH synthesized by cells for local use but it also participates in an elaborate intercellular exchange process regulated by theγ-glutamyl cycle. Extracellular GSH in plasma and in alveolar epithelial lining fluid is thus subject to variations according to the degree of expression ofγ-glutamyl cycle enzymes and the rate of consumption of GSH by electrophilic molecules. Bronchoalveolar lavage has allowed us to observe many of these variations of GSH within the extracellular environment of the normal and diseased human lung. Studies of lung GSH have lead to a better understanding of pathogenic processes and have stimulated investigations of novel therapeutic approaches in lung inflammatory disorders.","Cantin, André M.; Bégin, Raymond",Lung,260,1

Ceragenins are non-peptide, membrane-active agents that mimic the antimicrobial properties of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and affect the membrane permeability of microorganisms. The in vitro activities of CSA-8, CSA-13, CSA-44, CSA-131, CSA-138 either alone or in combination with colistin (sulphate) were determined against 25 carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of selected ceragenins and colistin against these isolates were measured by in vitro microbroth dilution techniques. Checkerboard techniques and time-kill assays were performed to determine the activities of combinations. The MIC(50) values (mg/L) of CSA-8, CSA-13, CSA-44, CSA-131, CSA-138 and colistin were 32, 4, 8, 2, 4 and 0.5, respectively.

Failure-to-rescue (FTR) is defined as death after a surgical complication, which is an institution-level surgical safety and quality metric that is an important variable affecting mortality rates in hospitals. This study aims to examine whether complication and FTR are different across low- and high-mortality hospitals for trauma care. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study performed at trauma care hospitals registered at Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB) from 2004 to 2017. Trauma patients aged ≥ 15 years with injury severity score (ISS) of ≥ 3 and those who survived for > 48 h after hospital admission were included. The hospitals in JTDB were categorized into three groups by standardized mortality rate. We compared trauma complications, FTR, and in-hospital mortality by a standardized mortality rate (divided by the institute-level quartile). RESULTS: Among 184,214 patients that were enrolled, the rate of any complication was 12.7%. The overall mortality rate was 3.7%, and the mortality rate among trauma patients without complications was only 2.8% (non-precedented deaths). However, the mortality rate among trauma patients with any complications was 10.2% (FTR). Hospitals were categorized into high- (40 facilities with 44,773 patients), average- (72 facilities with 102,368 patients), and low- (39 facilities with 37,073 patients) mortality hospitals, using the hospital ranking of a standardized mortality rate. High-mortality hospitals showed lower ISS than low-mortality hospitals [10 (IQR, 9–18) vs. 11 (IQR, 9–20), P < 0.01]. Patients in high-mortality hospitals showed more complications (14.2% vs. 11.2%, P < 0.01), in-hospital mortality (5.1% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.01), FTR (13.6% vs. 7.4%, P < 0.01), and non-precedented deaths (3.6% vs. 1.9%, P < 0.01) than those in low-mortality hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike reports of elective surgery, complication rates and FTR are associated with in-hospital mortality rates at the center level in trauma care.","Abe, Toshikazu; Komori, Akira; Shiraishi, Atsushi; Sugiyama, Takehiro; Iriyama, Hiroki; Kainoh, Takako; Saitoh, Daizoh",Crit Care,260,31

We also demonstrate the concomitant RNase H activation by six consecutive DNA bases in an LNA/DNA mix‐mer. We show ON uptake via receptor‐mediated transfection of a human T‐cell line in which the mix‐mers subsequently inhibit replication of a clinical HIV‐1 isolate. Thus, the technique of LNA/DNA mix‐mer antisense ONs targeting the conserved HIV‐1 DIS region may provide a strategy to prevent HIV‐1 assembly in the clinic.","Elmén, Joacim; Zhang, Hong-Yan; Zuber, Bartek; Ljungberg, Karl; Wahren, Britta; Wahlestedt, Claes; Liang, Zicai",FEBS Lett,260,1

Pseudo-PEA may constitute up to 40% of reported cases of cardiac arrest. Resuscitation from pseudo-PEA is often associated with hypotension refractory to catecholamine pressors. We hypothesized that this post-resuscitation state may be associated with hypocalcemic hypotension responsive to intravenous calcium. METHODS: Using pre-existing data from our hypoxic swine pseudo-PEA model, we measured blood pressure, hemodynamics, and electrolytes. Physiological data were analyzed on a heartbeat by heartbeat basis. The midpoint of the calcium response was defined using change of curvature feature detection. Hemodynamic parameters were shifted such that the value at the midpoint was equal to zero. RESULTS: In 9 animals with refractory hypotension, we administered 37 boluses of intravenous calcium in the dosage range of 5-20 mg. Comparisons were made between the average values in the time period 40-37 s before the midpoint and 35-40 s after the midpoint. Of the 37 administered boluses, 34 manifested a change in the blood pressure, with mean aortic pressure, systolic and diastolic pressures all increasing post bolus administration. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of intravenous calcium may be associated with a pressor-like response in refractory hypotension after resuscitation from pseudo-PEA. Relative ionized hypocalcemia may cause hypotension after resuscitation from pseudo-PEA. Therapy with intravenous calcium should be further investigated in this setting.","Lindqwister, Alexander L.; Lampe, Joshua W.; Gould, Jeffrey R.; Kaufman, Christopher L.; Moodie, Karen L.; Paradis, Norman A.",Intensive Care Med Exp,260,28

Our results indicate that a TANGO1 ring, by acting as a linactant, stabilizes the open neck of a nascent COPII bud. Elongation of such a bud into a transport intermediate commensurate with bulky procollagens is then facilitated by two complementary mechanisms: (i) by relieving membrane tension, possibly by TANGO1-mediated fusion of retrograde ERGIC membranes and (ii) by force application. Altogether, our theoretical approach identifies key biophysical events in TANGO1-driven procollagen export.","Raote, Ishier; Chabanon, Morgan; Walani, Nikhil; Arroyo, Marino; Garcia-Parajo, Maria F; Malhotra, Vivek; Campelo, Felix",,260,1

HIV and long term anti-retroviral therapy (ART) are risk factors for development of CVD in populations of people living with HIV (PLHIV). CVD risk assessment tools are currently being applied to SSA populations, but there are questions about accuracy as well as implementation challenges of these tools in lower resource setting populations. We aimed to assess the level of agreement between the various cardiovascular screening tools (Data collection on Adverse effects of anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D), Framingham risk score, WHO risk score and The Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Score) when applied to an HIV ART experienced population in Sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: This study was undertaken in an Anti-Retroviral Long Term (ALT) Cohort of 1000 PLHIV in care who have been on ART for at least 10 years in urban Uganda. A systematic review was undertaken to find the most frequently used screening tools from SSA PLHIV populations; these were applied to the ALT cohort. Levels of agreement between the resulting scores (those including lipids and non-lipids based, as well as HIV-specific and non-HIV specific) as applied to our cohort were compared. Prevalence Bias Adjusted Kappa was used to evaluate agreement between tools. RESULTS: Overall, PLHIV in ALT cohort had a median score of 1.1–1.4% risk of a CVD event over 5 years and 1.7–2.5% risk of a CVD event over 10 years. There was no statistical difference in the risk scores obtained for this population when comparing the different tools, including comparisons of those with lipids and non-lipids, and HIV specific vs non-HIV specific. CONCLUSION: The various tools yielded similar results, but those not including lipids are more feasible to apply in our setting. Long-term cohorts of PLHIV in SSA should in future provide longitudinal data to evaluate existing CVD risk prediction tools for these populations. Inclusion of HIV and ART history factors to existing scoring systems may improve accuracy without adding the expense and technical difficulty of lipid testing.","Mubiru, Frank; Castelnuovo, Barbara; Reynolds, Steven J.; Kiragga, Agnes; Tibakabikoba, Harriet; Owarwo, Noela Clara; Kambugu, Andrew; Lamorde, Mohammed; Parkes-Ratanshi, Rosalind",PLoS One,260,1

Compared with placebo, finerenone reduced the composite kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. We report the effect of finerenone on individual cardiovascular outcomes and in patients with and without history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included patients with type 2 diabetes and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30 to 5000 mg/g and an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥25 to <75 mL per min per 1.73 m(2), treated with optimized renin–angiotensin system blockade. Patients with a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive finerenone or placebo. The composite cardiovascular outcome included time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. Prespecified cardiovascular analyses included analyses of the components of this composite and outcomes according to CVD history at baseline. RESULTS: Between September 2015 and June 2018, 13 911 patients were screened and 5674 were randomized; 45.9% of patients had CVD at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 2.6 years (interquartile range, 2.0–3.4 years), finerenone reduced the risk of the composite cardiovascular outcome compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75–0.99]; P=0.034), with no significant interaction between patients with and without CVD (hazard ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.71–1.01] in patients with a history of CVD; hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.68–1.08] in patients without a history of CVD; P value for interaction, 0.85). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between treatment arms, with a low incidence of hyperkalemia-related permanent treatment discontinuation (2.3% with finerenone versus 0.8% with placebo in patients with CVD and 2.2% with finerenone versus 1.0% with placebo in patients without CVD). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, finerenone reduced incidence of the composite cardiovascular outcome, with no evidence of differences in treatment effect based on preexisting CVD status.

It is hypothesized that α-mangostin (AM), the major constituent of the xanthone fraction in extracts of Garcinia mangostana L., may protect the hepatic microvascular bed from thioacetamide (TAA)-induced fibrosis. In the present study, rats were divided into 4 groups: Control rats received no treatment; TAA-treated rats received 150 mg/kg TAA 3 times per week intraperitoneally; AM-treated rats received 75 mg/kg AM twice per week intraperitoneally; and TAA+AM-treated rats received both TAA and AM as described above. Rat livers were processed either for light microscopy or for vascular corrosion casting after 30 and 60 days of treatment. Vascular parameters were measured by 3D morphometry analysis of scanning electron micrographs. AM attenuated hepatocellular injuries and delayed both periportal and pericentral fibrosis in the TAA-treated rats. The comparison of findings at day 30 and 60 showed that TAA-induced fibrotic changes were progressive in time, and that the beneficial effects of AM only became apparent after prolonged treatment. The livers of rats treated with both TAA and AM had less space surrounding the portal vessels, improved preservation of the hepatic microvascular pattern, and minimally altered sinusoidal patterns with few signs of terminal portal venule remodeling. AM therefore partially protected the liver against hepatotoxin-induced fibrosis and the associated microvascular changes. The mechanism of the protective effect of AM on the liver remains to be investigated.","Tangphokhanon, Wasan; Pradidarcheep, Wisuit; Lametschwandtner, Alois",Biomed Rep,260,1

Some have suggested that assessment of pneumococcal carriage could be used to identify those children with bacterial pneumonia. The objective of this study was to determine if nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization patterns differed between children with definite viral disease, definite bacterial disease, and respiratory disease of indeterminate etiology. METHODS: Three groups of subjects were recruited: children with critical respiratory illness, previously healthy children with respiratory illness admitted to the ward, and previously healthy children diagnosed in the emergency department with non-severe pneumonia. Subjects were categorized as follows: a) viral infection syndrome (eg. bronchiolitis), b) bacterial infection syndrome (ie. pneumonia complicated by effusion/empyema), or c) ‘indeterminate’ pneumonia. Subjects’ nasopharyngeal swabs underwent quantitative PCR testing for S. pneumoniae. Associations between categorical variables were determined with Fisher’s exact, chi-square, or logistic regression, as appropriate. Associations between quantitative genomic load and categorical variables was determined by linear regression. RESULTS: There were 206 children in Group 1, 122 children in Group 2, and 179 children in Group 3. Only a minority (227/507, 45%) had detectable pneumococcal carriage; in those subjects, there was no association of quantitative genomic load with age, recruitment group, or disease category. In multivariate logistic regression, pneumococcal colonization > 3 log copies/mL was associated with younger age and recruitment group, but not with disease category. CONCLUSIONS: The nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae colonization patterns of subjects with definite viral infection were very similar to colonization patterns of those with definite bacterial infection or indeterminate pneumonia. Assessment and quantification of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization does not therefore appear useful to discriminate between acute viral and bacterial respiratory disease; consequently, this diagnostic testing is unlikely to reliably determine which children with indeterminate pneumonia have a bacterial etiology and/or require antibiotic treatment.","Pernica, Jeffrey M.; Inch, Kristin; Alfaraidi, Haifa; Van Meer, Ania; Carciumaru, Redjana; Luinstra, Kathy; Smieja, Marek",BMC Infect Dis,260,1

Glycyrrhizin (GL) has been proven to exhibit anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective properties. Here, we investigated the effects of GL on tissue injury, inflammatory response, and intestinal dysbiosis in Salmonella Typhimurium-infected mice. Results showed that GL or gentamicin (GM) significantly (P < 0.05) alleviated ST-induced splenomegaly indicated by the decreased spleen index, injury of liver and jejunum indicated by the decreased hepatocytic apoptosis, and the increased jejunal villous height. GL significantly (P < 0.05) increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12p70, IL-6, and IL-10) in spleen and IL-12p40 mRNA expression in liver. Meanwhile, GL or GM pre-infection treatments significantly (P < 0.05) decreased ST-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6) expression in both spleen and liver and increased (P < 0.05) anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 secretion in spleen. Furthermore, GL or GM pre-infection treatment also regulates the diversities and compositions of intestinal microbiota and decreased the negative connection among the intestinal microbes in ST-infected mice. The above findings indicate that GL alleviates ST-induced splenomegaly, hepatocytic apoptosis, injury of jejunum and liver, inflammatory response of liver and spleen, and intestinal dysbacteriosis in mice.","Wang, Baikui; Ye, Xiaolin; Zhou, Yuanhao; Zhao, Pengwei; Mao, Yulong",Front Vet Sci,260,1

METHOD: This retrospective cohort study included children aged 1 mo to 13 y with septic shock, requiring vasoactive medication. The area under curve receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was calculated using mean IS and mean VIS to predict PICU mortality, and Youden index cut points were generated. Sensitivity, specificity, and binary regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were enrolled (survivor, n = 72, 41% and nonsurvivor, n = 104, 59%). For predicting the PICU mortality, AUROC (95% CI) of IS was 0.80 (0.74–0.86) [sensitivity of 88.5 (80.7–94) and specificity of 58.3 (46.1–69.8)] and AUROC of VIS was 0.88 (0.82–0.92) [sensitivity of 83.7 (75.1–90.2) and specificity of 80.6 (69.5–89)]. The respective cutoff scores of IS and VIS were 28 and 42.5.

Seizures, which are more common in patients with Alzheimer’s disease than age matched controls, may contribute to the loss of nerve cells and abnormal brain discharges can disrupt cognition. This aberrant electrical activity may therefore present potentially important drug targets. The anti-seizure medication levetiracetam can reduce abnormal cortical discharges and reverse memory deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Levetiracetam has also been shown to improve memory difficulties in patients with mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease. Clinical use of levetiracetam is well-established in treatment of epilepsy and extensive safety data are available. Levetiracetam thus has the potential to provide safe and efficacious treatment to help with memory difficulties in Alzheimer’s disease. METHODS: The proposed project is a proof of concept study to test whether levetiracetam can help cognitive function in people with dementia. We plan to recruit thirty patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease with no history of previous seizures or other significant co-morbidity. Participants will be allocated to a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial that tests levetiracetam against placebo. Standardised scales to assess cognition and a computer-based touchscreen test that we have developed to better detect subtle improvements in hippocampal function will be used to measure changes in memory. All participants will have an electroencephalogram (EEG) at baseline. The primary outcome measure is a change in the computer-based touchscreen cognitive task while secondary outcomes include the effect of levetiracetam on mood, quality of life and modelling of the EEG, including time series measures and feature-based analysis to see whether the effect of levetiracetam can be predicted. The effect of levetiracetam and placebo will be compared within a given patient using the paired t-test and the analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline values. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to evaluate if an anti-seizure medication can offer meaningful benefit to patients with Alzheimer’s disease. If this study demonstrates at least stabilisation of memory function and/or good tolerability, the next step will be to rapidly progress to a larger study to establish whether levetiracetam may be a useful and cost-effective treatment for patients with Alzheimer’s disease.

Concentration and sizes of extracellular vesicles (EVs) recently emerged as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in patients with liver cancer, but no data on its prognostic relevance in the context of TACE exists. Here, we evaluate pre-interventional EVs as a potential biomarker in patients undergoing TACE for primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. METHODS: Vesicle size distribution and concentration were measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) in patient sera before and after TACE in 38 patients. RESULTS: Extracellular vesicle size distribution measured before TACE is of prognostic significance with respect to overall survival in patients after TACE. Overall survival is significantly reduced when initial vesicle size (X50) is in the upper quartile (>145.65nm). Median overall survival in patients in the upper quartile was only 314 days, compared to 799 days in patients with vesicle size in the first to third quartile (<145.65nm; p = 0.007). Vesicle size was also shown to be a significant prognostic marker for overall survival in Cox regression analysis [HR 1.089, 95% CI: 1.021–1.162, p = 0.010]. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between initial EVs concentration/BMI (r(S) = 0.358, p = 0.029), X50/IL-8-concentration (r(S) = 0.409, p = 0.011) and X50/CRP-concentration (r(S) = 0.404, p = 0.016). In contrast, with regard to immediate tumor response after TACE, EVs concentration and size did not differ. SUMMARY: Sizes (but not concentrations) of EVs represent a novel prognostic marker in patients receiving TACE for primary and secondary hepatic malignancies since patients with enlarged EVs display a significantly impaired prognosis after TACE.","Schöler, David; Castoldi, Mirco; Jördens, Markus S.; Schulze-Hagen, Max; Kuhl, Christiane; Keitel, Verena; Luedde, Tom; Roderburg, Christoph; Loosen, Sven H.",PLoS One,260,1

METHODS: Patients diagnosed as MDR-TB with low concentration INH resistance and rifampicin resistance, second-line/injectable agents sensitive were prospectively enrolled, given the regimen of Amikacin (Ak)–Fluoroquinolones (FQs)–Cycloserine (Cs)–Protionamide (Pto)–PasiniaZid (Pa)–Pyrazinamide (Z) for 6 months followed by 12 months of FQs–Cs–Pto–Pa–Z, and then followed up for treatment outcomes and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were enrolled into the study. The overall favorable treatment rate was 79.8% (91/114). Among 91 cases with favorable treatment, 75.4% (86/114) were cured and 4.4% (5/114) were completed treatment. Regarding to unfavorable outcomes, among 23 cases, 8.8% (10/114) had failures, 8.8% (10/114) losing follow up, 0.9% (1/114) had treatment terminated due to intolerance to drugs and 1.8% (2/114) died. Treatment favorable rate was significantly higher in newly treated MDR-TB (91.7%, 33/36) than that in retreated MDR-TB (74.4%, 58/78, p 0.03). The investigators recorded 42 AEs occurrences in 30 of 114 patients (26.3%). Clinicians rated most AEs as mild or moderate (95.24%, 40/42). CONCLUSIONS: The regimen was proved to be effective, safe and inexpensive. It is suitable for specific drug resistant population, especially for newly-treated patients, which could be expected to be developed into a short-course regimen.

This fabrication technique is new and yields environmentally friendly membranes for oil-water separation. GO loading was varied from 0.5 to 2.0 part per hundred-part rubber (pphr) to study its effect on the performance of NBR-GO membrane. GO was found to alter the surface morphology of the NBR matrix by introducing creases and fold on its surface, which then increases the permeation flux and rejection rate efficiency of the membrane. X-Ray diffraction analysis proves that GO was well dispersed in the membrane due to the non-existence of GO fingerprint diffraction peak at 2θ value of 10–12° in the membrane samples.

This mobility problem is highlighted by the increase in terms of time, distance and social and economic costs, whereas the congestion management approach implemented rarely meets the road users’ expectations. To overcome this problem, a novel approach for evaluating urban traffic congestion is proposed. Factors such as the imprecision of traffic records, the user’s perception of the road’s level of service provided and variation in sample data are mandatory to describe the real traffic condition. To respond to these requirements, a fuzzy inference-based method is suggested. It combines three independent congestion measures which are: speed ratio, volume to capacity ratio and decreased speed ratio into a single composite measure which is the congestion index. To run the proposed fuzzy model, the traffic dataset of Austin-Texas is used. Although it is still not possible to determine the best congestion measure, the proposed approach gives a composite aspect of traffic congestion by combining and incorporating the uncertainty of the three independent measures.","Berrouk, Sara; Fazziki, Abdelaziz El; Sadgal, Mohammed",Image and Signal Processing,260,16

The TGF-β/Smad signal transduction pathway plays an important role in allergic bronchial asthma. However, the effect of M. vaccae nebulization on the TGF-β/Smad signal transduction pathway in mouse models of allergic asthma remains unclear. This study investigated the preventive effect of M. vaccae nebulization during bronchial asthma in a mouse model and elucidate the implication of TGF-β/Smad signal transduction pathway in the process. METHODS: In total, 24 female Balb/c mice were randomized to normal control (group A), asthma control (group B), and M. vaccae nebulization (group C) groups. Both groups B and C were sensitized using ovalbumin for establishment of the asthmatic model; group A received phosphate-buffered solution. Prior to the establishment of asthma, Group C was nebulized with M. vaccae. Airway responsiveness was measured in all the groups, using a noninvasive lung function machine before and 24 h after establishment of the asthmatic model. The animals were then harvested, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were collected. The total cell counts in BALF was estimated. Protein expression of TGF-β1, TβR1, Smad1, and Smad7 was detected by immunohistochemistry. The population of CD3(+)γδT, IL-13(+)CD3(+)T, TGF-β(+)CD3(+)T, IL-13(+)CD3(+)γδT, and TGF-β(+) CD3(+) γδT cells were detected by flow cytometry. One-way analysis of variance for within-group comparisons, the least significant difference t-test or Student–Newman–Keuls test for intergroup comparisons, and the nonparametric rank sum test for analysis of airway inflammation scores were used in the study. RESULTS: The eosinophil count; protein expression of TGF-β1, TβR1, and Smad1; and percentages of CD3(+)γδT and IL-13(+)CD3(+)T cells were significantly lower in the M. vaccae nebulization group than in the asthma control group (P < 0.01). There were significant intergroup differences in the percentages of TGF-β(+)CD3(+)T and IL-13(+)CD3(+)γδT cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mycobacterium vaccae nebulization could confer protection against allergic bronchial asthma by reducing airway responsiveness and alleviating airway inflammation in mice. The underlying mechanism might be attributed its effect on the deregulated expression of TGF-β1, TβR1, Smad1, and Smad7 of the TGF-β/Smad signal transduction pathway.","Jiang, Xiao-hong; Li, Chao-qian; Feng, Guang-yi; Luo, Ming-jie; Sun, Qi-xiang",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,260,1

The objective is to develop rigorous criteria for the recognition of impact processes that assist in distinguishing “impact” from other potential erosional processes, particularly thermal fatigue, which has recently been advocated specifically for asteroids. Impact in rock is a process that is centrally to bilaterally symmetric, resulting in highly crushed, high-albedo, quasicircular depressions surrounded by volumetrically prominent spall zones. Containing central glass-lined pits in many cases, such features provide distinctive evidence of impact that is not duplicated by any other process. Additional evidence of impact can include radial fracture systems in the target that emanate from the impact point and clusters of fragments that attest to the lateral acceleration and displacement of each one. It is also important to note that impact produces a wide variety of fragment shapes that might totally overlap with those produced by thermal fatigue; we consider fragment shape to be an unreliable criterion for either process. The stochastic nature of the impact process will result in exponential survival times of surface rocks; that is, rock destruction initially is relatively efficient, but it is followed by ever increasing surface times for the last rock remnants. Thermal fatigue, however, is essentially a thermal-equilibrium process. The corresponding distribution of survival times should be much more peaked in comparison, presumably Gaussian, and diagnostically different from that due to impact. Given the abundance of evidence that has been gleaned from returned Apollo rocks and soils, it is surprising how little has been learned about the impact process from the photography of rocks and boulders taken by the astronauts on the lunar surface. This suggests that it will require rocks and soils returned from asteroids to evaluate the relative roles of thermal versus impact-triggered rock erosion, particularly when both processes are likely to be operating.","Hörz, Friedrich; Basilevsky, Alexander T.; Head, James W.; Cintala, Mark J.",Planet Space Sci,260,1

Social distancing effectively mitigates the spread of COVID-19, but this practice can also lead to social isolation and loneliness. Drawing on a sample of adults age 60 or older receiving Meals on Wheels/Grab and Go Meals in the state of Nebraska, this study investigates loneliness among rural and underserved older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were distributed to 3725 meal recipients across Nebraska’s eight Area Agencies on Aging in July 2020 (response rate = 50%), and a stratified random subsample was selected for preliminary analysis (N = 240). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the effects of COVID-19 and its associated safety precautions on loneliness. The findings reveal that 1 in 10 older adults have not left their home in over a month, and 38 percent feel lonelier due to the impact of COVID-19. Older adults who engaged in more community activities before the pandemic, reported leaving their home less, and experienced a longer absence of social interaction since the pandemic all had significantly increased odds of feeling lonelier in the COVID-19 era. Longer duration of sheltering in place was marginally associated with increased loneliness. The findings from this study show the consequences of social distancing on rural and underserved older adults, which calls for coordinated intervention.","Wilkinson, Lindsay; Masters, Julie; Kelly, Christopher; McKelvey, Miechelle; Saidi, Ladan Ghazi; Hill, Toni",Innov Aging,260,16

Thus, we will specifically focus on septic patients in this study to compare the effects of saline and balanced solution. We hypothesize that effects of saline on renal outcomes are related to the underline acute kidney injury (AKI) severity and total volumes of infusion. METHODS/DESIGN: The investigators designed a pragmatic, multi-center parallel controlled trial recruiting 312 patients who are diagnosed with sepsis/septic shock in the intensive care unit (ICU) and will be assigned with either acetate Ringer’s solution or saline in the corresponding month. Patients with an end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or who need renal replacement therapy (RRT) prior to or at the time of enrolment are excluded. Enrolled patients will be regarded as with mild, moderate, or severe sepsis on the basis of the severity of their illness and will be divided into subgroups according to their initial renal function and various intravenous infusion volumes when being analyzed. The primary outcome is major adverse kidney events within 28 days (MAKE28), including the composite of in-hospital death, receipt of new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction. Secondary outcomes include 28-day mortality, internal environment disturbance, incidence and duration of vasoactive drug treatment, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of RRT, and ICU and hospital length of stay. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study will be the first to focus on septic patients and provide credible and evident data on the comparison of outcome between acetate Ringer’s solution and saline for intravenous infusion in adult septic patients on the basis of baseline renal function and infusion volumes taken into consideration.

However, current approaches are either inefficient in dealing with more than two modalities or fail to capture both modality-specific and shared variations. We introduce a new multimodal generative model that integrates both modality-specific and shared factors and aggregates shared information across any subset of modalities efficiently. Our method partitions the latent space into disjoint subspaces for modality-specific and shared factors and learns to disentangle these in a purely self-supervised manner. Empirically, we show improvements in representation learning and generative performance compared to previous methods and showcase the disentanglement capabilities.

Method: Two databases (PubMed and PsycArticles) were searched to retrieve reviews published from 2015 up until 2020 on the general conceptualization of resilience. All reviews had to meet specific inclusion criteria, which resulted in the inclusion of 18 articles. After discussing different conceptualizations regarding the process-oriented approach of resilience in adult health research, we will highlight some mechanisms that are supposed to be involved in the resilience process. Results: Research on resilience in health sciences confronts three core difficulties: defining positive outcome for a processual construct, describing different trajectories within the process, and identifying mechanisms that mediate resilience. Conclusion: The definition of resilience in mental health research as a multidimensional adaptation process is widely accepted, and multiple research paradigms have contributed to a better understanding of the concept. However, the definition of a processual construct in a way that allows for high expert consensus and a valid operationalization for empirical studies remains a challenge. Future research should focus on the assessment of multiple cross-domain outcomes and international and interdisciplinary prospective mixed-method longitudinal designs to fill in the missing links.","Hiebel, Nina; Rabe, Milena; Maus, Katja; Peusquens, Frank; Radbruch, Lukas; Geiser, Franziska",Front Psychol,260,1

For students to pursue learning opportunities, the education system must improve. Augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) provide a promising future for the enhancement of medical education. This review article aims to evaluate the benefits and efficacy of AR and VR, especially during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: Multiple peer‐reviewed, randomized trials were synthesized into a review study investigating the efficacy, benefit, and use of VR and AR for medical education. The reviewed studies included medical and graduate‐level students as participants and aimed to support the use of AR and VR as an educational adjunct. The results of these trials support the use of additional technology in medical education. RESULTS: The COVID‐19 pandemic propelled medical schools, educators, and students into a world of total computerized learning. This pandemic acted as a necessary push to implement novel, untested technologies into the educational sector. Previous research demonstrates that AR and VR can confront these unfamiliar challenges and allow for a safe and beneficial COVID‐19 education, consisting of socially‐distanced and low‐risk patient‐care practice. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of continuous, safe learning outweigh the potential technological challenges of implementing AR and VR into medical education. During the pandemic, the medical community is faced with teaching students many skills necessary to become adept medical practitioners. Although the COVID‐19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity for the implementation of new technologies, virtual instruction does not have to end beyond this crisis. Virtual technology can teach medical students interpersonal skills such as empathy, engaging in difficult conversations, and delivering bad news. Because students have traditionally been exposed to passive teaching styles, it is time to look toward expanding medical students’ repertoire and allow them to personalize their education.","Caruso, Jessica; Harmon, Lauren; Born, Gabriella; Dufeau, David",FASEB J,260,1

The purpose of this study was to examine the content of the official medical sciences curriculum in undergraduate degrees from a social health perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This qualitative content analysis study was conducted in 2019 at the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences using a deductive approach based on Hsieh and Shannon's directed content analysis. For this purpose, official curricula in the fields of Public Health, Occupational Health, Environmental Health, Nursing, Midwifery, Nutrition Sciences, and Health Services Management were analyzed using MAXQDA 12. RESULTS: The results showed that a total of 136 codes related to the components of social health were identified in the topics of undergraduate medical sciences majors. Most to least relevant topics belonged to the fields of Public Health (61 codes), Midwifery (22 codes), Nursing (16 codes), Occupational Health (12 codes), Environmental Health and Nutrition Sciences (each 10 codes), and Health Services Management (5 codes), respectively. Among the components of social health, only the component related to access to insurance and health services was mentioned in all seven disciplines. However, the components of poverty and inequality were only included in three disciplines (Public Health, Nursing, Midwifery).

It is a part of the 30S ribosomal subunit and is also able to interact with mRNA and tmRNA. An important feature of the S1 protein family is a strong tendency towards aggregation. To study the amyloidogenic properties of S1, we isolated and purified the recombinant ribosomal S1 protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using the FoldAmyloid, Waltz, Pasta 2.0, and AGGRESCAN programs, amyloidogenic regions of the protein were predicted, which play a key role in its aggregation. The method of limited proteolysis in combination with high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis of the products, made it possible to identify regions of the S1 protein from P. aeruginosa that are protected from the action of proteinase K, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Sequences of theoretically predicted and experimentally identified amyloidogenic regions were used to synthesize four peptides, three of which demonstrated the ability to form amyloid-like fibrils, as shown by electron microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. The identified amyloidogenic sites can further serve as a basis for the development of new antibacterial peptides against the pathogenic microorganism P. aeruginosa.","Grishin, Sergei Y.; Dzhus, Ulyana F.; Glukhov, Anatoly S.; Selivanova, Olga M.; Surin, Alexey K.; Galzitskaya, Oxana V.",Int J Mol Sci,260,17

It has been particularly disruptive to forest operations courses that rely heavily on field experiences. Dodson and Blinn (2021) surveyed US forest operations instructors at four-year institutions granting SAF-accredited forestry degrees to understand how they rapidly modified courses during spring 2020 to accommodate a move to fully remote instruction. Through an online survey and interviews, a follow-up study was conducted to understand how courses were modified when instructors had time to prepare and what, if any, of those modifications are likely to be retained upon a return to in-person instruction. Two main themes emerged from the survey and interviews: instructors will expand the range of tools and methods used to convey course content, and they have a renewed respect for the importance of field experience and personal interactions. STUDY IMPLICATIONS: COVID-19 has affected academic instruction and workforce readiness. A broadening of instructors’ digital skill sets and resources, pedagogical modifications, and a renewed appreciation of field experiences and interactions with students will have a positive influence on instruction in the future. The professional preparation of graduates suffered during the pandemic because of a marked decrease in field time and personal interaction between and among faculty and students.

This study was designed to assess the association between PPI therapy and small-bowel lesions after adjustment for the differences in baseline characteristics between users and non-users of PPIs. METHODS We retrospectively studied patients suspected to be suffering from small-bowel diseases, who underwent capsule endoscopy between 2010 and 2013. We used propensity matching to adjust for the differences in baseline characteristics between users and non-users of PPIs. The outcomes included the prevalence of small-bowel lesions: erosion, ulcer, angioectasia, varices, and tumor. RESULTS We selected 327 patient pairs for analysis after propensity matching, and found no significant differences in the prevalence of small-bowel injuries, including erosions and ulcers, between users and non-users of PPIs. Two subgroup analyses of the effect of the type of PPI and the effect of PPI therapy in users and non-users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indicated no significant differences in the prevalence of small-bowel injuries in these two groups. CONCLUSION PPI therapy did not increase the prevalence of small-bowel injury, regardless of the type of PPI used and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.","Yamada, Atsuo; Niikura, Ryota; Maki, Koutarou; Nakamura, Masanao; Watabe, Hirotsugu; Fujishiro, Mitsuhiro; Oka, Shiro; Fujimori, Shunji; Nakajima, Atsushi; Ohmiya, Naoki; Matsumoto, Takayuki; Tanaka, Shinji; Koike, Kazuhiko; Sakamoto, Choitsu",PloS one,260,2

Seattle, WA, USA). Importantly, LCOO and LST assays commonly assigned subtypes in 17/18 (94.4%) ABC and 34/38 (89.5%) GCB DLBCL samples from this cohort. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of ABC and GCB subtypes, as classified by all platforms, were not significantly different in validation cohort. LCOO classification using publicly available microarray gene expression from two independent data sets (414 fresh frozen (FF) and 474 FFPET DLBCL biopsies) showed significantly worse outcome for ABC subtype compared to GCB subtype. In conclusion, a sensitive, reproducible, LCOO assay developed on an easy to standardize qRT-PCR platform could be an important clinical tool for DLCBL cell-of-origin classification.","Ta, Robert; Santini, Chris; Gou, Patricia; Lee, Greg; Tai, Yu Chuan; O'Brien, Cathal; Fontecha, Marcel; Grant, Cliona; Bacon, Larry; Finn, Stephen; Vandenberghe, Elisabeth; Quinn, Fiona; Dua, Rajiv; Flavin, Richard",The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,260,5

We assessed the mechanism and function of enterovirus 71 (EV71), a primary causative agent for recent hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreaks, in manipulating cell cycle progression. Our results suggest that EV71 infection induces S-phase arrest in diverse cell types by preventing the cell cycle transition from the S phase into the G2/M phase. Similar results were observed for an alternate picornavirus, Coxsackievirus A16. Synchronization in S phase, but not G0/G1 phase or G2/M phase, promotes viral replication. Consistent with its ability to arrest cells in S phase, the expression of cyclin A2, CDK 2, cyclin E1, and cyclin B1 was regulated by EV71 through increasing transcription of cyclin E1, promoting proteasome-mediated degradation of cyclin A2 and regulating the phosphorylation of CDK 2. Finally, a non-structural protein of EV71, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D, was demonstrated to mediate S-phase cell cycle arrest. These findings suggest that EV71 induces S-phase cell cycle arrest in infected cells via non-structural protein 3D, which may provide favorable conditions for virus production.","Yu, Jinghua; Zhang, Liying; Ren, Peiyou; Zhong, Ting; Li, Zhaolong; Wang, Zengyan; Li, Jingliang; Liu, Xin; Zhao, Ke; Zhang, Wenyan; Yu, Xiao-Fang",Cell cycle,260,16

We aim to estimate the size of the target population for COVID-19 vaccination at the provincial level in the mainland of China, and summarize the current progress of vaccination programs, which could support local governments in the timely determination and adjustment of vaccination policies and promotional measures. METHODS We conducted a descriptive study of the entire population in the mainland of China, between December 2020 and August 2021. By extracting provincial-stratified data from publicly available sources, we estimated the size of priority target groups for vaccination programs, and further characterized the ongoing vaccination program at the provincial level, including the total doses administered, the coverage rate, and the vaccination capacity needed to achieve the target coverage of 80% by the end of 2021. We used R (version 4.1.0) to complete the descriptive statistics. RESULTS The size of the target population shows large differences among provinces, ranging from 3.4 million to 108.4 million. As of 31 August, 2021, the speed of vaccine roll-out differs considerably as well, with the highest coverage occurring in Beijing and Shanghai, where 88.5% and 79.1% of the population has been fully vaccinated, respectively. In 22 of 31 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs), more than 70% of the population was administered at least one dose by August. With the current vaccination capacity, the target of 80% coverage could be achieved by 2021 in 28 PLADs. CONCLUSIONS Disparities exist in the target population size and vaccination progress across provinces in the mainland of China. China has made great strides in the vaccination speed since roll-out, and could basically achieve the targeted vaccine coverage.","Zheng, Wen; Yan, Xuemei; Zhao, Zeyao; Yang, Juan; Yu, Hongjie",Infectious diseases of poverty,260,19

The impairment of cerebral autoregulation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of IVH, whose incidence is highest during the transitional period. This pilot study aimed to evaluate whether patterns of cerebral autoregulation and oxygenation differ in relation to IVH development in very preterm infants during the transitional period. Methods: Infants <32 weeks' gestation were enrolled within 12 h from birth. A simultaneous monitoring of cerebral oxygenation (CrSO2) by near-infrared spectroscopy and of heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was performed over the first 72 h. Cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (cFTOE) and tissue oxygenation-heart rate reactivity index (TOHRx), which represents a marker of cerebrovascular reactivity, were calculated. Daily cranial and cardiac ultrasound scans were performed, in order to assess the hemodynamic status and to detect a possible IVH onset. CrSO2 and cFTOE, clustered on 6-hour epochs, were compared between infants who developed IVH during the study period and those who did not. A between-group comparison of TOHRx before and after IVH detection was also performed. Results: Twenty preterm infants with a median gestational age of 27 weeks (interquartile range, IQR: 25-30 weeks) and median birth weight of 895 g (IQR: 822-1208 g) were enrolled. Of these, 8 developed IVH. The median age at IVH detection was 40 h (IQR: 30-48 h). Pre-IVH TOHRx was significantly higher compared to matched control periods (p <0.001). CrSO2 was significantly lower from 12 to 30 h and from 42 h onwards in cases compared to controls; however, a temporary CrSO2 rise preceded IVH detection. Similarly, cFTOE was significantly higher in IVH infants from 12 to 30 h and from 48 to 72 h, with a transient decrease between the two periods. Conclusions: In preterm infants during the transitional period, the development of IVH is preceded by transient changes in cerebral oxygenation and oxygen extraction which, in turn, may underlie an early impairment of cerebral autoregulation. Larger studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.","Cimatti, Anna Giulia; Martini, Silvia; Galletti, Silvia; Vitali, Francesca; Aceti, Arianna; Frabboni, Giulia; Faldella, Giacomo; Corvaglia, Luigi",Frontiers in pediatrics,260,5

In 2018, a laboratory serving LTACHs in southern California began identifying species of Candida that were detected in urine specimens to enhance surveillance of C auris, and C auris was identified in February 2019 in a patient in an Orange County (OC), California, LTACH. Further investigation identified C auris at 3 associated facilities. OBJECTIVE To assess the prevalence of C auris and infection prevention and control (IPC) practices in LTACHs and vSNFs in OC. DESIGN Point prevalence surveys (PPSs), postdischarge testing for C auris detection, and assessments of IPC were done from March to October 2019. SETTING All LTACHs (n = 3) and vSNFs (n = 14) serving adult patients in OC. PARTICIPANTS Current or recent patients in LTACHs and vSNFs in OC. INTERVENTION In facilities where C auris was detected, PPSs were repeated every 2 weeks. Ongoing IPC support was provided. MEASUREMENTS Antifungal susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing to assess isolate relatedness. RESULTS Initial PPSs at 17 facilities identified 44 additional patients with C auris in 3 (100%) LTACHs and 6 (43%) vSNFs, with the first bloodstream infection reported in May 2019. By October 2019, a total of 182 patients with C auris were identified by serial PPSs and discharge testing. Of 81 isolates that were sequenced, all were clade III and highly related. Assessments of IPC identified gaps in hand hygiene, transmission-based precautions, and environmental cleaning. The outbreak was contained to 2 facilities by October 2019. LIMITATION Acute care hospitals were not assessed, and IPC improvements over time could not be rigorously evaluated. CONCLUSION Enhanced laboratory surveillance and prompt investigation with IPC support enabled swift identification and containment of C auris.

Formal child care has an important role in supporting breastfeeding, as many Australian infants commence care before two years of age. Currently, little is known about support or barriers in child care contexts. The present qualitative instrumental case study explores practices which protect, promote and support breastfeeding at a child care centre located in the Australian Capital Territory's outer suburbs. Extending from a previously published collective case study, a cultural-institutional focus of analysis was used to explore the roles of proximity, flexibility and communication in supporting breastfeeding within a child care centre located close to an infant's home. Interviews with centre staff and mothers, triangulated with observations of the centre environment and policy documents provide insight into the environment. Affirming the roles of flexibility in routine and staff rostering and two-way communication, findings suggest longer-term benefits may be derived from selecting a child care centre close to an infant's home, provided mothers can overcome barriers to breastmilk expression in the workplace. The study recognises the role of non-lactating caregivers in the transition to formal child care, and of the support culture for educators who breastfeed. This study extends the knowledge base of breastfeeding support interventions in the child care setting to inform future research and policy.","Woolley, Emma; Wyver, Shirley",Children,260,16

However, how signalling integration is regulated and whether the endocytic fate of single receptors controls such signalling integration remains poorly elucidated. Combining quantitative phosphoproteomics and targeted assays, we generated a detailed picture of recycling-dependent fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling in breast cancer cells, with a focus on distinct FGF receptors (FGFRs). We discovered reciprocal priming between FGFRs and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) that is coordinated at recycling endosomes. FGFR recycling ligands induce EGFR phosphorylation on threonine 693. This phosphorylation event alters both FGFR and EGFR trafficking and primes FGFR-mediated proliferation but not cell invasion. In turn, FGFR signalling primes EGF-mediated outputs via EGFR threonine 693 phosphorylation. This reciprocal priming between distinct families of RTKs from recycling endosomes exemplifies a novel signalling integration hub where recycling endosomes orchestrate cellular behaviour. Therefore, targeting reciprocal priming over individual receptors may improve personalized therapies in breast and other cancers.","Smith, Michael P; Ferguson, Harriet R; Ferguson, Jennifer; Zindy, Egor; Kowalczyk, Katarzyna M; Kedward, Thomas; Bates, Christian; Parsons, Joseph; Watson, Joanne; Chandler, Sarah; Fullwood, Paul; Warwood, Stacey; Knight, David; Clarke, Robert B; Francavilla, Chiara",The EMBO journal,260,13

The aim of the current study was to search for possible correlations between the rates of attempted and completed suicide and climate variables and regional unemployment per year in the county of Thessaloniki, Macedonia, northern Greece, for the years 2000-12. MATERIAL AND METHODS The regional rates of suicide and attempted suicide as well as regional unemployment were available from previous publications of the authors. The climate variables were calculated from the daily E-OBS gridded dataset which is based on observational data RESULTS Only the male suicide rates correlate significantly with high mean annual temperature but not with unemployment. The multiple linear regression analysis results suggest that temperature is the only variable that determines male suicides and explains 51% of their variance. Unemployment fails to contribute significantly to the model. There seems to be a seasonal distribution for attempts with mean rates being higher for the period from May to October and the rates clearly correlate with temperature. The highest mean rates were observed during May and August and the lowest during December and February. Multiple linear regression analysis suggests that temperature also determines the female attempts rate although the explained variable is significant but very low (3-5%) CONCLUSION Climate variables and specifically high temperature correlate both with suicide and attempted suicide rates but with a different way between males and females. The climate effect was stronger than the effect of unemployment.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Savopoulos, Christos; Zannis, Prodromos; Apostolopoulou, Martha; Fountoukidis, Ilias; Kakaletsis, Nikolaos; Kanellos, Ilias; Dimellis, Dimos; Hyphantis, Thomas; Tsikerdekis, Athanasios; Pompili, Maurizio; Hatzitolios, Apostolos I",Journal of affective disorders,260,31

In this study, we used proteomics approaches to investigate the secreted proteins (secretome) of paired human androgen-repressed prostate cancer (ARCaP) cell lines, representing the epithelial (ARCaP-E) and mesenchymal (ARCaP-M) phenotypes. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses showed high levels of proteins involved in bone remodeling and extracellular matrix degradation in the ARCaP-M cells, consistent with the bone metastasis phenotype. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS showed a significantly higher level of the serine protease granzyme B (GZMB) in ARCaP-M conditioned media (CM) compared to that of ARCaP-E. Using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect mRNA and Western blot to detect protein expression, we further demonstrated that the GZMB gene was expressed by ARCaP-M and the protein was secreted extracellularly. ARCaP-M cells with GZMB gene knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) have markedly reduced invasiveness as demonstrated by the Matrigel invasion assay in comparison with the scrambled siRNA negative control. This study reports that GZMB secretion by mesenchymal-like androgen-repressed human prostate cancer cells promotes invasion, suggesting a possible extracellular role for GZMB in addition to its classic role in immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity.","Bou-Dargham, Mayassa J; Sang, Qing-Xiang Amy",PloS one,260,1

Although researchers have studied the associations between alexithymia and both NSSI and risky drinking, the underlying factors of both associations are rarely compared. Using path analysis, we compared the mediating effects of behaviour-specific outcome expectancies and self-efficacy beliefs on the associations between alexithymia and both NSSI and risky drinking. A sample of 627 university students (76.10% female, Mage = 20.75, SD = 1.88) completed a battery of questionnaires. Alexithymia exhibited indirect effects on NSSI via affect regulation expectancies, pain expectancies, communication expectancies, and low self-efficacy to resist NSSI. Alexithymia exhibited indirect effects on risky drinking via expectations of increased confidence and negative consequences. However, the indirect effects differed depending on the valance of the emotion the individual had difficulties appraising. Our findings indicate that the underlying factors in the associations between alexithymia and both NSSI and risky drinking could differ. Where individuals who have difficulties appraising negative emotions may engage in NSSI to help regulate negative feelings, they may consume alcohol to gain more confidence in expressing their feelings.

The results suggested that photosynthesis was enhanced as H2S improved the tobacco ΦPSII, ETR, Photo, Cond, and Tr, and that by increasing the NPQ, it consumed considerable amount of energy to enhance plant resistances during Cd2+ exposure. Furthermore, H2S increased the gene transcription of NtSOD3, NtPOD1, and CAT1, to enhance antioxidant enzyme activity, which reduces the generation of the reactive oxygen protective membrane integrity. Additionally, H2S increased the gene expression of the tobacco PC genes, Pr2 and Pr8 promoted the formation of the Cd2+ complexes and transportation to the vacuole, resulting in improved Cd-ATPase gene expression, away from organelles, to alleviate the Cd2+ poison. Furthermore, H2S regulated the relative absorption of K+ and Ca2+, which antagonized the Cd2+, and reduced its transportation to the aboveground plant material.

Methods: Patients with intracranial large artery occlusion related AIS who received stent retriever (SR) thrombectomy from November 2014 to June 2019 were included in the study. All patients underwent angiography before SR thrombectomy, which was used to evaluate the occlusion type. Differences in the distribution of occlusion types in intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) and embolism were assessed, and the diagnostic indicators, including the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. Results: Of the 115 AIS patients with intracranial large artery occlusion, 42 were classified as having ICAS, and 73 having an embolism. In the ICAS group, branching-site occlusion was responsible for 3 (7%) cases and truncal-type occlusion for 39 (93%) cases, while in the embolism group, branching-site occlusion was responsible for 66 (90%) cases and truncal-type occlusion for 7 (10%) cases; the difference was statistically significant (all P < 0.01). The AUC for ICAS predicted by truncal-type occlusion was 0.916, with a sensitivity of 92.86%, and specificity of 90.41%. Conclusion: Truncal-type occlusion showed a high predictability of ICAS.

We hypothesized that goal-directed therapy would confer morbidity and mortality benefits in major trauma. METHODS The MedLine, Embase and Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register databases were systematically searched for randomized, controlled trials of goal-directed therapy in severe trauma patients. Mortality was the primary outcome of this review. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, and the volume of fluid and blood administered. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan software, and the data presented are as odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and as mean differences (MDs) and standard MDs for continuous outcomes. RESULTS Four randomized, controlled trials including 419 patients were analyzed. Mortality risk was significantly reduced in goal-directed therapy-treated patients, compared to the control group(OR=0.56, 95%CI: 0.34-0.92).

Compared with the patients included in the 1999-2000 cohort (n = 2807), the patients in 2015-2016 cohort were significantly older (median age, 70 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 59-79] vs 67 years [IQR, 54-75]; P < .001) and the proportion of female patients was similar (39.6% vs 38.7%; P = .58). Significantly more treatment limitations occurred in the 2015-2016 cohort compared with the 1999-2000 cohort (1601 [89.7%] vs 1918 [68.3%]; difference, 21.4% [95% CI, 19.2% to 23.6%]; P < .001), with more withholding of life-prolonging therapy (892 [50.0%] vs 1143 [40.7%]; difference, 9.3% [95% CI, 6.4% to 12.3%]; P < .001), more withdrawing of life-prolonging therapy (692 [38.8%] vs 695 [24.8%]; difference, 14.0% [95% CI, 11.2% to 16.8%]; P < .001), less failed CPR (110 [6.2%] vs 628 [22.4%]; difference, -16.2% [95% CI, -18.1% to -14.3%]; P < .001), less brain death (74 [4.1%] vs 261 [9.3%]; difference, -5.2% [95% CI, -6.6% to -3.8%]; P < .001) and less active shortening of the dying process (17 [1.0%] vs 80 [2.9%]; difference, -1.9% [95% CI, -2.7% to -1.1%]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients who had treatment limitations or died in 22 European ICUs in 2015-2016, compared with data reported from the same ICUs in 1999-2000, limitations in life-prolonging therapies occurred significantly more frequently and death without limitations in life-prolonging therapies occurred significantly less frequently. These findings suggest a shift in end-of-life practices in European ICUs, but the study is limited in that it excluded patients who survived ICU hospitalization without treatment limitations.","Sprung, Charles L; Ricou, Bara; Hartog, Christiane S; Maia, Paulo; Mentzelopoulos, Spyros D; Weiss, Manfred; Levin, Phillip D; Galarza, Laura; de la Guardia, Veronica; Schefold, Joerg C; Baras, Mario; Joynt, Gavin M; Bülow, Hans-Henrik; Nakos, Georgios; Cerny, Vladimir; Marsch, Stephan; Girbes, Armand R; Ingels, Catherine; Miskolci, Orsolya; Ledoux, Didier; Mullick, Sudakshina; Bocci, Maria G; Gjedsted, Jakob; Estébanez, Belén; Nates, Joseph L; Lesieur, Olivier; Sreedharan, Roshni; Giannini, Alberto M; Fuciños, Lucía Cachafeiro; Danbury, Christopher M; Michalsen, Andrej; Soliman, Ivo W; Estella, Angel; Avidan, Alexander",JAMA,260,8

Two of the most cumbersome side-effects of the ablation procedure are intractable pain and vagotonia when deep sedation is not used. We describe local injection of anesthetic into Glisson's sheath as a new technique for overcoming these problems. Lidocaine was injected into Glisson's sheath when radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinomas, which were located adjacent to Glisson's sheath, could not be continued due to severe pain (n = 8) or bradycardia (n = 3). In all three patients who showed vagotonia with bradycardia during the ablations, injection of lidocaine prevented bradycardia, allowing completion of the radiofrequency ablation. Pain was reduced in all eight patients who experienced pain during ablation. No side-effects were observed during the procedures. Injection of anesthetic into Glisson's sheath is simple and effective for reducing intractable pain and vagotonia associated with RFA.","Nakamura, Shinichiro; Nouso, Kazuhiro; Onishi, Hideki; Kuwaki, Kenji; Hagihara, Hiroaki; Takeuchi, Yasuto; Wada, Nozomu; Morimoto, Yuki; Miyahara, Koji; Yasunaka, Tetsuya; Ikeda, Fusao; Miyake, Yasuhiro; Kobayashi, Yoshiyuki; Shiraha, Hidenori; Ishikawa, Shinichi; Takaki, Akinobu; Yamamoto, Kazuhide",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,260,1

METHODS Using a neonatal manikin, 17 subject-pairs were randomized in a crossover design to provide 5-min CPR with a 3:1 chest compression (CC) to ventilation (C:V) ratio and continuous CCs at a rate of 120 min(-1) with asynchronous ventilations (CCaV-120). We measured participants' changes in heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP); perceived level of fatigue on a validated Likert scale; and manikin CC measures. RESULTS CCaV-120 compared with a 3:1 C:V ratio resulted in a change during 5-min of CPR in HR 49 versus 40 bpm (p = 0.01), and MAP 1.7 versus -2.8 mmHg (p = 0.03); fatigue rated on a Likert scale 12.9 versus 11.4 (p = 0.2); and a significant decay in CC depth after 90 s (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS The results indicate a trend toward more fatigue during simulated CPR in CCaV-120 compared to the recommended 3:1 C:V CPR.

The objective of this study was to explore if dose reduction, discontinuation, switch to a partial agonist, or switch from polypharmacy to monotherapy will lead to weight loss. Methods Controlled and uncontrolled studies reporting the effects of discontinuation, dose reduction, switch to a partial agonist, or switch from polypharmacy to monotherapy on weight were included. Primary outcome was difference in weight compared to maintenance groups based on controlled studies. Secondary outcome was change in weight from initiation of one of the included interventions until follow-up in a pre-post analysis. Results We identified 40 randomized controlled trials and 15 uncontrolled studies including 12,279 individuals. The effect of the interventions, i.e. dose reduction, drug discontinuation, or switch to a partial agonis, reduced the weight with 1.5 kg (95% CI -2.03 to -0.98; P < 0.001) compared to maintenance treatment. The weight change from pre to post was a reduction of 1.13 kg (95% CI -1.36 to -0.90; P < 0.001). Conclusion We found a significant but small reduction in weight, suggesting that antipsychotic-induced weight gain can be reversed to some degree. Only a few studies were designed to address the question as primary outcome, which limits the generalizability of our findings.","Speyer, Helene; Westergaard, Casper; Albert, Nikolai; Karlsen, Mette; Stürup, Anne Emilie; Nordentoft, Merete; Krogh, Jesper",Frontiers in endocrinology,260,12

Here, we investigated whether a point of care (POC) approach to perioperative bleeding and coagulopathy based on rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) results could decrease perioperative blood loss and the perioperative consumption of blood products during lung transplantation. METHODS Patients undergoing bilateral lung transplantation were randomized into two groups: In the first group, designated the ""non POC"" group, the management of perioperative bleeding and coagulopathy was based on the clinical experience of the anesthesiologist; in the second group, designated the ""POC"" group, the management of perioperative bleeding, and coagulopathy was based on the ROTEM results. RESULTS After performing an interim statistical analysis, the project was prematurely terminated as the results were significantly in favor of the POC approach. Data were analyzed for the period January 2018 until June 2020 when 67 patients were recruited into the study. There was significantly decreased perioperative blood loss in the POC group (n = 31 patients) with p = 0.013, decreased perioperative consumption of RBC with p = 0.009, and decreased perioperative consumption of fresh frozen plasma with p < 0.0001 (practically no fresh frozen plasma was used in the POC group) without deteriorating clot formation in secondary and primary hemostasis as compared to the non POC group (n = 36). CONCLUSION POC management of perioperative bleeding and coagulopathy based on ROTEM results is a promising strategy to decrease perioperative blood loss and the consumption of blood products in lung transplantation.","Durila, Miroslav; Vajter, Jaromir; Garaj, Michal; Pollert, Lukas; Berousek, Jan; Vachtenheim, Jiri; Vymazal, Tomas; Lischke, Robert",The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation,260,1

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to encourage home-based dialysis options have increased due to risks of infective transmission for patients receiving hemodialysis in center-based units. There are various practical and clinical advantages for patients receiving hemodialysis at home. However, the lack of caregiver support, cognitive and physical impairment, challenges of vascular access, and preparation and training for home hemodialysis (HHD) initiation may present as barriers to successful implementation of HHD in the older dialysis population. Assessment of an older patient's frailty status may help clinicians guide patients when making decisions about HHD. The development of an assisted HHD care delivery model and advancement of telehealth and technology in provision of HHD care may increase accessibility of HHD services for older patients. This review examines these factors and explores current unmet needs and barriers to increasing access, inclusion, and opportunities of HHD for the older dialysis population.","Wu, Henry H L; Nixon, Andrew C; Dhaygude, Ajay P; Jayanti, Anu; Mitra, Sandip",Hemodialysis international.

It lasts for 1 month per the lunar calendar year and is the abstention from any food and drink from dawn to sunset. While recommendations on 'safe' fasting exist for patients with some chronic conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, guidance for patients with cardiovascular disease is lacking. We reviewed the literature to help healthcare professionals educate, discuss and manage patients with cardiovascular conditions, who are considering fasting. Studies on the safety of Ramadan fasting in patients with cardiac disease are sparse, observational, of small sample size and have short follow-up. Using expert consensus and a recognised framework, we risk stratified patients into 'low or moderate risk', for example, stable angina or non-severe heart failure; 'high risk', for example, poorly controlled arrhythmias or recent myocardial infarction; and 'very high risk', for example, advanced heart failure. The 'low-moderate risk' group may fast, provided their medications and clinical conditions allow. The 'high' or 'very high risk' groups should not fast and may consider safe alternatives such as non-consecutive fasts or fasting shorter days, for example, during winter. All patients who are fasting should be educated before Ramadan on their risk and management (including the risk of dehydration, fluid overload and terminating the fast if they become unwell) and reviewed after Ramadan to reassess their risk status and condition. Further studies to clarify the benefits and risks of fasting on the cardiovascular system in patients with different cardiovascular conditions should help refine these recommendations.","Akhtar, Abid Mohammed; Ghouri, Nazim; Chahal, C Anwar A; Patel, Riyaz; Ricci, Fabrizio; Sattar, Naveed; Waqar, Salman; Khanji, Mohammed Yunus",Heart,260,24

However, the molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of uncharacterized fission yeast proteins Mso1 and Sec1 in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis. Fission yeast Mso1 shares homology with budding yeast Mso1 and human Mint1, proteins that interact with Sec1/Munc18 family proteins during vesicle fusion. Sec1/Munc18 proteins and their interactors are important regulators of SNARE complex formation during vesicle fusion. The roles of these proteins in vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis have been barely studied. Here, we show that fission yeast Mso1 is also a Sec1 binding protein and Mso1 and Sec1 localize to the division site interdependently during cytokinesis. The loss of Sec1 localization in mso1Δ cells results in a decrease in vesicle fusion and cytokinesis defects such as slow ring constriction, defective ring disassembly, and delayed plasma membrane closure. We also find that Mso1 and Sec1 may have functions independent of the exocyst tethering complex on the plasma membrane at the division site. Together, Mso1 and Sec1 play essential roles in regulating vesicle fusion and cargo delivery at the division site during cytokinesis.

Among them, KPC-31, KPC-39, KPC-49, KPC-66, KP-68, KPC-69 and KPC-70 showed amino acid substitutions, insertions and deletions in the Ω loop of the protein. KPC-29 has the duplication, while the novel KPC-67 has the triplication of the KDD triplet in the 270-loop of the protein.

Selection also promoted multiplication of the carbapenemase gene copy number by transposition, recombination, and fusion of resident plasmids. When expressed in Escherichia coli recipient cells cloned in the high-copy number pTOPO vector, the Ω loop mutated variants showed CZA-resistant phenotype associated with susceptibility to carbapenems, while KPC variants with insertions in the 270-loop showed residual activity on carbapenems.

Based on clinical data, the mesh-defect area ratio (MDAR) can lead to lower recurrence rates. Using dynamic intermittent strain (DIS) in a pig tissue model, MDAR can be modified to give a measure called grip to better assess the mechanical stability of ventral hernia repair. The focus of this experimental study is to assess the different aspects of mesh overlap (OL) and fixation only in bridging repair of ventral hernias. DIS mimics coughing actions in an ex vivo model with the repetition of submaximal impacts delivered via a hydraulically driven plastic containment. Tissue derived from pig bellies simulates a ventral hernia with varying defect sizes. MDAR is calculated from the hernia orifice and the mesh OL. Commercially available meshes were strengthened with glue, tacks, and sutures to bridge the defects. The reconstructions are strained with up to 425 dynamic impacts. The grip of each repair is assessed using MDAR modified by the strength of the fixation. The DIS classification is based on bridging of a 5 cm ventral hernia orifice with an OL of 5 cm in a sublay position. The classification discriminates meshes properties upon DIS strain. MDAR is calculated to be 9 under these conditions. Decreasing the OL or increasing the hernia orifice reduces MDAR to numbers below 9. MDAR is modified to reach GRIP. Closure of the peritoneum adds about 4 to the grip given by MDAR. The multiplying factor of a transmural suture or one tack of Securestrap® or Protack® is 0.5 times the number of tacks applied. The multiplier given by a bonding spot of Glubran® is similar to that of an Absorbatack® being 0.33. Plotting the likelihood of a bridging repair to survive more than 400 DIS impacts versus the grip estimated from the factors given above, the grip to be passed for a durable repair is 10 for Parietex Progrip®, and Dynamesh Cicat® and 25 for Dynamesh IPOM®. Clinical data previously published can be reculculated to assess MDAR and permit an estimation of the grip of the reconstruction. In these recalculations, a correlation between MDAR and long-term recurrence rates is found. A dimensionless number called grip can be calculated. The grip can be modified by fixation in a reproducible way. A higher grip can improve the durability of ventral hernia repair. We believe that a higher grip leads to lower recurrence rates in the clinical setting.","Kallinowski, Friedrich; Harder, F; Gutjahr, D; Raschidi, R; Silva, T G; Vollmer, M; Nessel, Regine",Frontiers in surgery,260,1

Responses to surveys, however, are susceptible to psychological biases, including framing effects and social desirability. Our aim was to measure the effects of these biases on estimates of compliance with public health guidance (eg, hand-washing, social distancing). DESIGN We conducted two online experiments (n=1800) and varied whether questions were framed positively or negatively (eg, 'I always wash my hands…' vs 'I don't always wash my hands…'). We also varied the degree to which anonymity was assured, via a 'list' experiment. RESULTS Reported compliance, despite being generally high, was reduced by negatively framing questions and increasing anonymity using a list experiment technique. Effect sizes were large: compliance estimates diminished by up to 17% points and 10% points, respectively. CONCLUSION Estimates of compliance with COVID-19 guidance vary substantially with how the question is asked. Standard tracking surveys tend to pose questions in ways that lead to higher estimates than alternative approaches. Experimental tests of these surveys offer public health officials greater insight into the range of likely compliance estimates to better inform policy and communications.","Timmons, Shane; McGinnity, Frances; Belton, Cameron; Barjaková, Martina; Lunn, Peter",Journal of epidemiology and community health,260,1

The development and testing of genetic therapies for respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) has also progressed. The addition of gene editing to the genetic agent toolbox, and its early success in other organ systems, suggests we will see rapid expansion of gene correction options for CF in the future. Although substantial progress has been made in creating techniques and genetic agents that can be highly effective for CF correction in vitro, physiologically-relevant functional in vivo changes have been largely prevented by poor delivery efficiency within the lungs. Somewhat hidden from view however is the absence of reliable, accurate, detailed, and non-invasive outcome measures that can detect subtle disease and treatment effects in the lungs of humans or animal models. The ability to measure the fundamental function of the lung - ventilation, the effective transport of air throughout the lung - has been constrained by the available measurement technologies. Without sensitive measurement methods, it is difficult to quantify the effectiveness of genetic therapies for CF. The mainstays of lung health assessment are spirometry, which cannot provide adequate disease localization and is not sensitive enough to detect small early changes in disease; and computed tomography, which provides structural rather than functional information. Magnetic resonance imaging using hyperpolarized gases is increasingly useful for lung ventilation assessment, and it removes the radiation risk that accompanies X-ray methods.

Abrasion of the fragile tracheal epithelium can occur at the points of contact between the tube and mucosa subject to respiratory movement. In this original experiment, we examined the mucosal protective effect of coating endotracheal tubes with poly[2-methacryloyloxyethl phosphorylcholine (MPC)-co-n-butyl methacrylate] (PMB). METHODS We prepared four types of tubes: tube A (control, no coating), tube B (two coats, 0.5% PMB), tube C (10 coats, 0.5% PMB) or tube D (one coat, 5% PMB). Twenty-nine beagle dogs were divided into four groups and orally intubated with tube A, B, C or D for 4±0.5 h. The cuffs of extubated tubes were stained with haematoxylin. Paraffin sections from tracheal walls in contact with the inflated cuff were stained with haematoxylin/eosin and periodic acid-Schiff. RESULTS Cuffs of tubes A and B were strongly stained with haematoxylin because of attached epithelial cells. Stained areas in those of tubes C and D were significantly reduced. Histological analysis showed that a single coat of 5% PMB prevented epithelial abrasion and proliferation of goblet cells. Excess tracheal mucus was observed in the tube A group, but not in the tube D group. CONCLUSION Tracheal epithelial damage caused by intubation was greatly reduced or eliminated by PMB coating on the surface of the tracheal tube.","Ito, Seiko; Shimohata, Nobuyuki; Iwanaga, Shintaroh; Ito, Wataru; Ohba, Masahiro; Mochizuki, Manabu; Nakagawa, Takayuki; Suzuki, Shigeki; Sasaki, Nobuo; Koshima, Isao; Chung, Ung-il",European journal of anaesthesiology,260,26

Comparisons between countries' schemes allow others to assess best practice, and aggregating published results from eradication schemes provides greater statistical power when analysing data. Aggregating data requires that results derived from different testing schemes be calibrated against one another. The authors aimed to evaluate whether relationships between published BVDV test results could be created and present the outcome of a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The results are tabulated, providing a summary of papers where there is potential cross-calibration and a summary of the obstacles preventing such data aggregation. Although differences in measuring BVDV present barriers to academic progress, they may also affect progress within individual eradication schemes. The authors examined the time taken to retest following an initial antibody BVDV test in the Scottish eradication scheme. The authors demonstrate that retesting occurred quicker if the initial not negative test was from blood rather than milk samples. Such differences in the response of farmers/veterinarians to tests may be of interest to the design of future schemes.","Duncan, A J; Gunn, G J; Humphry, R W",The Veterinary record,260,1

The aim of this study is to analyse the utility of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in the management of the neurological patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS The Clinical Neurophysiology Department of the Hospital Central de la Defensa Gomez Ulla was dissolved due to the hospital collapse situation. Therefore, the EEG was performed exceptionally in those cases with the greatest probability of providing a benefit in its management. We describe seven patients (four in ICU and three hospitalized) diagnosed with COVID-19, who underwent through an EEG. RESULTS The EEG showed abnormalities in all cases, including one case of brain death. The EEG resulted in a change in clinical management in four of the patients (57%) and helped the clinician provide information to the family. In the other three cases, a toxic-metabolic origin was suspected before the EEG was performed, so it did not imply a change in the clinical management already proposed, although it facilitated a prognostic orientation. Slow polymorphic waves were evident in five cases. Five patients were unresponsive. Currently, one patient remain hospitalized and four have died. CONCLUSIONS The EEG was useful and facilitated decision making in COVID-19 patients in whom it was requested. It guided the diagnosis in cases where CT was non-contributory and led to a change in therapeutic management in most patients. The most frequent findings were signs of encephalopathy and epileptiform discharges.","Hallal-Peche, F; Aguilera-Vergara, M; Guzmán-Méndez, M; González-Mendoza, C; Armas-Zurita, R; Garzón-Pulido, T; Moreno-Jiménez, C; Villar Royo-Martínez, M",Revista de neurologia,260,17

Based on the environmental problems found in the investigation, the fluoride removal research in the water containing algal cells was carried out. In this study, AlCl3 and [AlO4Al12(OH)24(H2O)12]7+ (Al13) were used to remove fluoride. Additionally, the role of aluminum speciation in fluoride removal and the effect of Microcystis aeruginosa on the fluoride removal by different aluminum species coagulants were elucidated. The results showed that AlCl3 mainly removed fluoride by physical interactions, surface adsorption and enmeshment. When algal cells were added to the system, the fluoride removal rate increased from 22.75 % to 72.99 % at a dosage of 40.0 mg/L. This was because algal cells greatly increased the distribution of Al(OH)3 in the flocs. In particular, the specific surface area of the flocs containing algal cells reached 160.77 m2/g, which allowed more fluoride to be adsorbed. However, excessive Al3+ led to serious damage to algal cells and release of intracellular organic matter (IOM), worsening the effect of defluoridation. F- and Al3+ formed AlF2+ and AlF2+ via complexation in water. These compounds were not conducive to defluoridation. Al13 removed fluorine mainly through ion exchange, substitution and hydrogen bonding. Algal cells had an inhibitory effect on defluorination, which was observed in the process of coagulation by different Al dosages. Al13 achieved agglomeration of algal cells and generated small and dense flocs through charge neutralization and electrostatic patch mechanism. Once Al13 combined with algal cells and algae organic matter (AOM), the reaction between Al13 and fluoride would be weakened. Al13 not only maintained the defluoridation performance, but also did not damage the integrity of algal cells, even at high dosages.","Xiang, Yu; Xu, Hui; Li, Chun-Fu; Demissie, Hailu; Li, Kun; Fan, Hua",Chemosphere,260,5

On the one hand, the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most common procedures used. However, many patients experience dumping syndrome or pain due to bile reflux. On the other hand, revisions after gastric banding are frequent and may be technically challenging. AIM To create a new bariatric procedure counterbalancing the drawbacks of conventional RYGB, also suitable as a redo option after gastric banding. MATERIAL AND METHODS To diminish the complication rate and pathophysiological disadvantages in reoperations after gastric banding, we primarily combined a gastric plication (GP) with a single anastomosis duodeno-ileal omega switch (DIOS), bypassing 2/3 of the total bowel length. Further on, in patients with lower body mass index we combined a GP or LSG and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with a duodeno-jejunal omega switch (DJOS), performing an end-to side anastomosis after 1/3 of the total bowel length. RESULTS The DIOS and DJOS techniques restrict food intake and bypass the duodenum and part (DJOS) or the whole (DIOS) jejunum. Restriction is achieved either through gastric plicature or conventional sleeve gastrectomy. CONCLUSIONS Similar bariatric and metabolic effects to proximal RYGB are expected in the case of DJOS, or to a conventional duodenal switch when performing a DIOS procedure. Performing a gastric plicature will reduce the risk of gastric leak when revising patients after failed gastric banding.","Karcz, W Konrad; Kuesters, Simon; Marjanovic, Goran; Grueneberger, Jodok M",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,260,5

We detected diverse and potentially novel parvoviruses from bats in Hong Kong and mainland China. Parvoviruses belonging to Amdoparvovirus, Bocaparvovirus and Dependoparvovirus were detected in alimentary, liver and spleen samples from 16 different chiropteran species of five families by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of partial helicase sequences showed that they potentially belonged to 25 bocaparvovirus, three dependoparvovirus and one amdoparvovirus species. Nearly complete genome sequencing confirmed the existence of at least four novel bat bocaparvovirus species (Rp-BtBoV1 and Rp-BtBoV2 from Rhinolophus pusillus, Rs-BtBoV2 from Rhinolophus sinicus and Rol-BtBoV1 from Rousettus leschenaultii) and two novel bat dependoparvovirus species (Rp-BtAAV1 from Rhinolophus pusillus and Rs-BtAAV1 from Rhinolophus sinicus). Rs-BtBoV2 was closely related to Ungulate bocaparvovirus 5 with 93, 72.1 and 78.7 % amino acid identities in the NS1, NP1 and VP1/VP2 genes, respectively. The detection of bat bocaparvoviruses, including Rs-BtBoV2, closely related to porcine bocaparvoviruses, suggests recent interspecies transmission of bocaparvoviruses between bats and swine. Moreover, Rp-BtAAV1 and Rs-BtAAV1 were most closely related to human AAV1 with 48.7 and 57.5 % amino acid identities in the rep gene. The phylogenetic relationship between BtAAVs and other mammalian AAVs suggests bats as the ancestral origin of mammalian AAVs. Furthermore, parvoviruses of the same species were detected from multiple bat species or families, supporting the ability of bat parvoviruses to cross species barriers. The results extend our knowledge on the diversity of bat parvoviruses and the role of bats in parvovirus evolution and emergence in humans and animals.","Lau, Susanna K P; Ahmed, Syed Shakeel; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Yeung, Hazel C; Li, Kenneth S M; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Zhao, Pyrear S H; Lau, Candy C C; Lam, Carol S F; Choi, Kelvin K F; Chan, Ben C H; Cai, Jian-Piao; Wong, Samson S Y; Chen, Honglin; Zhang, Hai-Lin; Zhang, Libiao; Wang, Ming; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",The Journal of general virology,260,30

We sought to characterize clinical research activity during the recent influenza A pandemic and to understand the experiences, beliefs, and practices of key stakeholders involved in pandemic research implementation. DESIGN Cross-sectional, provincial postal questionnaire. SETTING Level III ICUs. PARTICIPANTS ICU administrators and research coordinators. MEASUREMENTS We used rigorous survey methodology to identify potential respondents and to develop, test, and administer two-related questionnaires. MAIN RESULTS We analyzed responses from 39 research coordinators and 139 administrators (response rates: 70.9% and 73.2%, respectively). Compared with non-influenza A studies, influenza A studies were less likely to be randomized trials and most often investigator-initiated and peer-review funded. Whereas both respondent groups felt that pandemic research would be helpful in providing care during future pandemics, research coordinators placed significantly greater importance on their ICU's participation in pandemic research. Both respondent groups expressed a need for rapid approval processes, designated funding for research personnel, adequate funding for start-up and patient screening, preapproved template protocols and consent forms, and clearer guidance regarding co-enrollment. Research coordinators acknowledged a need for alternative consent models to increase their capacity to participate in future pandemic research. More administrators expressed willingness to participate in the next pandemic if the required research resources were made available to them. CONCLUSIONS Whereas research personnel and administrators support participation in pandemic ICU research, several modifiable barriers to participation exist. Pandemic research preparedness planning with regulatory bodies and dedicated funding to support research infrastructure, especially in community settings, are required to optimize future pandemic research participation.","Burns, Karen E A; Rizvi, Leena; Tan, Wylie; Marshall, John C; Pope, Karen",Critical care medicine,260,31

During laparoscopic gastrostomy, it is standard to perform gastropexy, apposing visceral and parietal peritoneum. In some settings, due to altered anatomy from prior surgery, direct apposition of the stomach to the abdominal wall is not possible. This study reports a series of cases where laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed via a Witzel approach without gastropexy. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients at a tertiary academic medical center who underwent Witzel gastrostomy without gastropexy over a 3-year period. In each case, an 18-French tube was placed into the fundus of the stomach and secured with a purse-string suture. A 5-cm serosalized Witzel tunnel was created around the tube using running silk suture. No gastropexy was performed. RESULTS Six patients underwent 7 Witzel gastrostomy procedures. In three cases, patients had undergone prior major upper abdominal surgery where adhesive disease prevented gastropexy. In the other four cases, the patients had undergone prior gastric bypass with antecolic antegastric position of the roux limb. No patient suffered leak of gastric contents into the peritoneum, and there were no postoperative complications or mortality related to the gastrostomy. CONCLUSION In cases where enteral access is necessary, and where the stomach cannot reach the anterior abdominal wall for gastropexy due to prior surgeries, a Witzel gastrostomy without gastropexy is a safe option which resulted in no morbidity or mortality in our series.","Davies, Joshua; Pernar, Luise; Eble, Danielle; Fernandez, Adolfo Z; Carmine, Brian; Hess, Donald; Carter, Cullen",Obesity surgery,260,1

Luminal chemosensing is a term used to describe how small molecules in the gut lumen interact with the host through surface receptors or via transport into the subepithelial space. In this review, we have summarized recent advances in the understanding of the luminal chemosensory system in the gastroduodenal epithelium consisting of enterocytes, enteroendocrine, and tuft cells, with particular emphasis on how chemosensing affects mucosal protective responses and the metabolic syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS Recent single-cell RNA sequencing provides detailed cell type-specific expression of chemosensory receptors and other bioactive molecules as well as cell lineages; some are similar to lingual taste cells whereas some are gut specific. Gut luminal chemosensing is not only important for the local or remote regulation of gut function, but also contributes to the systemic regulation of metabolism, energy balance, and food intake. We will discuss the chemosensory mechanisms of the proximal intestine, in particular to gastric acid, with a focus on the cell types and receptors involved in chemosensing, with emphasis on the rare chemosensory cells termed tuft cells. We will also discuss the chemosensory functions of intestinal ectoenzymes and bacterial components (e.g., lipopolysaccharide) as well as how they affect mucosal function through altering the gut-hormonal-neural axis. SUMMARY Recent updates in luminal chemosensing by different chemosensory cells have provided new possibilities for identifying novel molecular targets for the treatment of mucosal injury, metabolic disorders, and abnormal visceral sensation.","Akiba, Yasutada; Hashimoto, Sayuri; Kaunitz, Jonathan D",Current opinion in gastroenterology,260,1

And what does the study add? We have previously shown that percutaneous radiofrequency ablation guided by image-fusion technology allows for precise needle placement with real time ultrasound superimposed with pre-loaded imaging, removing the need for real-time CT or MR guidance. Emerging technology also allows real-time tracking of a treatment needle within an organ in a virtually created 3D format. To our knowledge, this is the first study utilising a sophisticated ultrasound-based navigation system that uses both image-fusion and real-time probe-tracking technologies for in-vivo renal ablative intervention. OBJECTIVES • To evaluate the feasibility, accuracy and efficacy of ultrasonography (US)-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the canine kidney model using novel Global Positioning System-like probe tracking technology. • Virtual tumours in the canine kidney were ablated in vivo by percutaneous RFA guided exclusively by two-dimensional (2D) US and a virtual navigation system. MATERIALS AND METHODS • Gold fiducial markers were inserted into renal parenchyma to serve as centres of virtual tumours. • After capturing 2D US images, navigation software created a three-dimensional planning model of the kidney, and superimposed it onto the live US image. • Percutaneous RFA was guided by multiplanar navigation, showing real-time probe positions within the superimposed images, to treat each virtual tumour with a single treatment. • Navigator software predicted the percentage of tumour treated; treated kidney specimens were examined to evaluate projection and targeting accuracy. RESULTS • In total, 32 virtual tumours (median diameter 16 mm, range 10-24 mm) were treated in 16 canine kidneys. • Median (range) error between 'fiducial tumour centre' and 'treated area centre' was 1.8 (0-25) mm. • Targeting accuracy improved with experience: median (range) error decreased from 6.3 (2-25) mm in an initial 12 tumours to 1.3 (0-9.0) mm in the last 20 tumours (P= 0.008). • The percentage (range) of tumour actually treated improved significantly from the initial series at 23% (0-100%) to 100% (51-100%) (P < 0.001). • Overall, navigator-reported and pathologically confirmed treatment percentages were correlated significantly (r= 0.5; P= 0.006). CONCLUSIONS • Percutaneous renal RFA guided exclusively by real-time 2D US with multiplanar Global Positioning System-like probe tracking is feasible and accurate. • Near-future technologies, including elastic fusion overlay and anticipation of soft-tissue deformation, will further augment this guidance system.","Hung, Andrew J; Ma, Yanling; Zehnder, Pascal; Nakamoto, Masahiko; Gill, Inderbir S; Ukimura, Osamu",BJU international,260,0

Recently, a transperineal robotic radical prostatectomy, a technique not yet popular to many, was introduced as an alternative approach in patients with previous abdominal surgery. Here, we present our unique experience with robotic perineal radical prostatectomy (r-PRP) on a kidney transplant recipient. Case Presentation: A 71-year-old man who had a kidney transplant 4 months previously was diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) and underwent r-PRP using the da Vinci Xi robotic system. The operative time was 110 minutes and blood loss was minimal. After the perineal drain was removed on postoperative day 3, the patient was discharged. The urethral catheter was subsequently removed on postoperative day 8. Pathologic analysis revealed localized PCa with negative surgical margins. Conclusion: The r-PRP offers all the advantages of minimally invasive surgery. Moreover, in a kidney transplant recipient, it provides additional benefits, such as avoidance of allograft vascular and ureteral injuries, while maintaining an equivalent oncologic efficacy and surgical safety compared with its transabdominal counterpart.","Tugcu, Volkan; Simsek, Abdulmuttalip; Yigitbasi, Ismail; Yenice, Mustafa Gurkan; Sahin, Selcuk; Tasci, Ali Ihsan",Journal of endourology case reports,260,1

Rhodiola crenulata (RC) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and to enhance exercise endurance, thereby having the potential to treat COPD. In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 57 patients with stable moderate-to-severe COPD aged 70±8.8 years were given RC (250 mg twice/day) (n=38) or a placebo (250 mg twice/day) (n=19) in addition to their standard regimen. There were no significant differences in anthropometrics, quality of life, lung function, six-minute walk and incremental exercise tests between the two groups at enrollment. Over the 12 weeks, RC was well tolerated, significantly reduced triceps skin thickness (Δ=-1 mm, p=.04), change of FEV1 (4.5%, p=.03), and improved workload (Δ=10%, p=.01); although there were no significant differences in these factors between the two groups. However, there were significant between-group differences in tidal volume and ventilation-CO2-output ratio at peak exercise (both p=.05), which were significantly related to peak work rate (both p<.0001). RC tended to protect against acute exacerbation of COPD (p=.1) but not other measurements. RC did not improve the six-minute walk test distance but significantly improved tidal breathing and ventilation efficiency, most likely through improvements in work rate.

The biological function of purified PET-AmIL-18 was determined on mouse splenocytes by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. INF-γ and other cytokines were increased when stimulated by PET-AmIL-18, particularly when combined with recombinant human interleukin 12, while a Th2-type cytokine, interleukin-4, was strikingly suppressed. These results will provide information for the potential use of recombinant proteins to manipulate the immune response in giant pandas and facilitate the study to protect this treasured species.","Yan, Y; Wang, Q; Niu, L L; Deng, J B; Yu, J Q; Zhang J X Wang, Y Z; Yin, M M; Tan, X M",Genetics and molecular research : GMR,260,26

Also, it aimed at ascertaining, for the first time, the effect of changes in climatic conditions (spring versus summer) on the aforementioned steroids, testicular volume, testicular echotexture (pixel intensity; PI, and integrated density; ID), and semen quality in goats. Saliva and plasma samples were collected from 7 male Shiba goats weekly in spring and summer for measurement of testosterone (T; ng/ml), estradiol (E2; pg/ml), and cortisol (ng/ml) using radioimmunoassay. The changes in testicular volumes (TV/ml) and echogenicity were monitored weekly using ultrasonographic assessments concomitantly with subjective evaluations of semen parameters. Results revealed a highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.72; P < 0.0001) between plasma and salivary cortisol. Mild significant positive correlation was found between salivary and plasma T levels (r = 0.31; P < 0.002). However, low non-significant negative correlation was reported between salivary and plasma E2 levels (r = -0.24; P > 0.05). Higher levels of salivary cortisol were found in summer than in the spring (3.8 ± 0.6 ng/ml versus 1.4 ± 0.3 ng/ml; P < 0.001). However, no differences in levels of T, E2, and plasma cortisol were recorded between spring and summer (P > 0.05). Values of testicular PI and ID were significantly (P < 0.001) higher in the summer (94.5 ± 4.9, 258,388 ± 13,190, respectively) than in the spring (74.0 ± 2.1, 200,922 ± 5704, respectively). Meanwhile, TV and semen parameters did not significantly differ between spring and summer. In conclusion, saliva can be considered as an alternative biological fluid for the measurement of cortisol and T, but not suitable for E2. Climatic conditions significantly impact the levels of cortisol in saliva and testicular echogenicity in goats.","Samir, Haney; Nyametease, Paul; Elbadawy, Mohamed; Fathi, Mohamed; Mandour, Ahmed S; Radwan, Faten; Nagaoka, Kentaro; Sasaki, Kazuaki; Watanabe, Gen",Theriogenology,260,23

To this end, we used two radionuclides, technetium 99m ((99m) Tc) and indium 111-chloride ((111) In-Cl3 ), coupled with single-photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT). We studied five patients with PMF and one with secondary myelofibrosis (MF). The classical pattern of lower fixation of both tracers at the axial skeleton where the myelofibrotic process occurs and the reactivation of sites of active hematopoiesis at the distal skeleton were confirmed. Coupling both radionuclides to SPECT/CT imaging allowed for more precise visualization of the sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis as those observed in the spleen and liver. Splenic high uptake of (111) In-Cl3 coupled with SPECT/CT represents a pathognomonic feature of PMF. We conclude that, the hybrid imaging procedures that we studied might constitute an alternative noninvasive method for the screening of the whole-body marrow and, by this way, to assess the impact of targeted therapies in PMF patients in whom it is well known that the distribution of the hematopoietic active areas is disturbed. Hybrid imaging could also be useful for diagnostic purposes in cases of early PMF or in suspected cases of myelofibrosis secondary to polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.","Ojeda-Uribe, Mario; Morel, Olivier; Ungureanu, Constantin; Desterke, Christophe; Le Bousse-Kerdilès, Marie-Caroline; Boulahdour, Hatem",Cancer medicine,260,1

METHODS Metagenomics using unbiased RNA or DNA sequencing was applied to faecal material from an 11-year-old female kakapo with exudative cloacitis, and a pool of eight birds (male and female aged 1-20 years) with no current signs or history of the disease. Faecal material from the diseased bird was collected pre- and post-treatment. For RNA sequencing, extracted RNA/DNA was subject to DNase, and the remaining RNA reverse transcribed to cDNA and subject to multiple displacement amplification prior to sequencing. RESULTS No significant alignment to any known avian virus sequence was obtained from any faecal samples. However significant BLAST alignments to five bacteriophages known to infect enterobacteria were obtained. Strong evidence was obtained for the presence of the bacteriophage Escherichia phage TL-2011b, a bacteriophage known to occur in Escherichia coli causing outbreaks of foodborne disease in humans, in the sample from the diseased bird, but not the non-diseased pool. Differences in E. coli community structure between the diseased bird and the non-diseased pool were also apparent. CONCLUSIONS Escherichia coli infection of human origin is suggested as a possible cause of exudative cloacitis, although confirmatory work is required to test this hypothesis.","White, D J; Hall, R J; Jakob-Hoff, R; Wang, J; Jackson, B; Tompkins, D M",New Zealand veterinary journal,260,5

The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is a recently developed intrasaccular flow disrupter dedicated to endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the WEB Dual-Layer and WEB Single-Layer devices for the treatment of wide-neck anterior communicating artery aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated with the WEB device between June 2013 and March 2014 in 5 French centers were analyzed. Procedural success, technical complications, clinical outcome at 1 month, and immediate and 3- to 6-month angiographic follow-up results were analyzed. RESULTS Ten patients with unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms with a mean neck diameter of 5.4 mm were treated with the WEB. Treatment failed in 3 of the 10 aneurysms without further clinical complications. One patient developed a procedural thromboembolic event, and the other 6 had normal neurologic examination findings at 1-month follow-up. Immediate anatomic outcome evaluation showed adequate occlusion (total occlusion or neck remnant) in 6 of 7 patients. Angiographic control was obtained in all patients, including 6 adequate aneurysm occlusions (3 complete occlusions and 3 neck remnants) at short-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In our small series, treatment of wide-neck anterior communicating artery aneurysms with the WEB device was feasible and safe. However, patient selection based on the aneurysm and initial angiographic findings in the parent artery is important due to the limitations of the WEB device navigation.","Gherasim, D N; Gory, B; Sivan-Hoffmann, R; Pierot, L; Raoult, H; Gauvrit, J-Y; Desal, H; Barreau, X; Herbreteau, D; Riva, R; Ambesi Impiombato, F; Armoiry, X; Turjman, F",AJNR.

Many techniques to treat this problem have been described, with little supporting evidence. The authors review their experience with laparoscopic removal of eroded gastric bands. METHODS The prospectively collected bariatric surgery database of the authors' practice was queried for the period January 2000 until February 2011, and the medical records for all patients with the diagnosis of band erosion were reviewed. Symptoms, time to erosion, interval between diagnosis and treatment, and complications of treatment were reviewed. All patients had undergone laparoscopy, cut-down onto the band, unclasping or division of the band near the buckle, removal of the band, and primary closure of the gastrotomy with omental patch reinforcement. RESULTS During the study period, 2,097 LAGB operations were performed and 53 (2.53%) of these resulted in intragastric erosion. All the bands placed were LapBands (Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA). Erosions occurred with 14 of the 10-cm bands, 11 of the Vanguard bands, 14 of the AP Small bands, and 14 of the AP Large bands. Three patients elected to have their revisional surgery elsewhere and thus were lost to follow-up evaluation. One patient declined to have her band removed. The remaining 49 patients were included in the analysis. The mean time from band placement to the diagnosis of erosion was 31.5 months, and the mean time from diagnosis to band removal was 32 days. The mean hospital stay was 4 days. The complications included one postoperative leak, four superficial wound infections, and one pleural effusion. There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS This review demonstrates the safety of laparoscopic removal of eroded gastric bands with primary closure and omental patch repair. The time from diagnosis of erosion to treatment can be short, in contrast to endoscopic removal, in which the requirement for further erosion of the band to free the buckle often necessitates delayed treatment.","Kohn, Geoffrey Paul; Hansen, Cheryl Anne; Gilhome, Richard William; McHenry, Ray Charles; Spilias, Dean Constantine; Hensman, Chris",Surgical endoscopy,260,1

We survey here the current state-of-the-art of this research field. Several vectors have been designed on the basis of DNA- and RNA-based plant virus genomes and viral vectors are used both as single- and multicomponent expression systems in different combinations depending on the protein of interest. The obvious advantages of these systems are ease of manipulation, speed, low cost and high yield of proteins. In addition, Agrobacterium-mediated expression also allows the production in plants of complex proteins assembled from subunits. Currently, the transient expression methods are preferential over any other transgenic system for the exploitation of large and unrestricted numbers of plants in a contained environment. By designing optimal constructs and related means of delivery into plant cells, the overall technology plan considers scenarios that envisage high yield of bioproducts and ease in monitoring the whole spectrum of upstream production, before entering good manufacturing practice facilities. In this way, plant-derived bioproducts show promise of high competitiveness towards classical eukaryotic cell factory systems.","Komarova, Tatiana V; Baschieri, Selene; Donini, Marcello; Marusic, Carla; Benvenuto, Eugenio; Dorokhov, Yuri L",Expert review of vaccines,260,1

Despite this burden there are few specific treatments available for respiratory virus infections. Since many viruses utilize host cell enzymatic machinery such as protein kinases for replication, we determined whether pharmacological inhibition of kinases could, in principle, be used as a broad antiviral strategy for common human respiratory virus infections. A panel of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing recombinant respiratory viruses, including an isolate of H1N1 influenza virus (H1N1/Weiss/43), was used to represent a broad range of virus families responsible for common respiratory infections (Adenoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Orthomyxoviridae). Kinase inhibitors were screened in a high-throughput assay that detected virus infection in human airway epithelial cells (1HAEo-) using a fluorescent plate reader. Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling was able to significantly inhibit replication by all viruses tested. Therefore, the pathways involved in virus-mediated p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK activation were investigated using bronchial epithelial cells and primary fibroblasts derived from MyD88 knockout mouse lungs. Influenza virus, which activated p38 MAPK to approximately 10-fold-greater levels than did respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 1HAEo- cells, was internalized about 8-fold faster and more completely than RSV. We show for the first time that p38 MAPK is a determinant of virus infection that is dependent upon MyD88 expression and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligation. Imaging of virus-TLR4 interactions showed significant clustering of TLR4 at the site of virus-cell interaction, triggering phosphorylation of downstream targets of p38 MAPK, suggesting the need for a signaling receptor to activate virus internalization.","Marchant, David; Singhera, Gurpreet K; Utokaparch, Soraya; Hackett, Tillie L; Boyd, John H; Luo, Zongshu; Si, Xiaoning; Dorscheid, Delbert R; McManus, Bruce M; Hegele, Richard G",Journal of virology,260,20

Their spread into new territories has been the cause of major epidemics throughout human history, including the Spanish flu in 1918 and the latest COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to their outer membrane, consisting essentially of host lipids, enveloped viruses are more resistant to enzymes, and are also less susceptible to host immune defenses than their naked counterparts. Therefore, the development of effective approaches to combat enveloped virus infections represents a major challenge for antiviral therapy in the current century. This review focuses on the characteristics of enveloped viruses, their importance in the entry phase, drugs targeting envelope membrane-mediated entry, and those specifically designed to target the envelope. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of these compounds can be attributed to their ability to affect the envelope, an essential structural feature common to several viruses. This makes this class of compounds agents of great interest when no specific drugs or vaccines are available to block viral infections.","Palombi, Nastasja; Brai, Annalaura; Gerace, Martina; Di Maria, Salvatore; Orofino, Francesco; Corelli, Federico",Current medicinal chemistry,260,27

However, the diversity and structure of the microbiota, and the assembly mechanisms of root-associated microbial communities of plants are still poorly understood. RESULTS We invstigated the microbiota of the root endosphere and rhizosphere soils of the rice cultivar Nipponbare (NPB) and its Piz-t-transgenic line (NPB-Piz-t) when infected with the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) isolate KJ201, using 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplicon sequencing. The rhizosphere soils showed higher bacterial and fungal richness and diversity than the endosphere except for fungal richness in the rhizosphere soils of the mock treatment. Bacteria richness and diversity increased in the endospheric communities of NPB and Piz-t under inoculation with KJ201 (referred to as 'NPB-KJ201' and 'Piz-t-KJ201', respectively) compared with the corresponding mock treatments, with the NPB-KJ201 showing the highest diversity in the four bacterial endocompartments. In contrast, fungal richness and diversity decreased in the endospheric communities of NPB-KJ201 and Piz-t-KJ201, relative to the corresponding mock treatments, with NPB-KJ201 and Piz-t-KJ201 having the lowest richness and diversity, respectively, across the four fungal endocompartments. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the microbiota of Piz-t-KJ201 of root endophytes were mostly remarkablely distinct from that of NPB-KJ201. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the phyla Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were the key contributors to the bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Furthermore, a comparative metabolic analysis showed that the contents of tryptophan metabolism and indole alkaloid biosynthesis were significantly lower in the Piz-t-KJ201 plants. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we compared the diversity, composition, and assembly of microbial communities associated with the rhizosphere soils and endosphere of Piz-t-KJ201 and NPB-KJ201. On the basis of the different compositions, diversities, and assemblies of the microbial communities among different compartments, we propose that the host genotype and inoculation pattern of M. oryzae played dominant roles in determining the microbial community assemblage. Further metabolomics analysis revealed that some metabolites may influence changes in bacterial communities. This study improves our understanding of the complex interactions between rice and M. oryzae, which could be useful in developing new strategies to improve rice resistance through the manipulation of soil microorganisms.","Tian, Dagang; Chen, Zaijie; Lin, Yan; Liang, Tingmin; Chen, Ziqiang; Guo, Xinrui; Wang, Feng; Wang, Zonghua",Rice,260,29

Whereas physiological VP is a feature of regular host defense and tissue repair, compromised barrier function may lead to aberrant vascular leakage, concurrent tissue edema, and inflammation eventually causing life-threatening conditions such as acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, cancer, kidney injury, etc. Measurement of VP helps to identify, design, and optimize anti-leak therapies. Further, it can define the effect of a stimulus or a gene modulation in endothelial-barrier regulation. The degree of VP can be of importance to determine the stage of cancer and disease prognosis. This chapter discusses Miles assay, which is a well-established, relatively simple, and a reliable in vivo technique to assess VP as a surrogate measurement. Although a reliable technique, Miles assay is time-consuming, and the technique does not consider the compounding factors that may increase VP independently of endothelial-barrier regulation, such as blood pressure or blood flow. As an alternative, we describe fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran lung permeability assay, a method that can also be adapted to measure VP and edema in other organs such as the brain and kidney.","Adil, Mir S; Somanath, Payaningal R",Methods in molecular biology,260,16

This CTB-SAP model allows us to study the impact of motor neuron death on the output of surviving phrenic motor neurons. After 7(d) days of CTB-SAP, phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF, a form of respiratory plasticity) is enhanced, but returns towards control levels at 28d. However, the mechanism responsible for this difference in magnitude of pLTF is unknown. In naïve rats, pLTF predominately requires 5-HT2 receptors, the new synthesis of BDNF, and MEK/ERK signaling; however, pLTF can alternatively be induced via A2A receptors, the new synthesis of TrkB, and PI3K/Akt signaling. Since A2A receptor-dependent pLTF is enhanced in naïve rats, we suggest that 7d CTB-SAP treated rats utilize the alternative mechanism for pLTF. Here, we tested the hypothesis that pLTF following CTB-SAP is: 1) TrkB and PI3K/Akt, not BDNF and MEK/ERK, dependent at 7d; and 2) BDNF and MEK/ERK, not TrkB and PI3K/Akt, dependent at 28d. Adult Sprague Dawley male rats were anesthetized, paralyzed, ventilated, and were exposed to acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH; 3, 5 min bouts of 10.5% O2) following bilateral, intrapleural injections at 7d and 28d of: 1) CTB-SAP (25 μg), or 2) un-conjugated CTB and SAP (control). Intrathecal C4 delivery included either: 1) small interfering RNA that targeted BDNF or TrkB mRNA; 2) UO126 (MEK/ERK inhibitor); or 3) PI828 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor). Our data suggest that pLTF in 7d CTB-SAP treated rats is elicited primarily through TrkB and PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanisms, whereas BDNF and MEK/ERK-dependent mechanisms induce pLTF in 28d CTB-SAP treated rats. This project increases our understanding of respiratory plasticity and its implications for breathing following motor neuron death.","Borkowski, Lauren F; Nichols, Nicole L",Experimental neurology,260,5

Ten mares undergoing standing bilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy were used in a randomized clinical study. During surgery, blood vessels within the mesovarium were either: (1) sealed and transected with a vessel sealing and dividing device (VSDD), or (2) ligated using two loops placed proximal to each ovary and then the mesovarium transected using laparoscopic scissors. The ovaries were removed through the ipsilateral body wall. Abdominocentesis was performed before surgery and 24 h and 72 h after surgery.

We report the preclinical development of two BNT162b vaccine candidates, which contain lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-derived immunogens. BNT162b1 encodes a soluble, secreted, trimerised receptor-binding domain (RBD-foldon). BNT162b2 encodes the full-length transmembrane spike glycoprotein, locked in its prefusion conformation (P2 S). The flexibly tethered RBDs of the RBD-foldon bind ACE2 with high avidity. Approximately 20% of the P 2S trimers are in the two-RBD 'down,' one-RBD 'up' state. In mice, one intramuscular dose of either candidate elicits a dose-dependent antibody response with high virus-entry inhibition titres and strong TH1 CD4+ and IFNγ+ CD8+ T-cell responses.

They are associated with major epidemics with an estimated 51-101 million cases each year, of which around 67 000 are fatal. In 2007, 13 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region reported VHF cases. Aims The main purpose of the study was to review the epidemiological situation in the Region vis-à-vis VHFs to obtain baseline epidemiological information for the establishment of the Emerging Dangerous Pathogen Laboratory Network (EDPLN). Methods A literature search was performed using PubMed, ProMED-Mail and GIDEON databases. Reported data included disease burden (reported cases and deaths), human prevalence (general population, high-risk groups), vectors and reservoirs. A scoring method was employed to divide countries into 4 groups (very highly, highly, medium and low affected countries). Results Very highly affected countries were Afghanistan, Egypt, Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. Highly affected countries were Djibouti, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Tunisia and Yemen. Medium affected countries were Iraq, Somalia and United Arab Emirates. Low affected countries were Bahrain, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Palestine, Qatar and Syrian Arab Republic. Conclusions This study contributes in prioritizing countries to be part of EDPLN and in addressing specific needs related to outbreak investigations, surveillance and research.","Altmann, Mathias; Nahapetyan, Karen; Asghar, Humayun",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,260,1

The objective of this study was to identify the kidney histopathologic characteristics of deceased patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 and evaluate the association between biopsy findings and clinical variables, including AKI severity. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS Our multicenter, observational study of deceased patients with COVID-19 in three third-level centers in Mexico City evaluated postmortem kidney biopsy by light and electron microscopy analysis in all cases. Descriptive and association statistics were performed between the clinical and histologic variables. RESULTS A total of 85 patients were included. Median age was 57 (49-66) years, 69% were men, body mass index was 29 (26-35) kg/m2, 51% had history of diabetes, 46% had history of hypertension, 98% received anticoagulation, 66% were on steroids, and 35% received at least one potential nephrotoxic medication. Severe AKI was present in 54% of patients. Biopsy findings included FSGS in 29%, diabetic nephropathy in 27%, and arteriosclerosis in 81%. Acute tubular injury grades 2-3 were observed in 49%. Histopathologic characteristics were not associated with severe AKI; however, pigment casts on the biopsy were associated with significantly lower probability of kidney function recovery (odds ratio, 0.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 0.77). The use of aminoglycosides/colistin, levels of C-reactive protein and serum albumin, previous use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, antivirals, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticoagulants were associated with specific histopathologic findings. CONCLUSIONS A high prevalence of chronic comorbidities was found on kidney biopsies. Nonrecovery from severe AKI was associated with the presence of pigmented casts. Inflammatory markers and medications were associated with specific histopathologic findings in patients dying from COVID-19.","Rivero, Jesús; Merino-López, Maribel; Olmedo, Rossana; Garrido-Roldan, Rubén; Moguel, Bernardo; Rojas, Gustavo; Chavez-Morales, Alfonso; Alvarez-Maldonado, Pablo; Duarte-Molina, Pablo; Castaño-Guerra, Rodolfo; Ruiz-Lopez, Ivon Karina; Soria-Castro, Elizabeth; Luna, Cesar; Bonilla-Méndez, Alejandro; Baranda, Francisco; Zabal, Carlos; Madero-Rovalo, Magdalena; Valdez-Ortiz, Rafael; Soto-Abraham, Ma Virgilia; Vazquez-Rangel, Armando",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,260,1

METHODS First, the ability of the assay to detect viral RNA in MLN FNA preparations compared with MLN biopsy preparations was assessed in matched samples from eight cats. Second, a panel of MLN FNA samples was collected from a series of cats representing non-effusive FIP cases (n = 20), FCoV-seropositive individuals (n = 8) and FCoV seronegative individuals (n = 18). Disease status of the animals was determined using a combination of gross pathology, histopathology and/or 'FIP profile', consisting of serology, clinical pathology and clinical signs. RESULTS Viral RNA was detected in 18/20 non-effusive FIP cases; it was not detected in two cases that presented with neurological FIP. Samples from 18 seronegative non-FIP control cats and 7/8 samples from seropositive non-FIP control cats contained no detectable viral RNA. Thus, as a method for diagnosing non-effusive FIP, MLN FNA RT-qPCR had an overall sensitivity of 90.0% and specificity of 96.1%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In cases with a high index of suspicion of disease, RT-qPCR targeting FCoV in MLN FNA can provide important information to support the ante-mortem diagnosis of non-effusive FIP. Importantly, viral RNA can be reliably detected in MLN FNA samples in saline submitted via the national mail service. When applied in combination with biochemistry, haematology and serological tests in cases with a high index of suspicion of disease the results of this assay may be used to support a diagnosis of non-effusive FIP.","Dunbar, Dawn; Kwok, Wendy; Graham, Elizabeth; Armitage, Andy; Irvine, Richard; Johnston, Pamela; McDonald, Michael; Montgomery, Dorothy; Nicolson, Lesley; Robertson, Elise; Weir, William; Addie, Diane D",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,260,33

Infection with SFTSV is associated with case-fatality rates of up to 30%, and neither antivirals nor vaccines are available at present. Development of antiviral strategies requires the elucidation of virus-host cell interactions. Here, we analyzed host cell entry of SFTSV. Employing lentiviral and rhabdoviral vectors, we found that the Gn/Gc glycoproteins (Gn/Gc) of SFTSV mediate entry into a broad range of human and animal cell lines, as well as human macrophages and dendritic cells. The Gn/Gc proteins of La Crosse virus (LACV) and Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV), other members of the bunyavirus family, facilitated entry into an overlapping but not identical range of cell lines, suggesting that SFTSV, LACV, and RVFV might differ in their receptor requirements. Entry driven by SFTSV Gn/Gc was dependent on low pH but did not require the activity of the pH-dependent endosomal/lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L. Instead, the activity of a cellular serine protease was required for infection driven by SFTSV and LACV Gn/Gc. Sera from convalescent SFTS patients inhibited SFTSV Gn/Gc-driven host cell entry in a dose-dependent fashion, demonstrating that the vector system employed is suitable to detect neutralizing antibodies. Finally, the C-type lectin DC-SIGN was found to serve as a receptor for SFTSV Gn/Gc-driven entry into cell lines and dendritic cells. Our results provide initial insights into cell tropism, receptor usage, and proteolytic activation of SFTSV and will aid in the understanding of viral spread and pathogenesis.","Hofmann, Heike; Li, Xingxing; Zhang, Xiaoai; Liu, Wei; Kühl, Annika; Kaup, Franziska; Soldan, Samantha S; González-Scarano, Francisco; Weber, Friedemann; He, Yuxian; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Journal of virology,260,20

We sought to determine the test positivity rate of close contacts of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in schools during the first half-term of the 2020/2021 academic year. METHODS National-level data from the schools' testing pathway were interrogated to determine the positivity rate of close contacts of cases of COVID-19 in Irish primary, postprimary and special schools during the first half-term of 2020/2021 academic year. The positivity rates among adult and child close contacts were compared and the proportion of national cases of COVID-19 who were aged 4-18 years during the observation period was calculated to assess whether this proportion increased after schools reopened. RESULTS Of all, 15,533 adult and child close contacts were tested for COVID-19 through the schools' testing pathway during the first half-term of the 2020/2021 academic year. Three hundred and ninety-nine close contacts tested positive, indicating a positivity rate of 2.6% (95% confidence interval: 2.3-2.8%). The positivity rates of child and adult close contacts were similarly low (2.6% vs 2.7%, P = 0.7). The proportion of all national cases of COVID-19 who were aged 4-18 years did not increase during the first half-term of the 2020/2021 school year. CONCLUSIONS The low positivity rate of close contacts of cases of COVID-19 in schools indicate that transmission of COVID-19 in Irish schools during the first half-term of the 2020/2021 academic year was low. These findings support policies to keep schools open during the pandemic.","White, P; Ceannt, R; Kennedy, E; O'Sullivan, M B; Ward, M; Collins, A",Public health,260,1

However, the results remain inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed to provide insights into the association between APOC3 polymorphisms and NAFLD risk. Methods Studies with terms ""NALFD"" and ""APOC3"" were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI and Wanfang databases up to August 1, 2019. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association of APOC3 polymorphisms and NAFLD risk were calculated using fixed and random-effects models. Results A total of twelve studies from eleven articles were included. Of them, eight studies (1750 cases and 2181 controls) reported the strong association of variant rs2854116 with NAFLD and six studies (1523 cases and 1568 controls) found the association of rs2854117 polymorphism with NAFLD. Overall, a statistically significant association between rs2854116 polymorphism of APOC3 gene and NAFLD risk was found only under dominant model. However, association of rs2854117 polymorphism with NAFLD risk was not detected under all four genetic models. In sub-group analysis of NAFLD subjects based on country, no association among them in China was detected. Besides, four studies analyze the association between the two polymorphisms and clinical characteristics in all subjects or NAFLD patients, and we also failed detect any association between the wild carriers and variant carriers. Conclusion The meta-analyses suggests that the rs2854116 polymorphism but not rs2854117 polymorphism in APOC3 gene might be a risk factor for NAFLD among Asians. That is, individuals with CT+CC genotype have higher risk of developing NAFLD. However, studies with sufficient sample size are needed for the further validation.","Wang, Jun; Ye, Chuncui; Fei, Sujuan",African health sciences,260,17

METHODS This phase 1 study (NCT02833857) evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) of single-dose etelcalcetide (0.035 mg/kg intravenously) in pediatric hemodialysis patients (two cohorts; 1: 12-< 18 years; 2: 2-< 12 years). Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), PK/PD were assessed post-dose on D1 at 10 min and 4 h, on multiple days until D10, and at end of study (D30). RESULTS Etelcalcetide administered to 11 patients (mean [SD] age 10.3 [4.3] years; cohort 1, n = 6; cohort 2, n = 5) was well tolerated. AEs were consistent with established safety profiles in adults. Two patients (1 per cohort) reported treatment-related AEs (cohort 1: hypocalcemia; cohort 2: headache, paresthesia, vomiting). No serious AEs or deaths were reported. Mean serum corrected calcium (cCa) for all patients was maintained > 2.25 mmol/L. After etelcalcetide dosing, PK exposures declined, with mean Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf exposures higher in cohort 1. Median percent change in serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) from baseline (cohort 1: 51.2 pmol/L; cohort 2: 84.0 pmol/L) reached the nadir on D1 at 4 h (cohort 1: - 33.4%; cohort 2: - 64.2%).

Cs-131 accumulates in the cells through the Na+/K+-ATPase. By this uptake mechanism and the alkali chemistry of Cs+, we argue for its intracellular homogeneous distribution. Cs-131 was added to the cell culture medium of HeLa and V79 Cells. The bio-kinetics of Cs-131 (uptake, release, intracellular distribution) was examined by measuring its intracellular activity concentration over time. Taking advantage of the 100% confluent cellular monolayer, we developed a new and robust dosimetry that is entrusted to a quantity called SC-value.Results: The SC-values evaluated in the cell nucleus are almost independent of the nuclear size and geometry. We obtained dose-rate controlled RBE-values for intracellular Cs-131 decay. Using the γH2AX assay, the RBE was 1 for HeLa cells. Using the clonogenic cell survival, it was 3.9 for HeLa cells and 3.2 for V79 cells.Conclusion: This experimental setup and dosimetry provides reliable RBE-values for Auger emitters in various cell lines.","Fredericia, Pil M; Siragusa, Mattia; Köster, Ulli; Severin, Gregory; Groesser, Torsten; Jensen, Mikael",International journal of radiation biology,260,1

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the reinforced cruroplasty during LSG compared with a concurrent group of simple cruroplasty. METHODS The study groups included 96 morbidly obese patients who underwent simultaneous LSG and cruroplasty. Group A: 48 patients with hiatal areal defect <4 cm(2) and normal pillars (simple posterior cruroplasty); group B: 48 patients with hiatal areal defect >4 and <8 cm(2) with weakness of the right pillar (on-lay synthetic absorbable mesh-reinforced cruroplasty). Upper GI symptoms were assessed by Roma III standard questionnaire. Endoscopy, imaging, esophageal 24-h pH monitoring and HR manometry were performed in cases of persistent or recurrent symptoms after surgery. RESULTS Mortality rate was nil. The conversion rate to open was 1 %. Intra-operative diagnosis of hiatal hernia occured in 41 patients (42.7 %). Mesh-related complications were none. Perioperative complications occurred in four patients (4.1 %). After 19- to 21-month follow-up, GERD symptom remission occurred in 89 % of patients.

Occupational patterns and work-related injury patterns vary with age. This study aimed to compare the incidence and characteristics of work-related injuries in older and younger workers in Korea. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of the characteristics of workers hospitalised with work-related injuries from January 2010 to December 2014, using data from the National Hospital Discharge In-Depth Injury Survey in South Korea. The analysis was stratified by age into older (aged ≥65 years) and younger (aged 20-64 years) workers. RESULTS The hospitalisation rate in older workers was double that of younger workers (2014 IRR: 2.06, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.76). Compared with workers of conventional working-age, a higher proportion of injured older workers were female (33.1% vs 13.6%, p<0.001), injured due to falls (40.8% vs 28.5%) and injured while working on a farm (46.5% vs 6.3%, p<0.001). In older workers, work-related injuries were seasonal and peaked during summer, but there was little seasonality in injuries among younger workers. CONCLUSION Older workers are more vulnerable to work-related injuries and have a different profile of work-related injuries from younger workers. Age-related differences in the injury profile need to be considered when developing workplace injury prevention policies and programmes, and the specific vulnerabilities of older workers need to be addressed.","Lee, Kyung-Eun; Kim, Jinhee; Lee, Jihye",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,260,1

The mean reported age for 138 elephants was 38.5 years (range 2-71 years). Seroprevalence for TB was 21.56% (33/153). The majority of seropositive elephants were female (n=30) and from Chitwan National Park (n=29. The occurrence of TB seropositive cases in other more remote national parks suggests TB may be widespread among the captive elephant population of Nepal. Hematology and biochemistry analyses were performed on 13 and 22 seropositive elephants, respectively and, nine elephants from a seronegative TB herd for comparison. Hematology parameters (hemoglobin, packed cell volume, platelet, white blood cells, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were comparable between the two groups. Total protein, globulin, and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly higher in seronegative elephants, and bilirubin was significantly higher in seropositive elephants whereas blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase/aspartate aminotransferase (GOT/AST), glutamic pyruvic transaminase/alanine aminotransferase (GPT/ALT), Gamma glutamyl transferase (GT), and albumin were not significantly different. The range of biochemical parameters that were significantly different between seropositive and seronegative elephants had narrow ranges. Thus, the potential of these parameters as a direct biomarker for TB diagnosis is limited based on the findings in this study. We recommend including blood parameters in future TB surveillance studies.","Thapa, Jeewan; Mikota, Susan K; Gairhe, Kamal Prasad; Paudel, Sarad; Singh, Dinesh Kumar; Dhakal, Ishwari Prasad; Nakajima, Chie; Suzuki, Yasuhiko",The Journal of veterinary medical science,260,12

METHODS The Cochrane methodology for a rapid living systematic review was applied. Primary research papers, published from January 1st to June 30th, 2020, reporting patients' data, with no limits of study design were included. Studies were categorized for study design, research question, COVID-19 phase, limitations of functioning (disability) of rehabilitation interest and type of rehabilitation service involved. Methodological quality assessment was based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools, and the level of evidence table (OCEBM 2011) for all the other studies. RESULTS Thirty-six, out of 3703 papers, were included. One paper was of level 2 (RCT), 7 were of level 3 (2 cohort studies, 2 cross-sectional studies and 3 case-control studies), and 28 papers of level 4 (descriptive studies); 61% of papers reported epidemiological data on clinical presentations, 5 investigated natural history/determining factors, 1 searched prevalence, 2 studies reported on intervention efficacy (though not on harms), and 5 studies looked at health service organization. DISCUSSION Main issues emerging from the review: it is advised to test for COVID-19 people with neurological disorders presenting with symptom changes; dysphagia is a frequent complication after oro-tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU; after discharge, COVID-19 survivors may report persistent restrictive ventilatory deficits regardless of disease severity; there is only sparse and low quality evidence concerning the efficacy of any rehabilitation intervention to promote functional recovery; a substantial increase in resource (staff and equipment) is needed for rehabilitation.","Ceravolo, Maria Gabriella; Arienti, Chiara; De Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Negrini, Francesco; Lazzarini, Stefano; Patrini, Michele; Negrini, Stefano",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,260,19

A 55-year-old man presented with a 4 months history of right exophthalmos, chemosis and diplopia. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a dilated superior orbital vein. Cerebral angiography showed an intraorbital AVF fed by the branch of the ophthalmic artery and drainage to the superior orbital vein (SOV) and inferior orbital vein (IOV). Superselective angiography and high-resolution CBCT with diluted contrast medium clarified that feeders of the AVF came from the first segment of the ophthalmic artery, and the shunt located surrounding an optic nerve sheath. Transvenous embolization via IOV with coils occluded the AVF. Detailed analysis of intraorbital vessels using high-resolution CBCT and selective angiography led to successful treatment by transvenous coil embolization.","Sato, Masayuki; Matsumaru, Yuji; Amano, Tatsuo; Kamiya, Yuki",Turkish neurosurgery,260,26

In this paper, we demonstrate that a fluorinated tetra (ethylene glycol) (FTEG)-terminated tetra (ethylene glycol) (EG4), namely, FTEG-EG4, ligand can self-assemble with gold nanoparticles (5 and 10 nm) into GNVs with a hollow structure in THF due to the solvophobic feature of the ligand. Time-dependent studies showed that the GNVs with a closely packed surface derived from the incomplete and irregular GNVs, but not through the fusion of the GNV precursors. After dialysis in water, the assemblies retained vesicular structures in water, even though GNVs aggregated together, which was initiated by the hydrophobic interactions between the FTEG heads of the surface ligands on GNVs. This study provides a new insight into the design of novel small surface ligands to produce water-stable GNVs for biological applications.","Wei, Jinjian; Huang, Xiaoying; Zhang, Liang; Chen, Yuqin; Niikura, Kenichi; Mitomo, Hideyuki; Ijiro, Kuniharu; Zhang, Zhide",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,260,31

Bone disease is a very common complication related to the poor absorption of calcium, the secondary chronic renal disease with low vitamin D, as well as multiple endocrine risk factors. The aim of this systematic review was to estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in thalassemia, as well as its association with osteoporosis/low bone mass. A systematic review was carried out using PubMed/Medline, Cochrane, and EBSCO databases. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with the validated Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale adapted for cross-sectional studies and cohort studies respectfully and the Cochrane Collaboration for clinical trials. After application of predetermined exclusion criteria compatible with the PICOS process, a total of 12 suitable articles were identified. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varied considerably. Only five of the reviewed studies examined the correlation between vitamin D levels and BMD of which just three showed a statistically significant positive association of mild/moderate grade. Vitamin D deficiency is a common comorbidity in patients with thalassemia. However, both its prevalence and its severity vary considerably in different populations, and existing evidence is insufficient to conclude whether vitamin D supplementation is also associated with BMD improvement in this special population group.","Manolopoulos, P P; Lavranos, G; Mamais, I; Angouridis, A; Giannakou, K; Johnson, E O",Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,260,11

Thirty patients seeking primary or outpatient care for subacromial pain syndrome and a parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendations) provided input regarding systematic review design and interpretation. RESULTS There was high certainty evidence of no additional benefit of subacromial decompression surgery over placebo surgery in reducing pain at 1 year following surgery (mean difference [MD] -0.26, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.33, minimally important difference [MID] 1.5) or improving physical function at 1-2 years (MD 2.8, 95% CI -1.4 to 6.9, MID 8.3). There was moderate certainty evidence for no additional benefit of subacromial decompression surgery on health-related quality of life at 1 year (MD -0.03 points, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.06, MID 0.07). There was moderate certainty evidence for six serious harms per 1000 (95% CI 5 to 7) patients undergoing subacromial decompression. CONCLUSION Subacromial decompression surgery provided no important benefit compared with placebo surgery or exercise therapy, and probably carries a small risk of serious harms.

Ketogenic diets are one strategy that has been proposed to enhance traditional anticancer therapy. This review summarises the evidence concerning the effect of oral ketogenic diets on anthropometry, metabolism, quality of life (QoL) and tumour effects, at the same time as documenting adverse events and adherence in patients with cancer. METHODS We searched electronic databases using medical subject headings (MeSH) and text words related to ketogenic diets and cancer. Adult patients following a ketogenic diet as a complementary therapy prior, alongside or after standard anticancer treatment for more than 7 days were included. Studies were assessed for quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tools (https://www.casp-uk.net). RESULTS Eleven studies were included with 102 participants (age range 34-87 years) from early-phase trials, cohort studies and case reports. Studies included participants with brain, rectal or mixed cancer sites at an early or advanced disease stage. The duration of intervention ranged from 2.4 to 134.7 weeks (0.5-31 months). Evidence was inconclusive for nutritional status and adverse events. Mixed results were observed for blood parameters, tumour effects and QoL. Adherence to diet was low (50 out of 102; 49%) and ranged from 23.5% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS High-quality evidence on the effect of ketogenic diets on anthropometry, metabolism, QoL and tumour effects is currently lacking in oncology patients. Heterogeneity between studies and low adherence to diet affects the current evidence. There is an obvious gap in the evidence, highlighting the need for controlled trials to fully evaluate the intervention.","Sremanakova, J; Sowerbutts, A M; Burden, S",Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,260,1

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. The clinical data of 65 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to Chongqing Public Health Medical Center and Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital from January 2020 to March 2020 during the period of supporting to combat COVID-19 by the medical team of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Chongqing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine were analyzed. According to different treatment regimens, patients were divided into conventional treatment group (conventional antivirus, anti-infection and symptomatic support treatments), Xuebijing group (Xuebijing was applied to patients with elevated inflammatory cytokines) and combination group (Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin, human immunoglobulin was applied to patients with low immunity indicated by monitoring results of lymphocytes and their subsets). The improvement of blood routine examination, blood gas analysis, myocardial enzyme spectrum, liver and kidney function, lymphocytes and their subsets and cytokines as well as severity score in three groups before and after treatment were observed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to draw the 28-day survival curve of each group, and the cumulative survival rate among the groups was compared. RESULTS Among the 65 severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients, only 20 patients received conventional treatment, 22 patients were treated with Xuebijing based on conventional treatment, and 23 patients were treated with Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin based on conventional treatment. Before treatment, CD4+ T cell count in combination group was higher than other two groups, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was lower than other two groups, while other indicators showed no statistically significant differences among the three groups, suggesting that the baseline of the three groups was relatively balanced before treatment. The patients in the conventional treatment group were relieved after treatment, and it was characterized by that the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly lower than those before treatment [APACHE II score: 5.20±2.74 vs. 6.20±1.93, LDH (μmol×s-1×L-1): 4.1±1.0 vs. 4.7±0.9, both P < 0.01], but there was still liver damage, which was manifested as higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than that before treatment [U/L: 30.5 (23.8, 41.5) vs. 21.0 (17.0, 34.0), P < 0.05]. In Xuebijing group, the respiratory function and immunity of patients were improved after treatment, and the improvement degree of the ratio of CD4+ T cell was more significant than that in the conventional treatment group (4.86±6.31 vs. -0.95±12.38, P < 0.05). However, the patients still lived with an ""inflammatory storm"" and liver damage after treatment. It was shown that IL-4 was significantly higher than that before treatment (ng/L: 2.57±1.15 vs. 1.92±1.04, P < 0.05), while albumin (ALB) decreased significantly compared with before treatment [g/L: 33.0 (30.5, 35.6) vs. 36.2 (32.1, 41.4), P < 0.01]. While the treatment of Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin could improve patients' respiratory function and enhance their immunity more effectively, it was shown that arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), T lymphocyte count, ratio of CD4+ T cell, CD4+ T cell count, CD8+ T cell count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio were significantly higher than those before treatment, while ALB, IL-6, APACHE II score and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were significantly lower than those before treatment. T lymphocyte count, the ratio of CD4+ T cell and IL-6 in combination group were improved more significantly than those in conventional treatment group and Xuebijing group [T lymphocyte count (×109/L): 310.68±359.28 vs. 46.54±240.01, 81.59±256.76; ratio of CD4+ T cell: 14.53±14.49 vs. -0.95±12.38, 4.86±6.31; IL-6 (ng/L): -25.53±39.05 vs. -1.75±5.45, 12.78±44.81], PaO2/FiO2 was improved more significantly as compared with the Xuebijing group [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 146.31±109.73 vs. 59.41±87.70], and the differences were statistically different (all P < 0.05).

Human Challenge Studies can help to shorten the development process of vaccines. The reviewers' opinions from research ethics committees (REC) play an essential gate-keeping role in determining whether a clinical trial can be conducted or not. METHODS A convergent mixed-methods study was conducted in a leading general hospital in China. A total of 58 REC members from the institution were invited to participate in an online questionnaire survey. According to the result of the quantitative survey, 15 of these REC members were purposefully selected to participate in qualitative interviews further. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques, and thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. Findings from the quantitative and qualitative analyses were synthesized to deeply illustrate the attitudes, views, and suggestions of REC members on human challenge studies to develop COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS The response rate of the online questionnaire was 62% (36/58), and 15 of the respondents were interviewed. All participants deemed that the human challenge study should provide compensation to its participants and that sufficiently informed consent is necessary. The human challenge study was disagreed with by 38.9% of participants. The key points of concern raised were representativeness and fairness of participant selection, benefit, and risk, vulnerable groups, compensation to participants, informed consent, and general view on human challenge studies. CONCLUSIONS Human challenge studies helped accelerate the development of vaccines for disease control to a certain extent, but the bottom line of medical ethics should not have been broken. At any time, the rights and interests of research participants should come first.","Pan, Zihan; Chu, Hongling; Zhang, Yu; Hong, Xue; Liang, Lijun; Zhao, Wenzhi; Chen, Yahong; Song, Chunli",Annals of palliative medicine,260,1

One hundred eighty-eight deaths were recorded (11.8%; mean age, 79.6±0.9 years). In nonsurvivors, older age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery diseases, and heart failure were more represented than in survivors. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (4.3±0.15 versus 2.6±0.05; P<0.001). ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, diuretics, and β-blockers were more frequently used in nonsurvivors than in survivors. After correction by multivariate analysis, only age (P=0.0001), diabetes mellitus (P=0.004), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.011), and chronic kidney disease (P=0.004) but not hypertension predicted mortality. Charlson Comorbidity Index, which cumulates age and comorbidities, predicts mortality with an exponential increase in the odds ratio by each point of score. In the COVID-19 outbreak, mortality is predicted by age and the presence of comorbidities. Our data do not support a significant interference of hypertension and antihypertensive therapy on COVID-19 lethality.

We hypothesized that these patients represent a vulnerable cohort with high rates of hospitalization and frequent use of healthcare services. This study aims to ascertain the need for and causes of treatment episodes after pleural infections during long-term follow-up. METHODS Patients treated for pleural infections at Tampere University Hospital between January 2000 and December 2008 (n = 191, 81% males, median age 58 years) were included and compared to a demographically matched population-based random sample of 1910 controls. Seventy percent of the pleural infections were caused by pneumonias and 80% of the patients underwent surgery. Information regarding later in-hospital periods and emergency room and out-patient clinic visits, as well as survival data, was obtained from national registries and compared between patients and controls. RESULTS Patients treated for pleural infections had significantly higher rates of hospitalizations (8.19 vs 2.19), in-hospital days (88.5 vs 26.6), emergency room admissions (3.18 vs 1.45), out-patient clinic visits (41.1 vs 11.8) and procedures performed (1.26 vs 0.55) per 100 patient-months when compared to controls during 5-year follow-up, in addition to having increased mortality (30% vs 11%), P-value <0.00001 each. Particularly, episodes due to respiratory and digestive diseases, malignancies and mental disorders were more frequent. The patients' comorbidities, such as alcoholism or chronic pulmonary disease, were associated with more frequent use of healthcare services. CONCLUSIONS Patients treated for pleural infections have high rates of hospitalizations, emergency room admissions and out-patient clinic visits during follow-up.","Lehtomäki, Antti I; Nevalainen, Riikka M; Toikkanen, Vesa J; Pohja, Emilia S; Nieminen, Jaakko J; Laurikka, Jari O; Khan, Jahangir A",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,260,17

METHODS The authors queried three biomedical databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) and two preprint servers (MedRxiv and SSRN) to identify literature pertaining to preprints. Additionally, they evaluated 12 preprint servers featuring COVID-19 research through sample submission of six manuscripts. RESULTS The realm of health sciences research has seen a dramatic increase in the presence and importance of preprint publications. By posting manuscripts on preprint servers, researchers are able to immediately communicate their findings, thereby facilitating prompt feedback and promoting collaboration. In doing so, they may also reduce publication bias and improve methodological transparency. However, by circumventing the peer-review process, academia incurs the risk of disseminating erroneous or misinterpreted data and suffering the downstream consequences. Never have these issues been better highlighted than during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers have flooded the literature with preprint publications as stopgaps to meet the desperate need for knowledge about the disease. These unreviewed articles initially outnumbered those published in conventional journals and helped steer the mainstream scientific community at the start of the pandemic. In surveying select preprint servers, the authors discovered varying usability, review practices, and acceptance polices. CONCLUSION While vital in the rapid dispensation of science, preprint manuscripts promulgate their conclusions without peer review and possess the capacity to misinform. Undoubtedly part of the future of science, conscientious consumers will need to appreciate not only their utility, but also their limitations.","Nabavi Nouri, Shayan; Cohen, Yosef A; Madhavan, Mahesh V; Slomka, Piotr J; Iskandrian, Ami E; Einstein, Andrew J",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,260,24

Contributors to severe MARV disease include immune response suppression and inflammatory gene dysregulation (""cytokine storm""), leading to systemic damage and often death. Conversely, MARV causes little to no clinical disease in its reservoir host, the Egyptian rousette bat (ERB). Previous genomic and in vitro data suggest that a tolerant ERB immune response may underlie MARV avirulence, but no significant examination of this response in vivo yet exists. Here, using colony-bred ERBs inoculated with a bat isolate of MARV, we use species-specific antibodies and an immune gene probe array (NanoString) to temporally characterize the transcriptional host response at sites of MARV replication relevant to primate pathogenesis and immunity, including CD14+ monocytes/macrophages, critical immune response mediators, primary MARV targets, and skin at the inoculation site, where highest viral loads and initial engagement of antiviral defenses are expected. Our analysis shows that ERBs upregulate canonical antiviral genes typical of mammalian systems, such as ISG15, IFIT1, and OAS3, yet demonstrate a remarkable lack of significant induction of proinflammatory genes classically implicated in primate filoviral pathogenesis, including CCL8, FAS, and IL6. Together, these findings offer the first in vivo functional evidence for disease tolerance as an immunological mechanism by which the bat reservoir asymptomatically hosts MARV. More broadly, these data highlight factors determining disparate outcomes between reservoir and spillover hosts and defensive strategies likely utilized by bat hosts of other emerging pathogens, knowledge that may guide development of effective antiviral therapies.","Guito, Jonathan C; Prescott, Joseph B; Arnold, Catherine E; Amman, Brian R; Schuh, Amy J; Spengler, Jessica R; Sealy, Tara K; Harmon, Jessica R; Coleman-McCray, JoAnn D; Kulcsar, Kirsten A; Nagle, Elyse R; Kumar, Raina; Palacios, Gustavo F; Sanchez-Lockhart, Mariano; Towner, Jonathan S",Current biology : CB,260,1

This study aimed at assessing the role of ICU-acquired weakness on extubation failure and the relation between limb weakness and cough strength. METHODS A secondary analysis of two previous prospective studies including patients at high risk of reintubation after a planned extubation, i.e., age greater than 65 years, with underlying cardiac or respiratory disease, or intubated for more than 7 days prior to extubation. Patients intubated less than 24 h and those with a do-not-reintubate order were not included. Limb and cough strength were assessed by a physiotherapist just before extubation. ICU-acquired weakness was clinically diagnosed as limb weakness defined as Medical Research Council (MRC) score < 48 points and severe weakness as MRC sum-score < 36. Cough strength was assessed using a semi-quantitative 5-Likert scale. Extubation failure was defined as reintubation or death within the first 7 days following extubation. RESULTS Among 344 patients at high risk of reintubation, 16% experienced extubation failure (56/344). They had greater severity and lower MRC sum-score (41 ± 16 vs. 49 ± 13, p < 0.001) and were more likely to have ineffective cough than the others. The prevalence of ICU-acquired weakness at the time of extubation was 38% (130/244). The extubation failure rate was 12% (25/214) in patients with no limb weakness vs. 18% (12/65) and 29% (19/65) in those with moderate and severe limb weakness, respectively (p < 0.01). MRC sum-score and cough strength were weakly but significantly correlated (rho = 0.28, p < .001). After multivariate logistic regression analyses, the lower the MRC sum-score the greater the risk of reintubation; severe limb weakness was independently associated with extubation failure, even after adjustment on cough strength and severity at admission. CONCLUSION ICU-acquired weakness was diagnosed in 38% in this population of patients at high risk at the time of extubation and was independently associated with extubation failure in the ICU.","Thille, Arnaud W; Boissier, Florence; Muller, Michel; Levrat, Albrice; Bourdin, Gaël; Rosselli, Sylvène; Frat, Jean-Pierre; Coudroy, Rémi; Vivier, Emmanuel",Critical care,260,1

For acute ischemic stroke, expert surveys have yielded MCIDs that are substantially higher than the MCIDs observed in actual expert behavior in guideline writing and clinical practice, potentially because of anchoring bias. METHODS We administered a structured, internet-based survey to a cross-section of academic stroke neurologists in the United States. Survey responses assessed demographic and clinical experience, and expert judgment of the MCID of the absolute increase needed in the proportion of patients achieving functional independence at 3 months to consider a novel, safe neuroprotective agent as clinically worthwhile. To mitigate anchoring bias, the survey response framework used a base 1000 rather than base 100 patient framework. RESULTS Survey responses were received from 122 of 333 academic stroke neurologists, there were 23% women, 72.8% had ≥6 years of practice experience, and neurovascular disease accounted for more than half of practice time in >70%. Responder-nonresponder and continuum of resistance tests indicated that responders were representative of the full expert population. Among respondents, the median MCID was 1.3% (interquartile range, 0.8% to >2%). CONCLUSIONS Stroke expert responses to MCID surveys are affected by anchoring and centrality bias. When survey design takes these into account, the expert-derived MCID for a safe acute ischemic stroke treatment is 1.1% to 1.5%, in accord with actual physician behavior in guideline writing and clinical practice. This revised MCID value can guide clinical trial design and grant-funding and regulatory agency decisions.","Cranston, Jessica S; Kaplan, Brett D; Saver, Jeffrey L",Stroke,260,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A convenience sample of therapists (physical and occupational) and students were enrolled in pairs in a cohort study with pre- versus post-training comparisons. The intervention was a hybrid of self-study and hands-on practice paired with remote feedback for ten intermediate and advanced manual wheelchair skills. Participants practiced with self-selected frequency and duration, uploading a session log and video(s) to an online platform. A remote trainer provided asynchronous feedback prior to the next practice session. Capacity and confidence in completing the ten skills were evaluated using the Wheelchair Skills Test Questionnaire (WST-Q). Knowledge of wheelchair skills training and motor learning was assessed using a 62-item Knowledge Test. Secondary outcome measures included skill achievement, as confirmed by submitted video recordings, and participant feedback about the training. RESULTS Across 41participants, scores were higher at follow-up compared to baseline for WST-Q capacity (73.9 ± 19.1 vs 16.8 ± 15.6, p < 0.001), WST-Q confidence (80.1 ± 12.2 vs 47.6 ± 18.2, p = 0.003) and knowledge (70.8 ± 7.5 vs 67.0 ± 5.4, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Remote learning can increase wheelchair skills capacity and confidence as well as knowledge about such training and assessment. This model should be further investigated as a delivery method for training rehabilitation professionals. Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT01807728. Implications for rehabilitation Wheelchair skills training is one of the 8 steps of wheelchair provision as outlined by the World Health Organization. Wheelchair skills are not a core part of most clinical curriculums and many clinicians cite a lack of resources and uncertainty on how to implement wheelchair skills training into practice as major barriers to providing such training. Remote learning offers the benefits of structured wheelchair skills training with expert feedback on an individual's own schedule that is not afforded by one-day ""bootcamp""-type courses or on-the-job training, which are how many clinicians currently learn wheelchair skills. In a sample of physical and occupational therapists and students, remote learning was effective at increasing capacity and confidence to perform manual wheelchair skills as well as knowledge of wheelchair training.","Worobey, Lynn A; Kirby, R Lee; Cowan, Rachel E; Dyson-Hudson, Trevor A; Shea, Mary; Heinemann, Allen W; Pedersen, Jessica Presperin; Hibbs, Rachel; Boninger, Michael L",Disability and rehabilitation.

We examined the frequency of acute intracranial abnormalities seen on CT and/or MR imaging in patients with COVID-19 and investigated possible associations between these findings and clinical parameters, including length of hospital stay, requirement for intubation, and development of acute kidney injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective study performed at a large academic hospital in the United States. A total of 641 patients presented to our institution between March 3, 2020, and May 6, 2020, for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019, of whom, 150 underwent CT and/or MR imaging of the brain. CT and/or MR imaging examinations were evaluated for the presence of hemorrhage, infarction, and leukoencephalopathy. The frequency of these findings was correlated with clinical variables, including body mass index, length of hospital stay, requirement for intubation, and development of acute kidney injury as documented in the electronic medical record. RESULTS Of the 150 patients, 26 (17%) had abnormal CT and/or MR imaging findings, with hemorrhage in 11 of the patients (42%), infarction in 13 of the patients (50%), and leukoencephalopathy in 7 of the patients (27%). Significant associations were seen between abnormal CT/MR imaging findings and intensive care unit admission (P = .039), intubation (P = .004), and acute kidney injury (P = .030). CONCLUSIONS A spectrum of acute neuroimaging abnormalities was seen in our cohort of patients with coronavirus disease 2019, including hemorrhage, infarction, and leukoencephalopathy. Significant associations between abnormal neuroimaging studies and markers of disease severity (intensive care unit admission, intubation, and acute kidney injury) suggest that patients with severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 may have higher rates of neuroimaging abnormalities.","Yoon, B C; Buch, K; Lang, M; Applewhite, B P; Li, M D; Mehan, W A; Leslie-Mazwi, T M; Rincon, S P",AJNR.

Here, to further understand the mechanism of EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer and offer novel therapeutic targets for anti-EGFR-inhibitor resistance via the deep mining of pharmacogenomics data, we associated DNA methylation with drug sensitivities for uncovering the methylation sites related to EGFR inhibitor sensitivity genes. Specifically, we first introduced a grouped regularized regression model (Group Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, group lasso) to detect the genes that were closely related to EGFR inhibitor effectiveness. Then, we applied the classical regression model (lasso) to identify the methylation sites associated with the above drug sensitivity genes. The new model was validated on the well-known cancer genomics resource: CTRP. GeneHancer and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) database searches indicated that the predicted methylation sites related to EGFR inhibitor sensitivity genes were related to regulatory elements. Moreover, the correlation analysis on sensitivity genes and predicted methylation sites suggested that the methylation sites located in the promoter region were more correlated with the expression of EGFR inhibitor sensitivity genes than those located in the enhancer region and the TFBS. Meanwhile, we performed differential expression analysis of genes and predicted methylation sites and found that changes in the methylation level of some sites may affect the expression of the corresponding EGFR inhibitor-responsive genes. Therefore, we supposed that the effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer may be improved by methylation modification in their sensitivity genes.","Yuan, Rui; Chen, Shilong; Wang, Yongcui",Biomolecules,260,15

Very few reports exist on the use of biologic mesh for LVR. The aim of our study was to report the complication and recurrence rate of our first 100 cases of LVR for symptomatic internal rectal prolapse and/or rectocele using a porcine dermal collagen mesh. METHODS Prospectively collected data on LVR for internal rectal prolapse were analysed. Surgical complications and functional results in terms of faecal incontinence (measured with the Faecal Incontinence Severity Index = FISI) and constipation (measured with the Wexner Constipation Score = WCS) at 3, 6 and 12 months were analysed. It was considered an improvement if FISI or WCS scores were reduced by at least 25 % and a cure if the FISI score decreased to <10 and the WCS decreased to <5. RESULTS Between April 2009 and April 2013, 100 consecutive female patients (mean age 63 years, range 24-88 years) underwent LVR. All patients had internal rectal prolapse (grade III [n = 25] and grade IV [n = 75] according to the Oxford classification) and rectocele. Mean operative time was 85 ± 40 min. Conversion rate to open technique was 1 %. There was no post-operative mortality. Overall 16 patients (16 %) experienced 18 complications, including rectal perforation (n = 1), small bowel obstruction (n = 2), urinary tract infection (n = 8), subcutaneous emphysema (n = 3), wound haematoma (n = 2), long lasting sacral pain (n = 1) and incisional hernia (1). Median post-operative length of stay was 2 days. Ninety-eight out of 100 patients completed follow-up. At the end of follow-up, the mean FISI score improved from 8.4 (±4.0 standard deviation (SD) p = 0.003) to 3.3 ± 2.3 SD (p = 0.04). Incontinence improved in 37 out of 43 patients (86 %), and 31 patients (72 %) were cured. Similarly, the mean WCS score improved from 18.4 ± 11.6 SD to 5.4 ± 4.1 SD (p = 0.04). Constipation improved in 82 out of 89 patients (92 %), and 70 patients (79 %) were cured. No worsening of continence status, constipation or sexual function was observed. Fourteen patients (14 %) experienced persistence or recurrence of prolapse. CONCLUSIONS LVR using biologic mesh is a safe and effective procedure for improving symptoms of obstructed defaecation and faecal incontinence in patients with internal rectal prolapse associated with rectocele.","Franceschilli, L; Varvaras, D; Capuano, I; Ciangola, C I; Giorgi, F; Boehm, G; Gaspari, A L; Sileri, P",Techniques in coloproctology,260,19

We validate GInPipe against simulated outbreaks and elaborate phylodynamic analyses. Using available sequence data, we reconstruct incidence histories for Denmark, Scotland, Switzerland, and Victoria (Australia) and demonstrate, how to use the method to investigate the effects of changing testing policies on case ascertainment. Specifically, we find that under-reporting was highest during summer 2020 in Europe, coinciding with more liberal testing policies at times of low testing capacities. Due to the increased use of real-time sequencing, it is envisaged that GInPipe can complement established surveillance tools to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

However, data regarding the short-term and long-term results of LPD are sparse, and this procedure is the primary focus of the current study. METHODS Between October 2010 and October 2013, a total of 31 consecutive patients received LPD, including hand-assisted laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy, total laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy, and laparoscopic pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Data regarding short-term surgical outcomes and long-term oncological results were collected prospectively. RESULTS The median operative time was 515.0 min (interquartile range 465.0-585.0 min). The median intraoperative estimated blood loss was 260.0 mL (interquartile range 150.0-430.0 mL). Conversion to open pancreaticoduodenectomy was required in three patients (9.7%) due to intraoperative pneumoperitoneum intolerance (n = 1, 3.2%) and tumor adherence to the superior mesenteric vein (n = 2, 6.5%). No significant differences between the surgical approaches were observed in regard to intraoperative and postoperative data. Postoperative severe complications (Clavien ≥ III) were detected in three (9.7%) patients, including one grade C pancreatic fistula, one grade B postoperative bleeding event, and one afferent loop obstruction. There were no deaths within 30 days following LPD. The final pathological results revealed duodenal adenocarcinoma in 14 (45.2%) patients, ampullary adenocarcinoma in four (12.9%) patients, distal common bile duct cancer in six (19.4%) patients, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in five (16.1%) patients, gastrointestinal stroma tumor in one (3.2%) patient, and chronic pancreatitis in one (3.2%) patient. All patients suffering from tumors underwent R0 resection (n = 30, 100.0%), with the optimal number of collected lymph nodes (median: 13, interquartile range 11-19). At the most recent follow-up, 20 patients were still alive, and the 1-, and 3-year overall survival for patients with duodenal adenocarcinoma were 100.0 and 71.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS According to this study, LPD is feasible and technically safe for highly selected patients and can offer acceptable oncological outcomes and long-term survival.","Wang, Mingjun; Zhang, Hua; Wu, Zhong; Zhang, Zhaoda; Peng, Bing",Surgical endoscopy,260,1

STUDY DESIGN The study associated common SDOH metrics from public data sources (county specific) with health plan enrollment data (including demographics, counties, and zip codes) and medical and pharmaceutical annual claims data. METHODS Following correlation analyses to reduce variables, the contribution of each SDOH individually and by category to the health outcomes was evaluated. Separate matrices for age populations (under age 19, general population [all ages], and ≥ 65 years) were created with assigned weights of influence for categories and the factors within each category. RESULTS The contributions of the categories varied by population, confirming that different SDOH influence populations to varying degrees. This was reflected in each model. The largest contributor to cost for the general population and for the group 65 years and older was factors grouped as health outcomes (such as perceived health), at 43.5% contribution and 37.7% contribution, respectively. Yet for the population younger than 19 years, the largest contributor to cost was socioeconomic factors (such as unemployment rate), at 40.2%. The other performance measures also varied by population and the mix and weight of determinants. CONCLUSIONS This study and the developed population-based matrices can provide a valuable framework for reporting the impact of SDOH on health care quality. The variation suggests the need for further research on how age groups react to the social environment.","Krause, Trudy Millard; Schaefer, Caroline; Highfield, Linda",The American journal of managed care,260,27

The present systematic review and meta-analysis describes the incidence of AKI, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and mortality among patients with COVID-19-associated AKI. METHODS We systematically searched electronic database PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science to identify English articles published until 25 May 2020. In case of significant heterogeneity, the meta-analyses were conducted assuming a random-effects model. RESULTS From 746 screened publications, we selected 21 observational studies with 15 536 patients with COVID-19 for random-effects model meta-analyses. The overall incidence of AKI was 12.3% (95% CI 7.3% to 20.0%) and 77% of patients with AKI were critically ill (95% CI 58.9% to 89.0%). The mortality among patients with AKI was 67% (95% CI 39.8% to 86.2%) and the risk of death was 13 times higher compared with patients without AKI (OR=13.3; 95% CI 6.1 to 29.2). Patients with COVID-19-associated AKI needed for RRT in 23.4% of cases (95% CI 12.6% to 39.4%) and those cases had high mortality (89%-100%). CONCLUSION The present study evidenced an incidence of COVID-19-associated AKI higher than previous meta-analysis. The majority of patients affected by AKI were critically ill and mortality rate among AKI cases was high. Thus, it is extremely important for health systems to be aware about the impact of AKI on patients' outcomes in order to establish proper screening, prevention of additional damage to the kidneys and adequate renal support when needed.","Oliveira, Camila Barbosa; Lima, Camilla Albertina Dantas; Vajgel, Gisele; Campos Coelho, Antonio Victor; Sandrin-Garcia, Paula",Journal of clinical pathology,260,1

OBJECTIVE We aimed to re-assess the safety of various SYSADOAs in a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials, using, as much as possible, data from full safety reports. METHODS We performed a systematic review and random-effects meta-analyses of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that assessed adverse events (AEs) with various SYSADOAs in patients with OA. The databases MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid CENTRAL) and Scopus were searched. The primary outcomes were overall severe and serious AEs, as well as AEs involving the following Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ classes (SOCs): gastrointestinal, cardiac, vascular, nervous system, skin and subcutaneous tissue, musculoskeletal and connective tissue, renal and urinary system. RESULTS Database searches initially identified 3815 records. After exclusions according to the selection criteria, 25 studies on various SYSADOAs were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 13 studies with adequate data were included in the meta-analyses. Next, from the studies previously excluded according to the protocol, 37 with mainly oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) permitted as concomitant medication were included in a parallel qualitative synthesis, from which 18 studies on various SYSADOAs were included in parallel meta-analyses. This post hoc parallel inclusion was conducted because of the high number of studies allowing concomitant anti-OA medications. Indeed, primarily excluding studies with concomitant anti-OA medications was crucial for a meta-analysis on safety. The decision for parallel inclusion was made for the purpose of comparative analyses. Glucosamine sulfate (GS), chondroitin sulfate (CS) and avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASU; Piascledine®) were not associated with increased odds for any type of AEs compared with placebo. Overall, with/without concomitant OA medication, diacerein was associated with significantly increased odds of total AEs (odds ratio [OR] 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58-3.13; I2 = 52.8%), gastrointestinal disorders (OR 2.85; 95% CI 2.02-4.04; I2 = 62.8%) and renal and urinary disorders (OR 3.42; 95% CI 2.36-4.96; I2 = 17.0%) compared with placebo. In studies that allowed concomitant OA medications, diacerein was associated with significantly more dermatological disorders (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.42-4.31; I2 = 0%) and more dropouts due to AEs (OR 3.18; 95% CI 1.85-5.47; I2 = 13.4%) than was placebo. No significant increase in serious or severe AEs was found with diacerein versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS GS and CS can be considered safe treatments for patients with OA. All eligible studies on ASU included in our analysis used the proprietary product Piascledine® and allowed other anti-OA medications; thus, the safety of ASU must be confirmed in future studies without concomitant anti-OA medications. Given the safety concerns with diacerein, its usefulness in patients with OA should be assessed, taking into account individual patient characteristics.","Honvo, Germain; Reginster, Jean-Yves; Rabenda, Véronique; Geerinck, Anton; Mkinsi, Ouafa; Charles, Alexia; Rizzoli, Rene; Cooper, Cyrus; Avouac, Bernard; Bruyère, Olivier",Drugs & aging,260,11

We evaluate whether these imaging characteristics were associated with angiographic outcomes of aspiration and stent retriever thrombectomy in COMPASS: a trial of aspiration thrombectomy versus stent retriever thrombectomy as first-line approach for large vessel occlusion. METHODS Clot density and perviousness were measured by two independent operators who were blind to all the final angiographic and clinical outcomes. The association of clot density and perviousness with the Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale after first pass was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS Among all patients enrolled in COMPASS, 165 were eligible for the post-hoc analysis (81 patients in the aspiration first and 84 in the stent retriever first groups). Overall mean perviousness of clot was significantly higher in patient with mTICI 2b-3 after first pass (28.6±22.9 vs 20.3±19.2, p=0.017). Mean perviousness among patients who achieved TICI 2c/3 versus TICI 2b versus TICI 0-2a in the aspiration first group varied significantly (32.6±26.1, 35.3±24.4, and 17.7±13.1, p=0.013). The association of perviousness with first pass success was not significant in the stent retriever group. Using multivariate analysis, high perviousness (defined as cut-off >27.6) was an independent predictor of TICI 2b-3 (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.10 to 13.19; p=0.034).

It follows that the UVI forecasting models are useful tools for such decision-making. In this study, a model for computationally-efficient data-driven forecasting of diffuse and global very short-term reactive (VSTR) (10-min lead-time) UVI, enhanced by drawing on the solar zenith angle (θs) data, was developed using an extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. An ELM algorithm typically serves to address complex and ill-defined forecasting problems. UV spectroradiometer situated in Toowoomba, Australia measured daily cycles (0500-1700h) of UVI over the austral summer period. After trialling activations functions based on sine, hard limit, logarithmic and tangent sigmoid and triangular and radial basis networks for best results, an optimal ELM architecture utilising logarithmic sigmoid equation in hidden layer, with lagged combinations of θs as the predictor data was developed. ELM's performance was evaluated using statistical metrics: correlation coefficient (r), Willmott's Index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (ENS), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) between observed and forecasted UVI. Using these metrics, the ELM model's performance was compared to that of existing methods: multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), M5 Model Tree, and a semi-empirical (Pro6UV) clear sky model. Based on RMSE and MAE values, the ELM model (0.255, 0.346, respectively) outperformed the MARS (0.310, 0.438) and M5 Model Tree (0.346, 0.466) models. Concurring with these metrics, the Willmott's Index for the ELM, MARS and M5 Model Tree models were 0.966, 0.942 and 0.934, respectively. About 57% of the ELM model's absolute errors were small in magnitude (±0.25), whereas the MARS and M5 Model Tree models generated 53% and 48% of such errors, respectively, indicating the latter models' errors to be distributed in larger magnitude error range. In terms of peak global UVI forecasting, with half the level of error, the ELM model outperformed MARS and M5 Model Tree. A comparison of the magnitude of hourly-cumulated errors of 10-min lead time forecasts for diffuse and global UVI highlighted ELM model's greater accuracy compared to MARS, M5 Model Tree or Pro6UV models. This confirmed the versatility of an ELM model drawing on θsdata for VSTR forecasting of UVI at near real-time horizon. When applied to the goal of enhancing expert systems, ELM-based accurate forecasts capable of reacting quickly to measured conditions can enhance real-time exposure advice for the public, mitigating the potential for solar UV-exposure-related disease.","Deo, Ravinesh C; Downs, Nathan; Parisi, Alfio V; Adamowski, Jan F; Quilty, John M",Environmental research,260,1

In this study, web-based traffic information covering the Greater Taipei Area was obtained using a vision-based traffic analysis system. Web-based traffic data were normalized and applied to the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to study the impact of vehicle emissions on air quality in the Greater Taipei Area. According to an analysis of the obtained traffic data, sedans were the most common vehicles in the Greater Taipei Area, followed by motorcycles. Moderate traffic conditions with an average speed of 30-50 km/h were most prominent during weekdays, whereas traffic flow with an average speed of 50-70 km/h was most common during weekends. The proportion of traffic flows in free-flow conditions (>70 km/h) was higher on weekends than on weekdays. Two peaks of traffic flow were observed during the morning and afternoon peak hours on weekdays. On the weekends, this morning peak was not observed, and the variation in vehicle numbers was lower than on weekdays. The simulation results suggested that the addition of real-time traffic data improved the CMAQ model's performance, especially for the carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. According to sensitivity tests for total and vehicle emissions in the Greater Taipei Area, vehicle emissions contributed to >90% of CO, 80% of nitrogen oxides (NOx), and approximately 50% of PM2.5 in the downtown areas of Taipei. The vehicle emissions contribution was affected by both vehicle emissions and meteorological conditions. The connection between the surveillance camera data, vehicle emissions, and regional air quality models in this study can also be used to explore the impact of special events (e.g., long weekends and COVID-19 lockdowns) on air quality.","Tsai, I-Chun; Lee, Chen-Ying; Lung, Shih-Chun Candice; Su, Chih-Wen",The Science of the total environment,260,28

Like all crises, these provide a unique opportunity to rethink the fundamental limiting assumptions and institutional inertia of our established systems. These inertial assumptions have obscured deeply rooted problems in health care and deflected attempts to address them. As hospitals begin to welcome all patients back, they should resist the temptation to go back to business as usual. Instead, they should retain the more deliberative, explicit, and transparent ways of thinking that have informed the development of crisis standards of care. The key lesson to be learned from those exercises in rational deliberation is that justice must be the ethical foundation of all standards of care. Justice demands that hospitals take a safety-net approach to providing services that prioritizes the most vulnerable segments of society, continue to expand telemedicine in ways that improve access without exacerbating disparities, invest in community-based care, and fully staff hospitals and clinics on nights and weekends.","Garrett, Jeremy R; McNolty, Leslie Ann; Wolfe, Ian D; Lantos, John D",The Hastings Center report,260,17

The epidemiology and clinical course of infected patients with life-threatening forms of ALD, including severe alcoholic hepatitis (sAH) and decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis (DAC), and specific risk factors for infection remain mostly unknown. APPROACH & RESULTS In this observational study, we assessed all infectious episodes occurring within a 90-day period from diagnosis in all consecutive patients with biopsy-proven sAH (mDF≥32, MELD≥18) and DAC (MELD≥18), without alcoholic hepatitis, in our tertiary hospital between 2003 and 2016. A total of 207 patients were included, 139 with sAH and 68 with DAC. One hundred seventeen(84%) patients with sAH and 41(60%) patients with DAC experienced at least one infection episode at 90 days(p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with the development of infection were the presence of sAH and baseline MELD score. Bacterial infections represented the most common infection in the two groups, and only MELD score was independently associated with the occurrence of bacterial infection. In both groups, pneumonia was the most prevalent bacterial infection and Gram-negative bacilli were the main pathogens. Invasive fungal infections (IFI) occurred in 20(14.5%) patients with sAH and 3(4.5%) with DAC patients(p<0.05). Multivariable regression showed that younger age, higher MELD, and corticosteroid therapy were independently associated with IFI. The 90-day cumulative incidence of death in infected patients with sAH and DAC were 46% and 41.5% respectively(p=0.43). CONCLUSIONS Patients with sAH are more susceptible to develop infection than those with DAC. In life-threatening forms of ALD, infected patients share a similar mortality rate. Corticosteroid treatment, not sAH, seems to be the main risk factor triggering IFI.","Otero Sanchez, Lukas; Karakike, Eleni; Njimi, Hassane; Putignagno, Antonella; Degré, Delphine; Hites, Maya; Jacobs, Frédérique; Moreno, Christophe; Trepo, Eric; Gustot, Thierry",Hepatology,260,12

Reactions with amines and thiols were conducted either as a two-step, one-pot transformation, or as a one-step conversion. Reactions with alcohols were conducted as two-step, one-pot transformations. In the course of these investigations, the formation of 1-(4-pyrimidinyl)-1H-benzotriazole-3-oxide derivatives from the pyrimidine nucleosides was identified. However, these too underwent conversion to the desired products. Products obtained from AZT were converted to the 3'-amino derivatives by catalytic reduction. All products were assayed for their abilities to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and for antiviral activities. Many were seen to be active against HIV-1 and HIV-2, and one was active against herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1).","Akula, Hari K; Kokatla, Hariprasad; Andrei, Graciela; Snoeck, Robert; Schols, Dominique; Balzarini, Jan; Yang, Lijia; Lakshman, Mahesh K",Organic & biomolecular chemistry,260,5

Methods: We collected the daily number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases by nucleic acid detection reported by the National Health Commission from January 16, 2020 to February 14, 2020. The analysis includes the epidemic curve of the new confirmed cases, multiple of the new confirmed cases for period-over-period, multiple of the new confirmed cases for fixed-base, and the period-over-period growth rate of the new confirmed cases. Results: From January 16 to February 14, 2020, the cumulative number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in mainland China was 50 031, including 37 930 in Hubei province, 22 883 in Wuhan city and 12 101 in other provinces outside Hubei. The peak of the number of new confirmed cases in other provinces outside Hubei was from January 31 to February 4, 2020, and the peak of new confirmed cases in Wuhan city and Hubei province was from February 5 to February 9, 2020. The number of new confirmed cases in other provinces outside Hubei showed a significant decline (23% compared with the peak) from February 5 to February 9, 2020, while the number of new confirmed cases in Wuhan city (30% compared with the peak) and Hubei Province (37% compared with the peak) decreased significantly from February 10 to February 14, 2020.

Thirteen healthy participants (33 ± 4 years, 9 female) performed two ITL tests breathing randomly assigned gas mixtures through an inspiratory loading device where the load was increased every two minutes until task failure. SA and SM root mean square (RMS) electromyography (EMG) were calculated and expressed as a percentage of maximum (RMS%max ) to reflect muscle activation intensity. Myoelectric manifestations of fatigue were characterized as decreased SA or SM EMG median frequency during maximum inspiratory pressure maneuvers before and after ITL. Dyspnea was recorded at baseline and task failure. Ventilatory parameters and mouth pressure (Pm) were recorded throughout the ITL. SA,RMS%max and SM,RMS%max increased in association with ITL load (p ≤ .01 for both). SA,RMS%max was similar between norm-ITL and hyp-ITL (p = .17), whereas SM,RMS%max was greater during the latter (p = .001). Neither SA nor SM had a decrease in EMG median frequency after ITL (p = .75 and 0.69 respectively). Pm increased in association with ITL load (p < .001) and tended to be higher during hyp-ITL compared to norm-ITL (p = .05). Dyspnea was similar during both conditions (p > .05). There was a trend for higher tidal volumes during hyp-ITL compared to norm-ITL (p = .10). Minute ventilation was similar between both conditions (p = .23). RMS,%max of the SA and SM increased linearly with increasing ITL. The presence of hypoxia only increased SM activation. Neither SA nor SM presented myoelectric manifestations of fatigue during both conditions.","Basoudan, Nada; Rodrigues, Antenor; Gallina, Alessio; Garland, Jayne; Guenette, Jordan A; Shadgan, Babak; Road, Jeremy; Reid, W Darlene",Physiological reports,260,26

On the other hand, small-incision thyroidectomy lacks sufficient working space and clear vision. The author has newly developed hybrid-type endoscopic thyroidectomy (HET) to overcome these problems. METHODS From March 2011 to February 2012, HET was performed for 85 patients. Clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. To evaluate the superiority of HET for malignancy representatively, conventional lobectomy with central compartment node dissection (CCND) performed 1 year previously was compared with HET. In lobectomy and node dissection, a single skin incision (1.5 cm) is made above the clavicle, with a port incision (5 mm) made 3 cm below the clavicle. Then CCND is performed directly through the incision by lifting up the isthmus. To obtain sufficient working space for the lobectomy, the strap muscles are taped and pulled toward the head, then hung by the cradle. The thyroid lobe is retracted to the midline with a retractor, followed by isolation of the inferior laryngeal nerve and transection of the inferior thyroid vessels with the monitor of the scope. Lateral lymph nodes dissection can be performed at the same time, if necessary. In total thyroidectomy, the same procedure is performed at the opposite side. The scalpel can be used to shave through each incision in case of tracheal invasion. RESULTS Of the 85 cases, 62 were malignant, involving papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and 23 were benign. Total thyroidectomy was performed for 22 of the PTC cases and CCND for 49 of the cases. Shaving for tracheal invasion was performed for eight patients. No mortality, complications, recurrence, or metastasis was found 1-2 years after the operation. Compared with conventional thyroidectomy, HET was superior in blood loss, visual analog scale, and postoperative hospital stay. CONCLUSION The author's method (Tori's method) might be less invasive, cosmetically excellent, and moreover, safe and feasible for differentiated thyroid carcinoma including invasion to the trachea.","Tori, Masayuki",Surgical endoscopy,260,16

The conjugation efficiency is influenced by many biotic and abiotic factors, one of which is the taxonomic relatedness between donor and recipient bacteria. A comprehensive overview of the influence of donor-recipient relatedness on conjugation is still lacking, but such an overview is important to quantitatively assess the risk of plasmid transfer and the effect of interventions which limit the spread of antibiotic resistance, and to obtain parameter values for conjugation in mathematical models. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis on reported conjugation frequencies from Escherichia coli donors to various recipient species. RESULTS Thirty-two studies reporting 313 conjugation frequencies for liquid broth matings and 270 conjugation frequencies for filter matings were included in our meta-analysis. The reported conjugation frequencies varied over 11 orders of magnitude. Decreasing taxonomic relatedness between donor and recipient bacteria, when adjusted for confounding factors, was associated with a lower conjugation frequency in liquid matings. The mean conjugation frequency for bacteria of the same order, the same class, and other classes was 10, 20, and 789 times lower than the mean conjugation frequency within the same species, respectively. This association between relatedness and conjugation frequency was not found for filter matings. The conjugation frequency was furthermore found to be influenced by temperature in both types of mating experiments, and in addition by plasmid incompatibility group in liquid matings, and by recipient origin and mating time in filter matings. CONCLUSIONS In our meta-analysis, taxonomic relatedness is limiting conjugation in liquid matings, but not in filter matings, suggesting that taxonomic relatedness is not a limiting factor for conjugation in environments where bacteria are fixed in space.","Alderliesten, Jesse B; Duxbury, Sarah J N; Zwart, Mark P; de Visser, J Arjan G M; Stegeman, Arjan; Fischer, Egil A J",BMC microbiology,260,12

Chronic stress impairs a myriad of prefrontal cortical functions, important for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, and has consequences on dyadic parent-child functioning. Informed by neuroscience and clinical evidence, sensitive parenting is a vital avenue of intervention that buffers against the toxic effects of COVID-19 on parent-child mental health. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we first discuss the neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms behind exacerbated mental health risks in families. We then highlight the role of sensitive parenting as a buffer against stress-related mental health problems, and conclude with recommendations for systemic-, family-, and individual-interventions to most effectively address stress-related mental health problems and their impact on children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although pressure ventilators have partial compensatory capacity, excessive leakage can compromise the effectiveness of treatment. Home ventilators are equipped with built-in software which provides information on leakage. However, the values of leakage and their effects in routine clinical practice are currently little known. OBJECTIVE To measure leakage in stable patients on nocturnal HMV and its impact on treatment effectiveness. METHODS Consecutive outpatients on HMV were recruited. Nocturnal pulse oximetry was performed at home and leakage was measured using the ventilator's built-in software. We measured: mean SpO(2), percentage of time with SpO(2) <90% (T90), mean leakage (meanL), maximum leakage (maxL), and minimum leakage (minL) during the ventilation session. We estimated ventilator capacity to compensate for leakage according to inspiratory positive airway pressure and divided the patients into two groups: those with leak compensation and those without. RESULTS The study included 41 patients [mean age, 64 years (SD 11.9); 23 (56%) women]. Nocturnal pulse oximetry showed an SpO(2) of 94% (±2.9) and a T90 of 10% (±21.7). Leakage (in l/min) was: meanL, 32.2 (±15.3); maxL, 64.8 (±28.5), and minL, 18.8 (±10.6). Seven cases (17%) had leakage greater than the ventilator compensatory capacity, but no significant difference in SpO(2) or T90 was observed between patients with or without leak compensation. CONCLUSIONS A wide variation between maxL and minL was observed in our series; 17% of cases had higher leakage values than the compensatory capacity of the ventilator, but this did not affect nocturnal oxygenation.","Fernandez Alvarez, Ramon; Rubinos Cuadrado, Gemma; Rodriguez Jerez, Francisco; Garcia Garcia, Almudena; Rodriguez Menendez, Patricia; Casan Clara, Pere",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,260,24

A technique for the study of such oedema may guide in the fluid regime of these patients. PROCEDURES We modified a double-isotope technique to evaluate abdominal organ oedema and fluid extravasation in 24 healthy or endotoxin-exposed ('septic') piglets. Two different markers were used: red blood cells (RBC) labelled with Technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) and Transferrin labelled with Indium111 ((111)In). Images were acquired on a dual-head gamma camera. Microscopic evaluation of tissue biopsies was performed to compare data with the isotope technique. RESULTS No (99m)Tc activity was measured in the plasma fraction in blood sampled after labelling. Similarly, after molecular size gel chromatography, (111)In activity was exclusively found in the high molecular fraction of the plasma. Extravasation of transferrin, indicating the degree of abdominal oedema, was 4·06 times higher in the LPS group compared to the healthy controls (P<0·0001). Abdominal free fluid, studied in 3 animals, had as high (111)In activity as in plasma, but no (99m)Tc activity. Intestinal lymphatic vessel size was higher in LPS (3·7 ± 1·1 μm) compared to control animals (0·6 + 0·2 μm; P<0·001) and oedema correlated to villus diameter (R(2) = 0·918) and lymphatic diameter (R(2) = 0·758). A correlation between a normalized index of oedema formation (NI) and intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was also found: NI = 0·46*IAP-3·3 (R(2) = 0·56). CONCLUSIONS The technique enables almost continuous recording of abdominal oedema formation and may be a valuable tool in experimental research, with the potential to be applied in the clinic.","Lattuada, Marco; Maripuu, Enn; Segerstad, Carl Hard af; Lundqvist, Hans; Hedenstierna, Göran",Clinical physiology and functional imaging,260,31

INTERVENTION(S) physiotherapist-led interventions for hip pain. Comparators: sham treatment, no treatment or other treatment (eg, hip arthroscopic surgery). OUTCOMES primary outcomes included patient-reported hip pain and function. Secondary outcomes included physical function measures. RESULTS 1722 papers were identified. After exclusion criteria were applied, 14 studies were included for analysis. They had varied risk of bias. There were no full-scale placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physiotherapist-led treatment. Pooled effects ranged from moderate effects (0.67 (95% CI 0.07 to 1.26)) favouring physiotherapist-led intervention over no treatment post-arthroscopy, to weak effects (-0.32 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.07)) favouring hip arthroscopy over physiotherapist-led treatment.

An attractive alternative to the use of transgenics or pesticides in agriculture is the use of a 'green' alternative known as RNAi, which involves the delivery of siRNAs that downregulate endogenous genes to confer resistance. However, siRNA is a molecule that is highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation and is difficult to deliver across the lignin-rich and multi-layered plant cell wall that poses the dominant physical barrier to biomolecule delivery in plants. We have demonstrated that DNA nanostructures can be utilized as a cargo carrier for direct siRNA delivery and gene silencing in mature plants. The size, shape, compactness and stiffness of the DNA nanostructure affect both internalization into plant cells and subsequent gene silencing efficiency. Herein, we provide a detailed protocol that can be readily adopted with standard biology benchtop equipment to generate geometrically optimized DNA nanostructures for transgene-free and force-independent siRNA delivery and gene silencing in mature plants. We further discuss how such DNA nanostructures can be rationally designed to efficiently enter plant cells and deliver cargoes to mature plants, and provide guidance for DNA nanostructure characterization, storage and use.

Data were presented using descriptive statistics, chi-square, one-way ANOVA, independent t-, and Welch's t-tests. RESULTS The questionnaire was sent to 281 patients, of whom 201 completed it. 59.2% patients were satisfied with their overall virtual phone clinic experience, and 75.6% preferred to continue attending the virtual phone clinics in the future. The average perception value of patients toward virtual phone clinics was 67.76 ± 19.9, suggesting good perception among the majority. Negative or neutral views of current health, asking to be physically seen, and missing a virtual appointment were associated with significantly lower average patient perception value (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Most Saudi patients with T1DM have adapted to virtual phone consultations, exhibiting good satisfaction and perception, and high preference to continue using this system in the future. The utilization of the service to assist patients with diabetes is highly encouraged, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies need to be developed to further enhance the patient experience.","Magliah, Sultan F; Alsabban, Ahmad S; Turkistani, Haneen A; Abulaban, Bahaa A; Alsharif, Abdulaziz H; Alsharif, Sarah S; Zarif, Hawazen A",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,260,19

Many adjuncts have been developed to reduce this risk including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Acetazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) is a drug used to counteract mountain sickness and one of its effects is to reduce CSF production. Here, we report its first postoperative application in thoracoabdominal surgery with the aim of reducing cerebrospinal cord perfusion pressure and reducing risk of paraplegia. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 6 patients who have been treated with this drug between 2011 and 2012 who were undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic surgery. Our indications were decided to include: (i) patients in whom a spinal drain could not be positioned; (ii) patients with blood-stained CSF; (iii) patients in whom the volume of CSF drained was outside guidelines; (iv) patients in whom CSF pressure was elevated; (v) patients with excessive vasopressor usage and (vi) patients with postoperative neurological dysfunction as measured by motor-evoked potentials or clinical examination. All were given 500 mg intravenous acetazolamide, not more than eight hourly, for a duration dependent on response. RESULTS In the 6 patients, 2 received a single dose of the drug and responded by an immediate drop in intracranial pressure (ICP) pressure. Of the 4 who received multiple doses of the drug, 1 had an immediate decline in ICP after each of the first six doses, while 3 had no discernable response. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report of the efficacy of acetazolamide in reducing CSF production and lowering ICP during thoracoabdominal aortic surgery. We believe that its use will be beneficial in the 6 patient groups described. Our experience suggests there are 'responders' and 'non-responders', the characteristics of whom are yet to be defined. Its efficacy in reducing not just CSF volume and ICP but also clinically relevant morbidity such as paraplegia, is the subject of a planned randomized controlled trial. This report serves to raise awareness of the possible efficacy of this drug when normal management strategies are limited or exhausted.","Jafarzadeh, Fatemeh; Field, Mark L; Harrington, Deborah K; Kuduvalli, Manoj; Oo, Aung; Kendall, Jonathan; Desmond, Mike; Mills, Keith",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,260,0

As such, only very few take advantage of temporal consistency in video sequences, and those that do only impose weak smoothness constraints across consecutive frames. In this paper, we advocate estimating people flows across image locations between consecutive images and inferring the people densities from these flows instead of directly regressing them. This enables us to impose much stronger constraints encoding the conservation of the number of people. As a result, it significantly boosts performance without requiring a more complex architecture. Furthermore, it allows us to exploit the correlation between people flow and optical flow to further improve the results. We also show that leveraging people conservation constraints in both a spatial and temporal manner makes it possible to train a deep crowd counting model in an active learning setting with much fewer annotations. This significantly reduces the annotation cost while still leading to similar performance to the full supervision case.","Liu, Weizhe; Salzmann, Mathieu; Fua, Pascal",IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence,260,6

AIMS The aim of this study is to examine gut microbiota changes after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) surgery in obese patients with T2D. METHODS Whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing of DNA fragments using Illumina HiSeq2000 was obtained from stool samples collected from 14 obese T2D patients pre-operatively (while on very low calorie diet) and 1 year after randomisation to laparoscopic SG (n = 7) or RYGB (n = 7). Resulting shotgun reads were annotated with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). RESULTS Body weight reduction and dietary change was similar 1 year after both surgery types. Identical proportions (n = 5/7) achieved diabetes remission (HbA1c < 48 mmol/mol without medications) 1 year after RYGB and SG. RYGB resulted in increased Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla but decreased Bacteroidetes phyla. SG resulted in increased Bacteroidetes phyla. Only an increase in Roseburia species was observed among those achieving diabetes remission, common to both surgery types. KEGG Orthology and pathway analysis predicted contrasting and greater gut microbiota metabolism changes after diabetes remission following RYGB than after SG. Those with persistent diabetes post-operatively had higher Desulfovibrio species pre-operatively. CONCLUSIONS Overall, RYGB produces greater and more predicted favourable changes in gut microbiota functional capacity than SG. An increase in Roseburia species was the only compositional change common to both types of surgery among those achieving diabetes remission.","Murphy, Rinki; Tsai, Peter; Jüllig, Mia; Liu, Amy; Plank, Lindsay; Booth, Michael",Obesity surgery,260,1

The presence of asymptomatic subjects in the population, that are responsible for about 30% of the new infections, may complicate this phase. Serological tests for the measurement of immune response could represent an effective tool for the rapid monitoring of the population with asymptomatic infections and for estimating the proportion of immune in a territory, too. OBJECTIVES to describe the distribution of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of the Municipality of Borgosesia (Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) and to estimate the efficacy of this strategy for the identification of asymptomatic cases. DESIGN Cross-sectional study with administration of a rapid test to assess the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS all subjects resident in Borgosesia over the age of 18, where invited to participate. A rapid serological test was administered to enrolled participants to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies on peripheral blood. Subjects with IgG or IgM positivity were offered to perform a swab test for viral RNA research. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES the prevalence of IgM and IgG, and the relative risks of having positive swab test and of having symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 in the recent past has been estimated. RESULTS 4,987 subjects participated to study, 44.5% of the adult population of Borgosesia. The average age was 55 years. There was a greater participation of women (54.4%), of people with a higher education level (37.3%) and of people without specific previous symptoms (95.1%). 245 people had a positive test for IgM or IgG, and the estimated prevalence was of 4.9%. 209 out of 245 subjects who were positive to the rapid test underwent to the RT-PCR test and this allowed to isolate 24 positive subjects. CONCLUSIONS the seroprevalence values ​​estimated for subjects residing in the city of Borgosesia which underwent the rapid test for the detection of type M and type G antibodies on peripheral blood, confirmed the population-based estimates reported in literature, in particular with the results of the Italian survey of seroprevalence. Furthermore, the implementation of this test allowed the identification and isolation of completely asymptomatic subjects, that could have been identified only through screening with tests for viral RNA.","Alessi, Daniela; Borré, Silvio; Barale, Antonella; Isabella, Antonio; Milano, Fulvia; Rossi, Maicol Andrea; Silano, Virginia; Piu, Nicola; Cena, Tiziana; Faggiano, Fabrizio",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,260,23

The need for constant monitoring of diseases activity and prompt adjustment of therapy have been balanced with the risk of contagion related to face-to-face consultations. Therefore, digital health initiatives have been pursued for safety reasons as vicarious instruments to avoid overcrowding of the IBD clinics. However, concerns and scepticism about the feasibility of digital health and telemedicine modalities limited their uptake in clinical practice in the pre-pandemic period. AREAS COVERED We conducted a literature overview on the current state of the art and the potential future benefits deriving from the integration of telemedicine systems, home-based laboratory tests, and self-administered drugs into IBD daily practice. EXPERT OPINION Digital health and telemedicine approaches at distance have been experimented as effective tools to avoid overcrowding of clinics and reduce risk from SARS-CoV2 exposure. Home-based point of care testing, such as faecal calprotectin and dried blood samples, might represent an effective method of remote monitoring of patients particularly when in-person visits are precluded. High expectations are placed on the use of self-administered advanced therapies, such as new subcutaneous formulation of biologics.","Solitano, Virginia; Alfarone, Ludovico; D'Amico, Ferdinando; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Danese, Silvio",Expert opinion on biological therapy,260,1

The management of aneurysms that fail to occlude following flow diversion is problematic. We aimed to reproduce failures in an animal model and study re-treatment with additional flow diverters alone or with flow diverters and liquid embolic agent. Material and methods Twenty wide-necked aneurysms were created at the carotid-lingual bifurcation in 10 dogs, and were treated with flow diverters 4-6 weeks later. Follow-up angiography was performed at three months. Suitable residual aneurysms were randomly allocated: re-treatment with flow diverters alone ( n = 6), or with the injection of liquid embolic between two layers of flow diverters ( n = 4) or no re-treatment ( n = 2). Angiography was repeated three months later, followed by euthanasia, photography and pathology. Results Patent wide-necked aneurysms were produced in 17/20 attempts (85%); three months after flow diversion there were 15/17 (88%) residual aneurysms. In three cases, re-treatment was not possible because the flow diverter had prolapsed into the aneurysm, leaving 12 aneurysms to study. Re-treated aneurysms showed improved angiographic results at six months (median score of 2; P = 0.03), but residual aneurysms were present in all cases. Parent artery occlusion occurred in two aneurysms treated with flow diverter plus liquid embolic. At pathology, aneurysms were only partially filled with thrombus; leaks through the flow diverters were found in the neointima connecting the arterial lumen to residual aneurysms. Conclusion Re-treatment of residual flow-diverted experimental aneurysms with additional flow diverters did not lead to aneurysm occlusion.","Fahed, Robert; Darsaut, Tim E; Kotowski, Marc; Salazkin, Igor; Raymond, Jean",The neuroradiology journal,260,1

Methods and Results Patients with successful endovascular thrombectomy (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction IIb or III) were enrolled from a multicenter registry as the training cohort. Step-wise logistic regression with Akaike information criterion was utilized to establish the best-fit nomogram. The discriminative value of the nomogram was tested by concordance index. An additional 224 patients from 2 comprehensive stroke centers were prospectively recruited as the test cohort for validating the new nomogram. Altogether, 417 patients were enrolled in the training cohort. Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10), poor pretreatment collateral status (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.18-3.85), baseline blood glucose level (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.21), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 9.51; 95% CI, 4.54-19.92), and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.12) were associated with mortality and were incorporated in the nomogram.

PATIENTS AND METHODS A phase III randomized trial was conducted between January 2013 and June 2015; eligible left-side donors were randomized to laparoscopic or open donor nephrectomy in a 1:1 ratio with recovery optimized within a standardized ERP. The primary outcome was patient-reported measure of physical fatigue, as measured by the physical fatigue domain of the translated Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 20. Secondary outcomes included other donor recovery outcomes, postoperative pain scores, hospital stay, perioperative complications, and graft outcomes. RESULTS A total of 224 donors (laparoscopy, n = 113; open surgery, n = 111) were randomly allocated. Six weeks postoperatively, physical fatigue domain scores in Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 20 were significantly lower in the LDN group (mean: laparoscopy, 8.2 ± 3.2 vs open surgery, 13.05 ± 2.9) (P = .007). Median total hospital stay was also significantly shorter in the LDN group (median: laparoscopy, 2; interquartile range, 1-5 vs open surgery, 4; interquartile range, 2-9 days) (P = .002). LDN was associated with less pain scores and less non-opioid analgesic requirements. Warm ischemia times were not significantly different in both groups (mean: laparoscopy, 2.5 ± 0.8 vs open surgery, 2.2 ± 0.6) (P = .431). CONCLUSION Even when optimized within an ERP, LDN was associated with less general and physical fatigue and better physical function at 6 weeks postoperatively when compared with open surgery for left kidney donations.","Mansour, Ahmed M; El-Nahas, Ahmed R; Ali-El-Dein, Bedeir; Denewar, Ahmed A; Abbas, Mohammed A; Abdel-Rahman, Ahmed; Eraky, Ibrahim; Shokeir, Ahmed A",Urology,260,19

Understanding the routes and pathogenesis of the coronavirus is important and it is considered that the studies on host cell receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be valuable for the treatment and prevention of the disease. AIM To evaluate the possibility of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at throat. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was conducted. CONCLUSION In view of the fact that the mouth and nose have higher number of ACE2 expressed cells, they serve as a gateway for the virus to enter. Thus, blocking the gate could be a good choice to reduce or even prevent the transmission. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are double-stranded RNA molecules and could be designed easily and directed against many strains of a virus. Due to their features, siRNAs can provide a potential strategy to interfere with the replication of viral diseases. We think that since oral and nasal epithelial cells are relatively easily accessible it may allow to develop siRNA molecules to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 already at the entry where it continues to replicate for a period (Fig. 1, Ref. 50).","Kaya, M; Abuaisha, A M; Serakinci, N; Ozturk, S",Bratislavske lekarske listy,260,7

Millions of lives are still affected because of mandatory quarantines, which hamstring economies and induce panic. Immunology plays a major role in the modern field of medicine, especially against virulent infectious diseases. In this field, neutralizing antibodies are heavily studied because they reflect the level of infection and individuals' immune status, which are essential when considering resumption of work, flight travel, and border entry control. More importantly, it also allows evaluating the antiviral vaccine efficacy as vaccines are still known for being the ultimate intervention method to inhibit the rapid spread of virulent infectious diseases. In this Review, we first introduce the host immune response after the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the latest results using conventional immunoassays. Next, as an enabling platform for detection with sufficient sensitivity while saving analysis time and sample size, the progress of microfluidic-based immunoassays is discussed and compared based on surface modification, microfluidic kinetics, signal output, signal amplification, sample matrix, and the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Based on the overall comparison, this Review concludes by proposing the future integration of visual quantitative signals on microfluidic devices as a more suitable approach for general use and large-scale surveillance.","Hartanto, Hogi; Wu, Minghui; Lam, Miu Ling; Chen, Ting-Hsuan",Biomicrofluidics,260,9

Various treatment modalities are available; however, searching for newer options to meet patients' needs and expectations is encouraged. AIM The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treatment of primary palmar hyperhidrosis. Two different photosensitizers for PDT were evaluated: eosin Y, and methylene blue. The study focused on the clinical efficacy, patient's satisfaction, and the time & number of sessions needed to achieve a satisfactory response. METHODS Twenty patients with primary palmar hyperhidrosis were enrolled in a single-center clinical study. Patients were treated with PDT for a maximum of eight sessions. Two photosensitizers were tested: eosin Y, and methylene blue for the right and left hand, respectively. The Hyperhidrosis disease severity scale (HDSS), and Sweating Intensity Visual Scale of Minor's test were used for assessment. RESULTS Photodynamic therapy effectively reduced the severity scores of hyperhidrosis with comparable results between the two photosensitizers. The treatment effect was maintained up to three months after the last procedure. CONCLUSION Photodynamic therapy is a good treatment option for primary palmar hyperhidrosis with results maintainable for three months after the treatment end.","Shabaik, Aya Ha; Shaheen, Maha A; Soltan, Marwa Y",Dermatologic therapy,260,7

Granting patients electronic access allows them to make well-informed health care decisions. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to identify sociodemographic differences in patient portal use and examine factors affecting patient portal utilization following the final stage of the Meaningful Use program which aimed to promote the use of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. RESEARCH DESIGN Survey data from Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 5, cycles 1, 2, and 3 were analyzed. The sample included 8291 completed surveys. Multivariable logistic regression on a selected response for each surveyed question was used to assess the racial and ethnic difference after controlling for age, sex, income, and education. SUBJECTS Subjects included English and Spanish speaking adults in the USA. MEASURES Measures included assessment of patient portal use, patient portal access, understanding health information, usefulness of health records, and privacy and security. RESULTS After adjusting for age, sex, income, and education, there was a significant association between race/ethnicity and patient portal non-users responding, ""no need to use online medical record"" as the reason for not using the patient portal (P = 0.005). Among the portal users, there were significant associations between race/ethnicity and health care provider maintaining an EHR (P = 0.006), being offered access to their portal (P < 0.001), understanding health information in the portal (P = 0.004), finding the portal useful for health monitoring (P < 0.001), reporting concern about unauthorized access (P = 0.017), and keeping information from health care providers (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS Race/ethnicity affects perceptions on the need for the patient portal, being offered access to a portal, and the reasons to access information online. Understanding the factors affecting patient portal use can inform future strategies aimed at increasing adoption.","Clarke, Martina A; Lyden, Elizabeth R; Ma, Jihyun; King, Keyonna M; Siahpush, Mohammad Mo; Michaud, Tzeyu; Idoate, Regina E; Ramos, Athena K",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,260,1

Viruses are submicroscopic infectious agents that replicate inside the living cells of different organisms. These viruses use nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) for further replication and maturity inside the cells. Some of the viruses responsible for various human and plant diseases belong to the classes of Picornaviridae, Retroviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, Pneumoviridae, Virgaviridae, and Hepadnaviridae, and their treatment options are limited or non-existent. The consistent reemergence and resistance development in the viral strains demands the discovery and development of new antiviral drugs possessing better efficacy. Bio-active compounds isolated from fungi can be the source of new compounds with enhanced potency and new mechanisms of action. Fungi are known to produce a diverse lot of secondary metabolites due to their existence in harsh climates which are often inhabitable for many organisms. Due to these unique environments, fungi produce a variety of secondary metabolites of different chemical classes like alkaloids, quinones, furanone, pyrones, benzopyranoids, xanthones, terpenes, steroids, peptides, and many acyclic compounds. Fungal metabolites are known to display a wide range of bioactive attributes, i.e., anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-Alzheimer's, along with antiviral properties. In this review article, we report over 300 antiviral compounds from fungal sources during the period of 2009 to 2019. The source of these compounds is marine and endophytic fungi and they are arranged based on their antiviral action against different viral families. These compounds are promising in their use and development as future antiviral drugs.","Deshmukh, Sunil K; Agrawal, Shivankar; Gupta, Manish Kumar; Patidar, Rajesh K; Ranjan, Nihar",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,260,8

METHODS This was a consecutive study that compared 12 patients who underwent a new LigaSure technique (LT) for segmental plane formation during thoracoscopic anatomical segmentectomy with 38 patients who underwent conventional methods using the staple technique (ST). Eleven patients were followed up more than 3 months after discharge. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 66 years in the LT group and 67 years in ST. The mean duration for the formation of segmental plane and the mean number of staples was 22.8 min and 1.8 per surgery, respectively, in the LT group; and 16.2 min and 3.4 per surgery, respectively, in ST. No patient had a prolonged air leak (PAL) of more than 7 days. Minor air leak was identified early in two and was delayed in one. Two-thirds of patients with early minor air leak had low index of prolonged air leak (IPAL) score. There was no air leak in the patients with high IPAL score. Eventually, we deduced that the cause of the minor air leak was a technical problem. CONCLUSIONS In the formation of segmental plane during thoracoscopic segmentectomy, a combination of ICG fluorescence and LigaSure may be beneficial for patients. As a new operative instrument, LT constitutes, in our opinion, a feasible and easy alternative to other thoracoscopic techniques.","Kuroda, Hiroaki; Dejima, Hitoshi; Mizumo, Tetsuya; Sakakura, Noriaki; Sakao, Yukinori",Journal of thoracic disease,260,16

The aim of the study was to examine the personal factors (body self-esteem and disinhibition) and erotic-sexual factors (sexual initiation strategies and erotic-pornographic sexting) that predict grooming. METHOD The sample was comprised of 1,200 adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years (M = 14.54, SD = 1.17; 50.83% girls). A cross-sectional design with self-report data was used and structural equation modeling (SEM) with mediation analysis was performed. RESULTS The results indicated two paths explaining child grooming: 1) physical attractiveness and disinhibition are indirectly associated with grooming through erotic sexting and direct sexual initiation strategies; both of which partially mediate this relationship; 2) disinhibited behavior has an indirect impact on grooming; pornographic sexting and coercive strategies acting as mediators. The semi-partial mediation model explains 54% of the variance of grooming. CONCLUSIONS These findings highlight the urgent need to implement prevention programs considering these attitudes and behaviors that function as precursors of victimization and the risk of falling into pedophile networks.","Schoeps, Konstanze; Peris Hernández, Montserrat; Garaigordobil, Maite; Montoya-Castilla, Inmaculada",Psicothema,260,26

Current recommendations for healthy food to complement breastfeeding at age 6 to 23 months include iron-rich and iron-enriched foods. An electronic nutrient analysis was undertaken to assess the iron content of hypothetical healthy diets for breastfed babies and young children aged 6 to 23 months in Australia, in comparison with their estimated requirements. METHODS Hypothetical diets for 1 day were developed that were consistent with the Foundation Diets for breastfed infants 6 to 12 months and for toddlers 13 to 23 months. Nutrient content was derived using the Australian Food Composition database in FoodWorks 10. The iron content of these two diets were compared with Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Intakes (RDIs) for iron for infants aged 7 to 12 months and children aged 1 to 3 years. RESULTS The iron content of the hypothetical diet for breastfed infants aged 6 to 12 months (5.8 mg) was less than the EAR (7 mg, 83%) and the RDI (11 mg, 53%). For young breastfed children aged 13 to 23 months, the iron content of the hypothetical diet was 4.4 mg; above the EAR (4 mg, 110%) but less than RDI (9 mg, 49%). CONCLUSIONS Breastfeeding has health and neurodevelopmental benefits for infants and young children that are particularly important in remote Australia where food insecurity and poor nutrition compromise health and wellbeing. Adequate iron intake is also important for neurodevelopment in early life but healthy diets for breastfed babies and young children may have insufficient iron content to meet requirements. The upcoming revision of the Australian Dietary Guidelines provides an opportunity to consider this issue.","Leonard, Dympna; Buettner, Petra; McDermott, Robyn; Makrides, Maria",Nutrition & dietetics: the journal of the Dietitians Association of Australia,260,1

This limitation in functionalization is attributed to the difficulty of electron transfer from 2H-TMD to the reacting molecules due to its semiconducting property and neutral charge state. Unfortunately, this is an all too important prerequisite step toward creating chemically reactive radical species for surface functionalization reactions. Herein, an electrochemical approach was developed for facilitating direct surface functionalization of 2H-MoS2 with 4-bromobenzene diazonium tetraborate (4-BBDT). Successful functionalization was characterized using various microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. During the course of investigating the change of optical transition seen for modified 2H-MoS2 using photoluminescence measurement combined with theoretical calculations, our study uncovered that the controlling S-C bond and sulfur vacancy generation could tune the electronic structure of functionalized 2H-MoS2.","Park, Younghee; Shin, Seunghyun; An, Young-Joon; Ahn, Jong-Guk; Shin, Geumbi; Ahn, Chaehyeon; Bang, Jiwon; Baik, Jaeyoon; Kim, Yousoo; Jung, Jaehoon; Lim, Hyunseob",ACS applied materials & interfaces,260,24

The differences among these studies include type of surgery and patient sex. In recent years, study of sex differences in regards to anesthetic pharmacology has drawn greater interest. Accordingly, we attempted to determine the effective Ce of remifentanil for preventing cough for each sex under the same clinical conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty female and 25 male ASA physical status I-II grade patients between the ages of 20 and 46 years who were undergoing thyroidectomy were enrolled in this study. The effective Ce of remifentanil for preventing cough was determined for each sex using the isotonic regression method with a bootstrapping approach, following Dixon's up-and-down method. RESULTS Isotonic regression with a bootstrapping approach revealed that the estimated EC₅₀ of remifentanil for preventing coughing during emergence was significantly lower in females {1.30 ng/mL [83% confidence interval (CI), 1.20-1.47 ng/mL]} than in males [2.57 ng/mL (83% CI, 2.45-2.70 ng/mL)]. Mean EC₅₀ in females was also significantly lower than in males (1.23±0.21 ng/mL vs. 2.43±0.21 ng/mL, p<0.001). Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate over time were not significantly different between the sexes. CONCLUSION When using remifentanil TCI for cough prevention during anesthetic emergence, patient sex should be a considered for appropriate dosing.","Soh, Sarah; Park, Wyun Kon; Kang, Sang Wook; Lee, Bo Ra; Lee, Jeong Rim",Yonsei medical journal,260,1

The objective of this study was to evaluate the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnancies among women with CHD in the modern era. Methods and Results We conducted a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed literature published January 2007 through June 2019. Studies were included if they reported on maternal or fetal mortality and provided data by CHD lesion. Meta-analysis was performed using random effect regression modeling using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (v3). CHD lesions were categorized as mild, moderate, and severe to allow for pooling of data across studies. Of 2200 articles returned by our search, 32 met inclusion criteria for this study. Overall, the rate of neonatal mortality was 1%, 3.1%, and 3.5% in mild, moderate, and severe lesions, respectively. There were too few maternal deaths in any group to pool data. The rates of maternal and neonatal morbidity among women with CHD increase with severity of lesion. Specifically, rates of maternal arrhythmia and heart failure, cesarean section, preterm birth, and small for gestational age neonate are all markedly increased as severity of maternal CHD increases. Conclusions In the modern era, pregnancy in women with CHD typically has a successful outcome in both mother and child. However, as maternal CHD severity increases, so too does the risk of numerous morbidities and neonatal mortality. These findings may help in counseling women with CHD who plan to become pregnant, especially women with severe lesions.","Hardee, Isabel; Wright, Lydia; McCracken, Courtney; Lawson, Emily; Oster, Matthew E",Journal of the American Heart Association,260,1

The evidence regarding their efficacy in procedural success rates, reduction of duodenoscope bacterial contamination, clinical outcomes associated with these devices, safety, and the financial considerations are discussed. CONCLUSIONS Several technologies discussed in this document are anticipated to eliminate or reduce exogenous infections during endoscopy requiring a duodenoscope. Although disposable duodenoscopes can eliminate exogenous ERCP-related risk of infection, data regarding effectiveness are needed outside of expert centers. Additionally, with more widespread adoption of these new technologies, more data regarding functionality, medical economics, and environmental impact will accrue.

We combine a model of customer movement with two models of disease transmission: direct exposure when two customers are in close proximity and wake exposure when one customer is in the airflow behind another customer. We find that the effectiveness of some operational interventions is sensitive to the primary mode of transmission. Restricting customer flow to one-way movement is highly effective if direct exposure is the dominant mode of transmission. In particular, the rate of direct transmission under full compliance with one-way movement is less than one-third the rate under two-way movement. Directing customers to follow one-way flow, however, is not effective if wake exposure dominates. We find that two other interventions-reducing the speed variance of customers and throughput control-can be effective whether direct or wake transmission is dominant. We also examine the trade-off between customer throughput and the risk of infection to customers, and we show how the optimal throughput rate drops rapidly as the population prevalence rises.","Shumsky, Robert A; Debo, Laurens; Lebeaux, Rebecca M; Nguyen, Quang P; Hoen, Anne G",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,260,31

Methods: The clinical data of 77 hospitalized cases admitted to the Children's Hospital of Fudan University were collected from January 19 to November 28, 2020. The characteristics and risk factors of abnormal liver chemistries in children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection were analyzed. Results: Of the 77 cases, 44 were male (57.1%) and 33 were female (42.9%), with a median age of 10 years. 27(35.1%) were asymptomatic, 28(36.4%) had mild illness, 22(28.6%)had non-severe pneumonia. Hydroxychloroquine was used in 7 cases.

A sensitive inflammation marker, neopterine (NP) was used to confirm whether the severity of inflammation in the thyroid gland was responsible for urticaria or not. METHODS Neopterine levels were assessed in patients with AT with urticaria and without urticaria. Furthermore, levels were compared in relation to pre and post levothyroxine treatment. Twenty-seven patients with urticaria (Group 1) and 28 patients without urticaria (Group 2) were enrolled in the study. A course of levothyroxine treatment was given to all patients, and urine neopterine levels before and after the trial were obtained. RESULTS All patients completed the trial. Mean age in Group 1 and Group 2 was similar (35.70 ± 10.86 years and 38.36 ± 10.38 years, respectively) (P=0.358). Pre-treatment urine neopterine levels were significantly higher in Group 1 (P=0.012). Post-treatment levels decreased in each group, as expected. However, the decrease in the neopterine level was insignificant in the patients of Group 2 (P=0.282). In Group 1, a significant decrease in post-treatment neopterine levels (P=0.015) was associated with the remission of urticaria. CONCLUSION In patients with CUA and AT, pre-treatment elevated levels of NP, and its decrease with levothyroxine treatment along with symptomatic relief in urticaria, may be evidence of the relationship between the degree of inflammation in thyroid and presence of urticaria.","Gulec, Mustafa; Kartal, Ozgür; Caliskaner, A Zafer; Yazici, Mahmut; Yaman, Halil; Ozturk, Sami; Sener, Osman","Indian journal of dermatology, venereology and leprology",260,1

A cross-sectional study was conducted in 11 CAPS of 5 different modalities. Sociodemographic data and information about drug use were obtained through interviews with users and analysis of prescriptions and medical records, using a semi-structured questionnaire. The mean number of drugs prescribed per user in CAPS was 3.38 (± 1.76) and the amounts were 4.08 (± 1.56), 3.54 (± 1.64) and 2.00 (± 1.66) for CAPS Alcohol and Drugs (CAPS ad), CAPS II and III and CAPS for children (CAPSi), respectively. The most prescribed therapeutic class was antipsychotics, with emphasis on haloperidol. Users in the economically active age group attended larger units (24h) or the CAPS ad modality and reported that in the past they had used drugs inappropriately and had a higher prevalence of prescriptions containing 5 drugs or more. The profile of drug use in the CAPS differed according to the modality of the service, and a greater degree of utilization was observed in the CAPS ad units. The differences revealed may subsidize discussion of the strategies for promoting the rational use of drugs.","Silva, Sarah Nascimento; Lima, Marina Guimarães; Ruas, Cristina Mariano",Ciencia & saude coletiva,260,16

However, differences between obese and normal-weight depressed patients and the moderating effect of obesity on antidepressant treatment outcome are not well studied. METHODS Adults (n = 662) with major depressive disorder in the Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes study were randomized to treatment with escitalopram plus placebo, bupropion plus escitalopram, or venlafaxine plus mirtazapine for a 12-week primary treatment phase and 16-week follow-up. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated at baseline and categorized according to World Health Organization criteria: normal or low weight (NW), overweight, Obese I and Obese II+. A repeated-effects model, unadjusted and adjusted for baseline variables, assessed outcomes. RESULTS Obesity was common (46.2%), only 25.5% were NW. Higher BMI was associated with greater medical illness (p < .001), social phobia (p = .003), and bulimia (p = .026). Lower BMI was associated with more frequent post-traumatic stress disorder (p = .002) and drug abuse (p < .001). Treatment outcomes did not differ including Week 12 remission rates (NW 36%, overweight 40%, Obese I 43%, Obese II+ 37%; p = .69). Lower BMI was associated with more frequent (p = .024 [unadjusted] and .053 [adjusted]) and more severe (p = .008 [unadjusted] and .053 [adjusted]) adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS BMI was related to clinical presentation and prevalence of comorbidities, but not antidepressant outcomes. Lower BMI classes had more psychiatric comorbidities, potentially obscuring the relationship between BMI and antidepressant effects.

Expression of the TXNIP gene is regulated by DNA methylation. However, no study has reported the influence of lifestyle factors on TXNIP DNA methylation. Our goal was to determine the association between smoking habits and TXNIP DNA methylation levels in a Japanese population. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 417 subjects (180 males and 237 females) participating in a health examination. We used a pyrosequencing assay to determine TXNIP DNA methylation levels in leukocytes. The mean TXNIP DNA methylation level in current smokers (75.3%) was significantly lower than that in never and ex-smokers (never: 78.1%, p < 0.001; ex: 76.9%, p = 0.013). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that the OR for TXNIP DNA hypomethylation was significantly higher in current smokers than that in never smokers, and significantly higher in current smokers with years of smoking ≥ 35 and Brinkman Index ≥ 600 compared to that in non-smokers. In conclusion, we found that current smokers had TXNIP DNA hypomethylation compared to never and ex-smokers. Moreover, long-term smoking and high smoking exposure also were associated with TXNIP DNA hypomethylation.","Maeda, Keisuke; Yamada, Hiroya; Munetsuna, Eiji; Fujii, Ryosuke; Yamazaki, Mirai; Ando, Yoshitaka; Mizuno, Genki; Ishikawa, Hiroaki; Ohashi, Koji; Tsuboi, Yoshiki; Hashimoto, Shuji; Hamajima, Nobuyuki; Suzuki, Koji",PloS one,260,29

The in vitro delivery and expression of one of these scFv with and without the C(H)2-C(H)4 Fc domain of chicken IgY attached (scFv-Fc) by a serotype 8 fowl adenovirus (FAdV-8) vector was investigated in the present study. A panel of FAdV-8 vectors was constructed, each containing a different transgene (scFv or scFv-Fc), a different promoter to drive scFv and scFv-Fc transcription (CMVie or the fowl adenovirus major late promoter), and a different sized, right-hand end genomic deletion (52 bp or 2.3 kb). This panel was used to establish what effect these variables had on protein production, viral replication and scFv transcription, as measured by enzyme-linked imunosorbent assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that, using a FAdV-8 vector containing the optimal CMVie promoter/2.3 kb deletion combination, we successfully expressed a secreted form of both scFv and scFv-Fc that were able to neutralize IBDV both in vitro and in ovo.

The RBD contains critical neutralizing epitopes and serves as an important vaccine target. Since RBD mutations occur in different MERS-CoV isolates and antibody escape mutants, cross-neutralization of divergent MERS-CoV strains by RBD-induced antibodies remains unknown. Here, we constructed four recombinant RBD (rRBD) proteins with single or multiple mutations detected in representative human MERS-CoV strains from the 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 outbreaks, respectively, and one rRBD protein with multiple changes derived from camel MERS-CoV strains. Like the RBD of prototype EMC2012 (EMC-RBD), all five RBDs maintained good antigenicity and functionality, the ability to bind RBD-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and the DPP4 receptor, and high immunogenicity, able to elicit S-specific antibodies. They induced potent neutralizing antibodies cross-neutralizing 17 MERS pseudoviruses expressing S proteins of representative human and camel MERS-CoV strains identified during the 2012-2015 outbreaks, 5 MAb escape MERS-CoV mutants, and 2 live human MERS-CoV strains. We then constructed two RBDs mutated in multiple key residues in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of RBD and demonstrated their strong cross-reactivity with anti-EMC-RBD antibodies. These RBD mutants with diminished DPP4 binding also led to virus attenuation, suggesting that immunoevasion after RBD immunization is accompanied by loss of viral fitness. Therefore, this study demonstrates that MERS-CoV RBD is an important vaccine target able to induce highly potent and broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against infection by divergent circulating human and camel MERS-CoV strains. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV was first identified in June 2012 and has since spread in humans and camels. Mutations in its spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), a key vaccine target, have been identified, raising concerns over the efficacy of RBD-based MERS vaccines against circulating human and camel MERS-CoV strains. Here, we constructed five vaccine candidates, designated 2012-RBD, 2013-RBD, 2014-RBD, 2015-RBD, and Camel-RBD, containing single or multiple mutations in the RBD of representative human and camel MERS-CoV strains during the 2012-2015 outbreaks. These RBD-based vaccine candidates maintained good functionality, antigenicity, and immunogenicity, and they induced strong cross-neutralizing antibodies against infection by divergent pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV strains, as well as antibody escape MERS-CoV mutants. This study provides impetus for further development of a safe, highly effective, and broad-spectrum RBD-based subunit vaccine to prevent MERS-CoV infection.","Tai, Wanbo; Wang, Yufei; Fett, Craig A; Zhao, Guangyu; Li, Fang; Perlman, Stanley; Jiang, Shibo; Zhou, Yusen; Du, Lanying",Journal of virology,260,27

The metabolism of polydatin, geniposide, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin was significantly inhibited by one or several anti-coronavirus drugs of 100 μM around 1 h and 4 h (P<0.05), among which darunavir could strongly reduce the production of genipin (70.6% reduction), quercitin (80.6% reduction) and glycyrrhetinic acid (37.9% reduction), which may cause a high risk of herb-drug interactions (HDI). Additionally, chloroquine reduced the production of genipin and quercitin by more than 75% (P<0.05), whereas arbidol had no significant influence on the metabolism of polydatin, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin (P>0.05) so that its risk may be lower. The inhibition of darunavir on β-glucosidase was relatively strong (IC50 = 193±23 μM), and the inhibition became weaker on β-glucuronidase and α-rhamnosidase (IC50>500 μM). The consistency between gut microflora and glycosidase system indicated that the inhibition of darunavir on the activity of β-glucosidase and β-glucuronidase may be the main reason for affecting the metabolism of geniposide, glycyrrhizin and polydatin in gut microflora. However, for the inhibition of darunavir and chloroquine on the metabolism of quercetrin, there was no correlation between gut microflora and α-rhamnosidase system. Assessing the risk of HDI mediated by glycosidases in gut microflora may be conducive to the safety and efficacy of combining traditional herbal and Western medicine for the treatment of patients with Covid-19.","Dai, Tianming; Wang, Min; Wang, Pengzhen; Dai, Libing; Dai, Renke; Meng, Qingqi",Die Pharmazie,260,16

This article leverages an online survey of general practitioners' (GPs') attitudes toward the soon-to-be-available COVID-19 vaccines, implemented in October-November 2020 (before the COVID-19 vaccines were authorized in France), to study the evolution of the distribution of their demographic and professional characteristics and opinions about these vaccines, as the survey fieldwork progressed, as reminders were sent out to encourage them to participate. Focusing on the analysis of the potential determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, we also tested if factors related to survey participation biased the association estimates. Our results show that online surveys of health professionals may be subject to significant selection bias that can have a significant impact on estimates of the prevalence of some of these professionals' behavioral, opinion, or attitude variables. Our results also highlight the effectiveness of reminder strategies in reaching hard-to-reach professionals and reducing these biases. Finally, they indicate that weighting for nonparticipation remains indispensable and that methods exist for testing (and correcting) selection biases.","Verger, Pierre; Scronias, Dimitri; Fradier, Yves; Meziani, Malika; Ventelou, Bruno",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,260,5

In particular the early events causing ammonia-induced toxicity to astrocytes are not well understood. Using established cellular HE models, we show that mitochondria rapidly undergo fragmentation in a reversible manner upon hyperammonemia. Further, within a timescale of minutes mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis were hampered which occurred in a pH-independent manner. Using metabolomics an accumulation of numerous amino acids, including branched chain amino acids and glucose was observed. Metabolomic tracking of 15N-labeled ammonia showed rapid incorporation of 15N into glutamate and glutamate-derived amino acids. Downregulating human GLUD2, encoding mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase 2 (GDH2), inhibiting GDH2 activity by SIRT4 overexpression, and supplementing cells with glutamate or glutamine alleviated ammonia-induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Metabolomic tracking of 13C-glutamine showed that hyperammonemia can inhibit anaplerosis of TCA-cycle intermediates. Contrary to its classical anaplerotic role, we show that under hyperammonemia GDH2 rather catalyzes the removal of ammonia by reductive amination of α-ketoglutarate which efficiently and rapidly inhibits the TCA-cycle. Overall, we propose a critical GDH2-dependent mechanism in HE models that on the one hand helps to remove ammonia but on the other hand impairs energy metabolism in mitochondria rapidly.","Drews, Leonie; Zimmermann, Marcel; Westhoff, Philipp; Brilhaus, Dominik; Poss, Rebecca E; Bergmann, Laura; Wiek, Constanze; Brenneisen, Peter; Piekorz, Roland P; Mettler-Altmann, Tabea; Weber, Andreas P M; Reichert, Andreas S",Disease models & mechanisms,260,27

However, an increasing number of reports currently support videolaryngoscopy, particularly for novice users. The widespread use of videolaryngoscopy may be limited due to financial limitations, especially in low-income countries. Therefore, affordable single-use scopes are now becoming increasingly popular. We sought to compare these new scopes with direct laryngoscopes and the previously tested videolaryngoscopes in mannequins by novices. METHODS Fifty medical students were recruited to serve as novice users. Following brief, standardized training, students were asked to execute endotracheal intubation with each of the devices, including the Airtraq®, a custom-made videolaryngoscope, the King Vision®, the Macintosh laryngoscope and the VividTrac®, on an airway trainer (Laerdal Airway Management Trainer®) in normal and difficult airway scenarios. We evaluated the time to and the proportion of successful intubation, the best view of the glottis, esophageal intubation, dental trauma and user satisfaction. RESULTS We observed no differences in esophageal intubation. However, intubation-related times, the view of the glottis and operator satisfaction were significantly better throughout the study with the commercial videolaryngoscopes. In comparison, the custom-made videolaryngoscope performance proved to be similar to that of the Macintosh laryngoscope. The VividTrac® performance was similar (P > 0.05) or significantly better than that of the King Vision® in both scenarios. CONCLUSIONS Based upon our results, the Airtraq®, King Vision® and VividTrac® were superior to the Macintosh laryngscope in both normal and difficult airway scencarios for novice users. In particular, our study is the first to report that the VividTrac® shows promise for further clinical evaluation.","Rendeki, Szilárd; Keresztes, Dóra; Woth, Gábor; Mérei, Ákos; Rozanovic, Martin; Rendeki, Mátyás; Farkas, József; Mühl, Diána; Nagy, Bálint",BMC anesthesiology,260,26

The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the 8-week lockdown on endurance capacity of elite male handball players. METHODS Ten male athletes (192±8 cm and 96±6 kg) from the first German handball league participated in the study. The effects of training on shuttle run tests between period 1 (P1: preseason to mid-season) and period 2 (P2: mid-season to time after lockdown) were compared. The maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) was assessed using an incremental exercise test (IET) (July 2019 and May 2020). RESULTS During the COVID-19 lockdown, the athletes completed an instructed home-based strength and endurance program (52/48). The training effects were found to be reduced after the 8-weeks of COVID-19 lockdown (period 2) as compared to period 1 (mean difference 249±248 m, p=0.005). There was no significant difference in the running distance (2358±430 m vs. 2400±362 m, respectively, p=0.70) after the lockdown as compared to the pre-seasonal performance. VO2max (46.6±5.1 vs. 49.4±7.0 ml/kg/min, respectively, p=0.12) and the power output (3.13±0.36 vs. 3.13±0.43 W/kg, respectively, p=1.0) also did not differ between preseason and after COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 lockdown led to a reduction in endurance capacity of elite handball players without team training, despite a home-based strength and endurance program. Supervision of individual home-based training is highly recommended to avoid inadequate implementation of the training.","Fikenzer, Sven; Fikenzer, Kati; Laufs, Ulrich; Falz, Roberto; Pietrek, Hagen; Hepp, Pierre",The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,260,1

Multiple etiologies have been proposed, including delayed diagnosis and treatment. Guidelines recommend ruling out malignancy in men and women presenting with hematuria. This study sought to determine the difference in timing from presentation with hematuria to diagnosis of bladder cancer in women versus men. METHODS This is a retrospective population-based study examining the timing from presentation with hematuria to diagnosis of bladder cancer, based on data from the MarketScan databases, which include enrollees of more than 100 health insurance plans of approximately 40 large US employers from 2004 through 2010. All study patients presented with hematuria and were subsequently diagnosed with bladder cancer. The primary outcome measure was number of days between initial presentation with hematuria and diagnosis of bladder cancer by sex. RESULTS A total of 5416 men and 2233 women met inclusion criteria. Mean days from initial hematuria claim to bladder cancer claim was significantly longer in women (85.4 versus 73.6 days, P < .001), and the proportion of women with >6 month delay in bladder cancer diagnosis was significantly higher (17.3% versus 14.1%, P < .001). Women were more likely to be diagnosed with urinary tract infection (odds ratio = 2.32, 95% confidence interval = 2.07-2.59) and less likely to undergo abdominal or pelvic imaging (odds ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval = 0.71-0.89). CONCLUSIONS Both men and women experience significant delays between presentation with hematuria and diagnosis of bladder cancer, with longer delays for women.

The objective of this large cohort study is to compare outcomes between patients undergoing TEP or TAPP. METHODS Based on prospective data of the Swiss association of laparoscopic and thoracoscopic surgery, all patients undergoing unilateral TEP or TAPP between 1995 and 2006 were included. The following outcomes were compared: conversion rates, intraoperative and postoperative complications, duration of operation. RESULTS Data on 4,552 patients undergoing TEP (n=3,457) and TAPP (n=1,095) were collected prospectively. Average age and American Society of Anesthesiologists score were similar in the two groups. Patients undergoing TEP had a significantly higher rate of intraoperative complications (TEP 1.9% vs. TAPP 0.9%, p=0.029) and surgical postoperative complications (TEP: 2.3% vs. TAPP: 0.8%, p=0.003). The postoperative length of stay was longer for patients undergoing TAPP (2.9 vs. 2.3 days, p=0.002), whereas the duration of the operation was longer for TEP (66.6 vs. 59.0 min, p<0.001) and the conversion rate was higher (TEP 1.0% vs. TAPP 0.2%, p=0.011). CONCLUSIONS This study is one of the first population-based analyses comparing TEP and TAPP in a prospective cohort of more than 4,500 patients. Intraoperative and surgical postoperative complications were significantly higher in patients undergoing TEP. TEP is also associated with longer operating times and higher conversion rates. Therefore, on a population-based level, the TAPP technique appears to be superior to the TEP repair in patients undergoing unilateral inguinal hernia repair.","Gass, Markus; Banz, Vanessa M; Rosella, Laura; Adamina, Michel; Candinas, Daniel; Güller, Ulrich",World journal of surgery,260,1

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection induces villus injury and impairs digestive function. Moreover, the infection might comprise localized innate mucosal immunity. This study investigated specific enterocyte subtypes and innate immune components of weaned pigs during PEDV infection. Four-week-old pigs were orally inoculated with PEDV IN19338 strain (n = 40) or sham-inoculated (n = 24). At day post inoculation (DPI) 2, 4, and 6, lysozyme expression in Paneth cells, cellular density of villous and Peyer's patch microfold (M) cells, and the expression of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) were assessed in the jejunum and ileum by immunohistochemistry, and interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured in the jejunum by ELISA. PEDV infection led to a decrease in the ratios of villus height to crypt depth (VH-CD) in jejunum at DPI 2, 4, and 6 and in ileum at DPI 4. The number of villous M cells was reduced in jejunum at DPI 4 and 6 and in ileum at DPI 6, while the number of Peyer's patch M cells in ileum increased at DPI 2 and then decreased at DPI 6. PEDV-infected pigs also had reduced lysozyme expression in ileal Paneth cells at DPI 2 and increased ileal pIgR expression at DPI 4. There were no significant changes in IL-1β and TNF-α expression in PEDV-infected pigs compared to controls. In conclusion, PEDV infection affected innate mucosal immunity of weaned pigs through alterations in Paneth cells, villous and Peyer's patch M cells, and pIgR expression.","Chen, Ya-Mei; Helm, Emma T; Gabler, Nicholas; Hostetter, Jesse M; Burrough, Eric R",Veterinary pathology,260,28

Dosed once-daily, such analogues can provide a more stable glucose-lowering action, which translates clinically into a reduced risk of hypoglycemia. Insulin degludec (degludec) became available in Canada in 2017 and is the first basal insulin analogue to have a half-life exceeding the dosing interval. As well as offering the promise of an exceptionally flat PK/PD profile when at steady state, this characteristic means that insulin degludec can be dosed with some flexibility with regard to time of day and that it need not be taken at the same time each day. However, the approximately 25-h half-life also has some implications concerning dose titration. This article provides an up-to-date review of the study data describing the clinical profile of degludec, and aims to give helpful and practical advice to prescribers about its use. While the clinical benefits of degludec are described, it is also acknowledged that further study is required to better understand how its clinical performance compares with that of insulin glargine 300 units/mL.","Woo, Vincent; Berard, Lori; Roscoe, Robert","Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders",260,12

Social norms dictate appropriate behaviour and judgement on others in response to their previous actions and reputation. Recently, the so-called leading eight norms have been identified from many potential social norms that can sustain cooperation through a reputation-based indirect reciprocity mechanism. Despite indirect reciprocity being claimed to extend direct reciprocity in larger populations where direct experiences cannot be accumulated, the success of social norms have been analysed in models with global information and evolution. This study is the first to analyse the leading eight norms with local information and evolution. We find that the leading eight are robust against selfish players within most scenarios and can maintain a high level of cooperation also with local information and evolution. In fact, local evolution sustains cooperation under a wider set of conditions than global evolution, while local reputation does not hinder cooperation compared to global reputation. Four of the leading eight norms that do not reward justified defection offer better chances for cooperation with quick evolution, reputation with noise, larger networks, and when unconditional defectors enter the population.","Podder, Shirsendu; Righi, Simone; Takács, Károly",Scientific reports,260,16

The method achieves focal endothelial-selective transgenesis, thereby allowing an investigator to determine the biological roles of endothelial-expressed transgenes and to quantify the in vivo transcriptional activity of DNA sequences in large artery endothelial cells. The method uses surgical isolation of rabbit common carotid arteries and an arteriotomy to deliver a transgene-expressing viral vector into the arterial lumen. A short incubation period of the vector in the lumen, with subsequent aspiration of the lumen contents, is sufficient to achieve efficient and durable expression of the transgene in the endothelium, with no detectable transduction or expression outside of the isolated arterial segment. The method allows assessment of the biological activities of transgene products both in normal arteries and in models of human vascular disease, while avoiding systemic effects that could be caused either by targeting gene delivery to other sites (e.g. the liver) or by the alternative approach of delivering genetic constructs to the endothelium by germ line transgenesis. Application of the method is limited by the need for a skilled surgeon and anesthetist, a well-equipped operating room, the costs of purchasing and housing rabbits, and the need for expertise in gene-transfer vector construction and use. Results obtained with this method include: transgene-related alterations in arterial structure, cellularity, extracellular matrix, or vasomotor function; increases or reductions in arterial inflammation; alterations in vascular cell apoptosis; and progression, retardation, or regression of diseases such as intimal hyperplasia or atherosclerosis. The method also allows measurement of the ability of native and synthetic DNA regulatory sequences to alter transgene expression in endothelial cells, providing results that include: levels of transgene mRNA, levels of transgene protein, and levels of transgene enzymatic activity.","Wacker, Bradley K; Bi, Lianxiang; Dichek, David A",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,260,31

This study sought to determine the relationship between H. pylori infection and development of marginal ulceration following bariatric surgery in a nationwide analysis. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study using the 2012 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Discharges with ICD-9-CM code indicating marginal ulceration and a secondary ICD-9-CM code for bariatric surgery were included. Primary outcome was incidence of marginal ulceration. A stepwise forward selection model was used to build the multivariate logistic regression model based on known risk factors. A P value of 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS There were 253,765 patients who met inclusion criteria. Prevalence of marginal ulceration was 3.90%. Of those patients found to have marginal ulceration, 31.20% of patients were H. pylori-positive. Final multivariate regression analysis revealed that H. pylori was the strongest independent predictor of marginal ulceration. CONCLUSIONS H. pylori is an independent predictor of marginal ulceration using a large national database.

However, children vary in their susceptibility to parenting behaviors, and the neurobiological underpinnings of this susceptibility are poorly understood. In a prospective longitudinal study, we examined whether neonatal total brain volume (TBV) and subregions of interest (i.e., hippocampus (HC) and anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG)) moderate the association between maternal sensitivity and cognitive/EF development across early childhood. Neonates underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Their cognitive performance and EF was characterized at 2.0 ± 0.1 years (N = 53) and at 4.9 ± 0.8 years (N = 36) of age. Maternal sensitivity was coded based on observation of a standardized play situation at 6-mo postpartum. Neonatal TBV moderated the association between maternal sensitivity and 2-year working memory as well as all 5-year cognitive outcomes, suggesting that the positive association between maternal sensitivity and child cognition was observed only among children with large or average but not small TBV as neonates. Similar patterns were observed for TBV-corrected HC and ACG volumes. The findings suggest that larger neonatal TBV, HC and ACG may underlie susceptibility to the environment and affect the degree to which parenting quality shapes long-term cognitive development.","Nolvi, Saara; Rasmussen, Jerod M; Graham, Alice M; Gilmore, John H; Styner, Martin; Fair, Damien A; Entringer, Sonja; Wadhwa, Pathik D; Buss, Claudia",Developmental cognitive neuroscience,260,5

While ACE2 has been identified as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses, the mechanism underlying cell entry remains unknown. Human immunodeficiency virus infects target cells via CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, CXCR4 interacts with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (CD26/DPPIV), an enzyme that cleaves CXCL12/SDF-1, which is the chemokine that activates this receptor. By analogy, we hypothesized that ACE2 might also be capable of interactions with RAS-associated G-protein coupled receptors. Using resonance energy transfer and cAMP and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling assays, we found that human ACE2 interacts with RAS-related receptors, namely the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R), and the MAS1 oncogene receptor (MasR). Although these interactions led to various alterations of signal transduction, but, more importantly, ligand binding to AT1R resulted in the downregulation of ACE2 cell surface expression, while ligand binding to AT2R, but not to MasR, resulted in upregulation of ACE2 cell surface expression. Proximity ligation assays performed in situ revealed macromolecular complexes containing ACE2 and AT1R, AT2R or MasR in adult but not fetal mouse lung tissue. These findings highlight the relevance of RAS in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the role of ACE2-containing complexes as potential therapeutic targets.","Franco, R.; Lillo, A.; Rivas-Santisteban, R.; Rodriguez-Perez, A.

Design: Cohort study. Setting: UK Biobank data were collected from 22 centres across the UK. Participants: Only white British individuals free of Alzheimer's or dementia diseases were included in the study, where 336517 participants had quality-controlled genetic data, and 18879 participants had qualified brain MRI data. Main outcome measures: Grey matter volume, intake of cereal and coffee, body mass index and blood cholesterol level. Results: We investigated diet effects in the UK Biobank data and discovered anti-correlated brain-wide grey matter volume (GMV)-association patterns between coffee and cereal intake, coincidence with their anti-correlated genetic constructs. These genetic factors may further affect people's lifestyle habits and body/blood fat levels through the mediation of cereal/coffee intake, and the brain-wide expression pattern of gene CPLX3, a dedicated marker of subplate neurons that regulate cortical development and plasticity, may underlie the shared GMV-association patterns among the coffee/cereal intake and cognitive functions.

Rapid, accurate diagnosis and genotyping of emerging pathogens during early-suspected disease cases is critical to facilitate timely response to deploy adequate control measures and prevent or reduce spread. Currently, most laboratories use PCR to amplify partial pathogen genomic regions, occasionally combined with sequencing of PCR amplicon(s) using conventional Sanger sequencing services for confirmatory diagnosis. The main limitation of this approach is the lengthy turnaround time. Here, we report an innovative approach using a previously developed specific PCR assay for pathogen diagnosis combined with a new Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)-based amplicon sequencing method for pathogen genotyping. Using fish clinical samples, we applied this approach for the rapid confirmation of PCR amplicon sequences identity and genotyping of tilapia lake virus (TiLV), a disease-causing virus affecting tilapia aquaculture globally. The consensus sequences obtained after polishing exhibit strikingly high identity to references derived by Illumina and Sanger methods (99.83-100%).

Given deep learning is an effective tool and framework for image analysis, there have been lots of studies for COVID-19 case detection by training deep learning models with X-ray images. Although some of them report good prediction results, their proposed deep learning models might suffer from overfitting, high variance, and generalization errors caused by noise and a limited number of datasets. Considering ensemble learning can overcome the shortcomings of deep learning by making predictions with multiple models instead of a single model, we propose EDL-COVID, an ensemble deep learning model employing deep learning and ensemble learning. The EDL-COVID model is generated by combining multiple snapshot models of COVID-Net, which has pioneered in an open-sourced COVID-19 case detection method with deep neural network processed chest X-ray images, by employing a proposed weighted averaging ensembling method that is aware of different sensitivities of deep learning models on different classes types. Experimental results show that EDL-COVID offers promising results for COVID-19 case detection with an accuracy of 95%, better than COVID-Net of 93.3%.","Tang, S. J.; Wang, C. J.; Nie, J.

Since the pandemic’s start, we have observed compounded health, social, and economic impacts for communities of color, fueled in part by profound residential segregation in the United States that, for centuries prior to the pandemic, created differences in access to opportunity and resources. Based on a longitudinal cohort of Black residents living in two racially isolated Pittsburgh neighborhoods, we sought to: 1) describe the experiences of behavioral responses to COVID-19 conditions (e.g., closures of businesses, schools, government offices) and illness experiences reported by residents within these disinvested, urban areas and 2) determine if these experiences were associated with perceptions of risk, negative mental health outcomes, and food insecurity; and 3) examine whether any of the associations were explained by social isolation or modified by neighborhood walkability. We found direct associations between residents’ experience with COVID-19-related closures and with the illness, with perceived risk, and change in psychological distress, sleep quality, and food insecurity from pre-COVID-19 levels. Social isolation was a statistically significant mediator of all of these associations, most strongly mediating the pathway to psychological distress. We found neighborhood walkability to be a significant moderator of the association between closure experiences and sleep quality. The results suggest that experiences of COVID-19 closures and illness were associated with serious threats to public health in Black, disinvested, urban neighborhoods, beyond those caused directly by the virus. Outcomes of the pandemic appear very much dependent on the extent to which social and physical resources are available to meet the demands of stress.","Finucane, Melissa L.; Beckman, Robin; Ghosh-Dastidar, Madhumita; Dubowitz, Tamara; Collins, Rebecca L.; Troxel, Wendy",Landscape and Urban Planning,260,26

METHODS: The official data for COVID-19, from March 2020 to March 2021 in the states of the Northeast Region (NE), were used. The analysis of capital cities and states for accumulated weekly cases and confirmed deaths was made using the JoinPoint Trend Analysis application. RESULTS: In one year, the Northeast region reported 22.9% of the cases and 21.5% of the deaths in the country due to C OVID-19. At the beginning of the pandemic, all states showed a growing number of cases, first in the capitals and then in the interior. Following this wave, decreases are observed in all states and their capitals, but with many still reporting a large number of cases. In the middle of the 2nd semester of 2020 the number of cases begins to increase again simultaneously in states and their capitals-some at explosive speed-especially in late 2020 and early 2021. A similar pattern is observed in deaths, which exceed or approach the peak seen in the first wave. In the first wave, all capitals and northeastern states adopted intense isolation measures. Fortaleza, Recife and Teresina reached the highest isolation index of all capitals, close to 0.60. This index decreases, with a slight growth trend until the end of December. With the exception of Fortaleza and Salvador, the other capitals fell to less than 0.40. CONCLUSION: The Brazilian NE and the country are in increasingly complicated health, social and economic situations. It is necessary to speed up vaccinations and maintain nonpharmacological measures: face masks, social distancing measures and hygiene care, in addition to policies to protect workers who have lost their incomes and to subsidize small business owners.","Kerr, Lrfs Kendall C.; de Almeida, R.

The photosensitive polymer in the resin mixture plays a vital role in dispersing ceramic powders and supporting complex structures cured by ultraviolet (UV) laser. The fabricated BaTiO3 and photopolymer composite part shows homogeneous dispersion of BaTiO3 microparticles. With a controlled thermal treatment, the photopolymer was carefully removed from the composite during the debinding process. Further sintering of the debinded ceramic parts at 1100 ℃, 1200 ℃, and 1300 °C shows a huge-volume shrinkage of up to 98.25% at a low concentration of ceramic powders (10 wt%). The sintered BaTiO3 ceramic parts are structurally intact with SEM images showing uniform microstructures with a relative density of 73.48%. The ultra-high shrinkage rate in this process provides a way to create complex 3D ceramic scaffolds with higher resolution than the SLA printing resolution. With the success of sintering ultralow solid loading ceramic-polymer composites, low-cost SLA 3D printers could be used to manufacture various ceramic parts with an improved resolution. This process allows widely application of 3D printed ceramics parts in the area of biomedical, aerospace, automotive, and energy fields.","Gao, Yuqi; Ding, Junjun",Procedia Manufacturing,260,20

Design: We evaluated 2,731 non-T2D participants recruited between 2008-2013 in the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study, China. T2D cases were identified with clinical and biochemical information collected at follow-up visits. Using stool samples collected during the follow-up in the subset (n=1,591), 16S rRNA profiling was conducted. Using multivariable-adjusted Poisson or linear regression, we examined associations of erythrocyte n-6 PUFA biomarkers with incident T2D, and diversity and composition of gut microbiota. Results: Over 6.2 years of follow-up, 276 T2D cases were identified (risk=0.10). Higher levels of erythrocyte {gamma}-linolenic acid (GLA), but not linoleic or arachidonic acid, were associated with higher T2D incidence. Comparing the top to the bottom quartile groups of GLA levels, relative risk was 1.72 (95% confidence intervals: 1.21, 2.44) adjusted for potential confounders. Baseline GLA was inversely associated with gut microbial richness and diversity (-diversity, both p<0.05) during follow-up, and significantly associated with microbiota {beta}-diversity (p=0.002). Seven genera ( Butyrivibrio, Blautia, Oscillospira, Odoribacter, S24-7 other, Rikenellaceae other, and Clostridiales other) were enriched in quartile 1 of GLA, and in participants without T2D. Conclusion: Relative concentrations of erythrocyte GLA were positively associated with incident T2D in a Chinese population and also with gut microbial profiles. These results highlight that gut microbiota may play an important role linking n-6 PUFA metabolism and T2D etiology.","Miao, Z.; Lin, J.-s.; Mao, Y.; Chen, G.-d.; Zeng, F.-f.; Dong, H.-l.; Jiang, Z.; Wang, J.; Xiao, C.; Shuai, M.; Gou, W.; Fu, Y.; Imamura, F.; Chen, Y.-m.; Zheng, J.-S.",,260,13

The virus started spreading over the world. Most of the governments have taken different measures to prevent the outbreak. Social distancing (SD) is one of the effective solutions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, in which people should maintain a specific distance between each other. This paper aims to provide a YOLOv4-based model for monitoring social distancing. The model begins by taking a video/picture as input and generating warnings of SD violation. The YOLOv4 we used in this model detects pedestrian’s people in public places such as streets, malls, train stations, and universities based on deep learning techniques. The model uses a predefined SD threshold (SDTH) and a violation index (VI) to determine when the violation occurs and trigger a warning sub-system to make an awareness action immediately. A comprehensive investigation and discussion on the existing literature of SD, object detection methods, and SD monitoring have also been provided in this paper. The model provided is supposed to operate continuously in the targeted places to monitor people, thus reducing the impact of COVID-19 spread. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Shareef, A.

IBM muscle biopsies exhibit nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 in muscle cells, a pathologic finding observed initially in neurodegenerative disease, and nuclear loss of TDP-43 in neurons causes aberrant RNA splicing. Here, we show that loss of TDP-43 splicing repression, as determined by inclusion of cryptic exons, occurs in skeletal muscle of IBM patients. Out of 119 muscle biopsies tested, RT-PCR-mediated detection of cryptic exon expression is 84% sensitive and 99% specific for diagnosing IBM, indicating utility as a functional and diagnostic biomarker. To determine the role of T cells in pathogenesis, we generated a novel xenograft model by transplanting human IBM muscle into the hindlimb of immunodeficient mice. Xenografts from IBM patients display robust regeneration of human myofibers and recapitulate both inflammatory and degenerative features of the disease. Myofibers in IBM xenografts are invaded by human, oligoclonal CD8+ T cells and exhibit MHC-I upregulation, rimmed vacuoles, mitochondrial pathology, p62-positive inclusions, and nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43, resulting in expression of cryptic exons. Depletion of human T cells within IBM xenografts by treating mice intraperitoneally with anti-CD3 (OKT3) suppresses MHC-I upregulation, but rimmed vacuoles and loss of TDP-43 function persist. These data suggest that myofiber degeneration occurs independent of T cells, and muscle cell-intrinsic mechanisms, such as loss of TDP-43 splicing repression, drive IBM pathogenesis. One Sentence Summary Depletion of T cells in a xenograft model of sporadic inclusion body myositis suppresses inflammation but not TDP-43 pathology or muscle degeneration.","Britson, Kyla A.; Ling, Jonathan P.; Braunstein, Kerstin E.; Montagne, Janelle M.; Kastenschmidt, Jenna M.; Wilson, Andrew; Ikenaga, Chiseko; Tsao, William; Pinal-Fernandez, Iago; Russel, Katelyn A.; Reed, Nicole; Wagner, Kathryn R.; Ostrow, Lyle W.; Corse, Andrea M.; Mammen, Andrew L.; Villalta, S.

A globally aging population means that an increasing proportion of patients have a susceptible constitution, and the frequent occurrence of severe infectious diseases has also led to an increase in the cost of prevention and control of NI. Medical buildings' spatial environment design for the prevention of NI has been a hot subject of considerable research, but few previous studies have summarized the design criteria for a medical building environment to control the risk of NI. Thus, there is no suitable evaluation framework to determine whether the spatial environment of a medical building is capable of inhibiting the spread of NI. In the context of the global spread of COVID-19, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the existing medical building environment in terms of inhibiting the spread of NI and to verify current environmental improvement strategies for the efficient and rational use of resources. This study determines the key design elements for the spatial environment of medical buildings, constructs an evaluation framework using exploratory factor analysis, verifies the complex dominant influence relationship, and prioritizes criteria in the evaluation framework using the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory- (DEMATEL-) based analytical network process (ANP) (DANP). Using representative real cases, this study uses the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to evaluate and analyze the performance with the aspiration level of reducing the NI risk. A continuous and systematic transformation design strategy for these real cases is proposed. The main contributions of this study include the following: (1) it creates a systematic framework that allows hospital decision-makers to evaluate the spatial environment of medical buildings;(2) it provides a reference for making design decisions to improve the current situation using the results of a performance evaluation;(3) it draws an influential network relation map (INRM) and the training of influence weights (IWs) for criteria. The sources of practical problems can be identified by the proposed evaluation framework, and the corresponding strategy can be proposed to avoid the waste of resources for the prevention of epidemics.","Xiong, L.; Sheng, G.; Fan, Z.

A possible worldwide sovereign debt crisis could emerge, in short term, for supply chains blockage due to its slowing-down in many countries. China, having the second largest economy in the world, is crucial for the stability and sustainability of the economic recovery. China endures a long-term growth since 2000;nevertheless, a large amount of that growth is contributed by the government debt, which was spent on infrastructures. The accumulation of debts is a potential risk to the future growth of China. This research evaluates the central government and local government debts with a series of indicators. The weights of indicators are determined by objective methods of the CRITIC approach. Results confirm that the central government debt of China is on the edge of risk, while the risk of local governments debt is already in a concerning danger. The local government risk is 50% higher than the central government's risk. Moreover, the K-means clustering algorithm performed on data, collected from various provinces, suggests that the local government debts of China follow a pattern of geographical distribution;that is, the closer to the coast, the lesser the risk, which is in accordance with the pattern of labor flowing. Labors are attracted by job opportunities which lie in the well-developed regions of China. This is confirmed by the crosscheck with the wage growth data. This indicates that the less developed areas of China rely more heavily on debt-investment stimulation that could be of a potential stagnation because the yield of investment follows diminishing marginal returns and the relative lacking labor weakens the potential economic growth.","Ouyang, T.

Quantifying the risk of mortality is challenging because of high relative prevalence of asymptomatic and non-specific disease manifestations. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between CYP who have died of SARS-CoV-2 and those who have died of an alternative disease process but coincidentally tested positive. Methods During the pandemic, the mandatory National Child Mortality Database (NCMD) was linked to Public Health England (PHE) testing data to identify CYP (<18 years) who died with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. A clinical review of all deaths from March 2020 to February 2021 was undertaken to differentiate between those who died of SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who died of an alternative cause but coincidentally tested positive. Then, using linkage to national hospital admission data, demographic and comorbidity details of CYP who died of SARS-CoV-2 were compared to all other deaths. Absolute risk of death was estimated where denominator data were available. Findings 3105 CYP died from all causes during the first pandemic year in England. 61 of these deaths occurred in CYP who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 25 CYP died of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 22 from acute infection and three from PIMS-TS. 99.995% of CYP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test survived. The 25 CYP who died of SARS-CoV-2 equates to a mortality rate of 2/million for the 12,023,568 CYP living in England. CYP >10 years, of Asian and Black ethnic backgrounds, and with comorbidities were over-represented compared to other children. Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 is very rarely fatal in CYP, even among those with underlying comorbidities. These findings are important to guide families, clinicians and policy makers about future shielding and vaccination.","Smith, C.; Odd, D.; Harwood, R.; Ward, J.; Linney, M.; Clark, M.; Hargreaves, D.; Ladhani, S.

However, the genetic factors that underlie this variability are not well characterized. We used VirScan, a high-throughput viral epitope scanning technology, to analyze the antibody binding specificities of twins and SNP-genotyped individuals. These data were used to estimate the heritability and identify genomic loci associated with antibody epitope selection, response breadth, and the control of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) viral load. We identified 4 epitopes of EBV that were heritably targeted, and at least two EBNA-2 binding specificities that were associated with variants in the MHC class-II locus. We identified an EBV serosignature that predicted viral load in white blood cells and was associated with genetic variants in the MHC class-I locus. Our study provides a new framework for identifying genes important for pathogen immunity, with specific implications for the genetic architecture of EBV humoral responses and the control of viral load.","Venkataraman, Thiagarajan; Valencia, Cristian; Mangino, Massimo; Morgenlander, William; Clipman, Steven J.; Liechti, Thomas; Valencia, Ana; Christofidou, Paraskevi; Spector, Tim; Roederer, Mario; Duggal, Priya; Larman, H.

A few small molecule inhibitors of 3CLpro are in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments and more inhibitors are being developed. One limiting factor for 3CLpro inhibitors development is that the cellular activities of such inhibitors have to be evaluated in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) or BSL-4 laboratory. Here, we design genetically encoded biosensors that can be used in BSL-2 laboratories to set up cell-based assays for 3CLpro inhibitor discovery. The biosensors were constructed by linking a green fluorescent protein (GFP2) to the N-terminus and a Renilla luciferase (RLuc8) to the C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, with the linkers derived from the cleavage sequences of 3CLpro. After over-expression of the biosensors in HEK293 cells, 3CLpro can be released from GFP2 and RLuc by self-cleavage, resulting in a decrease of the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) signal. Using one of these biosensors, pBRET-10, we evaluated the cellular activities of several 3CLpro inhibitors. These inhibitors restored the BRET signal by blocking the proteolysis of pBRET-10, and their relative activities measured using pBRET-10 were consistent with their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities reported previously. We conclude that the biosensor pBRET-10 is a useful tool for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor discovery. Furthermore, our strategy can be used to design biosensors for other viral proteases that share the same activation mechanism as 3CLpro, such as HIV protease PR and HCV protease NS3. Highlights Sensitive cell-based biosensors for 3CLpro inhibitor discovery in BSL-2 laboratories. The BRET-based self-cleaving biosensors mimic the in vivo autoproteolytic activation of 3CLpro. Similar biosensors can be designed for other self-cleaving proteases, such as HIV protease PR and HCV protease NS3.","Hou, Ningke; Peng, Chen; Zhang, Lijing; Zhu, Yuyao; Hu, Qi",bioRxiv,260,26

Here we evaluate modifications observed in pediatric healthcare activity during the SoA. Study design Descriptive retrospective observational study of the hospital pediatric activity. Method We compared the use of pediatric healthcare services during the SoA (March 11th – June 25th, 2020) versus the use during the equivalent periods of years 2018 and 2019, in the “Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular Materno Infantil de Canarias” (Mother and Child University Hospital of the Canary Islands). Results The number of patients visiting the pediatric ED decreased by 66.75% on average (95%CI: -65.6;- 67.7;p &lt;0.001), with a peak reduction (70.4%;95%CI: -69.0;-71.7;p &lt;0.001) during the lockdown.

Various factors could explain this trend, including changes in demographic characteristics of infected persons, and the improvement of case management. To date, no study has been performed to investigate the evolution of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in Switzerland, while also accounting for risk factors. Methods: We investigated the trends in COVID-19 related mortality (in-hospital and in-intermediate/intensive-care) over time in Switzerland, from February 2020 to May 2021, comparing in particular the first and the second wave. We used data from the COVID-19 Hospital-based Surveillance (CH-SUR) database. We performed survival analyses adjusting for well-known risk factors of COVID-19 mortality (age, sex and comorbidities) and accounting for competing risk. Results: Our analysis included 16,030 episodes recorded in CH-SUR, with 2,320 reported deaths due to COVID-19 (13.0% of included episodes). We found that overall in-hospital mortality was lower during the second wave of COVID-19 compared to the first wave (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.69 - 0.72, p-value < 0.001), a decrease apparently not explained by changes in demographic characteristics of patients. In contrast, mortality in intermediate and intensive care significantly increased in the second wave compared to the first wave (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.42 - 1.55, p-value < 0.001), with significant changes in the course of hospitalisation between the first and the second wave. Conclusion: We found that, in Switzerland, COVID-19 mortality decreased among hospitalised persons, whereas it increased among patients admitted to intermediate or intensive care, when comparing the second wave to the first wave. We put our findings in perspective with changes over time in case management, treatment strategy, hospital burden and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Further analyses of the potential effect of virus variants and of vaccination on mortality would be crucial to have a complete overview of COVID-19 mortality trends throughout the different phases of the pandemic.","Roelens, M.; Martin, A.; Friker, B.; Maximiano Sousa, F.; Thiabaud, A.; Vidondo, B.; Buchter, V.; Gardiol, C.; Vonlanthen, J.; Balmelli, C.; Battegay, M.; Berger, C.; Buettcher, M.; Cusini, A.; Flury, D.; Heininger, U.; Niederer-Loher, A.; Riedel, T.; Schreiber, P.

METHODS To retrospectively study the clinical characteristics of 5 cases with SARS and chest X ray changes after discontinuation of glucocorticosteroids. RESULTS 5 cases were medical workers and had exposure to SARS patients. The incubation periods were 2 to 7 days. They had high fever from the onset of the disease. There were lung infiltrates 1 to 6 days after fever and then methylprednisolone was given to them. Two or three days after glucocorticosteroids treatment, clinical symptoms in these patients were disappeared. The clinical symptoms in case 1, cases 2, case 4 and case 5 weren't deteriorated after discontinuation of methylprednisolone while the presentation in chest X ray was progressed 3-6 days later. No more methylprednisolone was given to the patients and the infiltrates in chest X ray was gradually absorbed in 5-11 days. The temperature in case 3 was elevated again and the shadow in chest X ray was progressed after discontinuation of methylprednisolone due to the low dosage of glucocorticosteroids. When the dosage of methylprednisolone was increased, the temperature tended to be normal and the lung infiltrates began to absorb gradually. CONCLUSION For the patients with non-severe SARS, if the symptoms were disappeared after discontinuation of glucocorticosteroids, the lung shadow may be progressed. we can closely observe the condition of the disease and no more glucocortisteroids needed to be given to the patients. The lung shadow could be absorbed gradually.","Yao, Wanzhen; Chen, Yahong; Zhang, Liqiang; Wang, Xiaohong; Sun, Yongchang; Sun, Wei; Han, Jiangli; Zhang, Fuchun; Zheng, Yaan; Sun, Bozhang; He, Bei; Zhao, Mingwu",Beijing da xue xue bao.

Infection of primary cells derived from the central nervous system (CNS) and liver was examined to analyze the interaction of virus with individual cell types derived from the two principal sites of viral replication in vivo. In glial cell cultures derived from C57BL/6 mice, MHV-A59 produces a productive but nonlytic infection, with no evidence of cell-to-cell fusion. In contrast, in continuously cultured cells, this virus produces a lytic infection with extensive formation of syncytia. The observation of few and delayed syncytia following MHV-A59 infection of hepatocytes more closely resembles infection of glial cells than that of continuously cultured cell lines. For MHV-A59, lack of syncytium formation correlates with lack of cleavage of the fusion glycoprotein, or spike (S) protein. The absence of cell-to-cell fusion following infection of both primary cell types prompted us to examine the cleavage of the spike protein. Cleavage of S protein was below the level of detection by Western blot analysis in MHV-A59-infected hepatocytes and glial cells. Furthermore, no cleavage of this protein was detected in liver homogenates from C57BL/6 mice infected with MHV-A59. Thus, cleavage of the spike protein does not seem to be essential for entry and spread of the virus in vivo, as well as for replication in vitro.","Hingley, S T; Leparc-Goffart, I; Weiss, S R",Journal of virology,260,16

Little evidence exists for how infection control measures impact on the provision of cancer services, or how patient experience would be affected. Our aim was to compare patient satisfaction with doctor-patient interaction, during and following a period of infection control measures. METHODS We measured patient satisfaction using a validated 29-question instrument for two weeks during the implementation of strict infection control measures as a result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak (T1), and compared results with a two-week period after measures had been lifted (T2). RESULTS A total of 296 patients were surveyed, 149 at T1 and 147 at T2. Most patients indicated overall satisfaction, with 92.3 percent and 86.9 percent satisfied at T1 and T2, respectively (p-value is not significant). Mean satisfaction index was 3.02 and 3.04 out of 4 at T1 and T2, respectively (p-value is not significant). However, the responses for several individual questions did differ significantly between time points. At T1 more patients indicated satisfaction for understanding the doctor's plans (p-value is 0.001), while at T2, more patients indicated satisfaction for being told how to care for their condition (p-value is 0.04). CONCLUSION The study demonstrated high patient satisfaction at both time points. Similar levels of satisfaction despite infection control measures may be due to patients being more tolerant of problems in doctor-patient interactions during the outbreak due to media campaigns. This research may facilitate those healthcare services planning to minimise the impact of infection control measures on patient care.","Shakespeare, T P; Tang, J I; Shen, L; Lu, J J; Mukherjee, R K; Lee, K M; Wynne, C J; Back, M F",Singapore medical journal,260,28

This review emphasizes the virus-receptor interactions of human immunodeficiency virus, the rhinoviruses, the herpesviruses, and the coronaviruses. These interactions are often found to be complex and dynamic, involving multiple sites or factors on both the virus and the host cell. Also, the receptor may play an important role in virus entry per se in addition to its role in virus binding. In the cases of human immunodeficiency virus and the rhinoviruses, ingenious approaches to therapeutic strategies based on inhibiting virus attachment and entry are under development and in clinical trials.","Norkin, L C",Clinical microbiology reviews,260,1

METHODS Initial chest radiographs of 79 patients, 15 to 69 years old (mean age 34.1 years, 40 men and 39 women), were retrospectively reviewed in the study. For all patients, average temperature was 38.8 degrees C and mean time from onset of the fever to the time of initial radiographs taken was 5.8 days. Location, abnormal distribution, appearance of lung abnormalities, effusion of pericadiaum and pleura, and lymphadenopathy were observed. Abnormal distribution and associated findings were compared. Differences of mean age, temperature, and the time were statistically analyzed between patients with and without abnormal findings. RESULTS Initial chest radiographs were normal in 36 of 79 patients (45.5%). Abnormal radiographs in 43 patients (81.3%) showed exudative changes. No significant difference of mean age and day (form onset of the fever to the time of initial radiographs taken) was found between the patients with and without abnormal initial chest radiographs (P > 0.05). No lymphadenopathy, effusion of pericadiaum and pleura were found on the initial chest radiographs. CONCLUSIONS The main abnormal radiographic appearance of lung in patients with SARS is exudative changes. SARS patients with normal initial chest radiographs are not uncommon and abnormal radiographic findings may appear to be late after onset of fever.

With more than eight thousand reported cases infection, Cameroon stands as the seventh most affected country in Africa. Prevention remains the best way to fight against this zoonosis. However, the limited information available about this infection is a great barrier to stopping the propagation of the virus within the population, especially in rural and semi-rural areas, where the lack of financial and material resources is a reality. This study aimed to assessing Awareness and attitudes of the population of the Menoua Division on COVID-19 infection. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 9 to April 15 2020 amongst the populations of rural and semi-rural areas of the Menoua Division. Data were collected using a questionnaire administered face to face to each participant. The analysis was carried out using the Statistical Analysis System software (SAS version 9.4). The significance threshold was set at a P value of less than 0.05. RESULTS A total of 434 participants of which male majority (sex ratio 1.07) were included in this study. The most represented age group was [21 - 40] years old representing 40.29% of the participants. Approximately all participants (98.57%) were aware of the world emergency state due to Coronavirus. 75.56%, 91% and 90.93% of the participants knew respectively that having close contacts, kissing and touching the face with the hands could favor the transmission of the virus. However, nearly 91.14% were not aware of the clinical symptoms of the disease. Moreover, 85.02% responded that they would not be able to comply with the confinement measures if they were applied at national level. The level of awareness varied significantly according to the occupation (p=0.038) and the educational level (p<0.001)of the participants. CONCLUSION The average level of awareness of the population of the Menoua Division on COVID-19 infection was relatively low.

Approximately 5 to 12 per cent of seropositive cats develop classical feline infectious peritonitis. A survey of kittens born into households of seropositive cats demonstrated the existence of healthy coronavirus carriers. Seronegative animals did not appear to excrete virus. No specific antibody titre could be linked to carrier status and some carrier cats subsequently became seronegative. The management of the kittens strongly influenced whether they became infected, and some degree of protection appeared to be conferred by maternally derived antibody. At present, feline infectious peritonitis virus and feline enteric coronavirus can only be differentiated by their different clinical histories in infected catteries. In this survey, cases of feline infectious peritonitis occurred in kittens from households where the initial presentation had been enteritis and vice versa. Therefore no difference in epidemiology could be found.","Addie, D D; Jarrett, O",The Veterinary record,260,33

The 5' end of this gene overlaps with the 3' end of an upstream gene that is in a different reading frame. The region of overlap is similar to sequences in retro- and coronaviruses that are known to express their polymerase genes by frameshifting. This overlap region includes a ""shifty"" heptanucleotide, followed by a highly structured region that may contain a pseudoknot. Sequences of 115 or 144 base pairs that span this region from barley yellow dwarf virus (PAV serotype) genomic RNA were introduced into a plasmid, so that a reporter gene could be expressed in plant cells only if a minus one (-1) frameshift event occurred. Frameshifting was detected at a rate of approximately 1%. This frameshifting was abolished when the stop codon at the 3' end of the upstream open reading frame was deleted. A sequence expected to form a strong stem-loop immediately upstream of the frameshift site was unnecessary for frameshifting, and initiation at AUG codons within the stem-loop appeared to be inhibited. Like viruses that infect hosts in other kingdoms, plant viruses also can induce frameshifting in translation of their genes.","Brault, V; Miller, W A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,260,9

We recently showed that six common MHC haplotypes account for essentially all MHC diversity in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) from the island of Mauritius. In this study, we employ complementary DNA cloning and sequencing to comprehensively characterize full length MHC class II alleles expressed at the Mafa-DPA, -DPB, -DQA, -DQB, -DRA, and -DRB loci on the six common haplotypes. We describe 34 full-length MHC class II alleles, 12 of which are completely novel. Polymorphism was evident at all six loci including DPA, a locus thought to be monomorphic in rhesus macaques. Similar to other Old World monkeys, Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM) share MHC class II allelic lineages with humans at the DQ and DR loci, but not at the DP loci. Additionally, we identified extensive sharing of MHC class II alleles between MCM and other nonhuman primates. The characterization of these full-length-expressed MHC class II alleles will enable researchers to generate MHC class II transferent cell lines, tetramers, and other molecular reagents that can be used to explore CD4+ T lymphocyte responses in MCM.","O'Connor, Shelby L; Blasky, Alex J; Pendley, Chad J; Becker, Ericka A; Wiseman, Roger W; Karl, Julie A; Hughes, Austin L; O'Connor, David H",Immunogenetics,260,1

METHODS A self-report survey was completed by 1557 healthcare workers at three Toronto hospitals in May and June 2003. Psychological stress was measured with the Impact of Event Scale. Scales representing attitudes to the outbreak were derived by factor analysis of 76 items probing attitudes to severe acute respiratory syndrome. The association of Impact of Event Scale scores to job role and contact with severe acute respiratory syndrome patients was tested by analysis of variance. Between-group differences in attitudinal scales were tested by multivariate analysis of variance. Attitudinal scales were tested as factors mediating the association of severe acute respiratory syndrome patient contact and job role with total Impact of Event Scale by linear regression. RESULTS Higher Impact of Event Scale scores are found in nurses and healthcare workers having contact with patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The relationship of these groups to the Impact of Event Scale score is mediated by three factors: health fear, social isolation, and job stress. CONCLUSIONS Although distress in response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak is greater in nurses and those who care for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, these relationships are explained by mediating variables that may be available for interventions to reduce stress in future outbreaks. In particular, the data suggest that the targets of intervention should include job stress, social isolation, and health fear.","Maunder, Robert G; Lancee, William J; Rourke, Sean; Hunter, Jonathan J; Goldbloom, David; Balderson, Ken; Petryshen, Patricia; Steinberg, Rosalie; Wasylenki, Donald; Koh, David; Fones, Calvin S L",Psychosomatic medicine,260,17

The usually precise switch is thought to occur during the synthesis of negative-strand templates for sgmRNA production and to be directed by heptameric core donor sequences within the genome that match an acceptor core (UCUAAAC in the case of bovine coronavirus) near the 3' end of the 5'-terminal genomic leader. Here it is shown that a 22-nucleotide (nt) donor sequence engineered into a packageable bovine coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA and made to match a sequence within the 65-nt virus genomic leader caused a template switch yielding an sgmRNA with only a 33-nt minileader. By changing the donor sequence, acceptor sites between genomic nt 33 and 97 (identical between the DI RNA and the viral genome) could be used to generate sgmRNAs detectable by Northern analysis (approximately 2 to 32 molecules per cell) by 24 h postinfection. Whether the switch was intramolecular only was not determined since a potentially distinguishing acceptor region in the DI RNA rapidly conformed to that in the helper virus genome through a previously described template switch known as leader switching. These results show that crossover acceptor sites for discontinuous transcription (i) need not include the UCUAAAC core and (ii) rest within a surprisingly wide 5'-proximal ""hotspot."" Overlap of this hotspot with that for leader switching and with elements required for RNA replication suggests that it is part of a larger 5'-proximal multifunctional structure.","Wu, Hung-Yi; Ozdarendeli, Aykut; Brian, David A",Journal of virology,260,31

The virus may remain dormant in the central nervous system but then becomes activated in adulthood. All existing models of MS are characterized by inflammation or demyelination that follows days after virus infection or antigen inoculation. While investigating the role of CD4+ T cell responses following Theiler's virus infection in mice deficient in STAT4 or STAT6, we discovered a model in which virus infection was followed by demyelination after a very prolonged incubation period. STAT4-/- mice were resistant to demyelination for 180 days after infection, but developed severe demyelination after this time point. Inflammatory cells and up-regulation of Class I and Class II MHC antigens characterized these lesions. Virus antigen was partially controlled during the early chronic phase of the infection even though viral RNA levels remained high throughout infection. Demyelination correlated with the appearance of virus antigen expression. Bone marrow reconstitution experiments indicated that the mechanism of the late onset demyelination was the result of the STAT4-/- immune system. Thus, virus infection of STAT4-/- mice results in a model that may allow for dissection of the immune events predisposing to late-onset demyelination in MS.","Rodriguez, Moses; Zoecklein, Laurie; Gamez, Jeffrey D; Pavelko, Kevin D; Papke, Louisa M; Nakane, Shunya; Howe, Charles; Radhakrishnan, Suresh; Hansen, Michael J; David, Chella S; Warrington, Arthur E; Pease, Larry R",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,260,7

In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia known as COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China. The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients are often in need for intensive chemotherapy to induce remission that will be complicated with prolonged period of cytopenias. They are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance. These patients may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anti-cancer therapy. ALL patients are at higher risk of developing life-threatening infections. Several factors increase the risk of infection and the presence of multiple risk factors in the same patient is common. Cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. With the World Health Organization declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address the impact of such pandemic on ALL patients. This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic. Currently and due to limited data, there are no international guidelines to address the optimal management of ALL patients in any infectious pandemic. In this review, we will address the potential challenges associated with managing ALL patients during the COVID-19 infection pandemic with suggestions of some practical approaches, focusing on screening asymptomatic ALL patients, diagnostic and response evaluation and choice of chemotherapy in different scenarios and setting and use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).","Alhuraiji, Ahmad; Eldadah, Saleem; Alfraih, Feras; Pandita, Ramesh; Absi, Ahmad; Hanbali, Amr; Aljurf, Mahmoud; El Fakih, Riad",The Gulf journal of oncology,260,1

We aimed to observe the impact on urological care delivery in an Irish university hospital. Methods Data on urological activity was prospectively collected for 3 months from March 2020. A retrospective review of the same period in 2019 was performed for control data. Results Over the 2020 study period, 356 urological admissions were recorded; a 23.1% decrease from the 2019 corresponding period(n=463). A 21.7% decrease in flexible cystoscopies was seen (162 versus 207). 125 theatre cases (36 off-site) were performed in the 2020 period, versus 151 in 2019. Emergency case load remained stable, with 69 cases in the 2020 period. The percentage of trainee-performed cases was preserved. COVID-era outpatient activity increased, to involve 559 clinic consultations compared to 439 the preceding year; a reflection of annual growth in service demand and facilitated by virtual clinic application (n=403). There were 490 instances of patients cancelling/failing to attend outpatient appointments, compared to 335 in 2019. Conclusion The Irish COVID-19 outbreak has created obstacles for urological care. Nonetheless, urgent/emergent urological cases persist. Our unit has managed this to-date with flexible adaptation of service delivery.

Understanding epidemiology and disease transmission is vital to nursing care. Infectious disease transmission requires three components: an agent (virus, bacterium, parasite or other microbe), a vulnerable host and a conducive environment. Disease spread can occur through direct contact or via indirect methods (airborne droplets, vectors, fomites, water or food). Intervention can occur by attacking the agent (e.g., using microbicides), changing the environment (e.g., providing negative pressure rooms) or strengthening the host (e.g., vaccination). Three epidemiologically relevant microbes are the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-associated coronavirus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). The first is an emerging pathogen, and the latter two are existing agents that have mutated such that they are resistant to their standard treatments. For SARS, control measures include screening for possible cases and appropriate triage, respiratory and barrier precautions within the healthcare facility, and voluntary isolation in the community for contacts or healthcare workers who exhibit symptoms. Control measures for MRSA include the screening of patient lesions, isolating or cohorting patients who are already infected, covering wounds with impermeable dressings, treating staff and patient carriers with antibiotics, and improved hygiene. Control measures for C. difficile Control measures include paying close attention to the hygiene of the clinical setting, disinfecting using bleach and the isolation of infected patients.","Stirling, Bridget; Littlejohn, Paula; Willbond, Mary Lynne",The Canadian nurse,260,23

Transmissions continue to occur despite effective therapies that make HIV preventable and treatable. Approximately one-half of people with HIV are not receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Starting ART early, followed by continuous lifetime treatment, most effectively achieves durable virologic suppression and restoration of immune function that can improve clinical outcomes and prevent transmission to partners who are seronegative. National treatment guidelines include ART options that can be offered immediately after diagnosis, even before the results of baseline HIV drug-resistance testing are available. Initial ART selection should be guided by co-occurring conditions, including viral hepatitis, medications, and other factors such as pregnancy. Identifying and addressing psychosocial barriers to care is a key element of ensuring long-term adherence to treatment. The initial physical examination typically reveals no clinical manifestations of HIV in the absence of advanced disease. A comprehensive laboratory evaluation, including HIV viral load and CD4 lymphocyte monitoring, is necessary to guide decision-making for treatment, opportunistic infection prophylaxis, and vaccinations.

The spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 may use the same host cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entering host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is much higher than that of ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV S protein, explaining why SARS-CoV-2 seems to be more readily transmitted from human to human. Here, we report that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, or by the stimulation with inflammatory cytokines such as interferons. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 may positively induce its cellular entry receptor, ACE2, to accelerate its replication and spread; high inflammatory cytokine levels increase ACE2 expression and act as high-risk factors for developing COVID-19, and the infection of other viruses may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, drugs targeting ACE2 may be developed for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of coronaviruses.","Zhuang, Meng-Wei; Cheng, Yun; Zhang, Jing; Jiang, Xue-Mei; Wang, Li; Deng, Jian; Wang, Pei-Hui",J. med. virol,260,16

It is unclear whether pregnant women manifest enhanced disease similar to influenza viral infection or whether specific risk factors might predispose to severe disease. OBJECTIVE: To describe maternal disease and obstetrical outcomes associated with coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy to rapidly inform clinical care. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of pregnant patients with a laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from 6 hospital systems in Washington State between Jan. 21, 2020, and April 17, 2020. Demographics, medical and obstetrical history, and coronavirus disease 2019 encounter data were abstracted from medical records. RESULTS: A total of 46 pregnant patients with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were identified from hospital systems capturing 40% of births in Washington State. Nearly all pregnant individuals with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were symptomatic (93.5%, n=43) and the majority were in their second or third trimester (43.5% [n=20] and 50.0% [n=23], respectively). Symptoms resolved in a median of 24 days (interquartile range, 13-37). Notably, 7 women were hospitalized (16%) including 1 admitted to the intensive care unit. A total of 6 cases (15%) were categorized as severe coronavirus disease 2019 with nearly all patients being either overweight or obese before pregnancy or with asthma or other comorbidities. Of the 8 deliveries that occurred during the study period, there was 1 preterm birth at 33 weeks' gestation to improve pulmonary status in a woman with class III obesity, and 1 stillbirth of unknown etiology. CONCLUSION: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 developed in approximately 15% of pregnant patients and occurred primarily in overweight or obese women with underlying conditions. Obesity and coronavirus disease 2019 may synergistically increase risk for a medically indicated preterm birth to improve maternal pulmonary status in late pregnancy. These findings support categorizing pregnant patients as a higher-risk group, particularly those with chronic comorbidities.","Lokken, Erica M; Walker, Christie L; Delaney, Shani; Kachikis, Alisa; Kretzer, Nicole M; Erickson, Anne; Resnick, Rebecca; Vanderhoeven, Jeroen; Hwang, Joseph K; Barnhart, Nena; Rah, Jasmine; McCartney, Stephen A; Ma, Kimberly K; Huebner, Emily M; Thomas, Chad; Sheng, Jessica S; Paek, Bettina W; Retzlaff, Kristin; Kline, Carolyn R; Munson, Jeff; Blain, Michela; LaCourse, Sylvia M; Deutsch, Gail; Adams Waldorf, Kristina M",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,260,15

It might contribute to the fast spread of COVID-19. However, there are few scientific reports about quantitative comparison of COVID-19 exposure dose (inhalation dose and adhesion dose) for the susceptible individual when the viruses were released from the larynx or lungs. In this paper, a typical numerical model was built based on a breathing human model with real respiratory tract. By using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, two kinds of virus released sites in the infected individual's respiratory tract (larynx, lungs), seven kinds of particle sizes between 1 and 50 µm, three kinds of expiratory flow rates: calm (10 L/min), moderate (30 L/min) and intense (90 L/min) were used to compare the particle deposition proportion and escape proportion. The inhalation dose and the adhesion dose of the susceptible individual were quantified. The results showed that COVID-19 virus-containing droplets and aerosols might be released into the environment at higher proportions (39.1%-44.2%) than viruses that replicate in lungs only (15.3%-37.1%). The exposure doses (inhalation dose and adhesion dose) of the susceptible individual in different situations were discussed. The susceptible individual suffered a higher exposure dose when the viruses were released from the larynx rather than lungs (the difference for 1 µm particles was 1.2-2.2 times). This study provides a possible explanation for the higher transmission risk of COVID-19 virus compared to other viruses and some control advice of COVID-19 in typical indoor environments were also discussed.","Wu, Jialin; Weng, Wenguo",Environ Res,260,15

To our knowledge, there are no studies exploring experiences after second-degree tear. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the experiences of a second-degree vaginal tear regarding aspects of the recovery and need for healthcare and rehabilitation. METHODS: Individual semi-structured interviews were performed and analysed with a qualitative, inductive descriptive approach. RESULTS: A group of 18 women with a second-degree vaginal tear after delivery were included. Four main categories with associated subcategories were found: (1) feeling uncertainty, with subcategories: not knowing what is normal, concern, confusion and uncertainty regarding pelvic floor muscle training; (2) feeling of security, with subcategories: I have no/I can handle the symptoms, trust in the healthcare system and I have sufficient knowledge; (3) not prioritizing myself, with the subcategories: I cannot find time and others have bigger problems; (4) lack of trust in healthcare providers, with the subcategories: feeling forgotten, not being taken seriously, distrust of the competence of the healthcare providers and resignation. CONCLUSION: Women who suffer from a second-degree vaginal tear after pregnancy can feel safe when needs are met but uncertainty is also common when available healthcare and information are perceived as insufficient. The women also feel uncertainty about what is normal after the tear and how to perform pelvic floor exercises.

We recruited 57 male patients each of Mild COVID-19, asymptomatic Covid 19, and healthy controls for the study. All participants underwent evaluation of smell threshold by Butanol Threshold test (BTT) and ability to distinguish common odors by Smell identification test. The scores of each test were recorded on a numerical scale. The participants in all three arms were matched for age, history of smoking, and pre-existing medical conditions. The mean scores of the Butanol Threshold test in Mild COVID-19, asymptomatic Covid 19 and controls were 2.95 ± 2.25 (0-7.5), 3.42 ± 2.23 (0-7.5), and 4.82 ± 1.86 (0-8), respectively. A one-way ANOVA showed a significant difference between groups (df 2, MS 53.78, F 11.94, p < 0.005).

The study included service quality, system quality, information quality, user satisfaction, system use, and E-learning portal success. The empirical data of 280 students participated from the different universities of Malaysia through google surveys analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling. The study further divided the full model into two domains, which are female and male. In the male model, information quality and system quality have direct relationships with user satisfaction. Information quality also supported the relationship with system use. At the same time, there is a positive relationship between user satisfaction and E-learning portals. Likewise, in the female model, E-service quality and Information quality both are supported by system use and user satisfaction. Similarly, system quality has a positive relationship with user satisfaction, and user satisfaction has a positive relationship with E-learning portals. The study will be further helpful for the Malaysian universities policy-makers such as top management, ministry of higher education, Malaysian universities union in designing the policies and programs on E-learning Portal Success in the country.

METHODS: The levels of total immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE), complement (C3, C4) results were retrospectively analyzed in COVID-19 patients. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to explore the risk factors associated with the in-hospital death. RESULT: A total of 236 patients were enrolled in this study, of which 169 were transferred to another institution or discharged (survival group) and 67 died in hospital (non-survival group). Compared with survivors, the levels of IgA and IgE in non-survivors increased significantly, and level of complement C3 decreased. Non-survivors also showed higher incidence of chest tightness, breath shortness and dyspnoea; higher levels of inflammatory indicators, leukocytes and neutrophils; and low levels of lymphocyte subsets. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (HR: 1.099; 95%CI: 1.057-1.143; p < 0.0001), d-dimer greater (HR: 1.294; 95%CI: 1.138-1.473; p < 0.0001) and decreased complement C3 level (HR: 0.073; 95%CI: 0.007-0.722; p = 0.025) on admission. Finally, in survival COVID-19 patients whose humoral immunity was re-examined, C3 levels tended to increase, while in non-survivors it decreased. CONCLUSION: Low level of complement C3 may be an alert to the admitted COVID-19 patients with additional management.

METHODS: All HCWs received an e-mail inviting them to take part in the study. Participants had a nasopharyngeal swab test performed for reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and serological tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (primary study). Additionally, they were invited to complete a questionnaire on their exposure to COVID-19 individuals and their COVID-19-related symptoms (secondary study). Prevalence of antibodies (IgG, IgM, or both) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of the hospital's HCWs (N = 2210) took part in the primary study. Antibodies were detected in 61 participants, a prevalence of 2.8% (95% CI: 2.5-3.1). The prevalence was slightly higher in nurses (3.4%), registrars (3.9%), and wardens (3.4%). Thirty-nine percent of the primary study participants completed the secondary study questionnaire. Those with positive antibody test results had closer contact with COVID-19 individuals (60% vs. 92%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: After the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in our university hospital HCWs was around 2.8%, which is slightly higher than the seroprevalence in the general population in our region. We believe it would be advisable to perform additional seroprevalence studies during the second wave of the epidemic.","Rodriguez, Adrian; Arrizabalaga-Asenjo, Maria; Fernandez-Baca, Victoria; Lainez, Maria Pilar; Al Nakeeb, Zaid; Garcia, Jose Daniel; Payeras, Antoni",Int J Infect Dis,260,26

Patients with end-stage heart failure and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) may be at risk for severe COVID-19 given a high prevalence of complex comorbidities and functional impaired immunity. The objective of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with end-stage heart failure and durable LVADs. METHODS: The Trans-CoV-VAD registry is a multi-center registry of LVAD and cardiac transplant patients in the United States with confirmed COVID-19. Patient characteristics, exposure history, presentation, laboratory data, course, and clinical outcomes were collected by participating institutions and reviewed by a central data repository. This report represents the participation of the first 9 centers to report LVAD data into the registry. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were included in this cohort. The median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 46-68), 14 (35%) were women, and 21 (52%) were Black. Among the most common presenting symptoms were cough (41%), fever, and fatigue (both 38%). A total of 18% were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Only 43% of the patients reported either subjective or measured fever during the entire course of illness. Over half (60%) required hospitalization, and 8 patients (20%) died, often after lengthy hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: We present the largest case series of LVAD patients with COVID-19 to date. Understanding these characteristics is essential in an effort to improve the outcome of this complex patient population.","Birati, Edo Y; Najjar, Samer S; Tedford, Ryan J; Houston, Brian A; Shore, Supriya; Vorovich, Esther; Atluri, Pavan; Urgo, Kimberly; Molina, Maria; Chambers, Susan; Escobar, Nicole; Hsich, Eileen; Estep, Jerry D; Alexander, Kevin M; Teuteberg, Jeffrey J; Chaudhry, Sunit-Preet; Ravichandran, Ashwin; DeVore, Adam D; Margulies, Kenneth B; Hanff, Thomas C; Zimmer, Ross; Kilic, Arman; Wald, Joyce W; Vidula, Himabindu; Martens, John; Blumberg, Emily A; Mazurek, Jeremy A; Owens, Anjali T; Goldberg, Lee R; Alvarez-Garcia, Jesus; Mancini, Donna M; Moss, Noah; Genuardi, Michael V",Circ Heart Fail,260,2

Water and sanitation services at 495 healthcare facilities in the West Bank of Palestine are assessed using the results of PCBS and MoH (2014) survey study. Services are reassessed after the COVID-10 pandemic using personal interviews with experts from healthcare facilities, regulatory authorities, and service providers. The results show that 92.1% of healthcare facilities were connected to public water networks, 12.9% of them purchased water tanks, and 10.8% of them depended on harvested rainwater which may cause contamination and waterborne diseases. Regardless the source of freshwater, the water quality has to be regularly examined and compared to local guidelines and international standards for health promotion. Almost 63.4% of healthcare facilities were not connected to wastewater networks and used either tight or porous cesspits. Once these cesspits are filled off, wastewater is randomly disposed into nearby valleys causing adverse environmental impacts on air, water, and land resources. Medical wastewater of hazardous substances should be treated before discharged to wastewater networks. Experts assured that although heightened procedures have been made by service providers to curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease, yet, more consistent protocols and stringent procedures are crucial. There have not been any new directives or procedures regarding the management of water supplies and wastewater services in the healthcare facilities.

In addition, four different coping strategies were investigated. The study was conducted in Germany with data from 665 participants (53.8% female; 18-73 years), who completed an online questionnaire in April 2020. The results revealed that COVID-19 worry was associated with impaired well-being and sleep. Meaning- and problem-focused coping were the most frequently used coping strategies, and showed positive associations with well-being and sleep. Social and avoidance coping were associated with decreased well-being and worse sleep outcomes. Three coping strategies showed moderating effects. People who worried more showed higher levels of positive affect when they used problem-focused coping compared to those who did not. Similarly, highly worried participants showed lower levels of negative affect when they reported using meaning-focused coping more often. In contrast, social coping increased the risk of high negative affect levels in worried participants. In conclusion, problem-focused and meaning-focused coping strategies seemed to be most effective in coping with COVID-19 challenges.","Saalwirth, Christina; Leipold, Bernhard",Stress health (Online),260,1

Patients and Methods: The age-adjusted race-stratified prevalence of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity), preexisting medical conditions (pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and malignant neoplasm), poor health behaviors (smoking, alcohol abuse, and physical inactivity), and adverse socioeconomic factors (education, household income, and health insurance) was computed in 435,139 American adult participants from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. Correlation was assessed between health determinants and the race-stratified COVID-19 crude mortality rate and infection-fatality ratio computed from respective state public health departments in 47 states. Results: Blacks had a higher prevalence of comorbidities (63.3%; 95% CI, 62.4% to 64.2% vs 55.1%; 95% CI, 54.7% to 55.5%) and adverse socioeconomic factors (47.0%; 95% CI, 46.0% to 47.9% vs 30.9%; 95% CI, 30.6% to 31.3%) than did whites. The prevalence of preexisting medical conditions was similar in blacks (30.4%; 95% CI, 28.8% to 32.1%) and whites (30.8%; 95% CI, 30.2% to 31.4%). The prevalence of poor health behaviors was higher in whites (57.2%; 95% CI, 56.3% to 58.0%) than in blacks (50.2%; 95% CI,46.2% to 54.2%). Comorbidities and adverse socioeconomic factors were highest in the southern region, and poor health behaviors were highest in the western region. The cumulative incidence rate (per 100,000 persons) was 3-fold higher in blacks (1546.4) than in whites (540.4). The crude mortality rate (per 100,000 persons) was 2-fold higher in blacks (83.2) than in whites (33.2). However, the infection-fatality ratio (per 100 cases) was similar in whites (6.2) and blacks (5.4). Within racial groups, the geographic distribution of health determinants did not correlate with the state-level COVID-19 mortality and infection-fatality ratio (P>.05 for all). Conclusion: Racial disparities in COVID-19 are largely driven by the higher cumulative incidence of infection in blacks. There is a discordance between the geographic dispersion of COVID-19 mortality and the regional distribution of health determinants.","Parcha, Vibhu; Malla, Gargya; Suri, Sarabjeet S; Kalra, Rajat; Heindl, Brittain; Berra, Lorenzo; Fouad, Mona N; Arora, Garima; Arora, Pankaj",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,260,14

To investigate the usefulness of a serological assay to predict vaccine efficacy, we analyzed the levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in the sera from BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals in Japan. METHODSThis study included 219 individuals who received two doses of BNT162b2. The levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA against RBD were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after the first and second vaccination, respectively. The relationship between antibody levels and several factors including age, gender, and hypertension were analyzed. Virus-neutralizing activity in sera was measured to determine the correlation with the levels of antibodies. A chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) method to measure IgG against RBD was developed and validated for the clinical setting. RESULTSThe levels of all antibody isotypes were increased after vaccination. Among them, RBD-IgG was dramatically increased after the second vaccination. The IgG levels in females were significantly higher than in males. There was a negative correlation between age and IgG levels in males. The IgG levels significantly correlated with the neutralizing activity. The CLEIA assay measuring IgG against RBD showed a reliable performance and a high correlation with neutralizing activity. CONCLUSIONSMonitoring of IgG against RBD is a powerful tool to predict the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and provides useful information in considering a personalized vaccination strategy for COVID-19.","Fujigaki, Hidetsugu; Yamamoto, Yasuko; Koseki, Takenao; Banno, Sumi; Ando, Tatsuya; Ito, Hiroyasu; Fujita, Takashi; Naruse, Hiroyuki; Hata, Tadayoshi; Moriyama, Saya; Takahashi, Yoshimasa; Suzuki, Tadaki; Murakami, Takahiro; Yoshida, Yukihiro; Yagura, Yo; Oyamada, Takayoshi; Takemura, Masao; Kondo, Masashi; Iwata, Mitsunaga; Saito, Kuniaki",,260,7

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter retrospective observational study of patients 18 years hospitalized due to COVID-19 at the Johns Hopkins Health system. Patients who were transferred from another facility with >24 hours stay and patients who died within 48 hours of hospitalization were excluded. METHODS: Elevated PCT values were determined based on each hospitals definition. Antibiotic therapy and PCT results were evaluated for patients with no evidence of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (bCAP) and patients with confirmed, probable, or possible bCAP. The added value of PCT to clinical criteria in detecting bCAP were evaluated with receiving operating curve characteristics (ROC). RESULTS: 64% (611/962) of patients received a PCT. ROC curves for clinical criteria and clinical criteria plus PCT were similar (at 0.5ng/ml and 0.25ng/ml). By bCAP group, median initial PCT values were 0.58 ng/mL (IQR 0.24, 1.14), 0.23 ng/mL (IQR 0.1, 0.63) and 0.15 ng/mL (IQR 0.09, 0.35) for proven/probable, possible, and no bCAP groups. Among patients without bCAP, an elevatedPCT was associated with 1.8 additional days of CAP therapy (95% CI 1.01 2.75, P<0.01) compared to patients with a negative PCT after adjusting for potential confounders. Duration of CAP therapy was similar between patients without a PCT ordered and a low PCT for no bCAP and possible bCAP groups. CONCLUSIONS: PCT may be abnormal in COVID-19 patients without bCAP and may result in receipt of unnecessary antibiotics.","Fabre, Valeria; Karaba, Sara; Amoah, Joe; Robinson, Matthew; Jones, George; Dzintars, Kathryn; Katz, Morgan; Landrum, B Mark; Qasba, Sarojini; Gupta, Pooja; Klein, Eili; Cosgrove, Sara E",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,260,24

In the United States, Medtronic Diabetes shifted from occasional to 100% virtual training on all diabetes devices in mid-March 2020. We studied the outcomes of virtual training on the MiniMed&#8482; 670 G hybrid closed-loop system in type 1 diabetes. Methods: From March 20, 2020, to April 22, 2020 (intra-COVID-19), virtual training on the MiniMed 670 G system was completed using Zoom with satisfaction captured through online post-training surveys. Training efficiency was measuring by the days between the date of product shipment and the date of the first and final trainings. Patient satisfaction with training on the MiniMed 670 G was determined by Net Promotor Score® (NPS®). Uploads from CareLink&#8482; Personal and CareLink Professional and calls to the Medtronic 24-h technical support team requesting educational/software assistance and/or help with health care provider telehealth visits were recorded. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) results were measured using the CareLink Personal database. All results except for the Zoom satisfaction survey were compared with data from January 20, 2020, to February 22, 2020, (Pre-COVID-19) when training was performed in-person. Results: The CGM metrics were comparable between pre- and intra-COVID-19 training. The Zoom video conferencing application had 98% satisfaction. The NPS rose from 78 to 84. The time between the pump shipment and the first and last (automode) training was significantly reduced from 14 ± 7 days to 11 ± 5 days (P < 0.001) and from 19 ± 7 days to 15 ± 15 days (P < 0.01), respectively. There was a decrease in the calls for educational assistance to the technical support team but an increase in requests for login and software installation support. Conclusions: Virtual training of individuals with diabetes on the MiniMed 670 G system resulted in high satisfaction and short-term glycemic results comparable with in-person training.","Vigersky, Robert A; Velado, Kevin; Zhong, Alex; Agrawal, Pratik; Cordero, Toni L",,260,24

Given that determining virus composition and function in association with states of human health and disease is of increasing interest, we anticipate that the field of viral metagenomics will continue to expand and be applied in a variety of areas ranging from surveillance to discovery, and will rely heavily upon the continued development of reference materials and databases. Information regarding viral composition and function readily translate into biological and clinical applications, including the rapid sequence identification of pathogenic viruses in various sample typ-es. However, viral metagenomic approaches often lack appropriate standards and reference materials to enable cross-study comparisons and assess potential biases which can be introduced at the various stages of collection, storage, processing, and sequence analysis. In addition, implementation of appropriate viral reference materials can aid in the benchmarking of current and development of novel assays for virus identification, discovery, and surveillance.

The release of NET components from neutrophils is involved in the suppression of pathogen diffusion. Development of NETs around target microbes leads to disruption of the cell membrane, eventuating in kind of cell death that is called as NETosis. The very first step in the process of NETosis is activation of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase upon signaling by innate immune receptors. Afterwards, produced Reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger protein-arginine deiminase type 4, neutrophil elastase, and myeloperoxidase to generate decondensed chromatin and disrupted integrity of nuclear membrane. Subsequently, decondensed chromatin is mixed with several enzymes in the cytoplasm released from granules, leading to release of DNA and histones, and finally formation of NET. Several reports have indicated that NETosis might contribute to the immune responses through limiting the dissemination of microbial organisms. In this review, we discuss recent advances on the role of neutrophils, NETs, and their implications in the pathogenesis of microbial infections.

It is unknown if critical care nurses have similar experiences. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to examine the mental health of Critical Care Registered Nurses providing direct patient care during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. DESIGN: This was a convergent parallel mixed method study utilizing validated questionnaires and semi-structured qualitative interviews. SETTING: Critical care units in a single large 650 bed academic teaching hospital in western Canada. The critical care units serve a general mixed medical - surgical adult patient population. PARTICIPANTS: Critical Care Registered Nurses providing direct patient care in the intensive care and high acuity units at the designated site. METHODS: 109 participants completed two self-reported validated surveys, the Impact of Events Scale - Revised and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. 15 participants completed one-on-one semi-structured interviews that were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: In the surveys, the participants reported clinical concern for (23%), probable (13%) and significant (38%) symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as mild to severe depression (57%), anxiety (67%) and stress (54%). In the interviews, psychological distress was described as anxiety, worry, distress and fear related to: 1) rapidly changing policy and information, 2) overwhelming and unclear communication, 3) meeting patient care needs in new ways while staying safe, and 4) managing home and personal commitments to self and family.

Therefore, we updated our routine clinical protocol to 1) inform patients with ongoing treatment about the potential risks of their medications in the case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, 2) discuss opt out of treatment temporarily, and 3) perform a closer follow-up on a monthly basis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes in patients with HS, who suspended and continued immunosuppressive therapy following COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: This retrospective study included patients with HS, who had been receiving biologic/immunosuppressive treatment when the COVID-19 pandemic was announced. Those who withdrew treatment for any reason or continued were analyzed. The primary endpoint was physician-diagnosed disease exacerbation. The secondary outcomes were changes in visual analogue scale (VAS) and COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: A total of 37 patients were included in the analysis. The majority of the patients were on adalimumab treatment (n=33). Fifteen (40.5%) patients withdrew the treatment for COVID-19 related concerns. During 83.2±0.6 days of follow-up following the withdrawal, all patients in this group had at least one exacerbation. Also, the mean VAS score increased from 5.7±0.56 to 8.6±0.57 (p=0.001). On the other hand, three patients (13.6%) who continued the treatment reported worsening in disease course, 12 patients (54.5%) remained stable and seven of them (31.9%) had clinical relief. We did not observe any confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in any of our 37 HS patients. Conclusions: The present study suggests that even a temporary withdrawal of biologic/immunosuppressive treatments may have significant adverse consequences on disease course and quality of life in patients with HS. These individuals may safely continue the treatment provided that maximum measures are taken to avoid COVID-19 infection.","Esme, Pelin Beksaç Burcu Çalışkan Ercan",Gülhane Tip Dergisi,260,1

Several clinical trials using previously approved drugs and drug combinations are urgently underway to improve our current situation. Unfortunately, a vaccine option is optimistically at least a year away. It is imperative that for future viral pandemic preparedness, we have a rapid screening technology for drug discovery and repurposing. The primary purpose of this research project was to evaluate the DeepNEU stem-cell based platform by creating and validating computer simulations of artificial lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 to enable the rapid identification of antiviral therapeutic targets and drug repurposing. The data generated from this project indicate that (a) human alveolar type lung cells can be simulated by DeepNEU (v5.0), (b) these simulated cells can then be infected with simulated SARS-CoV-2 virus, (c) the unsupervised learning system performed well in all simulations based on available published wet lab data, and (d) the platform identified potentially effective anti-SARS-CoV2 combinations of known drugs for urgent clinical study. The data also suggest that DeepNEU can identify potential therapeutic targets for expedited vaccine development. We conclude that based on published data plus current DeepNEU results, continued development of the DeepNEU platform will improve our preparedness for and response to future viral outbreaks. This can be achieved through rapid identification of potential therapeutic options for clinical testing as soon as the viral genome has been confirmed.","Esmail, Sally; Danter, Wayne R",Stem cells transl. med.

It is estimated that more than 5% of the global population suffers from chronic diarrhea. and that about 40% of these subjects are older than 60 years. The clinician is frequently faced with the need to decide which is the best therapeutic approach for these patients. While the origin of chronic diarrhea is diverse, impairment of intestinal barrier function, dysbiosis. and mucosal micro-inflammation are being increasingly recognized as underlying phenomena characterizing a variety of chronic diarrheal diseases. In addition to current pharmacological therapies, there is growing interest in alternative products such as mucoprotectants, which form a mucoadhesive film over the epithelium to reduce and protect against the development of altered intestinal permeability, dysbiosis, and mucosal micro-inflammation. This manuscript focuses on chronic diarrhea in adults, and we will review recent evidence on the ability of these natural compounds to improve symptoms associated with chronic diarrhea and to exert protective effects for the intestinal barrier.","Alonso-Cotoner, Carmen; Abril-Gil, Mar; Albert-Bayo, Mercé; Mall, John-P Ganda; Expósito, Elba; González-Castro, Ana M; Lobo, Beatriz; Santos, Javier",Adv. ther,260,1

But only a few cases of patients receiving this have been reported in the literature. Here we report the largest registry of the use of rpFVIII for the treatment of AHA. The objective of this retrospective study was to describe the efficacy and the safety of susoctocog-alfa for AHA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied a population of nine patients, recruited in five Italian haemophilia centres presenting AHA, and treated with Obizur® as first- or second-line therapy. fir RESULTS: rpFVIII was used as a first-line therapy in one-third of the patients. The median delay between clinical onset and diagnosis was 16 days. Initial bolus of infused susoctocog-alfa was 100 IU/kg, lower than the recommended dose. The treatment was maintained for a median of four days. Only one patient with serious co-morbidities and recurrent infections was treated for 32 days. All patients reached a complete resolution of AHA, and no recurrences were reported. Two patients developed a low-titre inhibitor against rpFVIII, neither experienced any complications. DISCUSSION: In our real world experience, susoctocog-alfa was proven to be an effective and safe therapeutic option for patients with AHA, also at a lower than recommended dosage.

METHODS: This geo-epidemiological analysis was based on data publicly available on government and administration websites for the 96 administrative departments of metropolitan France between March 19 and May 11, 2020, including Public Health France, the Regional Health Agencies, the French national statistics institute, and the Ministry of Health. Using hierarchical ascendant classification on principal component analysis of multidimensional variables, and multivariate analyses with generalised additive models, we assessed the associations between several factors (spatiotemporal spread of the epidemic between Feb 7 and March 17, 2020, the national lockdown, demographic population structure, baseline intensive care capacities, baseline population health and health-care services, new chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine dispensations, economic indicators, degree of urbanisation, and climate profile) and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates. Incidence rate was defined as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases per 100â000 inhabitants, mortality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per 100â000, and case fatality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases. FINDINGS: From March 19 to May 11, 2020, hospitals in metropolitan France notified a total of 100â988 COVID-19 cases, including 16â597 people who were admitted to intensive care and 17â062 deaths. There was an overall cumulative in-hospital incidence rate of 155·6 cases per 100â000 inhabitants (range 19·4-489·5), in-hospital mortality rate of 26·3 deaths per 100â000 (1·1-119·2), and in-hospital case fatality rate of 16·9% (4·8-26·2). We found clear spatial heterogeneity of in-hospital COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates, following the spread of the epidemic. After multivariate adjustment, the delay between the first COVID-19-associated death and the onset of the national lockdown was positively associated with in-hospital incidence (adjusted standardised incidence ratio 1·02, 95% CI 1·01-1·04), mortality (adjusted standardised mortality ratio 1·04, 1·02-1·06), and case fatality rates (adjusted standardised fatality ratio 1·01, 1·01-1·02). Mortality and case fatality rates were higher in departments with older populations (adjusted standardised ratio for populations with a high proportion older than aged >85 years 2·17 [95% CI 1·20-3·90] for mortality and 1·43 [1·08-1·88] for case fatality rate). Mortality rate was also associated with incidence rate (1·0004, 1·0002-1·001), but mortality and case fatality rates did not appear to be associated with baseline intensive care capacities. We found no association between climate and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, or between economic indicators and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence or mortality rates. INTERPRETATION: This ecological study highlights the impact of the epidemic spread, national lockdown, and reactive adaptation of intensive care capacities on the spatial distribution of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. It provides information for future geo-epidemiological analyses and has implications for preparedness and response policies to current and future epidemic waves in France and elsewhere.

In this study, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on aquatic environment of the southern Jiangsu (SJ) segment of Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal (SJ-BHGC) were explored. Fluorescent component similarity and high-performance size exclusion chromatography analyses indicated that the textile printing and dyeing wastewater might be one of the main pollution sources in SJ-BHGC. The water quality parameters and intensities of fluorescent components (WT-C1(20) and WT-C2(20)) decreased to low level due to the collective shutdown of all industries in SJ region during the Spring Festival holiday and the outbreak of the domestic COVID-19 pandemic in China (January 24th to late February, 2020). Then, they presented a gradual upward trend after the domestic epidemic was under control. In mid-March, the outbreak of the international COVID-19 pandemic hit the garment export trade of China and consequently inhibited the production activities of textile printing and dyeing industry (TPDI) in SJ region. After peaking on March 26th, the intensities of WT-C1(20) and WT-C2(20) decreased again with changed intensity ratio until April 12th. During the study period (135 days), correlation analysis revealed that WT-C1 and WT-C2 possessed homology and their fluorescence intensities were highly positively correlated with conductivity and CODMn. With fluorescence fingerprint (FF) technique, this study not only excavated the characteristics and pollution causes of water body in SJ-BHGC, but also provided novel insights into impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on production activities of TPDI and aquatic environment of SJ-BHGC. The results of this study indicated that FF technique was an effective tool for precise supervision of water environment.","Shen, Jian; Liu, Chuanyang; Lv, Qing; Gu, Junqiang; Su, Mingyu; Wang, Shifeng; Chai, Yidi; Cheng, Cheng; Wu, Jing",Water Res,260,21

Patients are triaged at admission according to their likelihood of COVID-19 infection, with high/medium risk patients being admitted to EAU and low risk patients being admitted ward A. Patients requiring longer stays are then moved to ward B (high risk) or C (medium risk), depending on risk. By contrast, there were significant periods of exposure in EAU (Table 1), with over a quarter of the hours susceptible patients spent in six of the eight bays being exposed to at least one other infectious patient.","Davies, Tim Cargill Tamsin Shaw Robert Ellis Tony Jeffery Katie Wangrangsimakul Tri",Clinical Medicine,260,5

Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries/regions. In the early stages of a new pathogen outbreak, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the infection transmission, in order to follow contagion over time and project the epidemiological situation in the near future. While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stems from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown. Here, we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency positively correlates with particulate air pollutants, and specifically with particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), while ozone gas is oppositely related with the number of infected individuals. We propose that atmospheric air pollutants could thus serve as surrogate markers to complement the infection outbreak anticipation.","Fronza, Raffaele; Lusic, Marina; Schmidt, Manfred; Lucic, Bojana",Viruses,260,1

She tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and chest radiography revealed moderate patchy bilateral airspace opacities. Serology markers for cytokine storm were significantly elevated, with a serum D-dimer level of 8180 ng/mL (normal < 230 ng/mL). Computed tomography of the chest with i.v. contrast was positive for bilateral ground-glass opacities, scattered filling defects within the bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries, and a large thrombus was present at the aortic arch. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and successfully treated with unfractionated heparin, alteplase 50 mg, and argatroban 2 µg/kg/min.

Until 27th May 2020, it caused more than 5.6 million individuals infected throughout the world and resulted in greater than 348,145 deaths. CT images-based classification technique has been tried to use the identification of COVID-19 with CT imaging by hospitals, which aims to minimize the possibility of virus transmission and alleviate the burden of clinicians and radiologists. Early diagnosis of COVID-19, which not only prevents the disease from spreading further but allows more reasonable allocation of limited medical resources. Therefore, CT images play an essential role in identifying cases of COVID-19 that are in great need of intensive clinical care. Unfortunately, the current public health emergency, which has caused great difficulties in collecting a large set of precise data for training neural networks. To tackle this challenge, our first thought is transfer learning, which is a technique that aims to transfer the knowledge from one or more source tasks to a target task when the latter has fewer training data. Since the training data is relatively limited, so a transfer learning-based DensNet-121 approach for the identification of COVID-19 is established. The proposed method is inspired by the precious work of predecessors such as CheXNet for identifying common Pneumonia, which was trained using the large Chest X-ray14 dataset, and the dataset contains 112,120 frontal chest X-rays of 14 different chest diseases (including Pneumonia) that are individually labeled and achieved good performance. Therefore, CheXNet as the pre-trained network was used for the target task (COVID-19 classification) by fine-tuning the network weights on the small-sized dataset in the target task. Finally, we evaluated our proposed method on the COVID-19-CT dataset. Experimentally, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for the accuracy (ACC) and F1-score. The quantitative indicators show that the proposed method only uses a GPU can reach the best performance, up to 0.87 and 0.86, respectively, compared with some widely used and recent deep learning methods, which are helpful for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage.

Reliable and fast testing of the COVID-19 has been a challenge for researchers and healthcare practitioners. In this work we present a novel machine learning (ML) integrated X-ray device in Healthcare Cyber-Physical System (H-CPS) or smart healthcare framework (called CoviLearn) to allow healthcare practitioners to perform automatic initial screening of COVID-19 patients. We propose convolutional neural network (CNN) models of X-ray images integrated into an X-ray device for automatic COVID-19 detection. The proposed CoviLearn device will be useful in detecting if a person is COVID-19 positive or negative by considering the chest X-ray image of individuals. CoviLearn will be useful tool doctors to detect potential COVID-19 infections instantaneously without taking more intrusive healthcare data samples, such as saliva and blood. COVID-19 attacks the endothelium tissues that support respiratory tract, X-rays images can be used to analyze the health of a patient lungs. As all healthcare centers have X-ray machines, it could be possible to use proposed CoviLearn X-rays to test for COVID-19 without the especial test kits. Our proposed automated analysis system CoviLearn which has 99% accuracy will be able to save valuable time of medical professionals as the X-ray machines come with a drawback as it needed a radiology expert.","Das, Debanjan; Samal, Chirag; Ukey, Deewanshu; Chowdhary, Gourav; Mohanty, Saraju P.",,260,20

However, data mining of current gene expression databases, such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), has not been previously performed to determine whether SIRT3 expression is upregulated or downregulated in the brain tissues of AD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eight RNA expression chip datasets of AD brains in the GEO database were selected, and GEO2R analysis was conducted to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the AD and control groups. Furthermore, the SIRT3 mRNA levels between the AD and control groups and their relationships with the DEGs and diagnosis of AD were evaluated. Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of both the AD-related DEGs and the SIRT3-related DEGs were conducted. RESULTS The SIRT3 mRNA levels were downregulated in 7 of 8 databases and were related to the diagnosis of AD in 7 databases, with an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) greater than 50%. Additionally, GO and KEGG analyses showed that SIRT3 downregulation could affect neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, the MAPK signaling pathway, long-term potentiation, the calcium signaling pathway and axon guidance in AD patients. CONCLUSIONS SIRT3 mRNA is downregulated in the brain tissues of AD patients, promoting the progression of AD.","Song, Shuang; Li, Bin; Jia, Zhen; Guo, Li",Med Sci Monit,260,1

METHODS: We analysed the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry (from 24 March 2020 to 12 April 2021). We investigated b/tsDMARD use for RA at the clinical onset of COVID-19 (baseline): abatacept (ABA), rituximab (RTX), Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), interleukin 6 inhibitors (IL-6i) or tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi, reference group). The ordinal COVID-19 severity outcome was (1) no hospitalisation, (2) hospitalisation without oxygen, (3) hospitalisation with oxygen/ventilation or (4) death. We used ordinal logistic regression to estimate the OR (odds of being one level higher on the ordinal outcome) for each drug class compared with TNFi, adjusting for potential baseline confounders. RESULTS: Of 2869 people with RA (mean age 56.7 years, 80.8% female) on b/tsDMARD at the onset of COVID-19, there were 237 on ABA, 364 on RTX, 317 on IL-6i, 563 on JAKi and 1388 on TNFi. Overall, 613 (21%) were hospitalised and 157 (5.5%) died. RTX (OR 4.15, 95% CI 3.16 to 5.44) and JAKi (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.65) were each associated with worse COVID-19 severity compared with TNFi. There were no associations between ABA or IL6i and COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: People with RA treated with RTX or JAKi had worse COVID-19 severity than those on TNFi. The strong association of RTX and JAKi use with poor COVID-19 outcomes highlights prioritisation of risk mitigation strategies for these people.","Sparks, Jeffrey A; Wallace, Zachary S; Seet, Andrea M; Gianfrancesco, Milena A; Izadi, Zara; Hyrich, Kimme L; Strangfeld, Anja; Gossec, Laure; Carmona, Loreto; Mateus, Elsa F; Lawson-Tovey, Saskia; Trupin, Laura; Rush, Stephanie; Katz, Patricia; Schmajuk, Gabriela; Jacobsohn, Lindsay; Wise, Leanna; Gilbert, Emily L; Duarte-García, Ali; Valenzuela-Almada, Maria O; Pons-Estel, Guillermo J; Isnardi, Carolina A; Berbotto, Guillermo A; Hsu, Tiffany Y-T; D039,; Silva, Kristin M; Patel, Naomi J; Kearsley-Fleet, Lianne; Schäfer, Martin; Ribeiro, Sandra Lúcia Euzébio; Al Emadi, Samar; Tidblad, Liselotte; Scirè, Carlo Alberto; Raffeiner, Bernd; Thomas, Thierry; Flipo, René-Marc; Avouac, Jérôme; Seror, Raphaèle; Bernardes, Miguel; Cunha, Maria Margarida; Hasseli, Rebecca; Schulze-Koops, Hendrik; Müller-Ladner, Ulf; Specker, Christof; Souza, Viviane Angelina de; Mota, Licia Maria Henrique da; Gomides, Ana Paula Monteiro; Dieudé, Philippe; Nikiphorou, Elena; Kronzer, Vanessa L; Singh, Namrata",Ann. rheum. dis,260,1

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of these patients according to their clinical characteristics. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and three Chinese biomedical databases were searched up to 25 March 2020 with no language restriction. We included original observational studies that reported the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of COVID-19 patients. Two separate reviewers conducted the review. Metaprop was adopted to conduct a meta-analysis of prevalence with variances stabilized by Freeman-Tukey Double Arcsine Transformation. A random-effects model was used. Heterogeneity across different studies was computed using Cochran's Q test and chi square statistics. RESULTS: From 17 studies, the pooled detection rate of fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 43.7% (95% CI 32.6%-55.0%) and 33.7% (95% C.I. 33.7%, 95% C.I. 20.1%-48.8%) by patient and number of specimens as a unit count, respectively. Female individuals (59.6% vs. 53.5%), those who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (77.1% vs. 57.7%), and patients with more severe disease (68.3% vs. 34.6%) tended to have a higher detection rate. DISCUSSION: A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients carry SARS-CoV-2 in their intestinal tract. Feces being a self-collected specimen bears a potential to improve case identification in community, especially for young children where proper respiratory sampling at home is difficult. Specific infection control strategies focusing on spread via fecal contamination and faulty toilet drainage are urgently needed.","Wong, Martin Cs; Huang, Junjie; Lai, Christopher; Ng, Rita; Chan, Francis K L; Chan, Paul K S",J Infect,260,32

The aim of this review is to investigate the role of surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods - A literature research was conducted via PubMed to detect articles featuring the potential protective role of surgical masks when they were worn by healthcare workers or by the general public. Results - Among 114 articles, only 31 met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen additional articles provided useful information according to the aim of this review. Existing literature supports the positive effect of surgical masks on COVID-19 con-lamination. Debate on the efficacy of surgical masks compared with other forms of facial protective devices exists. There seems to be a tendency to favor the use of particulate-filtering facepiece respirators in healthcare professionals who face higher risk of infection. However, surgical masks primarily and cloth masks secondarily seem to be adequate means of protection for the general public and for healthcare workers during procedures where respiratory droplets are not generated. Rational use of surgical masks is imperative; however, reuse after decontamination is not ideal. Conclusions - For optimum protection from COVID-19, the use of surgical masks should be combined with other infection control measures like hand hygiene and social distancing, since the level of their effectiveness is still being investigated. Shortage of surgical masks should be prevented; therefore, rational use plays a crucial role in this direction.","Solia, Eirini; Angelis, Stavros; Maglara, Elli; Tsakotos, Georgios; Filippou, Dimitrios K",J Long Term Eff Med Implants,260,33

As one major gastropod lineage, the patellogastropods show different characters in its shell field morphogenesis compared to other gastropods (e.g., the pulmonate gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis), likely related to its epibolic gastrulation. The investigation on the shell field morphogenesis of patellogastropods would be useful to reveal the lineage-specific characters in the process and explore the deep conservation among different molluscan lineages. RESULTS: We investigated the early shell field morphogenesis in the patellogastropod Lottia goshimai using multiple techniques. Electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological characters for the central and peripheral cells of the characteristic rosette-like shell field. Gene expression analysis and F-actin staining suggested that the shell field morphogenesis in this species predominantly relied on cell movement and F-actin dynamics, while BrdU assay revealed that cell proliferation contributed little to the process. We found constant contacts between ectodermal and meso/endodermal tissues during the early stages of shell field morphogenesis, which did not support the induction of shell field by endodermal tissues in general, but a potential stage-specific induction was indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results emphasize the roles of cell movement and F-actin dynamics during the morphogenesis of the shell field in Lo. goshimai, and suggest potential regulators such as diffusible factors and F-actin modulators. These findings reflect the differences in shell field morphogenesis of different gastropods, and add to the knowledge of molluscan larval shell formation.","Yang, Weihong; Huan, Pin; Liu, Baozhong",BMC Dev Biol,260,1

Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines have become the front-runners because of their safety profiles, precise and reproducible immune response with more cost-effective and faster production than other types of vaccines. However, the physicochemical properties of naked mRNA necessitate innovative delivery technologies to ferry these 'messengers' to ribosomes inside cells by crossing various barriers and subsequently induce an immune response. Intracellular delivery followed by endosomal escape represents the key strategies for cytoplasmic delivery of mRNA vaccines to the target. This Perspective provides insights into how state-of-the-art nanotechnology helps break the delivery barriers and advance the development of mRNA vaccines.

Nevertheless, this influential group's attitudes are not well understood, which undermines our ability to discern consensuses or disagreements between AI/ML researchers. To examine these researchers' views, we conducted a survey of those who published in the top AI/ML conferences (N = 524). We compare these results with those from a 2016 survey of AI/ML researchers (Grace, Salvatier, Dafoe, Zhang,&Evans, 2018) and a 2018 survey of the US public (Zhang&Dafoe, 2020). We find that AI/ML researchers place high levels of trust in international organizations and scientific organizations to shape the development and use of AI in the public interest; moderate trust in most Western tech companies; and low trust in national militaries, Chinese tech companies, and Facebook. While the respondents were overwhelmingly opposed to AI/ML researchers working on lethal autonomous weapons, they are less opposed to researchers working on other military applications of AI, particularly logistics algorithms. A strong majority of respondents think that AI safety research should be prioritized and that ML institutions should conduct pre-publication review to assess potential harms. Being closer to the technology itself, AI/ML re-searchers are well placed to highlight new risks and develop technical solutions, so this novel attempt to measure their attitudes has broad relevance. The findings should help to improve how researchers, private sector executives, and policymakers think about regulations, governance frameworks, guiding principles, and national and international governance strategies for AI.","Zhang, Baobao; Anderljung, Markus; Kahn, Lauren; Dreksler, Noemi; Horowitz, Michael C.; Dafoe, Allan",,260,24

From the epidemiological data, the picture emerges that the more severe etiopathologies among COVID-19 patients are found in elderly people. The risk of death due to COVID-19 increases exponentially with age. Eight out of 10 COVID-19 related deaths occur in people older than 65 years of age. Older patients with comorbid conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer have a much higher case fatality rate. Governments and public health authorities all over the world have realized that protections of vulnerable older adults should be a priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was originally transmitted likely from a bat or a pangolin to humans. Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, similar to other coronaviruses, can infect several species of animals, including companion animals such as dogs, cats, and ferrets although their viral loads remain low. While the main source of infection transmission therefore is human to human, there are a few rare cases of pets contracting the infection from a SARS-CoV-2-infected human. Although there is no evidence that pets actively transmit SARS-CoV-2 via animal-to-human transmission, senior pet ownership potentially may pose a small risk to older adults by (1) potentially enabling animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the most vulnerable population and (2) by increasing the exposition risk for the elderly due to the necessity to care for the pet and, in the case of dogs, to take them outside the house several times per day. In this overview, the available evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pets is considered and the potential for spread of COVID-19 from companion animals to older individuals and the importance of prevention are discussed.","Csiszar, Anna; Jakab, Ferenc; Valencak, Teresa G; Lanszki, Zsófia; Tóth, Gábor Endre; Kemenesi, Gábor; Tarantini, Stefano; Fazekas-Pongor, Vince; Ungvari, Zoltan",Geroscience,260,16

METHODS: In this prospective, monocentric, case series study, consecutive patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria benefited from an early postmortem structural brain MRI: death <24 hours, SARS-CoV-2 detection on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, chest CT scan suggestive of COVID-19, absence of known focal brain lesion, and MRI compatibility. RESULTS: Among the 62 patients who died of COVID-19 from March 31, 2020, to April 24, 2020, at our institution, 19 decedents fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Parenchymal brain abnormalities were observed in 4 decedents: subcortical microbleeds and macrobleeds (2 decedents), cortico-subcortical edematous changes evocative of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES; 1 decedent), and nonspecific deep white matter changes (1 decedent). Asymmetric olfactory bulbs were found in 4 other decedents without downstream olfactory tract abnormalities. No brainstem MRI signal abnormality was observed.

Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID-19 publications through to 30 September 2020. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies of all designs, except for case-control, that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID-19 and that reported estimates of test accuracy or provided data from which we could compute estimates. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The review authors independently and in duplicate screened articles, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS-2 domain-list. We presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity using paired forest plots, and we summarised pooled estimates in tables. We used a bivariate meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented the uncertainty of accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We included 51 studies with 19,775 participants suspected of having COVID-19, of whom 10,155 (51%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19. Forty-seven studies evaluated one imaging modality each, and four studies evaluated two imaging modalities each. All studies used RT-PCR as the reference standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, with 47 studies using only RT-PCR and four studies using a combination of RT-PCR and other criteria (such as clinical signs, imaging tests, positive contacts, and follow-up phone calls) as the reference standard. Studies were conducted in Europe (33), Asia (13), North America (3) and South America (2); including only adults (26), all ages (21), children only (1), adults over 70 years (1), and unclear (2); in inpatients (2), outpatients (32), and setting unclear (17). Risk of bias was high or unclear in thirty-two (63%) studies with respect to participant selection, 40 (78%) studies with respect to reference standard, 30 (59%) studies with respect to index test, and 24 (47%) studies with respect to participant flow. For chest CT (41 studies, 16,133 participants, 8110 (50%) cases), the sensitivity ranged from 56.3% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 25.4% to 97.4%. The pooled sensitivity of chest CT was 87.9% (95% CI 84.6 to 90.6) and the pooled specificity was 80.0% (95% CI 74.9 to 84.3). There was no statistical evidence indicating that reference standard conduct and definition for index test positivity were sources of heterogeneity for CT studies. Nine chest CT studies (2807 participants, 1139 (41%) cases) used the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) scoring system, which has five thresholds to define index test positivity. At a CO-RADS threshold of 5 (7 studies), the sensitivity ranged from 41.5% to 77.9% and the pooled sensitivity was 67.0% (95% CI 56.4 to 76.2); the specificity ranged from 83.5% to 96.2%; and the pooled specificity was 91.3% (95% CI 87.6 to 94.0). At a CO-RADS threshold of 4 (7 studies), the sensitivity ranged from 56.3% to 92.9% and the pooled sensitivity was 83.5% (95% CI 74.4 to 89.7); the specificity ranged from 77.2% to 90.4% and the pooled specificity was 83.6% (95% CI 80.5 to 86.4). For chest X-ray (9 studies, 3694 participants, 2111 (57%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 51.9% to 94.4% and specificity ranged from 40.4% to 88.9%. The pooled sensitivity of chest X-ray was 80.6% (95% CI 69.1 to 88.6) and the pooled specificity was 71.5% (95% CI 59.8 to 80.8). For ultrasound of the lungs (5 studies, 446 participants, 211 (47%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 68.2% to 96.8% and specificity ranged from 21.3% to 78.9%. The pooled sensitivity of ultrasound was 86.4% (95% CI 72.7 to 93.9) and the pooled specificity was 54.6% (95% CI 35.3 to 72.6). Based on an indirect comparison using all included studies, chest CT had a higher specificity than ultrasound. For indirect comparisons of chest CT and chest X-ray, or chest X-ray and ultrasound, the data did not show differences in specificity or sensitivity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that chest CT is sensitive and moderately specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest X-ray is moderately sensitive and moderately specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Ultrasound is sensitive but not specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus, chest CT and ultrasound may have more utility for excluding COVID-19 than for differentiating SARS-CoV-2 infection from other causes of respiratory illness. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should pre-define positive imaging findings, include direct comparisons of the various modalities of interest in the same participant population, and implement improved reporting practices.","Islam, Nayaar; Ebrahimzadeh, Sanam; Salameh, Jean-Paul; Kazi, Sakib; Fabiano, Nicholas; Treanor, Lee; Absi, Marissa; Hallgrimson, Zachary; Leeflang, Mariska Mg; Hooft, Lotty; van der Pol, Christian B; Prager, Ross; Hare, Samanjit S; Dennie, Carole; Spijker, René; Deeks, Jonathan J; Dinnes, Jacqueline; Jenniskens, Kevin; Korevaar, Daniël A; Cohen, Jérémie F; Van den Bruel, Ann; Takwoingi, Yemisi; van de Wijgert, Janneke; Damen, Johanna Aag; Wang, Junfeng; McInnes, Matthew Df",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,260,16

Early research showed thoracic (chest) imaging to be sensitive but not specific in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, this is a rapidly developing field and these findings need to be re-evaluated in the light of new research. This is the first update of this 'living systematic review'. This update focuses on people suspected of having COVID-19 and excludes studies with only confirmed COVID-19 participants. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray and ultrasound) in people with suspected COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID-19 publications through to 22 June 2020. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies of all designs that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID-19, and which reported estimates of test accuracy, or provided data from which estimates could be computed. When studies used a variety of reference standards, we retained the classification of participants as COVID-19 positive or negative as used in the study. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS-2 domain-list independently, in duplicate. We categorised included studies into three groups based on classification of index test results: studies that reported specific criteria for index test positivity (group 1); studies that did not report specific criteria, but had the test reader(s) explicitly classify the imaging test result as either COVID-19 positive or negative (group 2); and studies that reported an overview of index test findings, without explicitly classifying the imaging test as either COVID-19 positive or negative (group 3). We presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity using paired forest plots, and summarised in tables. We used a bivariate meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented uncertainty of the accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We included 34 studies: 30 were cross-sectional studies with 8491 participants suspected of COVID-19, of which 4575 (54%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19; four were case-control studies with 848 cases and controls in total, of which 464 (55%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT was evaluated in 31 studies (8014 participants, 4224 (53%) cases), chest X-ray in three studies (1243 participants, 784 (63%) cases), and ultrasound of the lungs in one study (100 participants, 31 (31%) cases). Twenty-six per cent (9/34) of all studies were available only as preprints. Nineteen studies were conducted in Asia, 10 in Europe, four in North America and one in Australia. Sixteen studies included only adults, 15 studies included both adults and children and one included only children. Two studies did not report the ages of participants. Twenty-four studies included inpatients, four studies included outpatients, while the remaining six studies were conducted in unclear settings. The majority of included studies had a high or unclear risk of bias with respect to participant selection, index test, reference standard, and participant flow. For chest CT in suspected COVID-19 participants (31 studies, 8014 participants, 4224 (53%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 57.4% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 0% to 96.0%. The pooled sensitivity of chest CT in suspected COVID-19 participants was 89.9% (95% CI 85.7 to 92.9) and the pooled specificity was 61.1% (95% CI 42.3 to 77.1). Sensitivity analyses showed that when the studies from China were excluded, the studies from other countries demonstrated higher specificity compared to the overall included studies. When studies that did not classify index tests as positive or negative for COVID-19 (group 3) were excluded, the remaining studies (groups 1 and 2) demonstrated higher specificity compared to the overall included studies. Sensitivity analyses limited to cross-sectional studies, or studies where at least two reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were conducted if the first was negative, did not substantively alter the accuracy estimates. We did not identify publication status as a source of heterogeneity. For chest X-ray in suspected COVID-19 participants (3 studies, 1243 participants, 784 (63%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 56.9% to 89.0% and specificity from 11.1% to 88.9%. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound of the lungs in suspected COVID-19 participants (1 study, 100 participants, 31 (31%) cases) were 96.8% and 62.3%, respectively. We could not perform a meta-analysis for chest X-ray or ultrasound due to the limited number of included studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that chest CT is sensitive and moderately specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected patients, meaning that CT may have limited capability in differentiating SARS-CoV-2 infection from other causes of respiratory illness. However, we are limited in our confidence in these results due to the poor study quality and the heterogeneity of included studies. Because of limited data, accuracy estimates of chest X-ray and ultrasound of the lungs for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases should be carefully interpreted. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should pre-define positive imaging findings, include direct comparisons of the various modalities of interest on the same participant population, and implement improved reporting practices. Planned updates of this review will aim to: increase precision around the accuracy estimates for chest CT (ideally with low risk of bias studies); obtain further data to inform accuracy of chest X-rays and ultrasound; and obtain data to further fulfil secondary objectives (e.g. 'threshold' effects, comparing accuracy estimates across different imaging modalities) to inform the utility of imaging along different diagnostic pathways.","Islam, Nayaar; Salameh, Jean-Paul; Leeflang, Mariska Mg; Hooft, Lotty; McGrath, Trevor A; van der Pol, Christian B; Frank, Robert A; Kazi, Sakib; Prager, Ross; Hare, Samanjit S; Dennie, Carole; Spijker, René; Deeks, Jonathan J; Dinnes, Jacqueline; Jenniskens, Kevin; Korevaar, Daniël A; Cohen, Jérémie F; Van den Bruel, Ann; Takwoingi, Yemisi; van de Wijgert, Janneke; Wang, Junfeng; McInnes, Matthew Df",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,260,16

With the increase in the number of patients, there was a slight increase in the incidence of various complications. In particular, infectious and inflammatory diseases of the face and jaw are observed in patients with COVID-19 in the early infectious stages of the disease, as well as in the late stages. In the previous literature, as a sign or complication of COVID-19 were mentioned cases of changes in the oral cavity - ulcers, rashes, and inflammation of salivary glands. The conditions presented in this article are a serious complication of COVID-19, radically different from the usual course of osteomyelitis, in which the patient has a course with a predominance of long-term, chronic-progressive, atrophic processes. Treatment was somewhat ineffective due to local chronic inflammation (pansinusitis), metabolic, microcirculatory, immune, and coagulation disorders in patients.","Boymuradov, Sh A.; Rustamova, D.

To contain this virus, researchers are working around the clock for a solution in the form of vaccine. Due to the impact of this pandemic, the economy and healthcare have immensely suffered around the globe. Thus, an efficient vaccine design is the need of the hour. Moreover, to have a generalised vaccine for heterogeneous human population, the virus genomes from different countries should be considered. Thus, in this work, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries around the globe in order to identify the potential conserved regions for the development of peptide based synthetic vaccine viz. epitopes with high immunogenic and antigenic scores. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment technique viz. Clustal Omega is used to align the 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes. Thereafter, entropy is computed for each genomic coordinate of the aligned genomes. The entropy values are then used to find the conserved regions. These conserved regions are refined based on the criteria that their lengths should be greater than or equal to 60 nt and their corresponding protein sequences are without any stop codons. Furthermore, Nucleotide BLAST is used to verify the specificity of the conserved regions. As a result, we have obtained 17 conserved regions that belong to NSP3, NSP4, NSP6, NSP8, RdRp, Helicase, endoRNAse, 2'-O-RMT, Spike glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, Membrane glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid protein. Finally, these conserved regions are used to identify the T-cell and B-cell epitopes with their corresponding immunogenic and antigenic scores. Based on these scores, the most immunogenic and antigenic epitopes are then selected for each of these 17 conserved regions. Hence, we have obtained 30 MHC-I and 24 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 14 and 13 unique HLA alleles and 21 B-cell epitopes for the 17 conserved regions. Moreover, for validating the relevance of these epitopes, the binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles. Also, the physico-chemical properties of the epitopes are reported along with Ramchandran plots and Z-Scores and the population coverage is shown as well. Overall, the analysis shows that the identified epitopes can be considered as potential candidates for vaccine design.","Ghosh, Nimisha; Sharma, Nikhil; Saha, Indrajit",Infect Genet Evol,260,1

In the past two decades, electrochemical techniques have been used to investigate EET in a wide range of microbes, with emphasis on dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria, such as Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, as model organisms. However, due to the typically bulk nature of these techniques, they are unable to reveal the subpopulation variation in EET or link the observed electrochemical currents to energy gain by individual cells, thus overlooking the potentially complex spatial patterns of activity in bioelectrochemical systems. Here, to address these limitations, we use the cell membrane potential as a bioenergetic indicator of EET by S. oneidensis MR-1 cells. Using a fluorescent membrane potential indicator during in vivo single-cell-level fluorescence microscopy in a bioelectrochemical reactor, we demonstrate that membrane potential strongly correlates with EET. Increasing electrode potential and associated EET current leads to more negative membrane potential. This EET-induced membrane hyperpolarization is spatially limited to cells in contact with the electrode and within a near-electrode zone (<30 µm) where the hyperpolarization decays with increasing cell-electrode distance. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the reported technique can be used to study the single-cell-level dynamics of EET not only on electrode surfaces, but also during respiration of other solid-phase electron acceptors.","Pirbadian, Sahand; Chavez, Marko S; El-Naggar, Mohamed Y",Proc.

The state of emergency that platforms invoked during the COVID-19 pandemic is subsiding, and lawmakers are poised to transform the regulatory landscape. What emerges from this moment will shape the most important channels for communication in the modern era and have profound consequences for individuals, societies, and democratic governance. Tracing the path to this point illuminates the tasks that the institutions created during this transformation must be designed to do. This history shows that where online speech governance was once dominated by the First Amendment tradition's categorical and individualistic approach to adjudicating speech conflicts, that approach became strained, and online speech governance now revolves around two other principles: proportionality and probability. Proportionality requires no longer focusing on the speech interest in an individual post alone, but also taking account of other societal interests that can justify proportionate limitations on content. But the unfathomable scale of online speech makes enforcement of rules only ever a matter of probability: Content moderation will always involve error, and so the pertinent questions are what error rates are reasonable and which kinds of errors should be preferred. Platforms' actions during the pandemic have thrown into stark relief the centrality of these principles to online speech governance and also how undertheorized they remain. This Article reviews the causes of this shift from a ""posts-as-trumps"" approach to online speech governance to one of systemic balancing and what this new era of content moderation entails for platforms and their regulators.","Douek, Evelyn",Columbia Law Review,260,6

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to explore risk factors of mortality and ICU admission in COVID-19 patients using combined CT and clinicolaboratory data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 (N= 63) from University Hospitals in Tehran, Iran were studied. All patients underwent CT examination and a total CT score and the number of involved lung lobes were calculated and compared against collected laboratory and clinical information. Univariable and multivariate proportional hazards analysis were used to determine the relationship between the CT, laboratory and clinical data and ICU admission and in-hospital death. RESULTS: By univariable analysis, in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with lower O2 saturation on admission (<88%), higher CT scores and higher number of lung lobes (> 4) involved with a diffuse parenchymal pattern. By multivariable analysis, in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with O2 saturation below 88% on admission and a higher number of lung lobes involved with diffuse parenchymal pattern. The risk of ICU admission was higher with comorbidities (hypertension and ischemic heart disease), SaO2 below 88% and pericardial effusion.

The effects will continue to grow and worsen if economies begin to open without the proper precautions, including expanded diagnostic capabilities. To address this need for increased testing, we have developed a sensitive reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay compatible with current reagents, which utilizes a colorimetric readout in as little as 30 min. A rapid inactivation protocol capable of inactivating virions, as well as endogenous nucleases, was optimized to increase sensitivity and sample stability. This protocol, combined with the RT-LAMP assay, has a sensitivity of at least 50 viral RNA copies per microliter in a sample. To further increase the sensitivity, a purification protocol compatible with this inactivation method was developed. The inactivation and purification protocol, combined with the RT-LAMP assay, brings the sensitivity to at least 1 viral RNA copy per microliter in a sample. This simple inactivation and purification pipeline is inexpensive and compatible with other downstream RNA detection platforms and uses readily available reagents. It should increase the availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing as well as expand the settings in which this testing can be performed.","Rabe, Brian A; Cepko, Constance",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,260,1

Apart from being studied by legal scholars, the notion of vulnerability has been embodied in concrete legal rules and transferred to national case law allowing courts to set its boundaries by the power of judicial interpretation. Even though it would be hard to contest Schroeder and Gefenas's statement that it is not necessary for an academic to say what vulnerability is because common sense dictates the existence of it, recent scholarly analysis clearly shows that the concept itself has become intolerably vague and slippery. More precisely, it is not quite clear what the essence of vulnerability is and what the effects of its gradation as well as repercussions are on other constitutional institutes across the human rights spectrum. The noted vagueness poses a great concern, particularly in the time of COVID-19, the greatest social stressor that humanity has faced in recent months. The COVID-19 crisis has had untold consequences on our health, mental well-being, educational growth, and economic stability. In order for the state to bear the COVID-19 social burden and adequately protect the vulnerable, it is of the utmost importance to set clear guidance for the interpretation and implementation of the vulnerability concept. Seeking to contribute to literature on these issues, the author brings light to constitutional and criminal legal standards on vulnerability set within the current jurisprudence and doctrine. Bearing in mind the influence of the European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter, the ECtHR or the Court) on developments in human rights law, 196 judgments related to vulnerability have been retrieved from the HUDOC database using a keywords search strategy. The quantitative analysis was supplemented with more in-depth qualitative linguistic research of the Court's reasoning in cases concerning vulnerable children, persons suffering from mental illness and victims of family violence. Although the vulnerability reasoning has considerably expended their rights within the ambit of the Convention, the analysis has shown that inconsistencies and ambiguities emerge around the formulation of the applicant's vulnerability and its gradation with respect to positive obligations.

However, the cost and technical finesse of manufacturing infrared optical components remain a major barrier towards the democratization of these technologies. In this report, we present a solution processed plasmonic reflective filter or PRF as a scalable and inexpensive thermal infrared optic. The PRF selectively absorbs sunlight and specularly reflects thermal infrared TIR wavelengths with performance comparable to state-of-the-art TIR optics made of materials like Germanium. Unlike traditional infrared optical components, however, the PRF can be conveniently fabricated using inexpensive materials and a dip and dry chemical synthesis technique, and crucially, has manufacturing costs that are orders of magnitude lower. We experimentally demonstrate the core optical functionality of the PRF, as well as its integration into infrared imaging and sensing systems without compromising their thermographic or radiometric capabilities. From a practical standpoint, the inexpensive and convenient fabricability of the PRF represent a significant advance towards making the benefits of thermal imaging and sensing systems more affordable and accessible. Scientifically, our work demonstrates a previously unexplored optical functionality and a new direction for versatile chemical synthesis in designing optical components.","Mandal, Jyotirmoy; Brewer, John; Mandal, Sagar; Raman, Aaswath P.",,260,24

But this epidemic has not affected all regions equally. We analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital stroke admissions and in-hospital mortality in tertiary referral hospitals from North-West Spain. METHODS: Spanish multicenter retrospective observational study based on data from tertiary hospitals of the NORDICTUS network. We recorded the number of patients admitted for ischemic stroke between 30 December 2019 and 3 May 2020, the number of IVT and EVT procedures, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In the study period, 2737 patients were admitted with ischemic stroke. There was a decrease in the weekly mean admitted patients during the pandemic (124 vs. 173, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality of stroke patients increased significantly (9.9% vs. 6.5%, p = 0.003), but there were no differences in the proportion of IVT (17.3% vs. 16.1%, p = 0.405) or EVT (22% vs. 23%, p = 0.504). CONCLUSION: We found a decrease in the number of ischemic stroke admissions and an increase in in-hospital mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic in this large study from North-West Spain.

CT scans are often over-utilized and ordered before a surgeon has evaluated the patient. Our aim was to develop a tool using machine learning (ML) algorithms that would help determine if there would be benefit in obtaining a CT scan prior to surgeon consultation. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 100 randomly selected cases who underwent appendectomy and 100 randomly selected controls was completed. Variables included components of the patient's history, laboratory values, CT readings, and pathology. Pathology was used as the gold standard for appendicitis diagnosis. All variables were then used to build the ML algorithms. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayesian Network Classifiers (BNC) models with and without CT scan results were trained and compared to CT scan results alone and the Alvarado score using area under the Receiver Operator Curve (ROC), sensitivity, and specificity measures as well as calibration indices from 500 bootstrapped samples. RESULTS: Among the cases that underwent appendectomy, 88% had pathology-confirmed appendicitis. All the ML algorithms had better sensitivity, specificity, and ROC than the Alvarado score. SVM with and without CT had the best indices and could predict if imaging would aid in appendicitis diagnosis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that SVM with and without CT results can be used for selective imaging in the diagnosis of appendicitis. This study serves as the initial step and proof-of-concept to externally validate these results with larger and more diverse patient population.","Gunasingha, Rathnayaka M K D; Grey, Scott F; Munoz, Beau; Schobel, Seth; Lee, Joseph; Erwin, Casey; Irons, Thomas; McMillan, Elizabeth; Unselt, Desiree; Elster, Eric; Bradley, Matthew",World j. sur,260,20

A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 844 pregnant women or those who gave birth in the last 6 months before the study. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the presence of significant associations, and an adjusted odds ratio with 95%CI was employed for the strength and directions of association between the independent and outcome variables.

Ethnobiology and ethnomedicine-centred research has moved at the (partially artificial and fictitious) interface between nature and culture and has investigated human consumption of wild foods and wild animals, as well as the use of wild animals or their parts for medicinal and other purposes, along with the associated knowledge, skills, practices, and beliefs. Little attention has been paid, however, to the complex interplay of social and cultural reasons behind the increasing pressure on wildlife. The available literature suggest that there are two main drivers that enhance the necessary conditions for infectious diseases to cross the species barrier from wild animals to humans: (1) the encroachment of human activities (e.g., logging, mining, agricultural expansion) into wild areas and forests and consequent ecological disruptions; and, connected to the former, (2) the commodification of wild animals (and natural resources in general) and an expanding demand and market for wild meat and live wild animals, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical areas. In particular, a crucial role may have been played by the bushmeat-euphoria and attached elitist gastronomies and conspicuous consumption phenomena. The COVID-19 pandemic will likely require ethnobiologists to reschedule research agendas and to envision new epistemological trajectories aimed at more effectively mitigating the mismanagement of natural resources that ultimately threats our and other beings' existence.","Volpato, Gabriele; Fontefrancesco, Michele F; Gruppuso, Paolo; Zocchi, Dauro M; Pieroni, Andrea",J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,260,1

GRP78 is a member of the 70 kDa heat shock family of proteins involved in correcting and clearing misfolded proteins in the ER. In response to cellular stress, GRP78 escapes from the ER and moves to the plasma membrane where it (a) functions as a receptor for many ligands, and (b) behaves as an autoantigen for autoantibodies that contribute to human disease and cancer. Cell surface GRP78 (csGRP78) associates with the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), and is the port of entry for several viruses, including the predictive binding of the novel SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, csGRP78 is found in association with partners as diverse as the teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor 1 (Cripto), the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and the DnaJ-like protein MTJ-1. CsGRP78 also serves as a receptor for a large variety of ligands including activated &#945;2 -macroglobulin (&#945;2 M*), plasminogen kringle 5 (K5), microplasminogen, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), tissue factor (TF), and the prostate apoptosis response-4 protein (Par-4).

This resulted in improved oxygenation as measured by a change in PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (P/F) ratio of 28.7 mmHg while prone, without significant change in heart rate or respiratory rate. Patients on average underwent 5 cycles with a median duration of 3 hours. There were no reported deaths, 7 of the 20 patients (35%) failed non-invasive ventilation and subsequently required intubation and mechanical ventilation. In our cohort of 20 COVID-19 patients with moderate acute hypoxic respiratory failure, prone positioning with non-invasive ventilation resulted in improved oxygenation. Prone positioning with non-invasive ventilation may be considered as an early therapeutic intervention in COVID-19 patients with moderate acute hypoxic respiratory failure.","Burton-Papp, H.

In particular, neurological symptoms involving the central nervous system can lead to acute or long-term consequences. The mechanisms of this neuropathogenesis of SARS-CoV­2 infection and its relation to acute and chronic neurological symptoms are the subject of current studies investigating a potential direct and indirect viral infection of the nervous system. The following review summarizes the current status of neuropathological manifestations, molecular pathogenesis, possible infection pathways in the nervous system, and systemic effects. In addition, an overview of the Germany-wide CNS-COVID19 registry and collaborations is presented, which should contribute to a better understanding of the neurological symptoms of COVID-19.","Ritschel, N; Radbruch, H; Herden, C; Schneider, N; Dittmayer, C; Franz, J; Thomas, C; Silva Boos, G; Pagenstecher, A; Schulz-Schaeffer, W; Stadelmann, C; Glatzel, M; Heppner, F L; Weis, J; Sohrabi, K; Schänzer, A; Németh, A; Acker, T",Pathologe,260,23

In this article, we review the ocular clinical presentations of COVID-19 and the features of the ocular surface that may underline the overall low ocular SARS-CoV-2 infection. We critically evaluate the studies performed in nonhuman primates, ex vivo organ culture ocular models, stem cell derived eye organoids and the differences in infection efficiency observed in different parts of human ocular surface epithelium. Finally, we highlight the additional work that needs to be carried out to understand the immune response of the ocular surface to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be translated into prophylactic treatments that may be applied to other organ systems.","Armstrong, Lyle; Collin, Joseph; Mostafa, Islam; Queen, Rachel; Figueiredo, Francisco C; Lako, Majlinda",Stem cells transl. med.

The impact of bubbling on COVID-19 transmission is challenging to quantify because of the complex social structures involved. We developed a network description of households in the UK, using the configuration model to link households. We explored the impact of bubbling scenarios by joining together households of various sizes. For each bubbling scenario, we calculated the percolation threshold, that is, the number of connections per individual required for a giant component to form, numerically and theoretically. We related the percolation threshold to the household reproduction number. We find that bubbling scenarios in which single-person households join with another household have a minimal impact on network connectivity and transmission potential. Ubiquitous scenarios where all households form a bubble are likely to lead to an extensive transmission that is hard to control. The impact of plausible scenarios, with variable uptake and heterogeneous bubble sizes, can be mitigated with reduced numbers of contacts outside the household. Bubbling of households comes at an increased risk of transmission; however, under certain circumstances risks can be modest and could be balanced by other changes in behaviours.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: In the setting of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the use of prone and supine positioning procedures (PP) has been associated with improved oxygenation resulting in decreased mortality. Nevertheless, applying PP is time consuming for ICU staffs that are at risk of mental of physical exhaustion, especially with the constant surge of admitted COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS. METHODS: This prospective cohort study conducted at a single regional university hospital between March 27 and April 15, 2020. Among 117 patients admitted to ICU, 67 patients (57.3%) presented with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection with severe ARDS requiring PP. After accelerated simulation training, 109 volunteers including surgeons, physicians, nurses and physiotherapists, multiple dedicated teams performed daily multiple PP following a systematic checklist. Patient demographics and PP data were collected. Patient safety and health care workers safety were assessed. RESULTS: Among 117 patients admitted to ICU, 67 patients (57.3%) required PP. Overall, 53 (79%) were male, with a median age of 68.5 years and median body mass index of 29.3âkg/m. A total of 384 PP were performed. Overall, complication occurred in 34 PP (8.8%) and led to PP cancelation in 4 patients (1%). Regarding health care workers safety, four health care workers presented with potential COVID-19 related symptoms and none was positive. CONCLUSIONS: To overcome the surge of critically ill COVID-19 patients, reallocating health care workers to targeted medical tasks beyond their respective expertise such as PP was safe.","Doussot, Alexandre; Ciceron, Floriane; Cerutti, Emilie; Salomon du Mont, Lucie; Thines, Laurent; Capellier, Gilles; Pretalli, Jean-Baptiste; Evrard, Philippe; Vettoretti, Lucie; Garbuio, Patrick; Brunel, Anne-Sophie; Pili-Floury, Sebastien; Lakkis, Zaher",Ann Surg,260,16

Patients with small HCC (<5 cm) are given priority over others for transplantation due to clinical allocation policies based on tumor size. Attempting to shift from the prevalent paradigm that successful transplantation and longer disease-free survival can only be achieved in patients with small HCC to expanding the transplantation option to patients with HCC of the highest tumor burden (>5 cm), we developed a convergent artificial intelligence (AI) model that combines transient clinical data with quantitative histologic and radiomic features for more objective risk assessment of liver transplantation for HCC patients. METHODS: Patients who received a LT for HCC between 2008-2019 were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. All patients with post-LT recurrence were included, and those without recurrence were randomly selected for inclusion in the deep learning model. Pre- and post-transplant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and reports were compressed using CapsNet networks and natural language processing, respectively, as input for a multiple feature radial basis function network. We applied a histological image analysis algorithm to detect pathologic areas of interest from explant tissue of patients who recurred. The multilayer perceptron was designed as a feed-forward, supervised neural network topology, with the final assessment of recurrence risk. We used area under the curve (AUC) and F-1 score to assess the predictability of different network combinations. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients were included (87 in the training group, 22 in the testing group), of which 20 were positive for cancer recurrence. Seven models (AUC; F-1 score) were generated, including clinical features only (0.55; 0.52), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) only (0.64; 0.61), pathological images only (0.64; 0.61), MRI plus pathology (0.68; 0.65), MRI plus clinical (0.78, 0.75), pathology plus clinical (0.77; 0.73), and a combination of clinical, MRI, and pathology features (0.87; 0.84). The final combined model showed 80 % recall and 89 % precision. The total accuracy of the implemented model was 82 %. CONCLUSION: We validated that the deep learning model combining clinical features and multi-scale histopathologic and radiomic image features can be used to discover risk factors for recurrence beyond tumor size and biomarker analysis. Such a predictive, convergent AI model has the potential to alter the LT allocation system for HCC patients and expand the transplantation treatment option to patients with HCC of the highest tumor burden.","He, Tiancheng; Fong, Joy Nolte; Moore, Linda W; Ezeana, Chika F; Victor, David; Divatia, Mukul; Vasquez, Matthew; Ghobrial, R Mark; Wong, Stephen T C",Comput Med Imaging Graph,260,30

LMICs having an operational cancer control plan committed to screen eligible individuals were selected. Managers/supervisors of cancer screening programs were invited to participate in an online survey and subsequent in-depth interview. Managers/supervisors from 18 programs in 17 countries participated. Lockdown was imposed in all countries except Brazil. Screening was suspended for at least 30 days in 13 countries, while diagnostic-services for screen-positives were suspended in 9 countries. All countries except Cameroon, Bangladesh, India, Honduras and China managed to continue with cancer treatment throughout the outbreak. The participants rated service availability compared to pre-COVID days on a scale of 0 (no activities) to 100 (same as before). A rating of &#8804;50 was given for screening services by 61.1%, diagnostic services by 44.4% and treatment services by 22.2% participants. At least 70% participants strongly agreed that increased noncompliance of screen-positive individuals and staff being overloaded or overwhelmed with backlogs would deeply impact screening programs in the next 6 months at least. Although many of the LMICs were deficient in following the ""best practices"" to minimize service disruptions, at least some of them made significant efforts to improve screening participation, treatment compliance and program organization. A well-coordinated effort is needed to reinitiate screening services in the LMICs, starting with a situational analysis. Innovative strategies adopted by the programs to keep services on-track should be mutually shared.","Villain, Patricia; Carvalho, Andre L; Lucas, Eric; Mosquera, Isabel; Zhang, Li; Muwonge, Richard; Selmouni, Farida; Sauvaget, Catherine; Basu, Partha",Int. j. cancer,260,29

METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients admitted to an academic-level ED in France who were undergoing a joint measurement of SpO2 and arterial blood gas. We compared SpO2 with SaO2 and evaluated performance of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio for the prediction of 300 and 400 mmHg PaO2/FiO2 cut-off values in COVID-19 positive and negative subgroups using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: During the study period from February to April 2020, a total of 430 arterial samples were analyzed and collected from 395 patients. The area under the ROC curves of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio was 0.918 (CI 95% 0.885-0.950) and 0.901 (CI 95% 0.872-0.930) for PaO2/FiO2 thresholds of 300 and 400 mmHg, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) of an SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 350 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 300 mmHg was 0.88 (CI95% 0.84-0.91), whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) of the SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 470 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 400 mmHg was 0.89 (CI95% 0.75-0.96). No significant differences were found between the subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The SpO2/FiO2 ratio may be a reliable tool for hypoxemia screening among patients admitted to the ED, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","Catoire, Pierre; Tellier, Eric; de la Rivière, Caroline; Beauvieux, Marie-Christine; Valdenaire, Guillaume; Galinski, Michel; Revel, Philippe; Combes, Xavier; Gil-Jardiné, Cédric",Am J Emerg Med,260,6

Ultrasound (US) of the inferior vena cava (IVC) may be a fast, noninvasive tool to gauge volume status, but its utility is unclear. Our objectives were to determine the interobserver agreement of IVC collapse and collapse duration, then correlate IVC collapse with the outcome of intravenous (IV) versus oral (PO) rehydration. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study by enrolling patients 0 to 21 years old with emesis requiring ondansetron or diarrhea requiring IV hydration. Clinical operators interpreted US examinations in real time to determine whether the IVC was collapsed. Two blinded reviewers interpreted the US videos to determine IVC collapse and collapse duration. Cohen's kappa(&#954;) was calculated for reviewer-reviewer and reviewer-operator agreement. Primary outcomes were PO versus IV rehydration, and admitted versus discharged. RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients were enrolled, and 102 had complete data for analysis. The mean age was 7.2 years with 51% female. Twenty-nine patients received IV hydration. The reviewer-operator agreement for IVC collapse was &#954; = 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.75) and interreviewer agreement was &#954; = 0.93 (95% CI, 0.83-1.0). The interreviewer agreement for collapse duration was &#954; = 0.66 (95% CI, 0.51-0.82). All patients with noncollapsed IVCs tolerated PO hydration. The likelihood of receiving IV hydration was correlated with the duration of IVC collapse (P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Based on a novel dynamic measure of IVC collapse duration, children with increasing duration of IVC collapse correlated positively with the need for IV rehydration. Noncollapsing IVCs on US were associated with successful PO rehydration without need for IV fluids or emergency department revisits.","Zhou, Amy Z; Green, Robert S; Haines, Elizabeth J; Vazquez, Michelle N; Tay, Ee T; Tsung, James W",Pediatr. emerg. care,260,20

Proteases are central to the infection process of SARS-CoV-2. Cleavage of the spike protein on the virus's capsid causes the conformational change that leads to membrane fusion and viral entry into the target cell. Since inhibition of one protease, even the dominant protease like TMPRSS2, may not be sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, other proteases that may play an activating role and hydrolyze the spike protein must be identified. We identified amino acid sequences in all regions of spike protein, including the S1/S2 region critical for activation and viral entry, that are susceptible to cleavage by furin and cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V using PACMANS, a computational platform that identifies and ranks preferred sites of proteolytic cleavage on substrates, and verified with molecular docking analysis and immunoblotting to determine if binding of these proteases can occur on the spike protein that were identified as possible cleavage sites. Together, this study highlights cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V for consideration in SARS-CoV-2 infection and presents methodologies by which other proteases can be screened to determine a role in viral entry. This highlights additional proteases to be considered in COVID-19 studies, particularly regarding exacerbated damage in inflammatory preconditions where these proteases are generally upregulated.","Bollavaram, Keval; Leeman, Tiffanie H; Lee, Maggie W; Kulkarni, Akhil; Upshaw, Sophia G; Yang, Jiabei; Song, Hannah; Platt, Manu O",Protein Sci,260,1

Orf9b is a unique accessory protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. It is implicated in immune evasion by targeting mitochondria, where it associates with the versatile adapter TOM70. Here, we determined the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 orf9b in complex with the cytosolic segment of human TOM70 to 2.2 Å. A central portion of orf9b occupies the deep pocket in the TOM70 C-terminal domain (CTD) and adopts a helical conformation strikingly different from the ß-sheet-rich structure of the orf9b homodimer. Interactions between orf9b and TOM70 CTD are primarily hydrophobic and distinct from the electrostatic interaction between the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) EEVD motif and the TOM70 N-terminal domain (NTD). Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we demonstrated that the orf9b dimer does not bind TOM70, but a synthetic peptide harboring a segment of orf9b (denoted C-peptide) binds TOM70 with nanomolar KD. While the interaction between C-peptide and TOM70 CTD is an endothermic process, the interaction between Hsp90 EEVD and TOM70 NTD is exothermic, which underscores the distinct binding mechanisms at NTD and CTD pockets. Strikingly, the binding affinity of Hsp90 EEVD motif to TOM70 NTD is reduced by ~29-fold when orf9b occupies the pocket of TOM70 CTD, supporting the hypothesis that orf9b allosterically inhibits the Hsp90/TOM70 interaction. Our findings shed light on the mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 orf9b mediated suppression of interferon responses.","Gao, Xiaopan; Zhu, Kaixiang; Qin, Bo; Olieric, Vincent; Wang, Meitian; Cui, Sheng",Nat Commun,260,29

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shares some similarities with IPF. SARS-CoV-2 related genes have been reported to be broadly regulated by N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification. Here, we identified the association between m6A methylation regulators, COVID-19 infection pathways, and immune responses in IPF. The characteristic gene expression networks and immune infiltration patterns of m6A-SARS-CoV-2 related genes in different tissues of IPF were revealed. We subsequently evaluated the influence of these related gene expression patterns and immune infiltration patterns on the prognosis/lung function of IPF patients. The IPF cohort was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to identify the correlations among genes or cells. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to assess the infiltration of 22 types of immune cells. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and proportional hazards model (Cox model) were used to develop the prognosis prediction model. Our research is pivotal for further understanding of the cellular and genetic links between IPF and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may contribute to providing new ideas for prognosis assessment and treatment of both diseases.","Li, Xinyu; Peng, Cheng; Zhu, Ziqing; Cai, Haozheng; Zhuang, Quan",Aging (Albany NY),260,9

As we write, infection rates are at their highest point globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to more infectious variants. The primary target of SARS-CoV-2 is the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predict that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order. Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results while finding additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The aim of the study was to estimate sensitivity of admission LUS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 lung involvement using Chest-CT (Computed Tomography) as reference standard in order to assess LUS usefulness in ruling out COVID-19 pneumonia in the Emergency Department (ED). Methods: Eighty-two patients with confirmed COVID-19 and signs of lung involvement on Chest-CT were consecutively admitted to our hospital and recruited in the study. Chest-CT and LUS examination were concurrently performed within the first 6-12h from admission. Sensitivity of LUS was calculated using CT findings as a reference standard. Results: Global LUS sensitivity in detecting COVID-19 pulmonary lesions was 52%. LUS sensitivity ranged from 8% in case of focal and sporadic ground-glass opacities (mild disease), to 52% for a crazy-paving pattern (moderate disease) and up to 100% in case of extensive subpleural consolidations (severe disease), although LUS was not always able to detect all the consolidations assessed at Chest-CT. LUS sensitivity was higher in detecting a typical Chest-CT pattern (60%) and abnormalities showing a middle-lower zone predominance (79%). Conclusions: As admission LUS may result falsely negative in most cases, it should not be considered as a reliable imaging tool in ruling out COVID-19 pneumonia in patients presenting in ED. It may at least represent an expanded clinical evaluation that needs integration with other diagnostic tests (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab, Chest-CT).","Quarato, Carla Maria Irene; Mirijello, Antonio; Lacedonia, Donato; Russo, Raffaele; Maggi, Michele Maria; Rea, Gaetano; Simeone, Annalisa; Borelli, Cristina; Feragalli, Beatrice; Scioscia, Giulia; Barbaro, Maria Pia Foschino; Massa, Valentina; De Cosmo, Salvatore; Sperandeo, Marco",Medicina (Kaunas),260,21

Physicians and nurses who had no infectious disease expertise were recruited to provide care to patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge, no studies on their experiences of combating COVID-19 have been published. We aimed to describe the experiences of these health-care providers in the early stages of the outbreak. METHODS: We did a qualitative study using an empirical phenomenological approach. Nurses and physicians were recruited from five COVID-19-designated hospitals in Hubei province using purposive and snowball sampling. They participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews by telephone from Feb 10 to Feb 15, 2020. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Haase's adaptation of Colaizzi's phenomenological method. FINDINGS: We recruited nine nurses and four physicians. Three theme categories emerged from data analysis. The first was ""being fully responsible for patients' wellbeing-'this is my duty'"". Health-care providers volunteered and tried their best to provide care for patients. Nurses had a crucial role in providing intensive care and assisting with activities of daily living. The second category was ""challenges of working on COVID-19 wards"". Health-care providers were challenged by working in a totally new context, exhaustion due to heavy workloads and protective gear, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, feeling powerless to handle patients' conditions, and managing relationships in this stressful situation. The third category was ""resilience amid challenges"". Health-care providers identified many sources of social support and used self-management strategies to cope with the situation. They also achieved transcendence from this unique experience. INTERPRETATION: The intensive work drained health-care providers physically and emotionally. Health-care providers showed their resilience and the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties. Comprehensive support should be provided to safeguard the wellbeing of health-care providers. Regular and intensive training for all health-care providers is necessary to promote preparedness and efficacy in crisis management.

The coagulopathy of COVID-19 is postulated to result from interactions of the inflammatory and immune systems with the coagulation system, manifesting as a cytokine storm associated with hyperinflammation and coagulation and platelet activation. Unique characteristics of VTE in hospitalized and critically ill patients with COVID-19 include the high incidence of VTE (and especially pulmonary embolism) when compared with historical controls; the finding of in situ pulmonary embolism associated with microthrombi, which suggests a thrombotic microangiopathic process in addition to classic macrovessel disease; and, most important from a clinical perspective, the unusually high rate of VTE that has been reported despite standard thromboprophylaxis. This raises the possibility that intermediate or weight-based heparin dosing may be more effective than fixed dosing for thromboprophylaxis in high-risk subsets of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. There have been several guidance statements focusing on the management of VTE in hospitalized and critically ill patients with COVID-19, including the most recent statement by the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, which includes comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of VTE in this patient population. Ongoing randomized trials that address key clinical questions, especially more intense thromboprophylactic strategies and novel antithrombotic approaches, have the potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality from VTE in hospitalized and critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Spyropoulos, Alex C",Blood Adv,260,1

Recombination signal-binding protein J&#954; (RBP-J)-mediated Notch signaling regulates macrophage development and phenotype. Here, using bleomycin-induced fibrosis model combined with myeloid-specific RBP-J disruption (RBP-JcKO ) mouse, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in macrophages during PF. Compared with the control, RBP-JcKO mice exhibited alleviated lung fibrosis as manifested by reduced collagen deposition and inflammation, and decreased TGF-ß production. FACS analysis suggested that decreased Ly6clo MHCIIhi AMs might make the major contribution to attenuated fibrogenesis in RBP-JcKO mice, probably by reduced inflammatory factor release and enhanced matrix metalloproteinases expression. Using clodronate-mediated macrophage depletion in RBP-JckO mice, we demonstrated that embryonic-derived AMs play negligible role in lung fibrosis, which was further supported by adoptive transfer experiments. Moreover, on CCR2 knockout background, the effect of RBP-J deficiency on fibrogenesis was not elicited, suggesting that Notch regulated monocyte-derived AMs. Co-culture experiment showed that monocyte-derived AMs from RBP-JcKO mice exhibit reduced myofibroblast activation due to decreased TGF-ß secretion. In conclusion, monocyte-derived Ly6clo MHCIIhi AMs, which are regulated by RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling, play an essential role in lung fibrosis.","Zhang, Ni; Yang, Kui; Bai, Jian; Yi, Jing; Gao, Chunchen; Zhao, Junlong; Liang, Shiqian; Wei, Tiaoxia; Feng, Lei; Song, Liqiang; Han, Hua; Qin, Hongyan",FASEB j,260,6

In China, some traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have been successfully applied to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and have achieved good clinical results, including the Reyanning mixture. In this study, we systematically analyzed the mechanism of the Reyanning mixture and its effects against SARS-CoV-2 based on the method of network pharmacology. Here, we used the TCM Systems Pharmacology database and employed a similarity algorithm to screen and identify the bioactive ingredients and potential targets of the Reyanning mixture. The GeneCards database was used to predict and screen the disease targets and build the active ingredient target network diagram. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to construct the target signal pathway associations. The STRING tool was used to reconstruct the protein-protein interaction network. As a result, 27 candidate targets, such as tumor necrosis factor, interferon gamma, tumor protein P53, C-reactive protein, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, were identified among the 33 bioactive ingredients of the 4 TCMs in the Reyanning mixture with effects on treating SARS-CoV-2. These targets were significantly enriched in 20 KEGG pathways and associated with 48 diverse GO terms. All of these targets may play a role in inhibiting inflammatory reactions, regulating immune function, and reducing lung injury to achieve the purpose of treating SARS-CoV-2.","Yang, Anping; Liu, Hui; Liu, Fang; Fan, Lixia; Liao, Wanqin; Guo, Jialiang; He, Kan",Nat.

METHODS: We evaluated care disruptions in a longitudinal cohort of non-metastatic breast cancer survivors ages 60-98 from five US regions (n=321). Survivors completed a web-based or telephone survey from May 27, 2020 to September 11, 2020. Care disruptions included self-reported interruptions in ability to see doctors, receive treatment or supportive therapies, or fill prescriptions. Logistic regression models evaluated bivariate and multivariate associations between care disruptions and education, medical, psychosocial and COVID-19-related factors. Multivariate models included age, county COVID-19 rates, comorbidity and post-diagnosis time. RESULTS: There was a high response rate (n=262, 81.6%). Survivors were 32.2 months post-diagnosis (SD 17.5, range 4-73). Nearly half (48%) reported a medical disruption. The unadjusted odds of care disruptions were significantly higher with more education (OR 1.23 per one-year increase, 95% CI 1.09-1.39, p =0.001) and greater depression (OR 1.04 per one-point increase in CES-D score, CI 1.003-1.08, p=0.033);tangible support decreased the odds of disruptions (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-0.99 per one-point increase, p=0.012). There was a trend for associations between disruptions and comorbidity (unadjusted OR 1.13 per 1 added comorbidity, 95% CI 0.99-1.29, p=0.07).

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not yet fully understood. The virus and host factors interplay among distinct outcomes of infected patients. METHODS: Using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) in PubMed, authors searched for articles cotaining information on COVID-19 and the skin. RESULTS: The pathophysiology of the disease is multifactorial: association with innate immune response, hypercoagulability state, lung tissue damage, neurological and/or gastrointestinal tract involvement, monocytic/macrophage activation syndrome, culminating in exaggerated cytokine secretion, called ""cytokine storm"", which leads to worsening and death. These systemic conditions may be associated with cutaneous lesions, that have polymorphic aspects, where at histopathological level show involvement in different skin changes. These lesions may be associated with multisystemic manifestations that could occur due to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and transmembrane serine protease action, allowing the pulmonary infection and possibly skin manifestation. Several reports in literature show cutaneous lesions similar to chilblain, urticarial eruptions, diffuse or disseminated erythema, livedo racemosa, blue toe syndrome, retiform purpura, vesicle trunk, purpuric exanthema or exanthema with clinical aspects of symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE) and others.

Based on drug repurposing strategy, we for the first time reported a novel series of troxipide analogs and then evaluated their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7, PC3, MGC-803, and PC9 cancer cell lines and WPMY-1, most of which showed obvious selectivity toward PC-3 over the other three cancer cell lines and WPMY-1. Compound 5q, especially, could effectively inhibit PC3 with an IC50 value of 0.91 µM, which exhibited around 53-fold selectivity toward WPMY-1. Data indicated that 5q effectively inhibited the colony formation, suppressed the cell migration, and induced G1/S phase arrest in PC3 cells. Also, compound 5q induced cell apoptosis by activating the two apoptotic signaling pathways in PC3 cells: death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway. Compound 5q up-regulated the expression of both pro-apoptotic Bax and P53, while down-regulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression. Besides, compound 5q significantly increased the expression of cleaved caspase 3/9 and cleaved PARP. Therefore, the successful discovery of compound 5q may further validate the feasibility of this theory, which will encourage researchers to reveal undescribed bioactivities in traditional drugs.","Lu, Nan; Huo, Jin-Ling; Wang, Shuai; Yuan, Xiao-Han; Liu, Hong-Min",Eur J Med Chem,260,16

One of the primary concerns associated with this illness is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the pneumonia that accompanies it. Historical literature dating back to the 1940s and earlier contains many reports of successful treatment of pneumonias with ionizing radiation. Although these were not randomized controlled trials, they do suggest a potential avenue for further investigation. Technical details in these reports however were limited. In this work we review the literature and identify details including nominal kilovoltage ranges, filtration, and focus-skin distances (FSDs). Using a freely available and benchmarked code, we generated spectra and used these as sources for Monte Carlo simulations using the EGSnrc software package. The approximate sources were projected through a radiologically anthropomorphic phantom to provide detailed dose distributions within a targeted lung volume (approximate right middle lobe). After accounting for the reported exposure levels, mean lung doses fell in a relatively narrow range: 30 - 80 cGy. Variation in patient dimensions and other details are expected to result in an uncertainty on the order of ± 20%. This result is consistent with the dose range expected to induce anti-inflammatory effects.","Kirkby, Charles; Mackenzie, Marc",Phys. med. biol,260,3

However, the existing systems are run by the people&#x2019;s smartphones and without a strong participation from the people, the systems become ineffective. Moreover, these systems can be misused to spy on people and breach their privacy. Due to recent privacy breaches, people became anxious about their privacy, and without privacy reassurance, the people may not accept the systems. In this paper, we propose a non-participatory privacy-preserving surveillance system for COVID-19-like pandemics. The system aims to control the spread of COVID-19 infection without depending on the participation of the people and with privacy preservation. In the proposed system, surveillance cameras of public places take images of visitors and compute embedding vectors that encode the facial features of the images by using deep learning techniques. A searchable encryption scheme is used by public places to encrypt the embedding vectors and send them to a cloud server (service manager). Similarly, hospitals and test centers send the encryptions of the embedding vectors of the images of positively-tested people to the cloud server. Finally, the server does operations on encrypted data to learn whether an infected person visited a public place for contact tracing without being able to learn the images or identify the visitors of the places and the infected persons, and then it alerts these places to take precautionary measures. Our analysis indicates that our system is secure and can preserve privacy. Our experimental results demonstrate that our system has high success rate and low false alarm rate, and needs low computation and communication overhead and acceptable search time.

This study aimed to identify such factors among patients convalescing from COVID-19. METHODS: This study comprised patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1 and June 30, 2020 and gave consent for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay during their acute and/or convalescent phases. Factors related to elevated antibody titers and the relationship between the days from disease onset and the development of antibody titers were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 84 participants enrolled in the study. Nineteen participants had antibody titers measured during the convalescent phase only, and 65 participants had antibody titers measured during the acute and convalescent phases. The antibody titers peaked in weeks 5 and 6. The stepwise multivariate log-normal analysis revealed that male sex (P = 0.04), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.03), and high C-reactive protein levels during the disease course (P < 0.001) were associated with elevated IgG antibodies. Glucocorticoid use was not associated with antibody titers. CONCLUSION: The study found that high values of maximum CRP levels during the acute phase, male sex, and diabetes mellitus were associated with elevated antibody titers. Antibody titers tended to be highest in the first 5 or 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms.","Kutsuna, Satoshi; Asai, Yusuke; Matsunaga, Akihiro; Kinoshita, Noriko; Terada, Mari; Miyazato, Yusuke; Nakamoto, Takato; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Saito, Sho; Endo, Mio; Kanda, Kohei; Kenji, Maeda; Takasaki, Jin; Hojo, Masayuki; Ishizaka, Yukihito; Ohmagari, Norio",J. infect. chemother,260,25

One of the major sources of noise pollution is road traffic. The WHO reports that around 40% of Europe's population are currently exposed to high noise levels. This study investigates noise pollution in Dublin, Ireland before and after the lockdown imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis was performed using 2020 hourly data from 12 noise monitoring stations. More than 80% of stations recorded high noise levels for more that 60% of the time before the lockdown in Dublin. However, a significant reduction in average and minimum noise levels was observed at all stations during the lockdown period and this can be attributed to reductions in both road and air traffic movements.","Basu, Bidroha; Murphy, Enda; Molter, Anna; Basu, Arunima Sarkar; Sannigrahi, Srikanta; Belmonte, Miguel; Pilla, Francesco",,260,1

Since the accessibility of live virus microneutralisation (MN) assays with SARS-CoV-2 is limited and requires enhanced bio-containment, the approach based on ""pseudotyping"" can be considered a useful complement to other serological assays. After fully characterising lentiviral pseudotypes bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we employed them in pseudotype-based neutralisation assays in order to profile the neutralising activity of human serum samples from an Italian sero-epidemiological study. The results obtained with pseudotype-based neutralisation assays mirrored those obtained when the same panel of sera was tested against the wild type virus, showing an evident convergence of the pseudotype-based neutralisation and MN results. The overall results lead to the conclusion that the pseudotype-based neutralisation assay is a valid alternative to using the wild-type strain, and although this system needs to be optimised and standardised, it can not only complement the classical serological methods, but also allows serological assessments to be made when other methods cannot be employed, especially in a human pandemic context.","Hyseni, Inesa; Molesti, Eleonora; Benincasa, Linda; Piu, Pietro; Casa, Elisa; Temperton, Nigel J; Manenti, Alessandro; Montomoli, Emanuele",Viruses,260,16

The survey participants are more concerned that other family members could catch the virus compared with themselves, and they are worried about its economic impact. The results suggest that how trust is measured is crucial because general trust and social trust have opposite effects on the participants' risk perceptions. People with high general trust perceive less risks associated with COVID-19 compared with people who have low general trust, and people with high social trust perceive more risks compared with people who have low social trust. The results further indicate that perceived risks are important drivers for the acceptance of the government's implemented measures to control COVID-19 and for more precautionary behavior (i.e., contact with fewer people and more hygienic behavior).

Both physical and mental stress could influence their well-being and also affect their work efficiency. There is a need of active intervention to restore and maintain the mental health of the frontline health workers. Thus, it is essential to gain an insight into their problems so that it would enable to identify appropriate solutions. Aim: To get an insight into the stress experienced by the COVID-19 community surveillance workers and to explore the perceptions of stress related trigger factors and coping strategies. Materials and Methods: This qualitative study was based on ""Focus Group Discussion (FGD)"" method and was associated with Nilratan Sircar Medical College & Hospital Kolkata. The participants were COVID-19 community surveillance workers who mainly comprised of ""honorary health workers"" and ""100 days field workers (18-55 years)"", employed in 5 different urban health centers in the Kolkata corporation area during April to June 2020. A total of 55 participants were included in the study in five sessions. Researchers took notes during the session, which was also recorded verbatim. Discussions were mainly conducted over four key areas namely positive aspects of COVID-19 surveillance activities, stress related to surveillance activities, precipitating factors related to stress and coping strategies for these stressful periods. Data was summarised and analysed qualitatively. Results: Participants felt that ""they provided service to the society and understood their importance in breaking the chain of transmission"". ""This job gave them pride of being a part of health system along with income generation"". However, they also expressed about the stressful situation related to the surveillance activity like social ostracisation, verbal and even physical abuse. Inadequate supply of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) was revealed. Most of the surveillance workers were informally trained thus they sought help for formal training for surveillance activity. Conclusion: Although the frontline health care workers felt proud to be involved in the surveillance work, almost all of them expressed apprehension against social stigmatisation, verbal and physical abuse. The need for formal training in surveillance work was evident.","Sain, S.; Mukherjee, S.",Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research,260,3

The majority of the people stayed at home, which had an obvious impact on the occurrence of traumatic fractures. This study aimed to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of traumatic fractures during the COVID-19, and provide reference for targeted control measures for the whole world by proposing China's experiences. METHODS: This was a retrospective & comparative multi-center study with data obtained from 11 hospitals in five provinces of China. Patients were enrolled into this study, who sustained fractures from 20 January to 19 February 2020 and the same period in 2019 (based on Chinese lunar calendar). All patients were divided into two groups: epidemic group (admitted in 2020) and control group (admitted in 2019). The data of patients' demographics (age and gender), injury related data (fracture type, fractured site, osteoporosis fracture, concurrent fractures, injury mechanism, places where fracture occurred, ISS score, Gustilo-Anderson Classification for open fracture), mortality and treatment modality were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 2,489 patients with 2,590 fractures were included. In the epidemic group, there were 865 patients, including 483 (55.8%) males and 382 (44.2%) females with an average age of 53.1 ± 23.1 years (range, 1 to 105). In the control group, there were 1,624 patients, including 876 (53.9%) males and 748 (46.1%) females with an average age of 51.2 ± 21.5 years (range, 1 to 98). Patients in the epidemic group was significantly older than those in the control group (t=-2.046, P = 0.045). For epidemic group, the mostly commonly involved age group was elderly patients, whereas it was middle-aged adults for the control group (&#967;2 = 14.642, P = 0.002). For epidemic group, a total of 576 (66.6%) patients had their fracture occurring at home, while in the control group there was 183 (11.3%). The proportion rates of low energy injuries (79.1%, 684/865), osteoporotic fractures (32.5%, 294/906) and closed fractures (94.5%, 817/865) in the epidemic group were significantly higher when compared to the control group, respectively (34.4%, 559/1624; 26.9%, 453/1684; 91.9%, 1,493/1692; all P<0.05). The proportion rates of Gustilo-Anderson classification (5.5%, 16/865), concurrent fractures (2.3%, 20/865), and injury severity score (15.6 ± 6.7) in epidemic group were significantly lower than those in the control group, respectively (52.8%, 199/1624; 3.9%, 63/1624; 20.1 ± 8.7; all P<0.05). No positive case with COVID-19 was diagnosed in the epidemic group. The mortality rate in the epidemic group (0.46%) was similar with that in the control group (0.43%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed the importance of the measures to restrict people's movement and wear masks in the prevention of the spread of COVID-19. The epidemiological characteristics of traumatic fractures amid the epidemic changes dramatically, and more attempts should be focused on the prevention of low energy injuries of elderly population.","Lv, Hongzhi; Zhang, Qi; Yin, Yingchao; Zhu, Yanbin; Wang, Juan; Hou, Zhiyong; Zhang, Yingze; Chen, Wei",Injury,260,22

OBJECTIVES: We estimated the association between patients' characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome in Mexico. METHODS: This retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalisation and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalisation and adverse outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 236â439 patients were included, with 89â756 (38.0%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8% were hospitalised and 13.0% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalisation and adverse outcome. Current smoking was not associated with adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: This largest ever case series of COVID-19 patients identified risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome. The findings could provide insight for the priorities the need to be set, especially by LMICs, to tackle the pandemic.","Giannouchos, Theodoros V; Sussman, Roberto A; Mier, José M; Poulas, Konstantinos; Farsalinos, Konstantinos",Eur. respir. j,260,15

There is an urgent need for physiological models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection using human disease-relevant cells. COVID-19 pathophysiology includes respiratory failure but involves other organ systems including gut, liver, heart, and pancreas. We present an experimental platform comprised of cell and organoid derivatives from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). A Spike-enabled pseudo-entry virus infects pancreatic endocrine cells, liver organoids, cardiomyocytes, and dopaminergic neurons. Recent clinical studies show a strong association with COVID-19 and diabetes. We find that human pancreatic beta cells and liver organoids are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, further validated using adult primary human islets and adult hepatocyte and cholangiocyte organoids. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused striking expression of chemokines, as also seen in primary human COVID-19 pulmonary autopsy samples. hPSC-derived cells/organoids provide valuable models for understanding the cellular responses of human tissues to SARS-CoV-2 infection and for disease modeling of COVID-19.","Yang, Liuliu; Han, Yuling; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E; Gupta, Vikas; Wang, Pengfei; Duan, Xiaohua; Tang, Xuming; Zhu, Jiajun; Zhao, Zeping; Jaffré, Fabrice; Zhang, Tuo; Kim, Tae Wan; Harschnitz, Oliver; Redmond, David; Houghton, Sean; Liu, Chengyang; Naji, Ali; Ciceri, Gabriele; Guttikonda, Sudha; Bram, Yaron; Nguyen, Duc-Huy T; Cioffi, Michele; Chandar, Vasuretha; Hoagland, Daisy A; Huang, Yaoxing; Xiang, Jenny; Wang, Hui; Lyden, David; Borczuk, Alain; Chen, Huanhuan Joyce; Studer, Lorenz; Pan, Fong Cheng; Ho, David D; tenOever, Benjamin R; Evans, Todd; Schwartz, Robert E; Chen, Shuibing",Cell Stem Cell,260,16

A large number of lipids can be readily detected from a single mass spectrum free from molecular fragmentation that may complicate spectral interpretation. This has been the driving force for MS to play a predominant role in lipidomics. However, elucidation of the detailed lipid structures, especially the location of carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), remains challenging for MS-based lipid analysis workflows. Here we describe the coupling of photochemical derivatization of C=C via Paternò-Büchi (PB) reaction with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to identify C=C locations in unsaturated lipids and quantify lipid C=C location isomers. The PB reaction can be conducted online in ~30 s, which transforms a C=C into the oxetane ring structure. Subjecting PB products of lipids to MS/MS leads to the formation of abundant C=C-specific fragment ions upon low energy collision-induced dissociation.","Hu, Qingyuan; Xia, Yu; Ma, Xiaoxiao",Methods Mol Biol,260,16

Methods: We studied the clinical performance of the Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 Test (index test) on a platform capable of fully automated nucleic acid testing including extraction, amplification, and detection in a single-use cartridge to establish the diagnosis of COVID-19. The study was conducted on a prospective cohort of 112 volunteers with recent symptoms and an unknown SARS-CoV-2 status who came to free screening centers of the Nice metropolitan area. All subjects underwent bilateral nasopharyngeal sampling. One sample was processed using the index test, the other using the standard of care RT-PCR. Samples were treated blind. Results: Most of the participants (70%) were sampled within 4 days of symptom onset. Forty-five (40.2%) were positive for COVID-19. No clinical symptoms were distinguished between SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive and negative subjects except anosmia and dysgeusia.

The basic condition questionnaire, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the Hamilton Depression Scale were adopted as the research tools. In total, 223 valid questionnaires were returned. The sample population was composed of 131 males and 92 females, with an average age of 42.87 ± 21.03 years. The psychological stress status of this febrile population during the isolation period was investigated. Results: The detection rate of problems related to psychological stress among the isolated individuals was high, with anxiety and depression showing the highest incidence rates (33.6% and 16.1%, respectively). The results of the one-way ANOVA analysis showed that age, educational background, marital status, job status, and isolation duration were all correlated with anxiety and depression. Conclusion: The isolated population showed a certain amount of stress, with the most frequently observed conditions being anxiety and depression.

The programme is generic, covering a wide range of professional backgrounds, though most are allied to the social sciences. Students on the programmes are generally mature individuals, senior in their fields, from across the world. They have significant expertise in their professional fields, but often have limited understanding of quantitative research processes, including the use of statistics. This deficit is addressed via a module in Quantitative Research delivered via a series of seven online seminars utilising meeting/webinar applications. Though the use of online technology has become commonplace since the advent of COVID19, its use as a means of delivering a series of discursive, problem-orientated statistics seminars for small groups of students is innovative. Also, learners are required to undertake specific reading and viewing of videos before each seminar so that they become acquainted with key points in advance. During seminars, students discuss specific topics, participate in problem-solving, and learn how to use software for statistical tests. Screensharing permits real-time observation of the use of software. At the end of the seminar series, students are provided with at least one individual online tutorial so that specific issues can be addressed. This Case Study examined learners' views of the Quantitative Research module by means of dialogic interviews. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts indicated that the use of an online seminar series to deliver the module was viewed positively by learners. They particularly appreciated the social aspects of the seminars which helped to remove fears and encourage participation. Understanding was enhanced by viewing short videos before and after the seminars, and by activities during the sessions.

Multiple complications have been reported in this patients related mainly to high inflammation markers such as cytokine storm. However there have been several reports regarding spontaneous pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum unrelated to mechanical ventilation. We report the case of a 77 years old woman with clinical history of COPD diagnosed in 2005 without treatment, she denies exacerbations and refers no spirometric control;as well as diabetes type 2 diagnosed in 2015. She had contact with a positive case of SARS-CoV-2. She presents to our emergency department with a one day history of headache, fever, myalgia, arthralgia, dyspnea as well as oxygen saturation of 88 percent with no supplementary oxygen. Simple chest tomography shows high attenuation diffuse ground glass opacities and bronchiectasis with predominance in lower lobes and hospitalization was offered to what she refused and was discharged with outpatient treatment. She received treatment with high dose steroid and supplementary oxygen. In the following week, she presented progressive dyspnea and increasing oxygen requirements and showed to emergency department one week later with dyspnea, tachypnea and desaturation down to 85% with supplementary oxygen. She was admitted and a new tomography showed increased ground glass opacities with septal thickening as well as pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema with no pneumothorax. Pneumomediastinum is the presence of air in the mediastinum secondary to air leak. COVID-19 has been related to cases of spontaneous air leak with no clear explanation yet. Some authors suggest severe degree of alveolar and interstitial lung architectural damage seen in COVID-19 has a significant effect on alveolar ventilation due to hyaline membranes, fibrin thrombi and infarction. Both ventilation and perfusion are simultaneously affected increasing the degree of hypoxemia and shunt, worsening the perfusion and causing pulmonary tissue ischemic with risk for air leak. Other hypothesis consider viral infiltration of lung parenchyma as well as in visceral and parietal pleura may cause disruption of parenchymal integrity leading to subsequent air leak, related to high inflammation markers as well as an hypercoagulable state. The importance of this case is to be aware of the different complications besides cytokine storm that may affect patients with COVID-19 and not to lose sight on spontaneous events of pneumomediastinum and neumothorax usually associated with adverse outcomes.","Menchaca Dávila, S.; Alonso ZÚÑiga, R.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,260,19

While PD techniques are well described, there is uncertainty about how to determine the amount of PD to be prescribed toward a target dose. The aim of this study is to derive practical equations to assist with the prescription of PD for AKI. METHODS: Using established physiological principles behind PD clearance and membrane transport, a primary determinant of dose delivery, equations were mathematically derived to estimate dialysate volume required to achieve a target dose of PD. RESULTS: The main derivative equation is VD = (1.2 × std-Kt/V × TBW)/(t dwell + 4), where VD is the total dialysate volume per day, std-Kt/V is the desired weekly dose, TBW is the total body water, and t dwell is the dwell time. VD can be expressed in terms of dwell volume, v dwell, by VD = (0.3 × std-Kt/V × TBW) - (6 × v dwell). Two further equations were derived which directly describe the mathematical relationship between t dwell and v dwell. A calculator is included as an Online Supplementary Material. CONCLUSIONS: The equations are intended as a practical tool to estimate solute clearances and guide prescription of continuous PD. The estimated dialysate volume required for any dose target can be calculated from cycle duration or dwell volume. However, the exact target dose of PD is uncertain and should be adjusted according to the clinical circumstances and response to treatment. The equations presented in this article facilitate the adjustment of PD prescription toward the targeted solute clearance.","Chionh, Chang Yin; Finkelstein, Fredric O; Ronco, Claudio",Perit Dial Int,260,1

Akt inhibitor triciribine (TCBN) has demonstrated promising results in promoting recovery from advanced-stage acute lung injury in preclinical studies. In the current study, we tested the direct effect of TCBN on ACE2 expression in human bronchial (H441) and lung alveolar (A549) epithelial cells. Treatment with TCBN resulted in the downregulation of both messenger RNA and protein levels of ACE2 in A549 cells. Since HMGB1 plays a vital role in the inflammatory response in COVID-19, and because hyperglycemia has been linked to increased COVID-19 infections, we determined if HMGB1 and hyperglycemia have any effect on ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells and whether TCBN has any effect on reversing HMGB1- and hyperglycemia-induced ACE2 expression. We observed increased ACE2 expression with both HMGB1 and hyperglycemia treatment in A549 as well as H441 cells, which were blunted by TCBN treatment. Our findings from this study, combined with our previous reports on the potential benefits of TCBN in the treatment of acute lung injury, generate reasonable optimism on the potential utility of TCBN in the therapeutic management of patients with COVID-19.","Adil, Mir S; Verma, Arti; Rudraraju, Madhuri; Narayanan, S Priya; Somanath, Payaningal R",J. cell. physiol,260,26

In the half-century since the discovery of the first cytokines, the interferons, over fifty cytokines have been identified. Amongst these is interleukin (IL)-6, the first and prototypical member of the IL-6 family of cytokines, nearly all of which utilize the common signaling receptor, gp130. In the last decade, there have been numerous advances in our understanding of the structural mechanisms of IL-6 family signaling, particularly for IL-6 itself. However, our understanding of the detailed structural mechanisms underlying signaling by most IL-6 family members remains limited. With the emergence of new roles for IL-6 family cytokines in disease and, in particular, roles of IL-11 in cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and cancer, there is an emerging need to develop therapeutics that can progress to clinical use. Here we outline our current knowledge of the structural mechanism of signaling by the IL-6 family of cytokines. We discuss how this knowledge allows us to understand the mechanism of action of currently available inhibitors targeting IL-6 family cytokine signaling, and most importantly how it allows for improved opportunities to pharmacologically disrupt cytokine signaling. We focus specifically on the need to develop and understand inhibitors that disrupt IL-11 signaling.","Metcalfe, Riley D; Putoczki, Tracy L; Griffin, Michael D W",Front Immunol,260,7

The present case study was done on an adult learner of German and analyzed her accounts of experiencing boredom throughout a whole semester, 13 sessions in length. The trajectory of boredom throughout the course showed that the beginning of the course was the most boring though the learner continued to experience boredom until the end of the semester. Among the theoretical explanations of boredom, under-stimulation, low perceived control over tasks and attention deficit were found to be the most dominant until the end of the course. Among the nontheoretical explanations of boredom, user-unfriendly requirements of online learning prevailed mostly in the beginning of the course until the middle but they were found to be less influential in the end of the course. The process tracing approach showed to be effective in unpacking the black box of the causal mechanisms involved in the boredom experienced in the online L3 learning. Suggestions were made on how to make an online language course less boring and more communicative, which seems essential today due to the unrivaled use of online education during the pandemic.","Yazdanmehr, Elham Elahi Shirvan Majid Saghafi Khatereh",Foreign Language Annals,260,1

Correct diagnosis is essential. Computed tomography (CT) usefully detects symptoms of COVID-19 infection. In this retrospective study, we present an improved framework for detection of COVID-19 infection on CT images;the steps include pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction/ fusion/selection, and classification. In the pre-processing phase, a Gabor wavelet filter is applied to enhance image intensities. A marker-based, watershed controlled approach with thresholding is used to isolate the lung region. In the segmentation phase,COVID-19 lesions are segmented using an encoder- /decoder-based deep learning model in which deepLabv3 serves as the bottleneck and mobilenetv2 as the classification head. DeepLabv3 is an effective decoder that helps to refine segmentation of lesion boundaries. The model was trained using fine-tuned hyperparameters selected after extensive experimentation. Subsequently, the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features and statistical features including circularity, area, and perimeters were computed for each segmented image. The computed features were serially fused and the best features (those that were optimally discriminatory) selected using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for classification. The performance of the method was evaluated using two benchmark datasets: The COVID-19 Segmentation and the POF Hospital datasets. The results were better than those of existing methods. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.","Amin, J.; Sharif, M.; Anjum, M.

The organization of health care services had to change because of this new disease, with the need to reallocate staff and materials, besides changing management protocols. A very important challenge is not to expose patients and health care workers to the risk of infection and not to waste personal protective equipment (PPE). In the field of interventional pulmonology, various aspects related to COVID-19 must be taken into great consideration. Although bronchoscopy is not a first-line test for patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, it has a role in selected cases and it can be useful for differential diagnosis. However, bronchoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure, that’s why its unjustified use could contribute to propagate the virus. For this reason, the utility of each procedure must be carefully evaluated, the patient has to be properly investigated before the procedure, which has to be performed with specific precautions, including adequate PPE.

Methods: We used data from a single large UK Cancer Center to assess the demographic/clinical characteristics of 156 cancer patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 29 February and 12 May 2020. Logistic/Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify which demographic and/or clinical characteristics were associated with COVID-19 severity/death. Results: 128 (82%) presented with mild/moderate COVID-19 and 28 (18%) with a severe case of the disease. An initial cancer diagnosis &gt;24 months before COVID-19 [OR: 1.74 (95% CI: 0.71–4.26)], presenting with fever [6.21 (1.76–21.99)], dyspnea [2.60 (1.00–6.76)], gastro-intestinal symptoms [7.38 (2.71–20.16)], or higher levels of C-reactive protein [9.43 (0.73–121.12)] were linked with greater COVID-19 severity.

We sought to evaluate the incidence and etiology of ICH in patients with COVID-19 requiring ECMO. Patients at two academic medical centers with COVID-19 who required venovenous-ECMO support for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were evaluated retrospectively. During the study period, 33 patients required ECMO support; 16 (48.5%) were discharged alive, 13 died (39.4%), and 4 (12.1%) had ongoing care. Eleven patients had ICH (33.3%). All ICH events occurred in patients who received intravenous anticoagulation. The ICH group had higher C-reactive protein (pâ=â0.04), and procalcitonin levels (pâ=â0.02), and IL-6 levels (pâ=â0.05), lower blood pH before and after ECMO (pâ<â0.01), and higher activated partial thromboplastin times throughout the hospital stay (pâ<â0.0001). ICH-free survival was lower in COVID-19 patients than in patients on ECMO for ARDS caused by other viruses (49% vs 79%, pâ=â0.02). In conclusion, patients with COVID-19 can be successfully bridged to recovery using ECMO but may suffer higher rates of ICH compared to those with other viral respiratory infections.","Bermea, Rene S; Raz, Yuval; Sertic, Federico; Rubin, Jonah; Wolf, Molly; Olia, Salim; Richards, Thomas; Crowley, Jerome; Funamoto, Masaki; Shelton, Kenneth; Bermudez, Christian",Shock (Augusta Ga.),260,10

Em bovinos, a doença relaciona-se, dentre outros fatores, a uma microbiota potencialmente patogênica que, em sua maioria, encontra-se alojada no biofilme bucal destes animais. Biofilmes são estruturas organizadas, nas quais os constituintes convivem em cooperativismo metabólico e oferecem benefícios para a sobrevivência da microbiota local. Estas formações podem ser classificadas em supragengivais ou subgengivais, e quando mineralizadas, resultam na formação do cálculo. O cálculo supragengival em bovinos é visualizado como um depósito fortemente aderido ao dente, pigmentado de marrom ou preto que no ser humano e em outras espécies já foi descrito como um fator predisponente às doenças periodontais. O objetivo do presente estudo foi caracterizar estrutural e quimicamente o biofilme supragengival de bovinos utilizando-se das técnicas de microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV) e espectroscopia de dispersão de energia (EDS), respectivamente, e relacionar os achados ao quadro clínico bucal dos animais (presença de periodontite). Foram coletados 11 dentes primeiro-molares de diferentes animais; cinco amostras sem pigmentação visível, e seis amostras pigmentadas de preto, que foram submetidas inicialmente a MEV, e posteriormente, foram selecionadas três áreas aleatórias para realização da EDS. Os resultados da MEV revelaram formações estruturais com presença de áreas irregulares, possivelmente oriundas de depósitos minerais. Os resultados da EDS apontaram associações entre a presença de ferro (p<0,014) e magnésio (p<0,001) com a ocorrência de periodontite. Com relação à pigmentação, carbono (p<0,039), manganês (p<0,007) e ferro (p<0,015) foram os elementos estatisticamente significantes. Os resultados de associação entre os elementos, independente de condição periodontal ou pigmentação, demonstraram associações entre cálcio e fósforo, e entre ferro e silício. As associações do elemento ferro com periodontite e pigmentação, sugerem possível presença de micro-organismos periodontopatogênicos nestas formações, uma vez que este elemento está intimamente relacionado ao metabolismo bacteriano. Os resultados inéditos do presente trabalho comprovam tratar-se de um biofilme verdadeiro os depósitos pigmentados que se formam na coroa dos dentes de bovinos, e indicam que a presença de biofilme pode atuar como um fator predisponente para etiologia das doenças periodontais.","SARAIVA, JULIA REBECCA",,260,1

Deferring hospitalization and non-urgent surgeries has become a priority for surgeons today in order to relieve the health care system.It is obviously not simple to reduce emergency surgery without altering the quality of care or leading to a loss of chance for the patient. Acute appendicitis is a very specific situation and the prevalence of this disease leads us to reconsider this particular disease in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature. Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis.The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible.","Collard, Maxime; Lefevre, Jérémie H; Maggiori, Léon",,260,16

Nine of the predictions were validated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the ELISA format using plasma and sera from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a further 11 predictions were compared to the recent literature. Results appeared to be in agreement with 12 of the predictions, in disagreement with 3, while a further 5 were deemed inconclusive.

Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, three-arm (1:1:1) placebo-equivalent controlled trial conducted remotely throughout the United States, adult outpatients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (400 mg BID x1day, followed by 200 mg BID x9days) with or without azithromycin (AZ) (500 mg, then 250 mg daily x4days) or placebo-equivalent (ascorbic acid (HCQ) and folic acid (AZ)), stratified by risk for progression to severe COVID-19 (high-risk vs. low-risk). Self-collected nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR, FLUPro symptom surveys, EKGs and vital signs were collected daily. Primary endpoints were: (a) 14-day progression to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), 28-day COVID-19 related hospitalization, or death; (b) 14-day time to viral clearance; secondary endpoints included time to symptom resolution (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04354428). Due to the low rate of clinical outcomes, the study was terminated for operational futility. Findings: Between 15th April and 27th July 2020, 231 participants were enrolled and 219 initiated medication a median of 5.9 days after symptom onset. Among 129 high-risk participants, incident LRTI occurred in six (4.7%) participants (two control, four HCQ/AZ) and COVID-19 related hospitalization in seven (5.4%) (four control, one HCQ, two HCQ/AZ); no LRTI and two (2%) hospitalizations occurred in the 102 low-risk participants (one HCQ, one HCQ/AZ). There were no deaths. Among 152 participants with viral shedding at enrollment, median time to clearance was 5 days (95% CI=4-6) in HCQ, 6 days (95% CI=4-8) in HCQ/AZ, and 8 days (95% CI=6-10) in control. Viral clearance was faster in HCQ (HR=1.62, 95% CI=1.01-2.60, p = 0.047) but not HCQ/AZ (HR=1.25, p = 0.39) compared to control. Among 197 participants who met the COVID-19 definition at enrollment, time to symptom resolution did not differ by group (HCQ: HR=1.02, 95% CI-0.63-1.64, p = 0.95, HCQ/AZ: HR=0.91, 95% CI=0.57-1.45, p = 0.70). Interpretation: Neither HCQ nor HCQ/AZ shortened the clinical course of outpatients with COVID-19, and HCQ, but not HCQ/AZ, had only a modest effect on SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding. HCQ and HCQ/AZ are not effective therapies for outpatient treatment of SARV-CoV-2 infection.

Taking one TAH with 800 beds as an example, we summarized details of the layout, setting, working mode of medical staff, patient management, admission standards, discharge standards, and standards for transferring to another hospital, hospital operation, and so on. Over the period of operation, a total of 1124 patients were admitted for treatment. Of these, 833 patients were cured and discharged from the hospital and 291 patients were transferred to other designated hospitals, owing to aggravation of their condition. The achievement was to have zero infection for medical staff, zero in-hospital deaths among admitted patients, and zero readmission for discharged patients. The rapid deployment of TAH provided a suitable place for treating mild/moderate or no asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, which successfully helped to control the infection in Wuhan.

Poisonous eggs from Pomacea apple snails have defensive macromolecules for protection. Here we isolated and characterized a novel lectin called PdPV1 that is massively accumulated in the eggs of Pomacea diffusa and seems part of its protective cocktail. The native protein, an oligomer of ca. 256 kDa, has high structural stability, withstanding 15 min boiling and denaturing by sodium dodecyl sulphate. It resists in vitro proteinase digestion and displays structural stability between pH 2.0-12.0 and up to 85 °C. These properties, as well as its subunit sequences, glycosylation pattern, presence of carotenoids, size, and global shape resemble those of its orthologs from other Pomacea. Further, like members of the canaliculata clade, PdPV1 is recovered unchanged in faeces of mice ingesting it, supporting an antinutritive defensive function. PdPV1 also displays a strong hemagglutinating activity specifically recognizing selected ganglioside motifs with high affinity. This activity is only shared with PsSC, a perivitelline from the same clade (bridgesii clade). As a whole, these results indicate that species in the genus Pomacea have diversified their eggs defences: Those from the bridgesii clade are protected mostly by non-digestible lectins that lower the nutritional value of eggs, in contrast with protection by neurotoxins of other Pomacea clades, indicating apple snail egg defensive strategies are clade-specific. The harsh gastrointestinal environment of predators would have favoured their appearance, extending by convergent evolution the presence of plant-like highly stable lectins, a strategy not reported in other animals.","Brola, T R; Dreon, M S; Qiu, J W; Heras, H",J. exp. biol,260,20

Outcomes of several chronic, autoimmune, and infectious diseases are linked to vitamin D. Emergent correlations of vitamin D insufficiency with coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, alongside empirical and clinical evidence of immunoregulation by vitamin D in other pulmonary diseases, have prompted proposals of vitamin D supplementation to curb the COVID-19 public health toll. In this review paper, we engage an immunological lens to discuss potential mechanisms by which vitamin D signals might regulate respiratory disease severity in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infections, vis a vis other pulmonary infections. It is proposed that vitamin D signals temper lung inflammatory cascades during SARS-CoV2 infection, and insufficiency of vitamin D causes increased inflammatory cytokine storm, thus leading to exacerbated respiratory disease. Additionally, analogous to studies of reduced cancer incidence, the dosage of vitamin D compounds administered to patients near the upper limit of safety may serve to maximize immune health benefits and mitigate inflammation and disease severity in SARS-CoV2 infections. We further deliberate on the importance of statistically powered clinical correlative and interventional studies, and the need for in-depth basic research into vitamin D-dependent host determinants of respiratory disease severity.","Kalia, Vandana; Studzinski, George P; Sarkar, Surojit",J. leukoc. biol,260,22

High concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the personal protective equipment (PPE) removal room and medical staff office. Submicron virus-laden aerosols could result from resuspension of particles containing SARS-CoV-2 sticking the PPE surface; removal could produce the initial velocity.

By late January 2020, it was evident that COVID-19 was rapidly spreading and represented a national health emergency. In order to contain the spread of COVID-19, China adopted a centralized treatment plan by appointing designated hospitals in each region. Shantou Central Hospital is a Grade A Class A general hospital in Guangdong Province. It was appointed as a provincial COVID-19 designated treatment hospital on January 21, 2020, to provide all COVID-19-related treatments for the city of Shantou. The nursing department at Shantou Central Hospital is fully responsible for hospital nursing administration, nursing human resource management, nursing quality management, and all nursing tasks related to hospital medical care, nursing, teaching, scientific research, preventive healthcare, and so on. Objective: To summarize the role of nursing management in transforming a general hospital into a designated hospital for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We undertook a series of nursing management measures in the strategic phase and the implementation phase. Findings: Through a series of nursing management measures, all COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital were cured and discharged. All non-COVID-19 patients and staff hospitalized during the same period were not infected with the virus. During this period, our hospital completed 7,466 operations. Hence, our nursing management measures were effective. Conclusions: Our efficient nursing management system, first of all, effectively mobilized all available manpower; secondly, up-skilled and trained personnel within a very short period of time; thirdly, provided reliable logistical support for front-line protection equipments; and finally, motivated nurses during this very difficult time to make a significant positive contribution to the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.","Wu, XiaoYing; Zheng, ShaoYan; Huang, JiaJia; Zheng, ZeLi; Xu, ManQing; Zhou, YuHua",Ann Glob Health,260,16

Medical oncology communities have developed treatment modifications to balance the risk of contracting the virus with the benefit of improving cancer-related outcomes. METHODS: We systemically examined our community cancer center database to display patterns of change and to unveil factors that have been considered with each decision. We studied a cohort of 282 patients receiving treatment and found that 159 patients (56.4%) had treatment modifications. RESULTS: The incidence of treatment modification was observed in patients undergoing adjuvant and neoadjuvant (41.4%), palliative (62.9%), or injectable endocrine or bone-modulating only (76.0%) treatments. Modifications were applied to regimens with myelosuppressive (56.5%), immunosuppressive (69.2%), and immunomodulating (61.5%) potentials. These modifications also affected intravenous (54.9%) and subcutaneous injectable treatments (62.5%) more than oral treatments (15.8%). Treatment modifications in 112 patients (70.4%) were recommended by providers, and 47 (29.6%) were initiated by patients. The most common strategy of modification was to skip or postpone a scheduled treatment (49%). Among treatment with no modifications, treatment regimens were maintained in patients who tolerated treatment well (37.0%), in treatments with curative intent (22%), and in symptomatic patients who required treatment (14%). CONCLUSION: Our observation and analysis suggested that the primary goal of treatment modification was to decrease potential exposure. The pattern also reflected the negative impact of the pandemic on health care providers who initiated these changes. Providers have to consider individualized recommendations incorporating multiple factors, such as tolerance, potential toxicity, treatment nature and route, and disease severity.","Lin, Dong D; Meghal, Trishala; Murthy, Pooja; Mo, Lan; D039,; Silva, Ashley; Huang, Yiwu; Xu, Yiqing",JCO Glob Oncol,260,21

Accordingly, the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the challenges of hospital preparedness in biological events. METHODS: This study employed a qualitative method using content analysis in which 20 healthcare managers and experts who are experienced in biological events were selected through purposeful sampling. The data collection was done through semi-structured interviews, which continued until data saturation. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis as well as the Landman and Graneheim Approach. RESULTS: Six main concepts (training and practice, resource management, safety and health, patient management, risk communication, and laboratory and surveillance) and 14 sub-concepts were extracted on hospital preparedness challenges in biological events through analyzing interviews. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that the health system of the country faces many challenges in response to biological events and threats. Moreover, study participants indicated that Iranian hospitals were not prepared for biological events. It is recommended to design preparedness plans of hospitals based on preparedness standards for biological events. In addition, comprehensive measures are required to enhance their capacity to respond to biological emergencies.","Aminizadeh, Mohsen; Farrokhi, Mehrdad; Ebadi, Abbas; Masoumi, Gholam Reza; Kolivand, Pirhossein; Khankeh, Hamid Reza",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,260,1

(COVID-19 Supplement.),16.6233,8.381148,2020,"PURPOSE: Traditional treatment of axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis is resource intensive due to the need for advanced nursing care and increased utilization of intensive care units for thrombolysis procedures. We recently encountered this in the management of 2 patients with effort-induced upper extremity venous thrombosis following COVID-19 infection and offer a treatment paradigm for consideration. CASE REPORTS: A 30-year-old presented with 2 weeks of left upper extremity symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Duplex ultrasound demonstrated axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis and venogram confirmed total occlusion of the axillary and subclavian veins with profuse collaterals around the occlusion. Suction thrombectomy was performed successfully and veins remained patent at 6 month follow up. The patient declined first rib resection and stopped lifting weights. A 16-year-old presented with 4 days of right arm symptoms 1 month after testing positive for COVID-19. Duplex ultrasound revealed acute axillary and subclavian vein thrombosis and she underwent successful thrombectomy followed by balloon angioplasty with improvement in symptoms. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has strained health care resources such that the treatment of non-life-threatening conditions must be triaged to conserve resources. While axillary-subclavian venous occlusion is usually not life-threatening, timely treatment leads to decreased morbidity and better outcomes. Percutaneous aspiration and thrombectomy without adjunctive thrombolysis may be of benefit in reducing healthcare resource utilization while still achieving good outcomes during the COVID pandemic and beyond.","Mukherjee, Dipankar; Kittner, Janine",Vasc Endovascular Surg,260,10

Live cell imaging of endocytosis has helped to decipher many of its mechanisms and regulations. With the pulsed-pH (ppH) protocol, one can detect the formation of individual endocytic vesicles (EVs) with an unmatched temporal resolution of 2 s. The ppH protocol makes use of cargo protein (e.g., the transferrin receptor) coupled to a pH-sensitive fluorescent protein, such as superecliptic pHluorin (SEP), which is brightly fluorescent at pH 7.4 but not fluorescent at pH <6.0. If the SEP moiety is at the surface, its fluorescence will decrease when cells are exposed to a low pH (5.5) buffer. If the SEP moiety has been internalized, SEP will remain fluorescent even during application of the low pH buffer. Fast perfusion enables the complete exchange of low and high pH extracellular solutions every 2 s, defining the temporal resolution of the technique. Unlike other imaging-based endocytosis assays, the ppH protocol detects EVs without a priori hypotheses on the dynamics of vesicle formation. Here, we explain how the ppH protocol quantifies the endocytic activity of living cells and the recruitment of associated proteins in real time. We provide a step-by-step procedure for expression of the reporter proteins with transient transfection, live cell image acquisition with synchronized pH changes and automated analysis. The whole protocol can be performed in 2 d to provide quantitative information on the endocytic process being studied.","Sposini, Silvia; Rosendale, Morgane; Claverie, Léa; Van, Thi Nhu Ngoc; Jullié, Damien; Perrais, David",Nat Protoc,260,24

Are physicians, nurses and other healthcare workers morally obligated to put themselves in harm's way and treat patients during a pandemic, occurring a great risk to themselves, their families and potentially to other patients? The issue was relevant during the 1918 influenza epidemic and more recently severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003. Since the risk to the healthcare workers was great, there was tension between the ethical duty and responsibility to treat and the risk to one's own life. This tension was further noted during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa that left hundreds of healthcare workers dead. The AMA Code of Ethics states that physicians are to 'provide urgent medical care during disasters even in the face of greater than usual risk to physicians' own safety, health or life.'1 Classic Jewish sources have dealt with this question as well. There is an obligation 'to not stand by idly when your friends life is in danger'; however, the question arises as to whether there are limits to this obligation? Is one required to risk one's own life to save another's? There is a consensus that one is not required but the question open to debate is whether it is praiseworthy to do so. However, regarding healthcare workers, there is agreement for ethical, professional and societal reasons that they are required to put themselves in harm's way to care for their patients.","Solnica, Amy; Barski, Leonid; Jotkowitz, Alan",J Med Ethics,260,1

Although extremely useful in many tasks, most models have performed poorly in forecasting the pandemic peaks. We investigate this common pitfall by forecasting four countries' pandemic peak: Austria, Germany, Italy, and South Korea. Far from the peaks, our models can forecast the pandemic dynamics 20 days ahead. Nevertheless, when calibrating our models close to the day of the pandemic peak, all forecasts fail. Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis revealed the main obstacle: the misestimation of the transmission rate. Inverse uncertainty quantification has shown that significant changes in transmission rate commonly precede a peak. These changes are a key factor in forecasting the pandemic peak. Long forecasts of the pandemic peak are therefore undermined by the lack of models that can forecast changes in the transmission rate, i.e., how a particular society behaves, changes of mitigation policies, or how society chooses to respond to them. In addition, our studies revealed that even short forecasts of the pandemic peak are challenging. Backward projections have shown us that the correct estimation of any temporal change in the transmission rate is only possible many days ahead. Our results suggest that the distance between a change in the transmission rate and its correct identification in the curve of active infected cases can be as long as 15 days. This is intrinsic to the phenomenon and how it affects epidemic data: a new case is usually only reported after an incubation period followed by a delay associated with the test. In summary, our results suggest the phenomenon itself challenges the task of forecasting the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when only epidemic data is available. Nevertheless, we show that exciting results can be obtained when using the same models to project different scenarios of reduced transmission rates. Therefore, our results highlight that mathematical modeling can help control COVID-19 pandemic by backward projections that characterize the phenomena' essential features and forward projections when different scenarios and strategies can be tested and used for decision-making.","Reis, Ruy Freitas; Oliveira, Rafael Sachetto; Quintela, Bárbara de Melo; Campos, Joventino de Oliveira; Gomes, Johnny Moreira; Rocha, Bernardo Martins; Lobosco, Marcelo; Dos Santos, Rodrigo Weber",Front Public Health,260,30

Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted with COVID-19 and evaluated outcomes in those with and without COPD and/or emphysema. Patients were identified as having COPD if they had a diagnosis in the medical record and a history of airflow-obstruction on spirometry, or a history of tobacco use and prescribed long-acting bronchodilator(s). Computed tomography scans were evaluated by radiologists. Propensity matching was performed for age, body-mass index (BMI), and serologic data correlated with severity of COVID-19 disease (D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, absolute lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, and lactate dehydrogenase). Results: Of 577 patients admitted with COVID-19, 103 had a diagnosis of COPD and/or emphysema. The COPD/emphysema cohort was older (67 vs 58, p<0.0001) than the other cohort and had a lower BMI. Among unmatched cohorts those with COPD/emphysema had higher rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (35% vs 24.9%, p=0.036) and maximal respiratory support requirements, with more frequent invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 11.8%), but no significant difference in mortality. After propensity-matching there was no difference in ICU admission, maximal respiratory support requirements, or mortality. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses yielded similar results. Discussion: Our propensity-matched retrospective cohort study suggests that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that have COPD and/or emphysema may not have worse outcomes than those without these comorbid conditions.","Marron, Robert M; Zheng, Matthew; Fernandez Romero, Gustavo; Zhao, Huaqing; Patel, Raj; Leopold, Ian; Thomas, Ashanth; Standiford, Taylor; Kumaran, Maruti; Patlakh Jeffrey Stewart, Nicole; Criner, Gerard J",,260,24

The final sample consisted of 65 patients with mild PD progression. Based on neuropsychological measures, our sample was categorized into three PD-MCI subtypes: (1) PD-MCI executive group (n = 24), (2) PD-MCI executive plus memory group (n = 22), and (3) PD-MCI executive plus visuospatial group (n = 19). Patients' executive functions were evaluated with the Trail Making Test-Part B (TMT-B) and Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test (SNST) for mental flexibility and inhibitory control, respectively. One-way ANOVA results indicated significant differences among the three subgroups on TMT-B and SNST performance. Post hoc Tukey honestly significant different (HSD) tests revealed that the PD-MCI executive plus visuospatial group had lower performances on both executive measures than the other two groups. Contrastingly, no significant differences were observed between the PD-MCI executive group and PD-MCI executive plus memory group. Our results indicated that the severity of executive dysfunction varies across different PD-MCI subtypes. These findings are discussed within the framework of the dual syndrome hypothesis and highlight the utility of determination of executive impairment severity for effective clinical management of patients with PD.","Kormas, Constantinos; Zalonis, Ioannis; Evdokimidis, Ioannis; Kapaki, Elisabeth; Potagas, Constantin",Appl Neuropsychol Adult,260,16

We aimed to analyse the safety of the hospital staff and the feasibility and outcomes of NRS applied to patients outside the ICU. METHODS: In this observational study, data from 670 consecutive patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 referred to pulmonology units in nine hospitals between March 1 and May 10, 2020 were analysed. Data collected included medication, mode and usage of NRS (i.e. high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation (NIV)), length of stay in hospital, endotracheal intubation (ETI) and deaths. RESULTS: 42 (11.1%) healthcare workers tested positive for infection, but only three of them required hospitalisation. Data are reported for all patients (69.3% male), whose mean±sd age was 68±13â years. The arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction ratio at baseline was 152±79, and the majority (49.3%) of patients were treated with CPAP.

In particular, this approach can be used to estimate patient zero sources, even when the infection has been propagated via large group gatherings rather than person-to-person spread, and when it is spreading through interrelated social bubbles with varying degrees of overlap. In contact tracing contexts, this estimator may be used to identify the source of a local outbreak, which can then be used for forward tracing or for further backward tracing (by similar or other means) to an upstream source.","Spencer, Sam; Varshney, Lav R.",,260,26

Recently, the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination has been regarded as a potential candidate to explain this difference. Herein, we hypothesised that the past epidemic of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) may act as a latent explanatory factor for the worldwide differences seen in COVID-19 impact on mortality and incidence. We compared two indicators of past epidemic of M. tuberculosis, specifically, incidence (90 countries in 1990) and mortality (28 countries in 1950), with the mortality and incidence of COVID-19. We determined that an inverse relationship existed between the past epidemic indicators of M. tuberculosis and current COVID-19 impact. The rate ratio of the cumulative COVID-19 mortality per 1 million was 2.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-6.68) per 1 unit decrease in the incidence rate of tuberculosis (per 100,000 people). The rate ratio of the cumulative COVID-19 incidence per 1 million was 2.07 (95% CI: 1.30-3.30). This association existed even after adjusting for potential confounders (rate of people aged 65 over, diabetes prevalence, the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease, and gross domestic product per capita), leading to an adjusted rate ratio of COVID-19 mortality of 2.44, (95% CI: 1.32-4.52) and a COVID-19 incidence of 1.31 (95% CI: 0.97-1.78). After latent infection, Mycobacterium survives in the human body and may continue to stimulate trained immunity.

Dig Liv Dis 2020;52:1071-5",16.507713,8.288974,2020,"Although enveloped viruses canonically mediate particle entry through virus-cell fusion, certain viruses can spread by cell-cell fusion, brought about by receptor engagement and triggering of membrane-bound, viral-encoded fusion proteins on the surface of cells. The formation of pathogenic syncytia or multinucleated cells is seen in vivo, but their contribution to viral pathogenesis is poorly understood. For the negative-strand paramyxoviruses respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Nipah virus (NiV), cell-cell spread is highly efficient because their oligomeric fusion protein complexes are active at neutral pH. The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has also been reported to induce syncytia formation in infected cells, with the spike protein initiating cell-cell fusion. Whilst it is well established that fusion protein-specific antibodies can block particle attachment and/or entry into the cell (canonical virus neutralization), their capacity to inhibit cell-cell fusion and the consequences of this neutralization for the control of infection are not well characterized, in part because of the lack of specific tools to assay and quantify this activity. Using an adapted bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, based on a split GFP-Renilla luciferase reporter, we have established a micro-fusion inhibition test (mFIT) that allows the identification and quantification of these neutralizing antibodies. This assay has been optimized for high-throughput use and its applicability has been demonstrated by screening monoclonal antibody (mAb)-mediated inhibition of RSV and NiV fusion and, separately, the development of fusion-inhibitory antibodies following NiV vaccine immunization in pigs. In light of the recent emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a similar assay was developed for SARS-CoV-2 and used to screen mAbs and convalescent patient plasma for fusion-inhibitory antibodies. Using mFITs to assess antibody responses following natural infection or vaccination is favourable, as this assay can be performed entirely at low biocontainment, without the need for live virus. In addition, the repertoire of antibodies that inhibit cell-cell fusion may be different to those that inhibit particle entry, shedding light on the mechanisms underpinning antibody-mediated neutralization of viral spread.","Thakur, Nazia; Conceicao, Carina; Isaacs, Ariel; Human, Stacey; Modhiran, Naphak; McLean, Rebecca K; Pedrera, Miriam; Tan, Tiong Kit; Rijal, Pramila; Townsend, Alain; Taylor, Geraldine; Young, Paul R; Watterson, Daniel; Chappell, Keith J; Graham, Simon P; Bailey, Dalan",J. gen. virol,260,7

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. The clinical data of 65 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to Chongqing Public Health Medical Center and Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital from January 2020 to March 2020 during the period of supporting to combat COVID-19 by the medical team of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Chongqing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine were analyzed. According to different treatment regimens, patients were divided into conventional treatment group (conventional antivirus, anti-infection and symptomatic support treatments), Xuebijing group (Xuebijing was applied to patients with elevated inflammatory cytokines) and combination group (Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin, human immunoglobulin was applied to patients with low immunity indicated by monitoring results of lymphocytes and their subsets). The improvement of blood routine examination, blood gas analysis, myocardial enzyme spectrum, liver and kidney function, lymphocytes and their subsets and cytokines as well as severity score in three groups before and after treatment were observed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to draw the 28-day survival curve of each group, and the cumulative survival rate among the groups was compared. RESULTS: Among the 65 severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients, only 20 patients received conventional treatment, 22 patients were treated with Xuebijing based on conventional treatment, and 23 patients were treated with Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin based on conventional treatment. Before treatment, CD4+ T cell count in combination group was higher than other two groups, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was lower than other two groups, while other indicators showed no statistically significant differences among the three groups, suggesting that the baseline of the three groups was relatively balanced before treatment. The patients in the conventional treatment group were relieved after treatment, and it was characterized by that the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly lower than those before treatment [APACHE II score: 5.20±2.74 vs. 6.20±1.93, LDH (µmol×s-1×L-1): 4.1±1.0 vs. 4.7±0.9, both P < 0.01], but there was still liver damage, which was manifested as higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than that before treatment [U/L: 30.5 (23.8, 41.5) vs. 21.0 (17.0, 34.0), P < 0.05]. In Xuebijing group, the respiratory function and immunity of patients were improved after treatment, and the improvement degree of the ratio of CD4+ T cell was more significant than that in the conventional treatment group (4.86±6.31 vs. -0.95±12.38, P < 0.05). However, the patients still lived with an ""inflammatory storm"" and liver damage after treatment. It was shown that IL-4 was significantly higher than that before treatment (ng/L: 2.57±1.15 vs. 1.92±1.04, P < 0.05), while albumin (ALB) decreased significantly compared with before treatment [g/L: 33.0 (30.5, 35.6) vs. 36.2 (32.1, 41.4), P < 0.01]. While the treatment of Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin could improve patients' respiratory function and enhance their immunity more effectively, it was shown that arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), T lymphocyte count, ratio of CD4+ T cell, CD4+ T cell count, CD8+ T cell count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio were significantly higher than those before treatment, while ALB, IL-6, APACHE II score and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were significantly lower than those before treatment. T lymphocyte count, the ratio of CD4+ T cell and IL-6 in combination group were improved more significantly than those in conventional treatment group and Xuebijing group [T lymphocyte count (×109/L): 310.68±359.28 vs. 46.54±240.01, 81.59±256.76; ratio of CD4+ T cell: 14.53±14.49 vs. -0.95±12.38, 4.86±6.31; IL-6 (ng/L): -25.53±39.05 vs. -1.75±5.45, 12.78±44.81], PaO2/FiO2 was improved more significantly as compared with the Xuebijing group [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 146.31±109.73 vs. 59.41±87.70], and the differences were statistically different (all P < 0.05).

OBJECTIVES: We here aim to investigate the prevalence, causative agents and antifungal susceptibility pattern of OPC in Iranian COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 53 hospitalised COVID-19 patients with OPC were studied. Relevant clinical data were mined. Strain identification was performed by 21-plex PCR and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2). Antifungal susceptibility testing to fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B, caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin was performed according to the CLSI broth dilution method. RESULTS: In 53 COVID-19 patients with OPC, cardiovascular diseases (52.83%) and diabetes (37.7%) were the principal underlying conditions. The most common risk factor was lymphopaenia (71%). In total, 65 Candida isolates causing OPC were recovered. C albicans (70.7%) was the most common, followed by C glabrata (10.7%), C dubliniensis (9.2%), C parapsilosis sensu stricto (4.6%), C tropicalis (3%) and Pichia kudriavzevii (=C krusei, 1.5%). Majority of the Candida isolates were susceptible to all three classes of antifungal drugs. CONCLUSION: Our data clarified some concerns regarding the occurrence of OPC in Iranian COVID-19 patients.

Prior to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, stable patients with chronic conditions attended the facility or support groups to obtain their medication. During the COVID-19 epidemic, these patients would be put at risk if they had to travel and gather in groups to receive medication. The Metropolitan Health Services, therefore, decided to offer home delivery of medication. A system of home delivery was rapidly established by linking the existing chronic dispensing unit system with the emerging approach to community-orientated primary care in the Metro. Medication was delivered as usual to primary care pharmacies, but then a variety of means were used to disseminate the parcels to local non-profit organisations, where they could be delivered by a city-wide network of community health workers (CHWs). Innovations included various ways of delivering the parcels, including via Uber, bicycles and electric scooters, as well as Google forms to monitor the success of the initiative. It was estimated that up to 200 000 parcels per month could be delivered in this way via 2500 CHWs. The new system was established throughout the Metropole, and its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats are further discussed.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to characterize the impact of COVID-19 on pharmacists' employment status, workload, and feelings of burnout, as well as to examine emotional health concerns related to COVID-19. METHODS: Wisconsin pharmacists were surveyed using an online instrument between August 25, 2020, and September 22, 2020. The data analysis, performed in December 2020, examined employment status, 3 common burnout risk factors (workload, rewards, and social depersonalization), and emotional health concerns related to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 1300 pharmacists, 439 completed the survey (33.8%). The study analysis included pharmacists in community (n = 127) and hospital or health system (n = 107) settings. With regard to employment changes and workload, hospital pharmacists (36%) were more likely to have their hours reduced than community pharmacists (13%) (P < 0.01), and, conversely, community pharmacists (19%) were more likely to have their hours increased than hospital pharmacists (8%) (P = 0.01). For the burnout domain of workload, 45% of the pharmacists reported increased feelings of physical exhaustion at work, and 53% reported increased feelings of emotional exhaustion at work, with no difference between settings. Regarding the burnout domain of rewards, 6% of the hospital pharmacists and 1% of the community pharmacists experienced a reduction in hourly wages or salaries as a result of COVID-19. For the burnout domain of depersonalization, 25% of the pharmacists reported that their ability to connect with colleagues and patients decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional emotional health concerns reported by the pharmacists included 40% experiencing more anxiety and 25% experiencing more sadness or depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, with no difference between settings. CONCLUSION: This study found that the burnout domains related to workload, rewards, and depersonalization were negatively affected by COVID-19.

The accurate diagnosis of influenza is critical to the timely clinical treatment of patients and the control of outbreaks to protect public health. Commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) that are operated by visual readout are widely used in clinics to screen influenza infections, but RIDTs suffer from imperfect analytical sensitivity, especially when the virus concentration in the sample is low. Fortunately, the sensitivity can be simply improved through an add-on signal amplification step, i.e., thermal contrast amplification (TCA). To demonstrate the advantage of TCA for influenza diagnosis, we conducted a prospective cohort study on 345 clinical specimens collected for influenza A and B testing during the 2017-2018 influenza season. All samples were tested using the Quidel QuickVue Influenza A + B test, followed by a TCA readout, and then confirmatory polymerase chain reaction testing. Through the TCA detecting sub-visual weak positives, TCA reading improved the overall influenza sensitivity by 53% for influenza A and 33% for influenza B over the visual RIDTs readings. Even though the specificity was compromised slightly by the TCA protocol (relative decrease of 0.09% for influenza A and 0.01% for influenza B), the overall performance was still better than that achieved by visual readout based on comparison of their plots in receiver operating characteristic space and F1 scores (relative increase of 14.5% for influenza A and 12.5% for influenza B). Performing a TCA readout on wet RIDTs also improved the overall TCA performance (relative increase in F1 score of 48%). Overall, the TCA method is a simple and promising way to improve the diagnostic performance of commercial RIDTs for infectious diseases, especially in the case of specimens with low target analytes.","Liu, Yilin; Zhan, Li; Wang, Yiru; Kangas, Joseph; Larkin, Daniel; Boulware, David R; Bischof, John C",Diagnostics (Basel),260,16

Exogenous estrogen induces immature oviduct development to improve egg production after molting. In this process, regressed female reproductive tract is regenerated in response to the secretion of estrogen. However, there is limited knowledge on the physiological mechanisms underlying the regulation of the avian female reproductive system. In our previous study, results from microarray analysis revealed that the expression of genes encoding egg white proteins is affected during molting. Herein, we artificially induced the molting period in chickens through a zinc-containing diet. Subsequently, changes in the expression of genes encoding egg white proteins were confirmed in the oviduct tissue. The levels of MUC5B, ORM1, RTBDN, and TENP mRNA were significantly high in the oviduct, and the genes were repressed in the regression phase, whereas these were expressed in the recrudescence phase, particularly in the luminal epithelium and glandular epithelium of the oviduct, during molting. Moreover, we observed that gene expression was induced in the magnum, the site for the secretion of egg white components. Next, differences in expression levels of the four genes in normal and cancerous ovaries were compared. Collectively, results suggest that the four selected genes are expressed in the female chicken reproductive tract in response to hormonal regulation, and egg white protein-encoding genes may serve as modulators of the reproductive system in hens.","Lee, Minkyeong; Yang, Changwon; Song, Gwonhwa; Lim, Whasun",Reproduction,260,30

There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

METHODS: We report findings on abdominal imaging in 7 critically ill children admitted with MIS-C to a tertiary, urban intensive care unit. All children had clinical and laboratory criteria of MIS-C including positive antibody testing to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 23 children diagnosed with MIS-C, 7 children (30%) had abdominal imaging, including ultrasound (all 7) and CT (3/7). Indications for abdominal imaging included concern for acute abdomen, gall bladder inflammation and intestinal obstruction. Hepatomegaly was the most common finding, while nephromegaly, gall bladder wall edema, ascites, intestinal inflammation and mesenteric lymphadenopathy were also seen on ultrasound. Two children had incidental finding of bilateral lower lobe consolidations on CT abdomen. One child had a thickened, enlarged appendix with diffuse inflammation of intestinal wall of descending colon and ileum on CT. Another patient with severe MIS-C had fluidfilled small bowel loops, terminal ileal inflammation, diffuse lymphadenopathy and moderate ascites on abdominal CT. This patient also had large vessel vasculitis involving the junction of the aortic arch and brachiocephalic trunk. CONCLUSIONS: Common with abdominal imaging findings in Kawasaki disease, our patients had reactive lymphadenopathy, abdominal free fluid, bowel wall thickening and vasculitis. Gall bladder hydrops, intestinal pseudo-obstruction or dilated bowel loops, commonly found in Kawasaki disease with prominent abdominal symptoms were not seen in our patients.","Morparia, K.; Park, M.

Its relationship with environmental factors is an issue that has attracted the attention of scientists and governments. This article aims to deal with a possible association between COVID-19 and environmental factors and provide some recommendations for adequately controlling future epidemic threats. Environmental management through ecosystem services has a relevant role in exposing and spreading infectious diseases, reduction of pollutants, and control of climatic factors. Pollutants and viruses (such as COVID-19) produce negative immunological responses and share similar mechanisms of action. Therefore, they can have an additive and enhancing role in viral diseases. Significant associations between air pollution and COVID-19 have been reported. Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can obstruct the airway, exacerbating cases of COVID-19. Some climatic factors have been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Yet, it is not well established if climatic factors might have a cause-effect relationship to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. So far, positive as well as negative indirect environmental impacts have been reported, with negative impacts greater and more persistent. Too little is known about the current pandemic to evaluate whether there is an association between environment and positive COVID-19 cases. We recommend smart technology to collect data remotely, the implementation of ""one health"" approach between public health physicians and veterinarians, and the use of biodegradable medical supplies in future epidemic threats.","Espejo, Winfred; Celis, José E; Chiang, Gustavo; Bahamonde, Paulina",Sci Total Environ,260,10

However, few studies in sub-Saharan Africa have examined its deleterious consequences on mental health. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and changes in boredom, anxiety and psychological well-being before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. METHODS: Data for this study were drawn from an online survey of 811 participants that collected retrospective information on mental health measures including symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, boredom, and well-being. Additional data were collected on COVID-19 related measures, biosocial (e.g. age and sex) and sociocultural factors (e.g., education, occupation, marital status). Following descriptive and psychometric evaluation of measures used, multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationships between predictor variables and boredom, anxiety and psychological well-being scores during the pandemic. Second, we assessed the effect of anxiety on psychological well-being. Next, we assessed predictors of the changes in boredom, anxiety, and well-being. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, 63.5% reported better well-being, 11.6% symptoms of anxiety, and 29.6% symptoms of boredom. Comparing experiences before and during the pandemic, there was an increase in boredom and anxiety symptomatology, and a decrease in well-being mean scores. The adjusted model shows participants with existing medical conditions had higher scores on boredom (ß = 1.76, p < .001) and anxiety (ß = 1.83, p < .01). In a separate model, anxiety scores before the pandemic (ß = -0.25, p < .01) and having prior medical conditions (ß = -1.53, p < .001) were associated with decreased psychological well-being scores during the pandemic. In the change model, having a prior medical condition was associated with an increasing change in boredom, anxiety, and well-being. Older age was associated with decreasing changes in boredom and well-being scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first in Ghana to provide evidence of the changes in boredom, anxiety and psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings underscore the need for the inclusion of mental health interventions as part of the current pandemic control protocol and public health preparedness towards infectious disease outbreaks.","Boateng, Godfred O; Doku, David Teye; Enyan, Nancy Innocentia Ebu; Owusu, Samuel Asiedu; Aboh, Irene Korkoi; Kodom, Ruby Victoria; Ekumah, Benard; Quansah, Reginald; Boamah, Sheila A; Obiri-Yeboah, Dorcas; Nsabimana, Epaphrodite; Jansen, Stefan; Armah, Frederick Ato",BMC Public Health,260,16

Background: Due to governmental stay-at-home orders during the pandemic, families with “dislocated” (compelled to return home) college students would likely encounter unique stressors while also being limited in their normal ways of coping. Methods: Using an online survey, the current study sought to discover how diverse individual characteristics and family living situations of 323 dislocated students associated with varying homelife experiences (e.g., intrusive parenting, students making an extra effort to spend time with family), and how such experiences associated with relationship changes during the quarantine. Results: Analyses detected some differences in the students' homelife experiences based on background and living situations, especially related to being a first-year student, having been excited about returning home, and feeling accepted by parents about being home. Negative family relationship quality during the quarantine was most predicted by negative attitudes from students and parents about students being home, the student feeling less adultlike (based on treatment and own identity conception), and having low autonomy. Conclusion: Returning home for quarantine was challenging for most students, and circumstances and attitudes appeared to contribute to how such challenges associated with family relationship changes.

A questionnaire was carried out in the University of Malta Faculties of Health Sciences, Dentistry and Medicine to ascertain degree of vaccine hesitancy vis-à-vis influenza and COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was sent through the faculty Deans and the respective secretaries via Google forms. RESULTS: The response rate was 23% (n = 852). The percentages of who took the influenza vaccine last year and who will take it this year increased at all ages, highest for Medicine and Academics. For COVID-19 vaccination, unlikely, undecided and likely to take were 30.5/25.3/44.2% respectively. Medicine and Academics was also likeliest to take, as were males overall. The proportion of those likelier to take the COVID-19 vaccine was directly related to likelihood of taking influenza vaccination. Concerns pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination were related to insufficient knowledge about such a vaccine and potential long-term side effects. DISCUSSION: The increased influenza vaccine uptake is unsurprising in view of the current heightened awareness of respiratory disease. The hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccination is of concern particularly in this health related group who should be better informed. The association of vaccine hesitancy for COVID-19 with influenza vaccination infers an intrinsic degree of vaccine hesitancy. Far more must be done in order to educate not only the public but also healthcare workers and students with regard to the advantages and safety of vaccines.","Grech, Victor; Gauci, Charmaine",Early Hum Dev,260,16

Objectives: We determined the risk factors that increase the risk of death in patients with Parkinson's disease who are infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of PD admitted to Montefiore Hospital (Bronx, New York) and tested for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. Retrospective review of electronic medical records confirmed the diagnosis; patients were classified by severity of PD. PD severity, demographic, socioeconomic factors, and co-morbidities were correlated with mortality rates in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Results: We identified 162 patients meeting criteria; chart review confirmed a diagnosis of PD in 70 patients. Of the 70 patients, 53 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 17 were negative. PD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a higher mortality rate (35.8%) compared to PD patients without the infection (5.9%, P = 0.028). PD patients older than 70 years of age, those with advanced Parkinson's disease, those with reductions in their medications, and non-Hispanics (largely comprised of Black/African- Americans) had a statistically significant higher mortality rate, if infected. Conclusions: PD did not increase mortality rates from SARS-CoV-2 infection when age was controlled. However, certain unalterable factors (advanced disease and age greater than 70 years) and alterable ones (reductions in PD medications) placed PD patients at increased risk for mortality. Also several socioeconomic factors contributed to mortality, for example, non-Hispanic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection fared worse, likely driven by poorer outcomes in the Black/African-American cohort.","Parihar, Raminder; Ferastraoaru, Victor; Galanopoulou, Aristea S; Geyer, Howard L; Kaufman, David M",,260,32

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study involving patients with clinical-epidemiological suspect of COVID-19 infection, who performed CXRs at the emergency department (ED) of our University Hospital from March 1 to March 31, 2020. All patients performed RT-PCR nasopharyngeal and throat swab, CXR at the ED and clinical-epidemiological data. RT-PCR results were considered the reference standard. The final outcome was expressed as discharged or hospitalized patients into a medicine department or intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Patients that had a RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 infection were 234 in total: 153 males (65.4%) and 81 females (34.6%), with a mean age of 66.04 years (range 18-97 years). Thirteen CXRs were negative for radiological thoracic involvement (5.6%). The following alterations were more commonly observed: 135 patients with lung consolidations (57.7%), 147 (62.8%) with GGO, 55 (23.5%) with nodules and 156 (66.6%) with reticular-nodular opacities. Patients with consolidations and GGO coexistent in the same radiography were 35.5% of total. Peripheral (57.7%) and lower zone distribution (58.5%) were the most common predominance. Moreover, bilateral involvement (69.2%) was most frequent than unilateral one. Baseline CXR sensitivity in our experience is about 67.1%. The most affected patients were especially males in the age group 60-79 years old (45.95%, of which 71.57% males). RALE score was slightly higher in male than in female patients. ANOVA with Games-Howell post hoc showed significant differences of RALE scores for group 1 vs 3 (p < 0.001) and 2 vs 3 (p = 0.001). Inter-reader agreement in assigning RALE score was very good (ICC: 0.92-with 95% confidence interval 0.88-0.95). CONCLUSION: In COVID-19, CXR shows patchy or diffuse reticular-nodular opacities and consolidation, with basal, peripheral and bilateral predominance. In our experience, baseline CXR had a sensitivity of 68.1%. The RALE score can be used in the emergency setting as a quantitative method of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, correlating with an increased risk of ICU admission.","Cozzi, Diletta; Albanesi, Marco; Cavigli, Edoardo; Moroni, Chiara; Bindi, Alessandra; Luvarà, Silvia; Lucarini, Silvia; Busoni, Simone; Mazzoni, Lorenzo Nicola; Miele, Vittorio",Radiol Med,260,6

Objective: To evaluate new data and incorporate them into current recommendations for initiating HIV therapy, monitoring individuals starting on therapy, changing regimens, preventing HIV infection for those at risk, and special considerations for older people with HIV. Evidence Review: New evidence was collected since the previous International Antiviral (formerly AIDS) Society-USA recommendations in 2018, including data published or presented at peer-reviewed scientific conferences through August 22, 2020. A volunteer panel of 15 experts in HIV research and patient care considered these data and updated previous recommendations. Findings: From 5316 citations about antiretroviral drugs identified, 549 were included to form the evidence basis for these recommendations. Antiretroviral therapy is recommended as soon as possible for all individuals with HIV who have detectable viremia. Most patients can start with a 3-drug regimen or now a 2-drug regimen, which includes an integrase strand transfer inhibitor. Effective options are available for patients who may be pregnant, those who have specific clinical conditions, such as kidney, liver, or cardiovascular disease, those who have opportunistic diseases, or those who have health care access issues. Recommended for the first time, a long-acting antiretroviral regimen injected once every 4 weeks for treatment or every 8 weeks pending approval by regulatory bodies and availability. For individuals at risk for HIV, preexposure prophylaxis with an oral regimen is recommended or, pending approval by regulatory bodies and availability, with a long-acting injection given every 8 weeks. Monitoring before and during therapy for effectiveness and safety is recommended. Switching therapy for virological failure is relatively rare at this time, and the recommendations for switching therapies for convenience and for other reasons are included. With the survival benefits provided by therapy, recommendations are made for older individuals with HIV.

To identify host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, we designed a focused high-coverage CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 332 members of a recently published SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome. We leveraged the compact nature of this library to systematically screen SARS-CoV-2 at two physiologically relevant temperatures along with three related coronaviruses (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E], HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43), allowing us to probe this interactome at a much higher resolution than genome-scale studies. This approach yielded several insights, including potential virus-specific differences in Rab GTPase requirements and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis, as well as identification of multiple pan-coronavirus factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. This coronavirus essentiality catalog could inform ongoing drug development efforts aimed at intercepting and treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and help prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks.","Hoffmann, H-Heinrich; Sánchez-Rivera, Francisco J; Schneider, William M; Luna, Joseph M; Soto-Feliciano, Yadira M; Ashbrook, Alison W; Le Pen, Jérémie; Leal, Andrew A; Ricardo-Lax, Inna; Michailidis, Eleftherios; Hao, Yuan; Stenzel, Ansgar F; Peace, Avery; Zuber, Johannes; Allis, C David; Lowe, Scott W; MacDonald, Margaret R; Poirier, John T; Rice, Charles M",Cell Host Microbe,260,23

The first reported case,16.255302,8.797449,2020,"BACKGROUND: Contemporary health policy is shifting towards remotely delivered care. A growing need to provide effective and accessible services, with maximal population reach has stimulated demand for flexible and efficient service models. The implementation of evidence-based practice has been slow, leaving many services ill equipped to respond to requests for non-face-to-face delivery. To address this translation gap, and provide empirically derived evidence to support large-scale practice change, our study aimed to explore practitioners' perspectives of the factors that enhance the delivery of a NICE-recommended psychological intervention, i.e. guided self-help by telephone (GSH-T), in routine care. We used the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to analyse our data, identify essential behaviour change processes and encourage the successful implementation of remote working in clinical practice. METHOD: Thirty-four psychological wellbeing practitioners (PWPs) from the UK NHS Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services were interviewed. Data were first analysed inductively, with codes cross-matched deductively to the TDF. RESULTS: Analysis identified barriers to the delivery, engagement and implementation of GSH-T, within eight domains from the TDF: (i) Deficits in practitioner knowledge, (ii) Sub-optimal practitioner telephone skills, (iii) Practitioners' lack of beliefs in telephone capabilities and self-confidence, (iv) Practitioners' negative beliefs about consequences, (v) Negative emotions, (vi) Professional role expectations (vii) Negative social influences, and (viii) Challenges in the environmental context and resources. A degree of interdependence was observed between the TDF domains, such that improvements in one domain were often reported to confer secondary advantages in another. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple TDF domains emerge as relevant to improve delivery of GSH-T; and these domains are theoretically and practically interlinked. A multicomponent approach is recommended to facilitate the shift from in-person to telephone-based service delivery models, and prompt behaviour change at practitioner, patient and service levels. At a minimum, the development of practitioners' telephone skills, an increase in clients' awareness of telephone-based treatment, dilution of negative preconceptions about telephone treatment, and robust service level guidance and standards for implementation are required. This is the first study that provides clear direction on how to improve telephone delivery and optimise implementation, aligning with current mental health policy and service improvement.","Faija, Cintia L; Connell, Janice; Welsh, Charlotte; Ardern, Kerry; Hopkin, Elinor; Gellatly, Judith; Rushton, Kelly; Fraser, Claire; Irvine, Annie; Armitage, Christopher J; Wilson, Paul; Bower, Peter; Lovell, Karina; Bee, Penny",BMC Psychiatry,260,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five large animal ARDS models of sheep were established by intravenous injection of Lipopolysaccharide. ASD was made under general anesthesia and VA-ECMO was simulated by extracorporeal circulation machine. The oxygenation of peripheral blood, systemic circulation, and cardiac function were observed under conditions of closed and opened ASD, and the significance of ASD shunt in improving cardiopulmonary function was evaluated. RESULTS: With ASD closed, the atrial shunts disappeared, the peripheral artery pressure of oxygen(PaO2): 141.2±21.4mmHg, the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2): 353.0±53.5, the mean blood pressure (MAP): 49.3±13.5 mmHg, the heart was full; with ASD opened, the left-to-right shunt was observed, PaO2: 169.3±18.9mmHg, PaO2/FiO2: 423.3±47.3, MAP: 68.2±16.1 mmHg, the range of cardiac motion significantly increased, heart beat was powerful, and systemic circulation significantly improved. Statistical analysis showed that there were significant differences between opened and closed ASD (P < .01).

Simply stated, telehealth is a tool to provide health care from a distance. Jefferson Health has leveraged its acute care telehealth platform to screen, order testing, and manage patients with COVID-19-related concerns. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the expansion and results of using a telehealth program to increase access to care while minimizing additional potential exposures during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Screening algorithms for patients with SARS-CoV-2-related complaints were created, and 150 new clinicians were trained within 72 hours to address increased patient demand. Simultaneously, Jefferson Health created mobile testing sites throughout eastern Pennsylvania and the southern New Jersey region. Visit volume, the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests ordered, and the number of positive tests were evaluated, and the volume was compared with preceding time periods. RESULTS: From March 8, 2020, to April 11, 2020, 4663 patients were screened using telehealth, representing a surge in visit volume. There were 1521 patients sent to mobile testing sites, and they received a telephone call from a centralized call center for results. Of the patients who were tested, nearly 20% (n=301) had a positive result. CONCLUSIONS: Our model demonstrates how using telehealth for a referral to central testing sites can increase access to community-based care, decrease clinician exposure, and minimize the demand for personal protective equipment. The scaling of this innovation may allow health care systems to focus on preparing for and delivering hospital-based care needs.","Joshi, Aditi U; Lewiss, Resa E; Aini, Maria; Babula, Bracken; Henwood, Patricia C",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,260,21

Previous research linked increased susceptibility to collapsing glomerulopathy, including in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy, to apo L1 (APOL1) variants that are more common in those of African descent. METHODS: To investigate genetic, histopathologic, and molecular features in six black patients with COVID-19 presenting with AKI and de novo nephrotic-range proteinuria, we obtained biopsied kidney tissue, which was examined by in situ hybridization for viral detection and by NanoString for COVID-19 and acute tubular injury-associated genes. We also collected peripheral blood for APOL1 genotyping. RESULTS: This case series included six black patients with COVID-19 (four men, two women), mean age 55 years. At biopsy day, mean serum creatinine was 6.5 mg/dl and mean urine protein-creatinine ratio was 11.5 g. Kidney biopsy specimens showed collapsing glomerulopathy, extensive foot process effacement, and focal/diffuse acute tubular injury. Three patients had endothelial reticular aggregates. We found no evidence of viral particles or SARS-CoV-2 RNA. NanoString showed elevated chemokine gene expression and changes in expression of genes associated with acute tubular injury compared with controls. All six patients had an APOL1 high-risk genotype. Five patients needed dialysis (two of whom died); one partially recovered without dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Collapsing glomerulopathy in black patients with COVID-19 was associated with high-risk APOL1 variants. We found no direct viral infection in the kidneys, suggesting a possible alternative mechanism: a ""two-hit"" combination of genetic predisposition and cytokine-mediated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given this entity's resemblance with HIV-associated nephropathy, we propose the term COVID-19-associated nephropathy to describe it.","Wu, Huijuan; Larsen, Christopher P; Hernandez-Arroyo, Cesar F; Mohamed, Muner M B; Caza, Tiffany; Sharshir, Moh039; Chughtai, Asim; Xie, Liping; Gimenez, Juan M; Sandow, Tyler A; Lusco, Mark A; Yang, Haichun; Acheampong, Ellen; Rosales, Ivy A; Colvin, Robert B; Fogo, Agnes B; Velez, Juan Carlos Q",J.

However, the specific regulatory mechanism in AD remains unclear. METHODS: Firstly, AD model was generated by the intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of the Aß1-42 peptide. Subsequently, mice were injected with shRNA adenoviral transduction particles designed to target DJ-1 or Aß1-42 or Aß1-42+shNC or Aß1-42+shRNA against DJ-1. shRNA against DJ-1 were injected into hippocampus of mice (8×104 viral particles for each mice) for 7 consecutive days. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the accumulation of Aß in the hippocampus of mice, and HE staining assay was carried to detect pathological changes in the hippocampus of mice. Further, sh-IKKß, shDJ-1, pcDNA-IKKß and pcDNA-DJ-1 plasmids were transfected into HT-22 cells, MTT assay, TUNEL staining and Hoechst staining were performed to detect cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. Western blotting was carried to measure the relative proteins expression. RESULTS: Findings indicated that Aß1-42 inhibited autophagy and up-regulated p-Tau protein expression; the overexpression of IKKß and DJ-1 all rescued the autophagy inhibited by Aß1-42 and down-regulated p-Tau protein expression induced by Aß1-42; DJ-1 up-regulated IKKß via p-VHL, further promoted autophagy and reduced the expression of p-Tau protein; DJ-1 knockdown inhibited autophagy and up-regulated p-Tau protein expression, resulting in delayed behavior in mice. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, IKKß, modulated by DJ-1p-VHL, reduces p-Tau accumulation via autophagy in AD's disease model. This study may provide theoretical basis for the treatment of AD.","Chen, Wei-Ping; Zhang, Ge; Cheng, Zhi-Juan; Gu, Xun-Hu; Li, Min; Liu, Xu",Neuroscience,260,1

This virus has shown high infectivity and severe symptoms in some cases, leading to over 1.5 million deaths globally. Despite the collaborative and concerted research efforts that have been made, no effective medication for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) is currently available. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an initial mediator for viral attachment and host cell invasion. ACE2 is widely distributed in the human tissues including the cell surface of lung cells which represent the primary site of the infection. Inhibiting or reducing cell surface availability of ACE2 represents a promising therapy for tackling COVID-19. In this context, most ACE2-based therapeutic strategies have aimed to tackle the virus through the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or neutralizing the virus by exogenous administration of ACE2, which does not directly aim to reduce its membrane availability. However, through this review, we present a different perspective focusing on the subcellular localization and trafficking of ACE2. Membrane targeting of ACE2, and shedding and cellular trafficking pathways including the internalization are not well elucidated in literature. Therefore, we hereby present an overview of the fate of newly synthesized ACE2, its post translational modifications, and what is known of its trafficking pathways. In addition, we highlight the possibility that some of the identified ACE2 missense variants might affect its trafficking efficiency and localization and hence may explain some of the observed variable severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Moreover, an extensive understanding of these processes is necessarily required to evaluate the potential use of ACE2 as a credible therapeutic target.","Badawi, Sally; Ali, Bassam R",Hum Genomics,260,16

Since effective antivirals and vaccines are lacking for dengue, along with the fear of contracting Covid-19 in healthcare facilities, local communities are increasingly turning to alternative treatment options such as integrative medicine (IM). Despite the high prevalence of dengue in Malaysia, research is lacking on the health knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of future healthcare professionals (HCPs) on IM use in dengue. Thus, this study aims to design a Malaysian survey to study the KAP of future HCPs towards IM use in dengue. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was carried out in Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library to identify articles related to the following keywords: KAP, IM and dengue. A questionnaire was then systematically designed and divided into key sections including demographics, knowledge on dengue, knowledge, attitude, practice, sources, and barriers of IM use in dengue. The questionnaire was administered to a panel of subject experts (n=8) for content validation and to a sample of the target population (n=10) for face validation. The eligibility criteria of the questionnaire and clarity of understanding were subsequently revised. Results: The finalized questionnaire was formatted into an online version for the convenience of distribution to survey participants from pre-clinical and clinical years of HCP courses. Conclusion: The data obtained from this questionnairebased survey will provide essential information regarding the KAP of future HCPs towards IM use in dengue. This is important as Malaysian HCPs need to manage growing numbers of dengue patients in their clinical practice and must be knowledgeable and aware of IM, and, even to the extent of possibly incorporating evidence-based IM in their dengue management.","Yi Khor, H.; Soon, Z.; Dhanoa, A.; Selvaratnam, L.; Tha, K.

This study examined hospitalized SMI patients' attitude and knowledge towards the COVID-19 infection. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in five psychiatric hospitals located in Gansu province, the most economically underdeveloped area in China. Patients' attitude towards preventive measures and knowledge of COVID-19 were measured by a self-report questionnaire. A total of 925 hospitalized patients with SMI were recruited. Of them, 84.8% (95%CI: 82.4%-87.1%) had positive attitudes towards preventive measures of the COVID-19 outbreak. Being married (OR: 1.55, 95%CI: 1.05-2.30) and a higher educational level (OR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.12-2.38) were independently associated with positive attitudes towards COVID-19 preventive measures, whereas higher educational level was associated with better knowledge of the COVID-19 outbreak (ß: 0.231, P < 0.001). Patients mainly received COVID-19 relevant knowledge from public media (58.9%), followed by their clinicians (33.2%). Most hospitalized SMI patients in economically underdeveloped areas in China showed positive attitudes towards COVID-19 preventive measures. However, public health education on COVID-19 relevant knowledge by mental health professionals was inadequate to reduce the risk of transmission and infection.","Zhu, Ju-Hong; Li, Wen; Huo, Xiao-Ning; Jin, Hong-Min; Zhang, Chun-Hu; Yun, Jin-De; Gao, Li-Guo; Cheung, Teris; Hall, Brian J; Yang, Bin; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Psychiatr. q,260,24

The objective is to determine the risk of developing VTE after corticosteroid administration during COVID-19 treatment. Using PRISMA reporting guidelines, a review was conducted from inception until 20 September 2020 with MESH terms including ""venous thromboembolism"" and ""covid-19,"" using MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, and WHO Global Database. The inclusion criteria included studies with COVID-19 patients aged 18 years and older with VTE diagnosed by duplex ultrasonography or computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Exclusion criteria were studies with non COVID-19 patients and non-VTE patients aged less than 18 years. Quality appraisal was conducted of included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). A random-effect model using 95% confidence intervals, and significance of findings was assessed using Review Manager V5.4.We included 12 observational studies with 2801 patients (VTE n = 434; non-VTE; n = 2367). Patients had a higher risk of presenting with VTE when being administered corticosteroids during treatment of COVID-19 (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.77, I2 = 0%). A positive effect size was found (SMD = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.32, I2 = 85%) for D-dimer laboratory values (µg/mL) in the VTE group. While critically ill COVID-19 patients are more likely to require corticosteroid treatment, it may be associated with increased risk of VTE, and poor clinical prognosis. Risk assessment is warranted to further evaluate patients as case-by-case in reducing VTE and worsening clinical outcomes.","Sarfraz, Azza; Sarfraz, Zouina; Razzack, Aminah Abdul; Patel, Gaurav; Sarfraz, Muzna",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,260,16

There is a link between the new coronavirus and changes in biochemical indicators, such as coagulation functions. Hypercoagulable state of blood caused by infections may lead to cerebrovascular diseases. More attention should be paid to patients with COVID-19, especially critically ill individuals with history of cerebrovascular disease who may have high risk of stroke. METHODS: 193 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. These patients were categorized into nonsevere (143 patients) and severe (50 patients) groups. This study evaluated laboratory tests, including routine blood tests, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, electrolytes, and coagulation functions. Furthermore, neurological function and stroke risks were evaluated in this study. RESULTS: Compared to the nonsevere group, there were increases in white blood cells, neutrophil count, interleukin-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein in the severe group (p < .05). For coagulation functions, parameters like prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrin degradation products were increased significantly in the severe group (p < .01). Severe patients also demonstrated higher scores on the Framingham stroke risk profile and lower Glasgow scores (p < .05). Furthermore, significant associations were noticed between stroke risk and age, blood cell count, neutrophil count, D-dimmer, and fibrin degradation productions (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Data suggested that coagulation functions were affected in patients with COVID-19. Hypercoagulable state in patients may lead to potential high risk of stroke.","Qiu, Feng; Wu, Yue; Zhang, Aiqing; Xie, Guojin; Cao, Hui; Du, Mingyang; Jiang, Haibo; Li, Shun; Ding, Ming",Brain Behav,260,1

The current spread of Covid-19 in Brazil is problematic causing a huge public health burden to its population and national health-care service. To evaluate strategies for alleviating such problems, it is necessary to forecast the number of cases and deaths in order to aid the stakeholders in the process of making decisions against the disease. We propose a novel system for real-time forecast of the cumulative cases of Covid-19 in Brazil. Methods: We developed the novel COVID-SGIS application for the real-time surveillance, forecast and spatial visualization of Covid-19 for Brazil. This system captures routinely reported Covid-19 information from 27 federative units from the Brazil.io database. It utilizes all Covid-19 confirmed case data that have been notified through the National Notification System, from March to May 2020. Time series ARIMA models were integrated for the forecast of cumulative number of Covid-19 cases and deaths. These include 6-days forecasts as graphical outputs for each federative unit in Brazil, separately, with its corresponding 95% CI for statistical significance. In addition, a worst and best scenarios are presented. Results: The following federative units (out of 27) were flagged by our ARIMA models showing statistically significant increasing temporal patterns of Covid-19 cases during the specified day-to-day period: Bahia, Maranhão, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Amapá, Rondônia, where their day-to-day forecasts were within the 95% CI limits. Equally, the same findings were observed for Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Paraná, and Santa Catarina. The overall percentage error between the forecasted values and the actual values varied between 2.56 and 6.50%. For the days when the forecasts fell outside the forecast interval, the percentage errors in relation to the worst case scenario were below 5%. Conclusion: The proposed method for dynamic forecasting may be used to guide social policies and plan direct interventions in a cost-effective, concise, and robust manner. This novel tools can play an important role for guiding the course of action against the Covid-19 pandemic for Brazil and country neighbors in South America.","de Lima, Clarisse Lins; da Silva, Cecilia Cordeiro; da Silva, Ana Clara Gomes; Luiz Silva, Eduardo; Marques, Gabriel Souza; de Araújo, Lucas Job Brito; Albuquerque Júnior, Luiz Antônio; de Souza, Samuel Barbosa Jatobá; de Santana, Maíra Araújo; Gomes, Juliana Carneiro; de Freitas Barbosa, Valter Augusto; Musah, Anwar; Kostkova, Patty; Dos Santos, Wellington Pinheiro; da Silva Filho, Abel Guilhermino",Front Public Health,260,14

The usual post-COVID symptoms include arthralgia and myalgia that are common in many viral diseases. It is the unusual symptoms like occurrence of primary septic joint infection and elevated rates of post-operative infections that warrant attention and further investigation. Could this be attributed to immune consumption leading to a phase of temporary immunosuppression is a matter of speculation and hypothesizing.

We also seek to establish the value of LFI testing on blood obtained from a capillary blood sample. METHODS: Samples collected by venous blood draw and finger stick were obtained from patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-qPCR and control patients. Samples were tested with Biolidics 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit lateral flow immunoassay, and antibody calls were compared with ELISA. RESULTS: Biolidics LFI showed clinical sensitivity of 92% with venous blood at 7 days after PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Test specificity was 92% for IgM and 100% for IgG. There was no significant difference in detecting IgM and IgG with Biolidics LFI and ELISA at D0 and D7 (p = 1.00), except for detection of IgM at D7 (p = 0.04). Capillary blood of SARS-CoV-2 patients showed 93% sensitivity for antibody detection. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical performance of Biolidics 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit is comparable to ELISA and was consistent across sample types.

Roots/rhizomes micromorphology, DNA barcoding and EOs phytochemical characterization were carried out, while biological effects on the nervous system were assessed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity and microelectrode arrays (MEA). Nj showed the highest inhibitory activity on AChE (IC50 67.15 µg/mL) followed by Vo (IC50 127.30 µg/mL) and Vj (IC50 246.84 µg/mL). MEA analyses on rat cortical neurons, carried out by recording mean firing rate (MFR) and mean bursting rate (MBR), revealed stronger inhibition by Nj (IC50 18.8 and 11.1 µg/mL) and Vo (16.5 and 22.5 µg/mL), compared with Vj (68.5 and 89.3 µg/mL). These results could be related to different EO compositions, since sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes significantly contribute to the observed effects, but the presence of oxygenated compounds such as aldehydes and ketones is a discriminating factor in determining the order of potency. Our multidisciplinary approach represents an important tool to avoid the adulteration of herbal drugs and permits the evaluation of the effectiveness of EOs that could be used for a wide range of therapeutic applications.","Cornara, Laura; Ambu, Gabriele; Trombetta, Domenico; Denaro, Marcella; Alloisio, Susanna; Frigerio, Jessica; Labra, Massimo; Ghimire, Govinda; Valussi, Marco; Smeriglio, Antonella",,260,16

Although SARS-CoV-2 replicates and propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (nucs) often show decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits low viability in human cells in culture. Here, serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate (original-SARS2) in the human hepatoma cell clone Huh7.5 led to the selection of a variant (adapted-SARS2) with significantly improved infectivity in human liver (Huh7 and Huh7.5) and lung cancer cells (unmodified Calu-1 and A549). The adapted virus exhibited mutations in the spike protein, including a 9 amino acid deletion and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). E484D also emerged in Vero E6 cultured viruses that became viable in A549 cells. Original and adapted viruses were susceptible to SR-B1 receptor blocking and adapted-SARS2 exhibited significantly less dependency of ACE2. Both variants were similarly neutralized by COVID-19 convalescent plasma but adapted-SARS2 exhibited increased susceptibility to exogenous type I interferon. Remdesivir inhibited original- and adapted-SARS2 similarly, demonstrating the utility of the system for the screening of nucs. Among the tested nucs, only remdesivir, molnupiravir and to a limited extent galidesivir, showed antiviral effect across human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity. Analogously to the emergence of spike mutations in vivo, the spike protein is under intense adaptive selection pressure in cell culture. Our results indicate that the emergence of spike mutations will most likely not affect the activity of remdesivir.","Ramirez, Santseharay; Fernandez-Antunez, Carlota; Galli, Andrea; Underwood, Alexander; Pham, Long V; Ryberg, Line A; Feng, Shan; Pedersen, Martin S; Mikkelsen, Lotte S; Belouzard, Sandrine; Dubuisson, Jean; Sølund, Christina; Weis, Nina; Gottwein, Judith M; Fahnøe, Ulrik; Bukh, Jens",,260,16

SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, uses ACE2, an important enzyme in the cardiovascular system that regulates the conversion of Ang II (deleterious/pro-hypertensive) to Ang 1-7 (protective/anti-hypertensive), as a receptor for host cell entry and infection. Considering the relationship between the viral S1-protein and the host's ACE2, it is unclear whether this interaction is merely a mechanism of infection or whether it also contributes to cardiovascular damage associated with COVID-19. We hypothesisedthat SARS-Cov-2-ACE2 interaction induces activation of vascular cell inflammatory responses that are influenced by ACE2 dependent and/or independent enzymatic Ang-(1-7) production. Methods Human microvascular endothelial cells (MEC) were used and stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S1 protein (rS1p) (0.66 ?g/mL) at 10/30 min (acute) and 5/24h (chronic). Activation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways (immunoblotting, real-time PCR), microparticle (MP) generation (NanoSight), and cytokine production (ELISA) were assessed. In some experiments, cells were pre-incubated with an ACE2 activator (DIZE ? 190 nM) and inhibitor (MLN-4760 ? 440 pM).

Few studies investigated the epidemic characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in the well-developed cities. METHODS: Epidemiological data of 136 confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected from the dataset of COVID-19 in Tianjin. All confirmed cases were categorized according to their potential infection sources. Daily numbers of confirmed cases of each category were plotted by date of onset, and the epidemic form of each category was inferred. RESULTS: Among the 136 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 48 cases were categorized as imported cases and their close contacts, which were the majority of early cases. A total of 43 cases were found an epidemiological link to the Baodi department store, and they were inferred to be a common-source outbreak. Additionally, 35 cases were considered as familial clusters of COVID-19 cases, and 10 cases were sporadic. The 45 cases were inferred to be a propagated epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Local transmission of COVID-19 mainly occurred within families and a poorly ventilated public place in Tianjin. Besides the imported cases, the pattern of local transmission of COVID-19 was a mixture of the propagated epidemic and the common-source outbreak in Tianjin.","Chen, Ting; Guo, Songxue; Zhong, Ping",Am J Infect Control,260,8

This may be due to the synergistic effects of unemployment, stress from childcare or additional caregiving responsibilities, reduced social interactions and negative coping strategies. Weerakoon and colleagues set out to identify the most robust risk factors for alcohol consumption, binge drinking, and changes in drinking patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One-third of the sample reported consuming more alcohol after COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19. In addition, each additional week spent at home under stay-at-home orders was increased the odds of binge drinking by 19%. Individuals who have been diagnosed with depression and were currently experiencing depressive symptoms were more than three times more likely (OR = 3.37) to have increased their alcohol consumption during COVID-19 compared to those with no history or symptoms of depression. Parents of children was associated with decreased COVID-19 related binge drinking (OR = .74). As many daily life factors have been altered due to the pandemic, a more holistic lifestyle disruption construct may help further investigate the long term effects of social isolation on alcohol use as the pandemic continues. Furthermore, the role of social support in mitigating COVID-19-related stress has yet to be examined and may be a protective factor against alcohol related problems. As stress continues, researchers should continue assessing the longitudinal effects of COVID-19 lockdowns with the goal of early identification for those at the highest risk of problematic alcohol use.","Molsberry, Rebecca; Maskaly, Jon; Reingle Gonzalez, Jennifer M",Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,260,21

However, significant variations are observed in following the policy across individuals and countries. Arguably, differences in citizens' adherence actions will be influenced by their perceptions about government's plans and the information available to guide their behaviors-more so in the digital age in the realm of mass influence of social media on citizens. Insights into the underlying factors and dynamics involved with citizens' adherence process will inform the policy makers to follow appropriate communication and messaging approaches to influence citizens' willingness to adhere to the recommendations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is a comparative evaluation of citizens' adherence process to COVID-19-relevant recommendations by the government. The focus is on how three different countries' (United States, Kuwait, and South Korea) citizens, randomly sampled, respond to governments' pandemic guidance efforts. We draw insights into two categories of perceived government roles in managing the pandemic: (1) citizens' perceptions of government's role in responding to the pandemic and (2) citizens' perceptions of government's business reopening efforts. Undoubtedly, the internet and social media have burgeoned, with differing effects on shaping individuals' views and assessments of the COVID-19 situation; we argue and test for the effects of information sources, social media use, and knowledge on the adherence actions. METHODS: We randomly sampled web-based survey data collected by a global firm in May 2020 from citizens of the United States, Kuwait, and South Korea. A nonlinear ordered probit regression, controlling for several counterfactuals, was used for analysis. The focal estimated effects of the study were compared across countries using the weighted distance between the parameter estimates. RESULTS: The total sample size was 482 respondents, of which 207 (43%) lived in the United States, 181 (38%) lived in Kuwait, and 94 (20%) lived in South Korea. The ordered probit estimation results suggest that overall, perception of government response efforts positively influenced self-adherence (P<.001) and others' adherence (P<.001) to social distancing and sheltering. Perception of government business reopening efforts positively influenced others' adherence (P<.001). A higher intensity of general health information source for COVID-19 had a positive effect on self-adherence (P=.003). A higher intensity of social media source use for COVID-19 positively influenced others' adherence (P=.002). A higher intensity of knowledge on COVID-19 positively influenced self-adherence (P=.008) and negatively influenced others' adherence (P<.001). There were country-level variations-broadly, the United States and Kuwait had better effects than South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to grow and governmental restrictions are ongoing, it is critical to understand people's frustration to reduce panic and promote social distancing to facilitate the control of the pandemic. This study finds that the government plays a central role in terms of adherence to restrictions. Governments need to enhance their efforts on publicizing information on the pandemic, as well as employ strategies for improved communication management to citizens through social media as well as mainstream information sources.","Al-Hasan, Abrar; Yim, Dobin; Khuntia, Jiban",J Med Internet Res,260,20

This state imaginary privileges 'modern' mobilities, championing highways, a bus rapid transport system, and an elevated metro, while so called 'traditional' means of moving around the city such as motorbikes, bicycles, or cyclos are being strongly discouraged and increasingly marginalised. For example, Hanoi officials are implementing a step-wise ban on motorbikes from downtown streets by 2030, while the majority of the urban population travels by motorbike, with about five million motorbikes plying the city's streets. While such an approach not only creates mobility injustice for lower socio-economic residents of the city as a whole, it threatens to undermine the livelihoods of thousands of informal motorbike taxi drivers (locally known as xe ôm). In this article I engage with the emerging mobility injustice literature to explore how state discourses regarding urban modernisation are impacting the possibilities for Hanoi's xe ôm drivers to maintain access to city streets and viable livelihoods. These drivers must negotiate emerging and often conflicting state policies, their enforcement, as well as new app-based competitors, all of which challenge the equitable distribution of motility and produce important frictions. Nonetheless, xe ôm drivers draw on their agency and creativity during their daily routines to push back, while also creating new narratives regarding their vital role in maintaining neighbourhood security. We thus see how marginalised individuals are counteracting policies they consider unjust, even when this urban agenda is embedded in a politically socialist context.","Turner, Sarah",J Transp Geogr,260,26

Responding to this, a weekly virtual coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) neurology multi-disciplinary meeting was established at the National Hospital, Queen Square, in early March 2020 in order to discuss and begin to understand neurological presentations in patients with suspected COVID-19-related neurological disorders. Detailed clinical and paraclinical data were collected from cases where the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed through RNA PCR, or where the diagnosis was probable/possible according to World Health Organization criteria. Of 43 patients, 29 were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and definite, eight probable and six possible. Five major categories emerged: (i) encephalopathies (n = 10) with delirium/psychosis and no distinct MRI or CSF abnormalities, and with 9/10 making a full or partial recovery with supportive care only; (ii) inflammatory CNS syndromes (n = 12) including encephalitis (n = 2, para- or post-infectious), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (n = 9), with haemorrhage in five, necrosis in one, and myelitis in two, and isolated myelitis (n = 1). Of these, 10 were treated with corticosteroids, and three of these patients also received intravenous immunoglobulin; one made a full recovery, 10 of 12 made a partial recovery, and one patient died; (iii) ischaemic strokes (n = 8) associated with a pro-thrombotic state (four with pulmonary thromboembolism), one of whom died; (iv) peripheral neurological disorders (n = 8), seven with Guillain-Barré syndrome, one with brachial plexopathy, six of eight making a partial and ongoing recovery; and (v) five patients with miscellaneous central disorders who did not fit these categories. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a wide spectrum of neurological syndromes affecting the whole neuraxis, including the cerebral vasculature and, in some cases, responding to immunotherapies. The high incidence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, particularly with haemorrhagic change, is striking. This complication was not related to the severity of the respiratory COVID-19 disease. Early recognition, investigation and management of COVID-19-related neurological disease is challenging. Further clinical, neuroradiological, biomarker and neuropathological studies are essential to determine the underlying pathobiological mechanisms that will guide treatment. Longitudinal follow-up studies will be necessary to ascertain the long-term neurological and neuropsychological consequences of this pandemic.","Paterson, Ross W; Brown, Rachel L; Benjamin, Laura; Nortley, Ross; Wiethoff, Sarah; Bharucha, Tehmina; Jayaseelan, Dipa L; Kumar, Guru; Raftopoulos, Rhian E; Zambreanu, Laura; Vivekanandam, Vinojini; Khoo, Anthony; Geraldes, Ruth; Chinthapalli, Krishna; Boyd, Elena; Tuzlali, Hatice; Price, Gary; Christofi, Gerry; Morrow, Jasper; McNamara, Patricia; McLoughlin, Benjamin; Lim, Soon Tjin; Mehta, Puja R; Levee, Viva; Keddie, Stephen; Yong, Wisdom; Trip, S Anand; Foulkes, Alexander J M; Hotton, Gary; Miller, Thomas D; Everitt, Alex D; Carswell, Christopher; Davies, Nicholas W S; Yoong, Michael; Attwell, David; Sreedharan, Jemeen; Silber, Eli; Schott, Jonathan M; Chandratheva, Arvind; Perry, Richard J; Simister, Robert; Checkley, Anna; Longley, Nicky; Farmer, Simon F; Carletti, Francesco; Houlihan, Catherine; Thom, Maria; Lunn, Michael P; Spillane, Jennifer; Howard, Robin",Brain,260,15

Here, we review the literature to date of the short-term and long-term consequences of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on the heart. RECENT FINDINGS: Early case reports described a spectrum of cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19, including myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. However, in most cases, myocardial injury in COVID-19 appears to be predominantly mediated by the severity of critical illness rather than direct injury to myocardium from viral particles. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging remains a powerful tool for diagnosing acute myocarditis, it should be used judiciously in light of low baseline prevalence of myocarditis. Guiding an athletic patient through return to play (RTP) after COVID-19 infection is a challenging process. More recent data show RTP has been a safe endeavor using a screening protocol. ""Long COVID"" or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been described. The reported symptoms span a large breadth of cardiopulmonary and neurologic complaints including fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, breathlessness, brain fog, and dysautonomia including postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Management of POTS/dysautonomia primarily centers on education, exercise, and salt and fluid repletion. Our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is constantly evolving. As we enter a new age of survivorship, additional research is needed to catalogue the burden of persistent cardiopulmonary symptoms. Research is also needed to learn how acute management may alter the likelihood and prevalence of this chronic syndrome.","Chilazi, Michael; Duffy, Eamon Y; Thakkar, Aarti; Michos, Erin D",Curr Atheroscler Rep,260,8

Additionally, the paper aimed to provide an insight into the key determinants of personal bankruptcy and to determine their relationship with individual characteristics. The fundamental causes of bankruptcy and its effects on financial status were also discussed. Through understanding the causes of bankruptcy, we hope to help financial institutions to minimise the number of personal bankruptcies. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive systematic search was conducted to identify articles on determinants of personal bankruptcy. The selected articles were then analysed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. Findings: We identified several themes that emerged as the key determinants of personal bankruptcy filings. These determinants were demographic indicators, socioeconomic status indicators, debt indicators, financial indicators, social stigma indicators, behavioural indicators, and macroeconomic indicators. Research implications: The key determinants of personal bankruptcy that were identified in this systematic review are renowned factors in the personal bankruptcy literature. Therefore, these determinants should be studied extensively to examine their effects in other studies and using a different type of datasets. Practical implications: The findings of this study help the financial institutions to predict the likelihood of consumer default by developing an effective credit scoring model. Additionally, the development of an effective credit scoring model could serve as an early warning indicator to identify “high risk” client. Originality/value: Bankruptcy is a long-term process that does not occur instantly. Therefore, a longitudinal and comprehensive approach is required to understand bankruptcy. Our findings contribute to the current literature by providing a better understanding of the causes of personal bankruptcy. We recommend developing an effective credit scoring model to predict the likelihood of personal bankruptcy. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University. All rights reserved.","Sahiq, A. N. M.

In response to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, SNAP benefits have been increased by 20.3% since October 2020. Given the intended goal of the program, is the 20.3% increase enough? Even prior to COVID-19, the literature had identified 3 separate shortcomings in the current formula that had not been addressed. Here, these shortcomings are integrated into a unifying framework that allows for a comparison between an adjusted formula, that accounts for all these shortcomings, and the current unadjusted formula, that does not account for these shortcomings. Using some average data from the literature, the current unadjusted formula gives the misleading impression that the government will provide 71% of the cost of a nutritious diet with households responsible for 29%. However, working with the adjusted formula, that takes into account the shortcomings, reveals the government actually only provides 41% of the adjusted cost of a nutritious diet and households are responsible for 59%. Some actual and recommended adjustments are shown to fall far short of the full adjustment required to reach a nutritious diet, on average. In particular, the 20.3% increase is less than half of the amount needed to fully correct for these omissions.","Davis, George C",J. nutr,260,0

We expect a rise of a massive group of 'lonely' consumers who are deeply entrenched in the social isolation caused by COVID-19. There is an urgent need to revisit the phenomenon of lonely consumers to better prepare academic researchers, public policy makers and commercial managers in the post-COVID-19 era. Thus, this study conducts a synthesised review on past studies of lonely consumers. Based on an inductive analysis of 56 articles, 74 key themes are identified. These key themes are further categorised into five major clusters by way of a co-occurrence network analysis. Respectively, the five clusters address the psychological implications related to the dynamics between nonhuman attachment and consumers' loneliness, the commercial implications related to the paradoxical motivations of affiliation and self-affirmation in product selection and the dual information processing mechanism in response to advertisement appeals, and the social implications related to consumers' well-being in an ageing society and the anthropomorphic companionship in a virtual world.

RBDs freely adopted ""up"" conformations required for ACE2 interaction, primarily through RBD movement combined with smaller alterations in neighboring domains. In the absence of ACE2, single-RBD-up conformations dominated at pH 5.5, resolving into a solitary all-down conformation at lower pH. Notably, a pH-dependent refolding region (residues 824-858) at the spike-interdomain interface displayed dramatic structural rearrangements and mediated RBD positioning through coordinated movements of the entire trimer apex. These structures provide a foundation for understanding prefusion-spike mechanics governing endosomal entry; we suggest that the low pH all-down conformation potentially facilitates immune evasion from RBD-up binding antibody.","Zhou, Tongqing; Tsybovsky, Yaroslav; Gorman, Jason; Rapp, Micah; Cerutti, Gabriele; Chuang, Gwo-Yu; Katsamba, Phinikoula S; Sampson, Jared M; Schön, Arne; Bimela, Jude; Boyington, Jeffrey C; Nazzari, Alexandra; Olia, Adam S; Shi, Wei; Sastry, Mallika; Stephens, Tyler; Stuckey, Jonathan; Teng, I-Ting; Wang, Pengfei; Wang, Shuishu; Zhang, Baoshan; Friesner, Richard A; Ho, David D; Mascola, John R; Shapiro, Lawrence; Kwong, Peter D",Cell Host Microbe,260,20

The main routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are physical contact with infected persons and exposure to respiratory droplets. In cases of infection, the nasal cavity and nasopharynx have the highest viral load in the body. Swallowing occurs in the oral cavity and pharynx, which correspond to the sites of viral proliferation. In addition, the possibility of infection by aerosol transmission is also concerning. Dysphagia treatment includes a broad range of clinical assessments and examinations, dysphagia rehabilitation, oral care, nursing care, and surgical treatments. Any of these can lead to the production of droplets and aerosols, as well as contact with viral particles. In terms of proper infection control measures, all healthcare professionals involved in dysphagia treatment must be fully briefed and must appropriately implement all measures. In addition, most patients with dysphagia should be considered to be at a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 because they are elderly and have complications including heart diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases. This statement establishes three regional categories according to the status of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accordingly, the SSDJ proposes specific infection countermeasures that should be implemented considering 1) the current status of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the region, 2) the patient status of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 3) whether the examinations or procedures conducted correspond to aerosol-generating procedures, depending on the status of dysphagia treatment. This statement is arranged into separate sections providing information and advice in consideration of the COVID-19 outbreak, including ""terminology"", ""clinical swallowing assessment and examination"", ""swallowing therapy"", ""oral care"", ""surgical procedure for dysphagia"", ""tracheotomy care"", and ""nursing care"". In areas where SARS-CoV-2 infection is widespread, sufficient personal protective equipment should be used when performing aerosol generation procedures. The current set of statements on dysphagia management in the COVID-19 outbreak is not an evidence-based clinical practice guideline, but a guide for all healthcare workers involved in the treatment of dysphagia during the COVID-19 epidemic to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Kimura, Yurika; Ueha, Rumi; Furukawa, Tatsuya; Oshima, Fumiko; Fujitani, Junko; Nakajima, Junko; Kaneoka, Asako; Aoyama, Hisaaki; Fujimoto, Yasushi; Umezaki, Toshiro",Auris Nasus Larynx,260,16

The advantages and disadvantages of each optical detection method are presented, and prospects for applying optical biosensors in COVID-19 detection are discussed.","Maddali, Hemanth; Miles, Catherine E; Kohn, Joachim; O039,; Carroll, Deirdre M",Chembiochem,260,12

However, sampling via nasopharyngeal swabs frequently provokes sneezing or coughing, which results in increased risk of the viral dissemination and environmental contamination. Furthermore, the sensitivity associated with the PCR tests s limited to 60%-70%, which is mainly attributable to technical deficiency in sampling. Given that the disease is transmitted via exhaled aerosol and droplets, and that the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is the established modality for sampling exhaled aerosol, detection of the viral RNA in EBC is a promising approach for safe and efficient diagnosis of the disease. Subjects are those patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 by positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test and admitted to Saitama Medical Center, Japan. EBC samples will be collected using an R-tube® or R-tubeVent® device. Collected EBC samples will be introduced into a nucleic acid purifier. The purified nucleic acids will undergo amplification through RT-PCR for detection and quantification of SARS-COV-2 RNA. To date we have collected eight samples from seven subjects. Among them, two samples from two subjects tested positive for SARS-COV-2 RNA by the RT-PCR. Reflecting the second wave of COVID-19 prevalence in Japan, new admissions of COVID-19 patients to the Saitama Medical Center are increasing, and we are expecting to collect at least 50 EBC samples from 25 patients before the end of this year.","Sawano, Makoto; Takeshita, Kyousuke; Ohno, Hideaki; Oka, Hideaki",J Breath Res,260,16

Moreover, the evolution of human CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, is intermingled with those of animal CoVs. In this comprehensive review, attempts have been made to compare the current knowledge on evolution, transmission, pathogenesis, immunopathology, therapeutics, and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 with those of various animal CoVs.

We have characterized a positive-sense (+) single-stranded (ss) RNA mycovirus, Rhizoctonia solani hypovirus 2 (RsHV2), from the phytopathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani. RsHV2 has the largest RNA genome size of 22,219 nucleotides, excluding the poly(A) tail, in all known mycoviruses, and contains two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2). ORF1 encodes a protein of 2,009 amino acid (aa) that includes a conserved helicase domain belonging to helicase superfamily I (SFI). In contrast, ORF2 encodes a polyprotein of 4459 aa containing the hallmark genes of hypoviruses. The latter includes a helicase belonging to SFII. Following phylogenetic analysis, the ORF1-encoded helicase (Hel1) unexpectedly clustered in an independent evolutionary branch together with nidovirus helicases, including coronaviruses, and bacteria helicases. Thus, Hel1 presence indicates the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer between viruses and bacteria. These findings also suggest that RsHV2 is most likely a recombinant arising between hypoviruses and nidoviruses.","Abdoulaye, A.

First, the well-posedness of the multi-scale model is discussed, followed by the stability analysis of the equilibrium points. The disease-free equilibrium point is shown to be globally asymptotically stable for $R_0<1$. When $R_0$ exceeds unity, a unique infected equilibrium exists, and the system is found to undergo a forward (trans-critical) bifurcation at $R_0=1$. Two parameter heat plots are also done to find the parameter combinations for which the equilibrium points are stable. The parameters $\beta, \pi$ and $\Lambda$ are found to be most sensitive to $R_0$. The influence of within-host sub-model parameter on the between-host sub-model variables is numerically illustrated. The spread of infection in a community is shown to be influenced by within-host level sub-model parameters, such as the production of viral particles by infected cells $(\alpha)$, the clearance rate of infected cells by the immune system $(x)$, and the clearance rate of viral particles by the immune system $(y)$. The comparative effectiveness of the three health interventions (antiviral drugs, immunomodulators, and generalized social distancing) for COVID-19 infection was examined using the effective reproductive number $R_E$ as an indicator of the effectiveness of the interventions. The results suggest that a combined strategy of antiviral drugs, immunomodulators and generalized social distancing would be the best strategy to implement to contain the spread of infection in the community.","Chhetri, Bishal; Vamsi, D.K.K; Sanjeevi, Carani",,260,24

Nevertheless, there seems to be some degree of moral concern regarding the ethical legitimacy of practicing reverse triage in the context of a pandemic. Such concern can be taken as a reflection of the moral antipathy some exhibit towards current practices of withdrawing treatment-that is, when withdrawal of treatment is arguably in the best interests of patients-and a rejection of the purported normative insignificance of withholding and withdrawing. Given that the relevance of the psychological attitudes of some healthcare professionals to the moral assessment of withdrawing and withholding treatment continues to be debated, it would seem that some thought should be given to the introduction and implementation of reverse triage decisions in response to a pandemic. This brief paper will consider if provision should be made for healthcare professionals to conscientiously refuse to participate in reverse triage.","Emmerich, Nathan",J Bioeth Inq,260,26

This study examines an unexplored consequence of COVID-19 school closures: the broken link between child maltreatment victims and the number one source of reported maltreatment allegations—school personnel. Using current, county-level data from Florida, we estimate a counterfactual distribution of child maltreatment allegations for March and April 2020, the first two months in which Florida schools closed. While one would expect the financial, mental, and physical stress due to COVID-19 to result in additional child maltreatment cases, we find that the actual number of reported allegations was approximately 15,000 lower (27%) than expected for these two months. We leverage a detailed dataset of school district staffing and spending to show that the observed decline in allegations was largely driven by school closures. Finally, we discuss policy implications of our findings for the debate surrounding school reopenings and suggest a number of responses that may mitigate this hidden cost of school closures.","Baron, E.

Most regulatory processes in biology are intrinsically related to modifications of protein structure, function, and abundance. However, it is unclear to which extent intrinsic proteolysis affects toxins and snake venom phenotypes upon ontogenesis. Here we assessed the natural N-terminome of Bothrops jararaca newborn and adult venoms and explored the degree of N-terminal protein truncation in ontogenetic-based proteome variation. To this end we applied the Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) technology to characterize venom collected in the presence of proteinase inhibitors. We identified natural N-terminal sequences in the newborn (71) and adult (84) venoms, from which only 37 were common to both. However, truncated toxins were found in higher number in the newborn (212) than in the adult (140) venom. Moreover, sequences N-terminally blocked by pyroglutamic acid were identified in the newborn (55) and adult (49) venoms. Most toxin classes identified by their natural N-terminal sequences showed a similar number of unique peptides in the newborn and adult venoms, however, those of serine proteinases and C-type lectins were more abundant in the adult venom. Truncated sequences from at least ten toxin classes were detected, however the catalytic and cysteine-rich domains of metalloproteinases were the most prone to proteolysis, mainly in the newborn venom. Our results underscore the pervasiveness of truncations in most toxin classes and highlight variable post-translational events in newborn and adult venoms.","Andrade-Silva, Débora; Nishiyama Junior, Milton Yutaka; Stuginski, Daniel Rodrigues; Zelanis, André; Serrano, Solange Maria de Toledo",Biochim.

We conducted a study to examine sedative use for this patient population within multiple intensive care units (ICUs) of a large academic medical center. METHODS: A retrospective, single-center cohort study of sedation practices for critically ill patients with COVID-19 during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation was conducted in 8 ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. The study population was a sequential cohort of 86 critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. Data characterizing the sedative medications, doses, drug combinations, and duration of administration were collected daily and compared to published recommendations for sedation of critically ill patients without COVID-19. The associations between drug doses, number of drugs administered, baseline patient characteristics, and inflammatory markers were investigated. RESULTS: Among the study cohort, propofol and hydromorphone were the most common initial drug combination, with these medications being used on a given day in up to 100% and 88% of patients, respectively. The doses of sedative and analgesic infusions increased for patients over the first 10 days, reaching or exceeding the upper limits of published dosage guidelines for propofol (48% of patients), dexmedetomidine (29%), midazolam (7.7%), ketamine (32%), and hydromorphone (38%). The number of sedative and analgesic agents simultaneously administered increased over time for each patient, with more than 50% of patients requiring 3 or more agents by day 2. Compared with patients requiring 3 or fewer agents, as a group patients requiring more than 3 agents were of younger age, had an increased body mass index, increased serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations, had a lower PaO2:FIO2 (ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen), and were more likely to receive neuromuscular blockade. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the clinical impression of elevated sedative use in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 relative to guideline-recommended sedation practices in other critically ill populations.","Balakrishna, Aditi; Walsh, Elisa C; Hamidi, Arzo; Berg, Sheri; Austin, Daniel; Pino, Richard M; Hanidziar, Dusan; Chang, Marvin G; Bittner, Edward A",Am. j. health system pharm,260,20

Even though a safe vaccine exists for this disease, it remains one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in infants and young children. We aimed to create a retrospective descriptive study in which to analyze the evolution of the measles epidemic at the European level. The documentation was carried out using European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) statistics. At the same time, we present the epidemic's evolution in Romania, using data provided by the Romanian National Institute of Public Health and Ministry of Health. European statistical data indicate a high number of patients diagnosed with measles both among children and adults. All European countries benefit from the measles vaccination in the form of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) trivaccine included in their National Vaccination Programme. The vaccination schedule varies from country to country. In the vaccination scheme, most European countries include two doses of the MMR vaccine among the pediatric population. Romania registered a limited number of cases of measles between 1980 and 2015 following the introduction of the measles vaccination in the National Vaccination Programme. Since 2005, the Romanian vaccination schedule includes two doses of MMR trivaccine, administered at 12 months and at 6-7 years. After 2015, as a result of a significant decrease in the number of vaccinated children, Romania is facing a major increase in the cases of measles. Consecutively, a measles epidemic was declared in 2016 and an additional dose of mandatory MMR trivaccine was introduced at the age of 9 months. After 4 years of this schedule of administration, starting with August 2020, the additional dose of MMR administered during infancy has been discontinued. We propose an analysis of the factors that influenced the downward evolution of the measles epidemic in Romania at the beginning of the third millennium. Issues related to the limitation of interpersonal contact in the context of the social distancing imposed by the Sars-CoV-2 virus pandemic are discussed. We consider necessary a detailed documentation of the percentage of new disease cases that will appear in the pediatric population in the near future, in the context of the resumption of daily activity after the reopening of nurseries, kindergartens and schools.","Davitoiu, A.

This meta-analysis aimed at synthesizing the available evidence on the efficacy of HFNC on exercise capacity, lung function, and other factors related to pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients. Methods: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science) were searched for randomized trials comparing with conventional oxygen therapy (COT) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Primary outcomes were respiratory rate, FEV1, tidal volume, oxygen partial pressure, total score of St. George's respiratory questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, and exercise endurance time. Results: Ten trials met the criteria for inclusion. Combined data from six studies showed that HFNC showed a lower respiratory rate in COPD patients [mean difference -1.27 (95% CI: -1.65-(-0.89)]. Combined data from three studies showed a lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in the group of HFNC. No difference in tidal volume was showed between the HFNC and control groups in COPD patients. No significant oxygen improvement between the HFNC groups and control groups. The total score of St. George's respiratory questionnaire was improved by the subgroup analysis of HFNC versus COT but no NIV. Two multicenter RCTs showed the six-minute walk test, and statistical results showed that the length of the six-minute walk capacity was increased after usage of HFNC compared to the control group [mean difference -8.65 (95% CI: -9.12-(-8.19)]. No increase of exercise capacity after usage of HFNC (mean difference -12.65). Conclusion: In the first meta-analysis of the area, the current evidence did not show so much positive effect on tidal volume or oxygen improvement in COPD patients. Length of the six-minute walk capacity was increased after using HFNC, while other pulmonary rehabilitation parameters, namely, the score of St. George's respiratory questionnaire and exercise capacity show no increase in the group of HFNC. The variance in the quality of the evidence included in this meta-analysis highlights the need for this evidence to be followed up with further high-quality and more randomized trials.","Fu, Cuiping; Liu, Xin; Zhu, Qingqing; Wu, Xu; Hao, Shengyu; Xie, Liang; Li, Shanqun",Biomed Res Int,260,16

Although nonselective MMP inhibitors are known to induce serious side-effects, targeting individual MMPs may offer a safer therapeutic potential for several diseases. Hence, we provide a concise overview on MMP-12, given its association with pulmonary diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and other progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF), which may also occur in coronavirus disease 2019. RECENT FINDINGS: In asthma, COPD, and PPF, increased MMP-12 levels have been associated with inflammation and/or structural changes within the lungs and negatively correlated with functional parameters. Increased pulmonary MMP-12 levels and MMP-12 gene expression have been related to disease severity in asthma and COPD. Targeting MMP-12 showed potential in animal models of pulmonary diseases but human data are still very scarce. SUMMARY: Although there may be a potential role of MMP-12 in asthma, COPD and PPF, several pathophysiological aspects await elucidation. Targeting MMP-12 may provide further insights into MMP-12 related mechanisms and how this translates into clinical outcomes; this warrants further research.","Abd-Elaziz, Khalid; Jesenak, Milos; Vasakova, Martina; Diamant, Zuzana",Curr Opin Pulm Med,260,2

Considering the problematic consequences that the COVID-19 fake-news have brought, the scientific community has put effort to tackle it. To contribute to this fight against the infodemic, we aim to achieve a robust model for the COVID-19 fake-news detection task proposed at CONSTRAINT 2021 (FakeNews-19) by taking two separate approaches: 1) fine-tuning transformers based language models with robust loss functions and 2) removing harmful training instances through influence calculation. We further evaluate the robustness of our models by evaluating on different COVID-19 misinformation test set (Tweets-19) to understand model generalization ability. With the first approach, we achieve 98.13% for weighted F1 score (W-F1) for the shared task, whereas 38.18% W-F1 on the Tweets-19 highest. On the contrary, by performing influence data cleansing, our model with 99% cleansing percentage can achieve 54.33% W-F1 score on Tweets-19 with a trade-off. By evaluating our models on two COVID-19 fake-news test sets, we suggest the importance of model generalization ability in this task to step forward to tackle the COVID-19 fake-news problem in online social media platforms.","Bang, Yejin; Ishii, Etsuko; Cahyawijaya, Samuel; Ji, Ziwei; Fung, Pascale",,260,16

We aim to test whether BCG vaccination may reduce susceptibility to and/or the severity of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in health care workers (HCW) and thus prevent work absenteeism.The primary objective is to reduce absenteeism due to illness among HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objectives are to reduce the number of HCW that are infected with SARS-CoV-2, and to reduce the number of hospital admissions among HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. HYPOTHESIS: BCG vaccination of HCW will reduce absenteeism by 20% over a period of 6 months. TRIAL DESIGN: Placebo-controlled, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial, recruiting study participants at several geographic locations. The BCG vaccine is used in this study on a different indication than the one it has been approved for by the Danish Medicines Agency, therefore this is classified as a phase III study. PARTICIPANTS: The trial will recruit 1,500 HCW at Danish hospitals.To be eligible for participation, a subject must meet the following criteria: Adult (&#8805;18 years); Hospital personnel working at a participating hospital for more than 22 hours per week.A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: Known allergy to components of the BCG vaccine or serious adverse events to prior BCG administration Known prior active or latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) or other mycobacterial species Previous confirmed COVID-19 Fever (>38 C) within the past 24 hours Suspicion of active viral or bacterial infection Pregnancy Breastfeeding Vaccination with other live attenuated vaccine within the last 4 weeks Severely immunocompromised subjects. This exclusion category comprises: a) subjects with known infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) b) subjects with solid organ transplantation c) subjects with bone marrow transplantation d) subjects under chemotherapy e) subjects with primary immunodeficiency f) subjects under treatment with any anti-cytokine therapy within the last year g) subjects under treatment with oral or intravenous steroids defined as daily doses of 10 mg prednisone or equivalent for longer than 3 months h) Active solid or non-solid malignancy or lymphoma within the prior two years Direct involvement in the design or the execution of the BCG-DENMARK-COVID trial Intervention and comparator: Participants will be randomised to BCG vaccine (BCG-Denmark, AJ Vaccines, Copenhagen, Denmark) or placebo (saline). An adult dose of 0.1 ml of resuspended BCG vaccine (intervention) or 0.1 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution (control) is administered intradermally in the upper deltoid area of the right arm. All participants will receive one injection at inclusion, and no further treatment of study participants will take place. MAIN OUTCOMES: Main study endpoint: Days of unplanned absenteeism due to illness within 180 days of randomisation.Secondary study endpoints: The cumulative incidence of documented COVID-19 and the cumulative incidence of hospital admission for any reason within 180 days of randomisation.Randomisation: Randomisation will be done centrally using the REDCap tool with stratification by hospital, sex and age groups (+/- 45 years of age) in random blocks of 4 and 6. The allocation ratio is 1:1.Blinding (masking): Participants will be blinded to treatment. The participant will be asked to leave the room while the allocated treatment is prepared. Once ready for injection, vaccine and placebo will look similar, and the participant will not be able to tell the difference.The physicians administering the treatment are not blinded.Numbers to be randomised (sample size): Sample size: N=1,500. The 1,500 participants will be randomised 1:1 to BCG or placebo with 750 participants in each group.Trial Status: Current protocol version 5.1, from July 6, 2020.Recruitment of study participants started on May 18, 2020 and we anticipate having finished recruiting by the end of December 2020.

Results: Median age of the patients was 54 years, and 58% were males. All patients presented with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, only 37.5% failed trials of awake proning and required mechanical ventilation. Patients who received mechanical ventilation typically matched the H-phenotype of COVID-19 pneumonia, and 55.5% of these patients were successfully extubated. Conclusion: The most common reason for ICU admission in our series of 24 patients with severe COVID-19 was hypoxemic respiratory failure, which responded well to conservative measures such as awake proning and oxygen supplementation.

Using the same questionnaire translated from Italian to English, Arabic and Spanish, the study has investigated these ecosystems through the lens of University teachers. Despite cultural and infrastructural differences that unavoidably influenced the outcomes, we have detected common effects in the three samples, such as an increase of the working load and a better organization of the time at individual level. Network analysis methods also allowed us to identify some relationships between variables common to the three contexts. In particular, some variables clustered in all samples: a cluster related to the setting (infrastructure and technologies, competences and readiness to respond), one related to the characteristics of the didactic activities, and one related to expectations for the future about use of and involvement in on-line learning. In addition, the reproducibility of classroom dynamics seems to have high betweenness centrality in all three networks. In one case, that of Iraq, we have been also able to include in the causal networks the factors considered by the TAM (Technology Acceptance Model), but the networks appear not to be substantially influenced by the inclusion of TAM variables. On the basis of these results, we propose a Model for the Attitude to get Engaged in Technological Innovation (MAETI), to be used as possible reference framework for future investigation on the effects induced by technologies on use intentions.","Giovannella, C.; Passarelli, M.; Alkhafaji, A.

We issue our recommendations on the diagnosis and management of patients presenting this complication. METHODS: The multidisciplinary working group, led by the Spanish Federation of Medical and Scientific Associations (FACME) and including representatives of several scientific societies, reviewed the available evidence from the literature and reports of the European Medicines Agency. We establish a definition for suspected cases and issue diagnostic and treatment recommendations regarding vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia. RESULTS: We define suspected cases as those cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis occurring between 3 and 21 days after the administration of non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines, in patients with a platelet count below 150 000/µL or presenting a decrease of 50% with respect to the previous value. Findings suggestive of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia include the presence of antibodies to platelet factor 4, D-dimer levels 4 times greater than the upper limit of normal, and unexplained thrombosis. The recommended treatment includes intravenous administration of non-specific human immunoglobulin or alternatively plasmapheresis, avoiding the use of heparin, instead employing argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, or apixaban for anticoagulation, and avoiding platelet transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines may be associated with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopaenia; it is important to treat the dysimmune phenomenon and the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.","GarcÃ­a-AzorÃ­n, D.",Neurologia (Engl Ed),260,16

We aimed to assess the consistency of national and international surgical society recommendations regarding the choice of surgical approach; assess the quality of evidence of viral emission in surgical aerosol; and assess the quality of evidence comparing aerosol generation by different surgical energy devices. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases was performed. Three search strategies were employed. Twenty-eight studies were included in the final analysis and quality appraised. Confidence in review findings was assessed using the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) tool. RESULTS: Worldwide recommendations regarding open versus laparoscopic surgery are consistent, with a majority recommending that surgical approach is decided on a case-by-case, risk minimization approach. There is limited, low-quality evidence that viral particles can be emitted in surgical aerosol. There is a paucity of literature on the quantity of aerosol produced by different surgical energy devices, and no evidence to support the use of certain surgical instruments to minimize aerosol production. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable consistency among worldwide recommendations regarding the choice of surgical approach, although the evidence base is lacking. To inform clinical recommendations, further research examining viral emission, transmission, infectivity and amount of surgical aerosol produced is required.","Jacob, Susan; Hameed, Ahmer; Lam, Vincent; Pang, Tony Cy",ANZ j.

Worldwide, the delivery of transplant care is severely challenged by matters concerning - but not limited to - organ procurement, risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, screening strategies of donors and recipients, decisions to postpone or proceed with transplantation, the attributable risk of immunosuppression for COVID-19 and entrenched health care resources and capacity. The transplant community is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils: initiating immunosuppression and potentially accepting detrimental outcome when transplant recipients develop COVID-19 versus postponing transplantation and accepting associated waitlist mortality. Notably, prioritization of health care services for COVID-19 care raises concerns about allocation of resources to deliver care for transplant patients who might otherwise have excellent 1-year and 10-year survival rates. Children and young adults with end-stage organ disease in particular seem more disadvantaged by withholding transplantation because of capacity issues than from medical consequences of SARS-CoV-2. This report details the nationwide response of the Dutch transplant community to these issues and the immediate consequences for transplant activity. Worrisome, there was a significant decrease in organ donation numbers affecting all organ transplant services. In addition, there was a detrimental effect on transplantation numbers in children with end-organ failure. Ongoing efforts focus on mitigation of not only primary but also secondary harm of the pandemic and to find right definitions and momentum to restore the transplant programs.","de Vries, A P J; Alwayn, I P J; Hoek, R A S; van den Berg, A P; Ultee, F C W; Vogelaar, S M; Haase-Kromwijk, B J J M; Heemskerk, M B A; Hemke, A C; Nijboer, W N; Schaefer, B S; Kuiper, M A; de Jonge, J; van der Kaaij, N P; Reinders, M E J",Transpl Immunol,260,20

Methods: Between January 2014 and August 2020, 6 cases of traumatic calcaneal osteomyelitis with defect deformities were treated by simultaneous treatment of near-arc bone transport by Ilizarov technique. The patients were all male; aged from 40 to 61 years (mean, 49.3 years). The disease duration was 2-72 months, with an average of 16.1 months. All patients were traumatic calcaneal osteomyelitis, including 4 cases of falling from height, 1 case of traffic accident injury, and 1 case of crushing injury. The infection affected the talar-heel joint in 4 cases, and the talar-heel joint was fused or partially fused in 2 cases. After the external fixator was removed, the Maryland foot scoring system was used to evaluate the foot function, and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot function scoring system was used to evaluate the ankle-hindfoot function, and were compared with the preoperative scores. Results: All patients were followed up 1.5-26.0 months, with an average of 16.3 months. All incisions healed by first intention, no recurrence of infection occurred, and no surgical intervention such as second-stage bone grafting and fusion was performed. Five cases of calcaneal osteomyelitis with defect deformity underwent one-stage osteotomy and slipped, 1 case of the original bone mass after debridement after infection of calcaneal fractures slipped directly. The bone sliding time was 28-62 days, with an average of 38.7 days; the sliding distance was 3.1-5.2 cm, with an average of 3.6 cm. In 1 patient, due to the short follow-up time, the calcaneal slip bone had not healed, the external fixator had not been removed (not involved in clinical scoring), but the foot shape, reexamination of X-ray films and with frame walking were satisfactory. The time with external fixator was 6-8 months, with an average of 6.5 months in the other 5 cases. After removing the external fixator, the foot returned to three-point weight-bearing, and the longitudinal arch was recovered to varying degrees, and there was no obvious varus valgus. The Maryland score after removal of the external fixator was 80.8±4.7, which was significantly higher than that before operation (33.6±4.3) ( t=-35.782, P=0.000), 3 cases were excellent and 2 cases were good; the median AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score was 84, the interquartile range was (79, 86), which was significantly improved when compared with the preoperative score [the median score was 33.5, the interquartile range was (21.3, 37.5)] ( Z=-2.023, P=0.043), 4 cases were excellent and 1 case was good. Among them, pain, walking distance, getting rid of walking aids, going up and down stairs, deformity, etc. were significantly improved when compared with preoperative ones. Mobility such as subtalar and hock joints were poor or disappeared. Conclusion: Simultaneous treatment of traumatic calcaneal osteomyelitis and defect deformity with near-arc bone transport by Ilizarov technique can optimize the operation method, reduce the number of operations, and try to simulate the original shape of the calcaneus. It is an effective, economical, and novel treatment method.","Zhang, Lei; Chen, Yusheng; Wang, Xinwei; Hua, Haotian; Sheng, Jingya; Chen, Jiangfei; Guo, Zairan",Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi,260,21

The authors hypothesized that the effects of the pandemic would indicate differences based on the ethnicity of the participating dentist. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey was available online between June 1, 2020 and July 10, 2020, a period when many dental offices remained closed, and for the most part, unable to provide non-emergency dental care. The link to the survey was made available to dentists through outreach to several national dental organizations. Descriptive statistics summarized the characteristics of the entire sample and Fisher's exact test was used to examine respondents' answers stratified by ethnicity using frequencies and percentages. RESULTS: All ethnic groups reported decreased revenue and African American dentists were the least likely to report a decrease in revenue compared to White and Other ethnic groups (84.2%, 87.2% and 92.9%). African American dentists were the most likely to report willingness to contribute to a task force to address the new challenges resulting from COVID-19 when compared to White and Other ethnic groups (46.4%, 18.8%, and 29.6%, respectively). African American dentists were more likely to indicate a need for a stronger connection to academic programs as compared to White or Other dentists in order to address current and future challenges (12.3%, 0.0%, and 9.1%). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected dental practices differently, highlighting racial disparities, and strategies that factor in the race or ethnicity of the dentist and the communities in which they practice need to be considered to ensure that underserved communities receive needed resources.","Diab, Zeid; Shara, Nawar; Chou, Jiling; Libin, Alexander; Kuhn, Alexander; Farmer-Dixon, Cherae; Jackson, Andrea; Hughes, Bertram; Laurence, Brian",,260,14

In a previous work I have highlighted that the binding of the SARS-CoV spike proteins to the zinc-metalloprotease ACE2 has been shown to induce ACE2 shedding by activating the zinc-metalloprotease ADAM17, which ultimately leads to systemic upregulation of ACE2 activity. Moreover, based on experimental models, it was also shown the detrimental effect of the excessive systemic activity of ACE2 through its downstream pathways, which leads to ""clinical"" manifestations resembling COVID-19. In this regard, strong upregulation of circulating ACE2 activity was recently reported in COVID-19 patients, thus supporting the previous hypothesis that COVID-19 may derive from upregulation of ACE2 activity. Based on this, a reasonable hypothesis of using inhibitors that curb the upregulation of both ACE2 and ADAM17 zinc-metalloprotease activities and consequent positive feedback-loops (initially triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently sustained independently on viral trigger) is proposed as therapy for COVID-19. In particular, zinc-chelating agents such as citrate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) alone or in combination are expected to act in protecting from COVID-19 at different levels thanks to their both anticoagulant properties and inhibitory activity on zinc-metalloproteases. Several arguments are presented in support of this hypothesis and based on the current knowledge of both beneficial/harmful effects and cost/effectiveness, the use of chelating agents in the prevention and therapy of COVID-19 is proposed. In this regard, clinical trials (currently absent) employing citrate/EDTA in COVID-19 are urgently needed in order to shed more light on the efficacy of zinc chelators against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo.","Zamai, Loris",,260,3

A potentially high-risk group for PIU are those with symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD symptoms), because of restrictions in their physical activity levels and engagement in computer diversions requiring only short attention spans. METHODS: We used convenience sampling in a cross-sectional survey of university students from 30 universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. We assessed PIU using the Internet Addiction Test and ADHD symptoms using the WHO Adult ADHD Self-Report Screening Scale. Using logistic regression and linear regression analyses we adjusted for demographic, epidemic-related and psychological covariates in models of the association between ADHD symptoms and PIU. RESULTS: Among 11,254 participants, we found a 28.4% (95% CI, 27.5%-29.2%) prevalence of PIU, relatively higher than before the pandemic. In our final logistic regression model, participants with ADHD symptoms had approximately two times the risk for PIU (OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.89-2.83).

In this article, we describe the sequence of pathological changes in COVID-19 and discuss the implications for approaches to treatment. METHODS: Standardized autopsies were performed on thirteen patients who had died of COVID-19. The findings were analyzed together with clinical data from the patients' medical records. RESULTS: Most (77%) of the deceased patients were men. Their median age at death was 78 years (range, 41-90). Most of them had major pre-existing chronic diseases, most commonly arterial hypertension. The autopsies revealed characteristic COVID-19-induced pathological changes in the lungs, which were regarded as the cause of death in most patients. The main histological finding was sequential alveolar damage, apparently due in large measure to focal capillary microthrombus formation. Alveolar damage leads to the death of the patient either directly or by the induction of pulmonary parenchymal fibrosis. Diffuse lung damage was seen exclusively in invasively ventilated patients. CONCLUSION: Autopsies are crucial for the systematic assessment of new diseases such as COVID-19: they provide a basis for further investigations of disease mechanisms and for the devising of potentially effective modes of treatment. The autopsy findings suggest that focal damage of the microvascular pulmonary circulation is a main mechanism of lethal lung disease due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It may also be a cause of persistent lung damage in patients who recover from severe COVID-19.","Kommoss, Felix K F; Schwab, Constantin; Tavernar, Luca; Schreck, Johannes; Wagner, Willi L; Merle, Uta; Jonigk, Danny; Schirmacher, Peter; Longerich, Thomas",Dtsch Arztebl Int,260,20

In such a knowledge graph-based representation of drug discovery domains, crucial elements including genes, diseases and drugs are represented as entities or vertices, whilst relationships or edges between them indicate some level of interaction. For example, an edge between a disease and drug entity might represent a successful clinical trial, or an edge between two drug entities could indicate a potentially harmful interaction. In order to construct high-quality and ultimately informative knowledge graphs however, suitable data and information is of course required. In this review, we detail publicly available primary data sources containing information suitable for use in constructing various drug discovery focused knowledge graphs. We aim to help guide machine learning and knowledge graph practitioners who are interested in applying new techniques to the drug discovery field, but who may be unfamiliar with the relevant data sources. Overall we hope this review will help motivate more machine learning researchers to explore combining knowledge graphs and machine learning to help solve key and emerging questions in the drug discovery domain.","Bonner, Stephen; Barrett, Ian P; Ye, Cheng; Swiers, Rowan; Engkvist, Ola; Bender, Andreas; Hamilton, William",,260,1

With the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, we developed an alternative to contact-type fingertip photoplethysmography: a novel web camera-based contact-free MDD screening system (WCF-MSS) for non-contact measurement of autonomic transient responses induced by a mental task. METHODS: The WCF-MSS measures time-series interbeat intervals (IBI) by monitoring color tone changes in the facial region of interest induced by arterial pulsation using a web camera (1920 × 1080 pixels, 30 frames/s). Artifacts caused by body movements and head shakes are reduced. The WCF-MSS evaluates autonomic nervous activation from time-series IBI by calculating LF (0.04-0.15 Hz) components of heart rate variability (HRV) corresponding to sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity and HF (0.15-0.4 Hz) components equivalent to parasympathetic activities. The clinical test procedure comprises a pre-rest period (Pre-R;140 s), mental task period (MT;100 s), and post-rest period (Post-R;120 s). The WCF-MSS uses logistic regression analysis to discriminate MDD patients from healthy volunteers via an optimal combination of four explanatory variables determined by a minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm: HF during MT (HF (MT) ), the percentage change of LF from pre-rest to MT (%ΔLF((Pre-R⇒MT)) ), the percentage change of HF from pre-rest to MT (%ΔHF((Pre-R⇒MT)) ), and the percentage change of HF from MT to post-rest (%ΔHF((MT⇒Post-R)) ). To clinically test the WCF-MSS, 26 MDD patients (16 males and 10 females, 20-58 years) were recruited from BESLI Clinic in Tokyo, and 27 healthy volunteers (15 males and 12 females, 18-60 years) were recruited from Tokyo Metropolitan University and RICOH Company, Ltd. Electrocardiography was used to calculate HRV variables as references. RESULT: The WCF-MSS achieved 73% sensitivity and 85% specificity on 5-fold cross-validation. IBI correlated significantly with IBI from reference electrocardiography (r = 0.97, p &lt; 0.0001). Logit scores and subjective self-rating depression scale scores correlated significantly (r = 0.43, p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The WCF-MSS seems a promising contact-free MDD screening apparatus. This method enables web camera built-in smartphones to be used as MDD screening systems.","Unursaikhan, B.; Tanaka, N.; Sun, G.; Watanabe, S.; Yoshii, M.; Funahashi, K.; Sekimoto, F.; Hayashibara, F.; Yoshizawa, Y.; Choimaa, L.; Matsui, T.",Front Physiol,260,27

However, there are no effective treatments for this condition. Recent research suggests that continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a non-invasive brain stimulation, can reduce pain level, improve cognitive function and affective symptoms in multiple diseases or dysfunctions, including anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, sleep disorders and pain. But the potential benefits of cTBS in reducing postoperative delirium have not been investigated. Therefore, we propose determining whether cTBS can prevent and/or treat postoperative delirium in senior patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will be a double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Participants (65 years old or older) undergoing scheduled orthopaedic surgery (&#8805;2 hours, general anaesthesia) will be randomised to receive either cTBS or sham stimulation with a focal figure-of-eight coil over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 80% of the resting motor threshold. Every patient will receive 2-3 sets of stimulations during postoperative days (40 s per session, 3 sessions per set, 1 set per day). Participants will be assessed twice daily by a research assistant blinded to allocation. The primary outcome will be the incidence of postoperative delirium measured by the Confusion Assessment Method on postoperative days 1, 2 and 3. The secondary outcomes will be the severity and duration of postoperative delirium, cognitive function, pain, sleep quality, activities of daily living, length of hospital stay, discharge-to-facility or home, and rate of complication and mortality during the hospital stay. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the ethics committee of Shanghai 10th People's Hospital. The principal investigator will submit a research progress report to the ethics committee regularly. All participants will provide written informed consent. Study results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

In the literature, cutaneous symptoms associated with the disease are generally emphasized. However, there are very few studies on the effect of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus entering our lives on dermatological diseases, and none of them have used the dermatological quality of life index (DLQI). In our study, we aimed to evaluate the difficulties faced by the patients who applied to the dermatology outpatient clinic during the pandemic period and the course of their diseases with the dermatological quality of life index. The study was carried out prospectively by including dermatology patients who will apply to the outpatient clinic in June-July 2020. 282 patients were evaluated in the study. DLQI was significantly lower in the group using regular emollients (P < .001). When DLQI was compared between disease groups, it was found to be significantly different (P: .017). DLQI was found to worsen significantly compared to prepandemic studies. It was found that using moisturizer in this period helps to maintain the dermatological quality of life.","Daye, Munise; Temiz, Selami Aykut; Isik, Begüm; Dursun, Recep; Ataseven, Arzu",Dermatol Ther,260,20

METHODS: We supplemented a rapid literature search (including unpublished, non-peer reviewed and ongoing studies/reports) on dementia wellbeing in the context of COVID-19 with expert group members' consensus about future research needs. From this we generated potential research questions the group judged to be relevant that were not covered by the existing literature. RESULTS: Themes emerged from 141 studies within the six domains of the NHS England COVID-19 Dementia Wellbeing Pathway: Preventing Well, Diagnosing Well, Treating Well, Supporting Well, Living Well and Dying Well. We describe current research findings and knowledge gaps relating to the impact on people affected by dementia (individuals with a diagnosis, their carers and social contacts, health and social care practitioners and volunteers), services, research activities and organisations. Broad themes included the potential benefits and risks of new models of working including remote healthcare, the need for population-representative longitudinal studies to monitor longer-term impacts, and the importance of reporting dementia-related findings within broader health and care studies. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionately negative impact on people affected by dementia. Researchers and funding organisations have responded rapidly to try to understand the impacts. Future research should highlight and resolve outstanding questions to develop evidence-based measures to improve the quality of life of people affected by dementia.","Liu, Kathy Y; Howard, Robert; Banerjee, Sube; Comas-Herrera, Adelina; Goddard, Joanne; Knapp, Martin; Livingston, Gill; Manthorpe, Jill; O039,; Brien, John T; Paterson, Ross W; Robinson, Louise; Rossor, Martin; Rowe, James B; Sharp, David J; Sommerlad, Andrew; Suárez-González, Aida; Burns, Alistair",Int. j. geriatr. psychiatry,260,16

To this end, we augment the iso-flux tension propagation (IFTP) theory with electrostatics for a negatively charged biopolymer pulled through a nanopore embedded in a similarly charged anionic membrane. We show that in the realistic case of a single-stranded DNA molecule, dilute salt conditions characterized by weak charge screening, and a negatively charged membrane, the translocation dynamics is unexpectedly accelerated despite the presence of large repulsive electrostatic interactions between the polymer coil on the {it cis} side and the charged membrane. This is due to the rapid release of the electrostatic potential energy of the coil during translocation, leading to an effectively attractive force that assists end-driven translocation. The speedup results in non-monotonic polymer length and membrane charge dependence of the exponent $alpha$ characterizing the translocation time $tau propto N_0^alpha$ of the polymer with length $N_0$. In the regime of long polymers $N_0gtrsim500$, the translocation exponent exceeds its upper limit $alpha=2$ previously observed for the same system without electrostatic interactions.","Sarabadani, Jalal; Buyukdagli, Sahin; Ala-Nissila, Tapio",J. phys. condens. matter,260,24

Nevertheless, the pace of COVID-19 hematology-related research has continued to accelerate and has established the role of laboratory hematology data for many purposes including disease prognosis and outcome. The purpose of this scoping review was to assess the current state of COVID-19 laboratory hematology research. A comprehensive search of the literature published between December 1, 2019, and July 3, 2020, was performed, and we analyzed the sources, publication dates, study types, and topics of the retrieved studies. Overall, 402 studies were included in this scoping review. Approximately half of these studies (n = 202, 50.37%) originated in China. Retrospective cohort studies comprised the largest study type (n = 176, 43.89%). Prognosis/ risk factors, epidemiology, and coagulation were the most common topics. The number of studies published per day has increased through the end of May. The studies were heavily biased in favor of papers originating in China and on retrospective clinical studies with limited use of and reporting of laboratory data. Despite the major improvements in our understanding of the role of coagulation, automated hematology, and cell morphology in COVID-19, there are gaps in the literature, including biosafety and the laboratory role in screening and prevention of COVID-19. There is a gap in the publication of papers focused on guidelines for the laboratory.

However, most research on sexual activity during the COVID-19 pandemic focused on heterosexual individuals. The only study so far on men who have sex with men was conducted in the United States. AIM: Our study expands the understanding of sexual activity during the COVID-19 pandemic by studying gay and bisexual men in Hong Kong. Although sexual desire and sexual activity continue to be important aspects of one's life during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are COVID-19-related barriers to having sex. This study therefore examined the association between sexual desire, COVID-19-related barriers, and whether to engage in sexual activity or not during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: 857 cisgender sexual minority people in Hong Kong participated in an online survey study, and for this article, only male participants were included in the analysis, yielding an analytical sample of 376 gay and bisexual men. OUTCOMES: Participants were asked to assess their sexual desire (ie, sexual drive and sexual motivation), COVID-19-related barriers (ie, perceived difficulties to have sex with another person during the pandemic and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection), and sexual activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: It was found that while sexual desire remained prevalent among the gay and bisexual men, COVID-19-related barriers were also commonly observed. Sexual drive and sexual motivation were positively associated with sexual activity. Perceived difficulties to have sex with another person during the pandemic and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection were negatively predictive of engaging in sexual activity, after controlling for general sexual desire. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Understanding the ambivalence and driving and inhibiting factors for having sex during the COVID-19 pandemic can provide a new framework for understanding people's sexual activity during an unprecedented scale of the pandemic. It is likely that abstinence would not work as the respondents expressed strong sexual desire and that the pandemic is going to last for a long time. Governments, policy makers, and sexual scientists need to work together to come up with practicable, feasible, and easy-to-follow guidelines for having sex during the pandemic. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This is one of the first studies to examine the impact of COVID-19 on sexual activity among gay and bisexual men. The results should be interpreted with caution because of the use of cross-sectional design and nonprobability sampling. CONCLUSION: Sexual desire and COVID-19-related barriers serve as driving and inhibiting factors in explaining whether or not people have sex during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suen YT, Chan RCH, Wong EMY.

The ACE1 D allele is associated with higher ACE1 concentrations in tissues. Previous research has shown that susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is primarily determined by the affinity between the viral receptor-binding domain and the host human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. In the human genome, ACE2 is identified as a homolog to ACE1. Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize the ACE1 D allele distribution in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H), so as to compare it to population data from other European countries and to investigate the potential correlation between D allele frequencies and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiological findings in selected European populations. Methods: The ACE1 D allele frequencies in 18 selected European populations were analyzed and compared with COVID-19 prevalence, mortality, and severity using multivariate linear regression analysis. Results and Discussion: The ACE1 D allele distribution within the B&H population was similar to its distribution in other European populations. Regression analysis showed no significant correlation between the D allele frequency and the incidence of infections between the examined populations, nor with the rates of fatality and severe cases. Conclusion: There is no clear statistical evidence that the ACE1 D allele is associated with increased or decreased COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and case severity within the investigated populations.","Cenanovic, Merisa; Dogan, Serkan; Asic, Adna; Besic, Larisa; Marjanovic, Damir",Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,260,12

COMMENT: COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to thromboembolic events, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Various studies have emphasized the role of neutrophil elastase (NE) in the development of DIC in patients with ARDS and sepsis. It has been shown that NE inhibition by sivelestat mitigates ALI through amelioration of injuries in alveolar epithelium and vascular endothelium, as well as reversing the neutrophil-mediated increased vascular permeability. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: Sivelestat, a selective NE inhibitor, has not been evaluated for its possible therapeutic effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on its promising beneficial effects in underlying complications of COVID-19, sivelestat could be considered as a promising modality for better management of COVID-19-induced ALI/ARDS or coagulopathy.","Sahebnasagh, Adeleh; Saghafi, Fatemeh; Safdari, Mohammadreza; Khataminia, Masoud; Sadremomtaz, Afsaneh; Talaei, Zeinab; Rezai Ghaleno, Hassan; Bagheri, Mahdi; Habtemariam, Solomon; Avan, Razieh",J. clin. pharm. ther,260,16

Meanwhile, reports of episodes of discrimination and violence towards healthcare workers increased globally. This study explores the association between perceived discrimination and mental health outcomes in a large sample of healthcare workers in Spain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthcare workers from inpatient and outpatient facilities (N=2053) filled an on-line questionnaire in May or June 2020. Mental health outcomes included depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]), psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire [GHQ-12]) and death thoughts (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS]). We also measured perceived discrimination and/or stigmatization due to being a healthcare worker since pandemic onset. Regression models adjusted for potential confounding sources (age, sex, history of a mental health diagnosis and type of job) were fitted. RESULTS: Thirty percent of the respondents reported discrimination and/or stigmatization. Perceived discrimination was associated with higher depression (B=2.4, 95 percent CI: 1.8, 2.9) and psychological distress (B=1.1, 95 percent CI: 0.7, 1.4) scores, and with a 2-fold increase in risk of reporting death thoughts (OR=2.0, 95 percent CI: 1.4, 3.1). CONCLUSIONS: Perceived discrimination is a modifiable driver of mental health problems among healthcare workers. Mass media, legislators, and healthcare institutions must put in place prevention and restoration strategies to limit discrimination towards healthcare workers and reduce its mental health impact.","Mediavilla, Roberto; Fernández-Jiménez, Eduardo; Andreo, Jorge; Morán-Sánchez, Inés; José, Ainoa Muñoz-San; Moreno-Küstner, Berta; Mascayano, Franco; Ayuso-Mateos, José Luis; Bravo-Ortiz, María-Fe; Martínez-Alés, Gonzalo","Rev. psiquiatr. salud ment.

Previous research has found celebrity illness disclosures to influence behavior, but during the uncertainty of a pandemic, the effects of such a disclosure were unclear. OBJECTIVE: To test the proposed Celebrity Illness Disclosure Effects (CIDE) model, demonstrating how an illness disclosure, communicated through mediated and interpersonal channels, may shape willingness to engage in prevention behaviors. METHODS: We conducted an online survey (N = 587) 24 hours after Hanks' COVID-19 disclosure. RESULTS: Findings revealed that celebrity-related perception variables predicted illness-related cognitions and emotions\, which were associated with willingness to enact prevention behaviors. Greater willingness to seek information, stronger perceptions of COVID as a threat, and stronger perceptions of efficacy for dealing with COVID after learning of Hanks' diagnosis predicted stronger willingness to enact prevention behaviors. However, anxiety about COVID predicted lower willingness to enact prevention behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The CIDE model can serve as a guide for future research in this area. The results can help scholars who aim to better understand the phenomena around celebrities and health communication as well as policymakers who hope to ride the wave of star power to improved public health outcomes.","Myrick, Jessica Gall; Willoughby, Jessica Fitts",Soc Sci Med,260,33

This research examined the feasibility, acceptability and outcomes of delivering a 6-week yoga-based meditation intervention to clinical teams of hospice professionals (HPs) at a large non-profit hospice organization. The intervention was designed to increase mind-body integration and combat burnout. This article was written for different audiences, including research scientists who study interoception, burnout, meditation, or yoga, designers of meditation interventions, and hospice organizations looking for ways to mitigate HP burnout. (2) Methods. The intervention was launched within clinical teams, beginning with a half-hour online introduction to the program and exposure to the week 1 meditation at each team's monthly all-staff meeting. Throughout the program, HPs could access the meditations on their own via their workplace computers, tablets, and smartphones. Online pre- and post-intervention surveys were submitted by 151 HPs, 76 of whom were exposed to the intervention and completed both surveys. The surveys assessed burnout using the Professional Fulfillment Index and mind-body integration using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness scales. (3) Results. Two-thirds of HPs who were present at a staff meeting where the program was introduced went on to do a meditation on their own at least once. Half of HPs expressed a desire to continue with access to the meditations after the 6-week program ended. Due to COVID-19 work from home restrictions, three-fourth of HPs did a meditation at home, 29% in a car between patient visits (not while driving), and 23% at the office. Higher interoceptive awareness was significantly related to lower burnout, particularly lower work exhaustion. Meditation frequency was significantly related to higher interoceptive awareness but not to burnout. Interpersonal disengagement was rare and temporary. (4) Conclusions. Findings showed that the yoga-based meditation intervention was feasible and acceptable and associated with higher interoceptive awareness. The results point to a role for interoceptive awareness in reducing the risk for burnout.","Heeter, Carrie; Allbritton, Marcel; Lehto, Rebecca; Miller, Patrick; McDaniel, Patricia; Paletta, Michael",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),260,10

Millions of people have become infected with the disease, while billions of people have been continually asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that it is associated with large-scale behavioral and mental health changes; however, few studies have been able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these changes to previous years of data for the same individuals. OBJECTIVE: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data in a cohort of college-aged students enrolled in a longitudinal study, we seek to understand the behavioral and mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, measured by interest across the United States in the search terms coronavirus and COVID fatigue. METHODS: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone use, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Spring 2020 term, as compared to previous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models. RESULTS: Linear mixed models demonstrated differences in phone use, sleep, sedentary time and number of locations visited associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In further models, these behaviors were strongly associated with increased interest in COVID fatigue. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, phone use, sedentary time), both anxiety and depression (P<.001) were significantly associated with interest in COVID fatigue. Notably, these behavioral and mental health changes are consistent with those observed around the initial implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: In the initial lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent more time on their phones, were more sedentary, visited fewer locations, and exhibited increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. As the pandemic persisted through the spring, people continued to exhibit very similar changes in both mental health and behaviors. Although these large-scale shifts in mental health and behaviors are unsurprising, understanding them is critical in disrupting the negative consequences to mental health during the ongoing pandemic.","Mack, Dante L; DaSilva, Alex W; Rogers, Courtney; Hedlund, Elin; Murphy, Eilis I; Vojdanovski, Vlado; Plomp, Jane; Wang, Weichen; Nepal, Subigya K; Holtzheimer, Paul E; Wagner, Dylan D; Jacobson, Nicholas C; Meyer, Meghan L; Campbell, Andrew T; Huckins, Jeremy F",J Med Internet Res,260,6

AIMS: This study is aimed to summarize the existing data regarding anxiety, depression, and psychological distress during the covid-19 pandemic among the wider population so that effective intervention strategies will be initiated. METHODS: Pieces of literature that assessed anxiety, depression, and psychological distress among the general population during the COVID pandemic period were systematically gathered. Data extraction in Microsoft excel was done by two independent reviewers using predefined criteria. The analysis was done using a stata-11 and random effect model. A sub-group and sensitivity analysis was done. Besides, the funnel plot and eggers publication bias test was tested. RESULTS: Sixteen studies that assessed 78,225 participants were included. Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis for anxiety prevalence. The average prevalence of anxiety was found to be 38.12%. A sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was 33.33% in China and 47.70% in other countries (Italy, Turkey, and India). Anxiety prevalence in studies measured with the DASS-21 scale, GAD-7 scale, and other tools (SAS, HADS, and 5-point Likert scale) was 23.4%, 40.73%, and 44.47% respectively. The prevalence of anxiety in studies that assessed a sample size above 2,000 participants was 40.33%. The average prevalence of depression among included studies was 34.31% and a sub-group analysis showed that depression was higher in China (36.32%) than in other countries (28.3%). Moreover, six studies reported psychological distress and the average prevalence was 37.54%. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that anxiety, depression, and psychological distress are potential public mental health problems of the global community that suggests the need for early recognition and initiation of interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Necho, Mogesie; Tsehay, Mekonnen; Birkie, Mengesha; Biset, Gebyaw; Tadesse, Erkihun",Int J Soc Psychiatry,260,24

Despite the severity of some cases, there are no current pathogen-specific antivirals available to treat the disease. Therefore, many studies have focused on the evaluation of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of clinically available drugs. Here, we conducted a systematic review to describe the drug repositioning strategy against SARS-CoV-2 and to discuss the clinical impact of this approach in the current pandemic context. The systematic review was performed on March 23, 2020, using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde (BVS). The data were summarized in tables and critically analyzed. After the database search, 12 relevant studies were identified as eligible for the review. Among the drugs reported in these studies, 57 showed some evidence of antiviral activity. Antivirals, especially antiretrovirals, are the main class of therapeutic agents evaluated against COVID-19. Moreover, studies have reported the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of antitumor (16%; 9/57), antimalarial (7%, 4/57), and antibacterial (5%; 3/57) agents. Additionally, seven pharmacological agents (chloroquine, tetrandrine, umifenovir (arbidol), carrimycin, damageprevir, lopinavir/ritonavir) are in phase IV of clinical trials. Due to the evidence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of various clinically available agents, drug repositioning stands out as a promising strategy for a short-term response in the fight against the novel coronavirus.","Lima, William Gustavo; Brito, Júlio César Moreira; Overhage, Joerg; Nizer, Waleska Stephanie da Cruz",Arch Virol,260,1

Over 12 million people have been affected across several countries since it was first recognized. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to commonly spread via respiratory droplets formed while talking, coughing, and sneezing of an infected patient. As several cases, with an absence of travel history to the majorly affected areas were identified, a strong possibility of community transmission could have been possible. Broadly, two modes of transmission of COVID-19 exist-direct and indirect. The direct mode includes (1) transmission via aerosols formed via surgical and dental procedures and/or in the form of respiratory droplet nuclei; (2) other body fluids and secretions, for example, feces, saliva, urine, semen, and tears; and (3) mother-to-child. Indirect transmission may occur via (1) fomites or surfaces (e.g., furniture and fixtures) present within the immediate environment of an infected patient and (2) objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). As many of these modes may be underestimated, it is necessary to emphasize and illustrate them. The goal of this paper is to briefly review how SARS-CoV-2 is shown to transmit via various modes and propose measures to reduce the risk of spread within the population and operating personnel.","Karia, Rutu; Gupta, Ishita; Khandait, Harshwardhan; Yadav, Ashima; Yadav, Anmol",SN Compr Clin Med,260,14

However, there is noticeable the lack of clinical trials that confirm the efficacy, security, absence of side effects in the short and long term, and the effective doses of melatonin. This point is especially important in diseases with high morbidity and mortality including COVID-19. There is not treatment for COVID-19, and several anti-inflammatory and antiviral molecules are being tested, and different vaccines are in preparation. Although the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is apparently improving, it is expected new resurges next fall. Thus, looking for an effective treatment of COVID-19 is mandatory. Melatonin has significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and mitochondrial protective effects, and its efficacy has been demonstrated in multiple experimental models of disease and in a clinical trial in sepsis. Because COVID-19 courses with a severe septic response, multiple reviews proposing melatonin as a treatment for COVID-19 have been published. Nevertheless, there is a lack of experimental and clinical data on the use of melatonin on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accordingly, we designed a clinical trial with an injectable formulation of melatonin for intravenous perfusion in ICU patients suffering from COVID-19 that has been just approved by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS). The trial will allow by the first time understand the doses and efficacy of melatonin against COVID-19.","Acuña-Castroviejo, Dario; Escames, Germaine; Figueira, Juan C; de la Oliva, Pedro; Borobia, Alberto M; Acuña-Fernández, Carlos",J Pineal Res,260,1

We hypothesized that achieving glycemic control soon after admission, in both intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU settings, could affect outcomes in patients with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed pooled data from the Glytec national database including 1,544 patients with COVID-19 from 91 hospitals in 12 states. Patients were stratified according to achieved mean glucose category in mg/dL (&#8804;7.77, 7.83-10, 10.1-13.88, and >13.88 mmol/L; &#8804;140, 141-180, 181-250, and >250 mg/dL) during days 2-3 in non-ICU patients or on day 2 in ICU patients. We conducted a survival analysis to determine the association between glucose category and hospital mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 18.1% (279/1,544) of patients died in the hospital. In non-ICU patients, severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose [BG] >13.88 mmol/L [250 mg/dL]) on days 2-3 was independently associated with high mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 7.17; 95% CI 2.62-19.62) compared with patients with BG <7.77 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). This relationship was not significant for admission glucose (HR 1.465; 95% CI 0.683-3.143). In patients admitted directly to the ICU, severe hyperglycemia on admission was associated with increased mortality (adjusted HR 3.14; 95% CI 1.44-6.88). This relationship was not significant on day 2 (HR 1.40; 95% CI 0.53-3.69). Hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL) was also associated with increased mortality (odds ratio 2.2; 95% CI 1.35-3.60). CONCLUSIONS: Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia were associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Admission glucose was a strong predictor of death among patients directly admitted to the ICU. Severe hyperglycemia after admission was a strong predictor of death among non-ICU patients.","Klonoff, David C; Messler, Jordan C; Umpierrez, Guillermo E; Peng, Limin; Booth, Robby; Crowe, Jennifer; Garrett, Valerie; McFarland, Raymie; Pasquel, Francisco J",Diabetes Care,260,20

The collaborative approach with multiple partners proved to be efficient and was able to reach a large audience, particularly in the case of the webinars. However, the impact in terms of use of tools and training of others after the events was higher for the workshops. In addition, engagement with experts was higher from workshop participants. In terms of efficiency, webinars are significantly cheaper to organize.

In the present work, the sigmoidal-Boltzmann mathematical model was applied to study the Covid-19 spread in 15 different countries. The cumulative number of infected persons I has been accurately fitted by the sigmoidal-Boltzmann equation (SBE), giving rise to different epidemiological parameters such as the pandemic peak tp, the maximum number of infected persons Imax, and the time of the epidemic stabilization t&#8734;. The time constant relative to the sigmoid &#916;t (called also the slope factor) was revealed to be the determining parameter which influences all the epidemiological parameters. Empirical laws between the different parameters allowed us to propose a modified sigmoidal-Boltzmann equation describing the spread of the pandemic. The expression of the spread speed Vp was further determined as a function of the sigmoid parameters. This made it possible to assess the maximum speed of spread of the virus Vpmax and to trace the speed profile in each country. In addition, for countries undergoing a second pandemic wave, the cumulative number of infected people I has been successfully adjusted by a double sigmoidal-Boltzmann equation (DSBE) allowing the comparison between the two waves. Finally, the comparison between the maximum virus spread of two waves Vp max 1 and Vp max 2 showed that the intensity of the second wave of Covid-19 is low compared to the first for all the countries studied.","El Aferni, Ahmed; Guettari, Moez; Tajouri, Tahar",,260,16

Following the first reported case of GBS after Zika virus infection in 2013, there has been a considerable increase in the incidence of GBS in endemic countries such as French Polynesia and Latin American countries. The association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and GBS is another emerging research hotspot. Electrophysiological studies have suggested that GBS patients associated with Zika virus infection or COVID-19 tend to manifest acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, rather than acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). Causative autoantibodies, such as anti-ganglioside antibodies in AMAN associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection, have not been identified in GBS associated with these emerging infectious diseases. Nevertheless, recent studies suggested molecular mimicry between these viruses and human proteins related to GBS. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of new vaccines, containing artificial messenger RNA encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV2, against COVID-19. These vaccines are now available in many countries and massive vaccination campaigns are currently ongoing. Although there are long-standing concerns about the increased risk of GBS after inoculation of conventional vaccines, the risk of GBS is not considered a legitimate reason to limit administration of currently available vaccines because the benefits outweigh the risks.","Koike, Haruki Katsuno Masahisa",Clinical and Experimental Neuroimmunology,260,24

We conducted the first representative national phone survey among the adult population of Qatar, between December 2020 and January 2021, to estimate the prevalence and identify potential determinants of vaccine willingness: acceptance (strongly agree), resistance (strongly disagree), and hesitance (somewhat agree, neutral, somewhat disagree). Bivariate and multinomial logistic regression models estimated associations between willingness groups and fifteen variables. In the total sample, 42.7% (95% CI: 39.5–46.1) were accepting, 45.2% (95% CI: 41.9–48.4) hesitant, and 12.1% (95% CI: 10.1–14.4) resistant. Vaccine resistant compared with hesistant and accepting groups reported no endorsement source will increase vaccine confidence (58.9% vs. 5.6% vs. 0.2%, respectively). Female gender, Arab ethnicity, migrant status/type, and vaccine side-effects concerns were associated with hesitancy and resistance. COVID-19 related bereavement, infection, and quarantine status were not significantly associated with any willingness group. Absence of or lack of concern about contracting the virus was solely associated with resistance.

Despite substantial workforce planning efforts, the effectiveness of this planning has been criticised. Education, training, and workforce plans have typically considered each health-care profession in isolation and have not adequately responded to changing health and care needs. The results are persistent vacancies, poor morale, and low retention. Areas of particular concern highlighted in this Health Policy paper include primary care, mental health, nursing, clinical and non-clinical support, and social care. Responses to workforce shortfalls have included a high reliance on foreign and temporary staff, small-scale changes in skill mix, and enhanced recruitment drives. Impending challenges for the UK health and care workforce include growing multimorbidity, an increasing shortfall in the supply of unpaid carers, and the relative decline of the attractiveness of the National Health Service (NHS) as an employer internationally. We argue that to secure a sustainable and fit-for-purpose health and care workforce, integrated workforce approaches need to be developed alongside reforms to education and training that reflect changes in roles and skill mix, as well as the trend towards multidisciplinary working. Enhancing career development opportunities, promoting staff wellbeing, and tackling discrimination in the NHS are all needed to improve recruitment, retention, and morale of staff. An urgent priority is to offer sufficient aftercare and support to staff who have been exposed to high-risk situations and traumatic experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to growing calls to recognise and reward health and care staff, growth in pay must at least keep pace with projected rises in average earnings, which in turn will require linking future NHS funding allocations to rises in pay. Through illustrative projections, we show that, to sustain annual growth in the workforce at approximately 2·4%, increases in NHS expenditure of 4% annually in real terms will be required. Above all, a radical long-term strategic vision is needed to ensure that the future NHS workforce is fit for purpose.","Anderson, Michael; O039,; Neill, Ciaran; Macleod Clark, Jill; Street, Andrew; Woods, Michael; Johnston-Webber, Charlotte; Charlesworth, Anita; Whyte, Moira; Foster, Margaret; Majeed, Azeem; Pitchforth, Emma; Mossialos, Elias; Asaria, Miqdad; McGuire, Alistair",Lancet,260,16

Despite its relevance, e information is scarse about its evolutionary traces. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversification patterns of the spike for each clade of SARS-CoV-2 through different approaches. Two thousand and one hundred sequences representing the seven clades of the SARS-CoV-2 were included. Patterns of genetic diversifications and nucleotide evolutionary rate were estimated for the spike genomic region. The haplotype networks showed a star shape, where multiple haplotypes with few nucleotide differences diverge from a common ancestor. Four hundred seventy-nine different haplotypes were defined in the seven analyzed clades. The main haplotype, named Hap-1, was the most frequent for clades G (54%), GH (54%), and GR (56%) and a different haplotype (named Hap-252) was the most important for clades L (63.3%), O (39.7%), S (51.7%), and V (70%). The evolutionary rate for the spike protein was estimated as 1.08 × 10-3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year. Moreover, the nucleotide evolutionary rate after nine months of the pandemic was similar for each clade. In conclusion, the present evolutionary analysis is relevant as the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the target for most therapeutic candidates; besides, changes in this protein could have consequences on viral transmission, response to antivirals and efficacy of vaccines. Moreover, the evolutionary characterization of clades improves knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and deserves to be assessed in more detail as re-infection by different phylogenetic clades has been reported.","Pereson, Matías J; Flichman, Diego M; Martínez, Alfredo P; Baré, Patricia; Garcia, Gabriel H; Di Lello, Federico A",J Med Virol,260,16

METHODS: In the setting of the STROKOVID study including patients with acute ischemic stroke consecutively admitted to the ten hub hospitals in Lombardy, Italy, between March 8 and April 30, 2020, we compared clinical features of patients with confirmed infection and non-infected patients by logistic regression models and survival analysis. Then, we trained and tested a random forest (RF) binary classifier for the prediction of in-hospital death among patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 1013 patients, 160 (15.8%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.06-2.27) and atrial fibrillation (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.05-2.43) were independently associated with COVID-19 status. Patients with COVID-19 had increased stroke severity at admission [median NIHSS score, 9 (25th to75th percentile, 13) vs 6 (25th to75th percentile, 9)] and increased risk of in-hospital death (38.1% deaths vs 7.2%; HR 3.30; 95% CI 2.17-5.02). The RF model based on six clinical and laboratory parameters exhibited high cross-validated classification accuracy (0.86) and precision (0.87), good recall (0.72) and F1-score (0.79) in predicting in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic strokes in COVID-19 patients have distinctive risk factor profile and etiology, increased clinical severity and higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to non-COVID-19 patients. A simple model based on clinical and routine laboratory parameters may be useful in identifying ischemic stroke patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are unlikely to survive the acute phase.","Pezzini, Alessandro; Grassi, Mario; Silvestrelli, Giorgio; Locatelli, Martina; Rifino, Nicola; Beretta, Simone; Gamba, Massimo; Raimondi, Elisa; Giussani, Giuditta; Carimati, Federico; Sangalli, Davide; Corato, Manuel; Gerevini, Simonetta; Masciocchi, Stefano; Cortinovis, Matteo; La Gioia, Sara; Barbieri, Francesca; Mazzoleni, Valentina; Pezzini, Debora; Bonacina, Sonia; Pilotto, Andrea; Benussi, Alberto; Magoni, Mauro; Premi, Enrico; Prelle, Alessandro Cesare; Agostoni, Elio Clemente; Palluzzi, Fernando; De Giuli, Valeria; Magherini, Anna; Roccatagliata, Daria Valeria; Vinciguerra, Luisa; Puglisi, Valentina; Fusi, Laura; Diamanti, Susanna; Santangelo, Francesco; Xhani, Rubjona; Pozzi, Federico; Grampa, Giampiero; Versino, Maurizio; Salmaggi, Andrea; Marcheselli, Simona; Cavallini, Anna; Giossi, Alessia; Censori, Bruno; Ferrarese, Carlo; Ciccone, Alfonso; Sessa, Maria; Padovani, Alessandro",J. neurol,260,1

We describe and utilize an original approach based on statistical physics to predict the societal transmission timescale and the universal recovery trajectory resulting from the countermeasures implemented in entire societies. We compare the whole-society infection growth rates for many countries and local regions, to illustrate the common physical and mathematical basis for the viral spread and infection rate reduction, and validate the theory and resulting correlations. We show that methods traditionally considered for the numerical analysis and the control of individual virus transmission (e.g. ℜ0scaling) represent one special case of the theory, and also compare our results to the available IHME computer model outcomes. We proceed to illustrate several interesting features of the different approaches to the mitigation of the pandemic, related to social isolation and “lockdown” tactics. Finally, we use presently available data from many countries to make actual predictions of the time needed for securing minimum infection rates in the future, highlighting the differences that emerge between isolated “islands” and mobile cities, and identifying the desired overall recovery trajectory.","Duffey, Romney B.; Zio, Enrico",Saf.

The central event in the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis is the conversion of tachyzoites into encysted bradyzoites. A novel approach to analyze the structure of in vivo-derived tissue cysts may be the increasingly used computational image analysis. The objective of this study was to quantify the geometrical complexity of T. gondii cysts by morphological, particle, and fractal analysis, as well as to determine if it is impacted by parasite strain, cyst age, and host type. A total of 31 images of T. gondii brain cysts of four type-2 strains (Me49, and local isolates BGD1, BGD14, and BGD26) was analyzed using ImageJ software. The parameters of interest included diameter, circularity, packing density (PD), fractal dimension (FD), and lacunarity. Although cyst diameter varied widely, its negative correlation with PD was observed. Circularity was remarkably close to 1, indicating a perfectly round shape of the cysts. PD and FD did not vary among cysts of different strains, age, and derived from mice of different genetic background. Conversely, lacunarity, which is a measure of heterogeneity, was significantly lower for BGD1 strain vs. all other strains, and higher for Me49 vs. BGD14 and BGD26, but did not differ among Me49 cysts of different age, or those derived from genetically different mice. The results indicate a highly uniform structure and occupancy of the different T. gondii tissue cysts. This study furthers the use of image analysis in describing the structural complexity of T. gondii cyst morphology, and presents the first application of fractal analysis for this purpose. The presented results show that use of a freely available software is a cost-effective approach to advance automated image scoring for T. gondii cysts.","Bauman, Neda; Ilic, Andjelija; Lijeskic, Olivera; Uzelac, Aleksandra; Klun, Ivana; Srbljanovic, Jelena; Cirkovic, Vladimir; Bobic, Branko; Stajner, Tijana; Djurkovic-Djakovic, Olgica",PLoS One,260,20

Such measures are expected to have consequences on mental health. Aims: In this study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of quarantine-related anxiety and its socioeconomic correlates. Methods: An online questionnaire was utilized to collect information about quarantine-related anxiety and related factors from a non-representative sample of Jordanian population in March 2020. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was used to ascertain the level of stress. Using STATA 16, multivariable ordinal logistic regression was done to estimate beta-coefficient (ß) and corresponding 95% CI of the anxiety level. Results: Overall, 5274 participants returned the survey. The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe anxiety was 21.5%, 10.9%, and 6%, respectively. Female gender (ß= 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.59) and more members of the household (ß= 0.04, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.07) were correlated with a higher degree of anxiety, while older age (ß= -0.27, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.20), having larger social network (ß= -0.17, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.13), social support (ß= -0.28, 95% CI: -0.32 to -0.23), and higher income (>2000 Jordanian Dinars vs reference, ß= -0.52, 95% CI: -0.71 to -0.33) were correlated with lower BAI scores. Conclusion: Our findings showed that approximately four out of every ten participants experienced quarantine-related anxiety. Younger participants, women, and people with poor social support were more likely to experience quarantine-related anxiety. These findings highlight the importance of targeting these groups to mitigate the consequence of home quarantine on public health.","Massad, Islam; Al-Taher, Raed; Massad, Faysal; Al-Sabbagh, Mohammed Qussay; Haddad, Murad; Abufaraj, Mohammad",East Mediterr Health J,260,17

DESIGN: A qualitative study based on grounded theory. METHODS: Individual semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted from January 2020-February 2020 with 10 nurses who were isolated at home sharing the experiences of the epidemic of COVID-19. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analysed using constant comparative data analysis. RESULTS: Analyses of the collected data reveal that the psychological changes of nurses during home isolation reflect a complex, dynamic, and gradually adaptive process that was affected by many factors. Nurses had many negative emotional reactions in the early stages of isolation and positive emotions gradually increased during home isolation. After release from home isolation, they become more confident and calm after. Six categories of coping strategies were identified, including reasoned cognition; autosuggestion; develop healthy protective behaviours; shifting attention; social support; and the power of a role model. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides a better understanding of the psychological changes and the coping strategies used among nurses isolated at home. It is necessary to pay more attention to negative emotions in the early stages of home isolation to help nurses adjust quickly. The coping strategies used by nurses are likely to help those in home isolation reduce negative psychological changes and experience more optimal self-adjustment. IMPACT: This study explored the psychological changes and coping strategies of home isolation among nurses, providing useful advice for psychologists to develop psychological crisis interventions to help individuals reduce negative psychological and have more actively coping strategies when faced sudden stressful infectious diseases.","Zhang, Mao-Mao; Niu, Niu; Zhi, Xiao-Xu; Zhu, Ping; Wu, Bing; Wu, Bai-Nv; Meng, Ai-Feng; Zhao, Yun",J. adv. nurs,260,20

HYPOTHESIS: The consumption of twice a week of sardine, during one year would reduce T2D-developing risk in a population with prediabetes (preDM) and old age. DESIGN: 152 subjects with fasting glucose between 100-124 mg/dL aged &#8805;65 yo were recruited from three primary care centers in Barcelona and were randomly distributed among two interventional groups: control group (CG) and sardine group (SG). Both groups received same T2D-prevention nutritional during a year but only SG had to add 200 g of sardine per week. All variables were collected before to start and at the end of the diet. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03557541). RESULTS: 152 people were randomized into CG (n=77) and SG (n=75) with 18 and 12 drop outs respectively. Subjects in SG, significantly compared to CG, decreased percentage classified-individuals in a very high risk group to develop T2D according to FINDRISC (p=0.035). In addition to increasing HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin and decreasing triglycerides (p<0.05) and blood pressure (<0.05), SG showed a lower HOMA-IR (p=0.032). The consumption of sardine characteristics nutrients as omega-3, EPA and DHA, vitamin D, fluorine and taurine were higher for SG (p<0.05). These results agreed with the increased of taurine, fatty acid (FA) omega-3 and bile acids circulating metabolites (p<0.05). Changes erythrocyte membrane FA were detected only in SG with a decrease of 5 omega-6 FA (p<0.001) and an increase of 3 omega-3 FA types (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: We conclude that a year T2D-prevention diet with sardine supplementation has a greater protective effect against developing T2D and CV events.","Díaz-Rizzolo, D A; Serra, A; Colungo, C; Sala-Vila, A; Sisó-Almirall, A; Gomis, R",Clin Nutr,260,16

For COVID-19, typically, numerous national and global initiatives have been set up from this perspective. Here, we propose to develop a shared vision of the country-level outbreaks during a pandemic, by enhancing, at the international scale, the foundations of the analysis of surveillance data and by adopting a unified and real-time approach to monitor and forecast the outbreak across time and across the world. This proposal, rolled out as a web platform, should contribute to strengthen epidemiological understanding, sanitary democracy as well as global and local responses to pandemics.","Soubeyrand, Samuel; Demongeot, Jacques; Roques, Lionel",One Health,260,16

The smaller ""bluestones"" near the center of the monument have been traced to Wales, but the origins of the sarsen (silcrete) megaliths that form the primary architecture of Stonehenge remain unknown. Here, we use geochemical data to show that 50 of the 52 sarsens at the monument share a consistent chemistry and, by inference, originated from a common source area. We then compare the geochemical signature of a core extracted from Stone 58 at Stonehenge with equivalent data for sarsens from across southern Britain. From this, we identify West Woods, Wiltshire, 25 km north of Stonehenge, as the most probable source area for the majority of sarsens at the monument.","Nash, David J; Ciborowski, T Jake R; Ullyott, J Stewart; Pearson, Mike Parker; Darvill, Timothy; Greaney, Susan; Maniatis, Georgios; Whitaker, Katy A",Sci.

The management of each phase is unique and specific. The pulmonary phase of COVID-19 is characterized by an organizing pneumonia with profound immune dysregulation, activation of clotting, and a severe microvascular injury culminating in severe hypoxemia. The core treatment strategy to manage the pulmonary phase includes the combination of methylprednisolone, ascorbic acid, thiamine, and heparin (MATH+ protocol). The rationale for the MATH+ protocol is reviewed in this paper. AREAS COVERED: We provide an overview on the pathophysiological changes occurring in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure and a treatment strategy to reverse these changes thereby preventing progressive lung injury and death. EXPERT OPINION: While there is no single 'Silver Bullet' to cure COVID-19, we believe that the severely disturbed pathological processes leading to respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 organizing pneumonia will respond to the combination of Methylprednisone, Ascorbic acid, Thiamine, and full anticoagulation with Heparin (MATH+ protocol).We believe that it is no longer ethically acceptable to limit management to 'supportive care' alone, in the face of effective, safe, and inexpensive medications that can effectively treat this disease and thereby reduce the risk of complications and death.","Marik, Paul E; Kory, Pierre; Varon, Joseph; Iglesias, Jose; Meduri, G Umberto",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,260,5

We pass a Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) among 235 people to detect their habits before and after 25 confinement days. The data collection protocol consisted on a Google forms questionnaire included two parts: the first with current data (isolation period) and a second with pre-isolation period data. Differences between the pre-isolation and isolation period were calculated using the related paired T-tests. When statistically significant differences were found, the effect size was estimated using the Cohen's d index (d). The reduction in physical activity levels during confinement were related to the increase in total number of minutes of screen consumption from 433.49 min to 623.97 min per day (d = 0.67; 44.01%). The CISS scores were increased by more than 43% during confinement. The increase in convergence insufficiency was 100% after the studied isolation period of 25 days. The 92.19% increase in television use during 25 days of confinement is not responsible for the increase in convergence insufficiency. However, due to the increase in the use of PCs in this period, there is a notable increase in convergence insufficiency. Therefore, we can conclude that not all increases in tasks with electronic devices are responsible for the increase in convergence insufficiency.","Mon-López, Daniel; Bernardez-Vilaboa, Ricardo; Fernandez-Balbuena, Antonio Alvarez; Sillero-Quintana, Manuel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),260,22

Studies on temporal dynamics of its shedding suggests it peaks 1-2 days prior to any symptom onset. Therefore, a large proportion of patients are actively spreading the disease unknowingly whilst undetected. However, lengthy lockdowns and isolation leads to a host of socioeconomic issues and are impractical. Conversely, there exists no study describing this group and their clinical significance despite their key role in disease transmission. METHODS: As a result, we devised a retrospective study to look at the prevalence of presymptomatic patients with COVID-19 from data sourced via our medical records office. Subsequently, we identify early indicators of infection through demographic information, biochemical and radiological abnormalities which would allow early diagnosis and isolation. In addition, we will look into the clinical significance of this group and their outcome; if it differs from asymptomatic or symptomatic patients. Descriptive statistics were used in addition to tabulating the variables and corresponding values for reference. Variables are compared between the presymptomatic group and others via Chi-square testing and Fisher's exact test, accepting a p value of < 0.05 as significant. RESULTS: Our analysis shows a higher proportion of presymptomatic patients with atypical symptoms like chest pain while symptomatic patients commonly present with respiratory symptoms like cough and shortness of breath. Besides that, there were more females presenting as presymptomatic patients compared to males (p = 0.019) and these group of patients were likely to receive treatment (p < 0.001). Otherwise, we were not able to identify other statistically significant markers suggesting a patient is presymptomatic. CONCLUSION: As we have little means of identifying these silent spreaders, it highlights further the importance of general measures implemented to stop COVID-19 transmission like social distancing, face mask, and widespread testing.","Tan, Juen Kiem; Leong, Dalleen; Munusamy, Hemalatha; Zenol Ariffin, Nor Hazwani; Kori, Najma; Hod, Rozita; Periyasamy, Petrick",BMC Infect Dis,260,16

We exploited proximity-dependent labeling to define the in vivo interactions of cohesin domains with DNA or with other cohesin domains that lie within the same or in different cohesin complexes. Our results suggest both cohesin's head and hinge domains bind to DNA, and cohesin structure is dynamic with differential folding of its coiled coil regions to generate butterfly confirmations. This method also reveals that cohesins form ordered clusters on and off DNA. The levels of cohesin clusters and their distribution on chromosomes are cell cycle-regulated. Cohesin clustering is likely necessary for cohesion maintenance because clustering and maintenance uniquely require the same subset of cohesin domains and the auxiliary cohesin factor Pds5p. These conclusions provide important new mechanistic and biological insights into the architecture of the cohesin complex, cohesin-cohesin interactions, and cohesin's tethering and loop extruding activities.","Xiang, Siheng; Koshland, Douglas",eLife (Cambridge),260,20

Plasma cells are not routinely found in peripheral blood, though may produce virus-neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 later in the course of an infection. METHODS: Using the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Precision Medicine Analytics Platform Registry, we identified hospitalized adult patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and stratified by presence of plasma cells and World Health Organization (WHO) disease severity. To identify plasma cells, we employed a sensitive flow cytometric screening method for highly fluorescent lymphocytes and confirmed these microscopically. Cox regression models were used to evaluate time to death and time to clinical improvement by the presence of plasma cells in patients with severe disease. RESULTS: Of 2301 hospitalized patients with confirmed infection, 371 had plasma cells identified. Patients with plasma cells were more likely to have severe disease, though 86.6% developed plasma cells after onset of severe disease. In patients with severe disease, after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, race, and other covariates associated with disease severity, patients with plasma cells had a reduced hazard of death (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.57; 95% confidence interval: 0.38-0.87; P value: .008). There was no significant association with the presence of plasma cells and time to clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe disease who have detectable plasma cells in the peripheral blood have improved mortality despite adjusting for known covariates associated with disease severity in COVID-19. Further investigation is warranted to understand the role of plasma cells in the immune response to COVID-19.","Boulanger, Mary; Molina, Emily; Wang, Kunbo; Kickler, Thomas; Xu, Yanxun; Garibaldi, Brian T",Am. j. med,260,16

BNT162b2 is approved for the vaccination of adolescents over 16 years of age. Systemic adverse events were scarce though the pretested cohort of this age group was relatively small. The aim of the current study is to raise awareness for potential adverse reactions. METHODS: This is a case series of patients diagnosed with perimyocarditis following vaccination. Patients were compiled from 3 pediatric medical centers in Israel through a network of pediatricians and data regarding those cases was collected. In addition, incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination period was compared with previous years. RESULTS: All patients were males 16-18 years old, of Jewish descent, who presented with chest pain that began 1-3 days following vaccination (mean, 2.1 days). In 6 of the 7 patients, symptoms began following the 2nd dose and in 1 patient following the 1st dose. All cases were mild and none required cardiovascular or respiratory support. The incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination period was elevated in comparison to previous years. CONCLUSIONS: This case series describes a time association between coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine and perimyocarditis in adolescents. All cases were mild, although only long-term follow-up can reveal the true impact of this cardiac injury. While it seems that the incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination campaign period is increased, a more comprehensive data collection on a wider scale should be done. We hope this report will serve as a reminder to report events and allow for analysis of potential adverse reactions.","Snapiri, Ori; Rosenberg Danziger, Chen; Shirman, Nina; Weissbach, Avichai; Lowenthal, Alexander; Ayalon, Itay; Adam, Dganit; Yarden-Bilavsky, Havatzelet; Bilavsky, Efraim",Pediatr. infect. dis. j,260,16

Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported as frequent but their incidence is unknown. The aim of this research was to assess the real incidence of cardiac arrhythmias among COVID-19 patients admitted to Portuguese hospitals and to understand the underlying prognostic implications. METHODS: The Portuguese Association of Arrhythmology, Pacing and Electrophysiology (APAPE) conducted a survey in Portuguese hospitals to assess the occurrence of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients, their clinical characteristics, the use of experimental therapies and the impact on QT interval. RESULTS: Twenty hospitals participated, reporting 692 hospitalized patients. An arrhythmic episode occurred in 81 (11.7%) and 64 (79%) had detailed information on these episodes. New onset arrhythmias occurred in 41 (64%) patients, 45 (70.3%) male, median age 73.5 (61-80.3) years. There were 51 (79.7%) with associated comorbidities, mainly arterial hypertension (41, 64.1%). Of 53 patients (82.3%) on experimental therapy, 7 (10.9%) had an increased QTc interval. Regarding arrhythmias, two patients (3.1%) had ventricular tachycardia, 5 (7.8%) sinus bradycardia, 17 (26.6%) paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 40 (62.5%) atrial fibrillation or flutter. At the time of reporting, there had been no deaths due to arrhythmic syndrome or related complications. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of COVID-19 patients. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is high but not associated with increased cardiac mortality although it does though occur frequently in extremely ill patients and with multiple organ failure. Regardless of the use of experimental drugs, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is low and atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias are the most prevalent arrythmias.","Mesquita, Dinis; Carmo, Pedro; Cabanelas, Nuno; Santos, Nuno; Martins, Vítor; Sanfins, Victor; Costa, Helena Cristina; Fontes, José Paulo; Fonseca, Paulo; Parreira, Leonor","Rev. port. cardiol.

Thus, the construction sector has been highly disrupted by the current pandemic. The construction sector represents a key component of countries' economies-it is approximately 13% of global GDP-as such, having the availability to perform construction activities with a minimum spread of COVID-19 may help to the financial response to the pandemic. Given this context, this study aims to understand the potential impact of COVID-19 on construction workers using an agent-based modeling approach. Activities are classified as being of low-medium-high risk for workers, and the spread of COVID-19 is simulated among construction workers in a project. This study found that the workforce from a construction project may be reduced by 30% to 90% due to the spread of COVID-19. Understanding how COVID-19 may spread among construction workers may assist construction project managers in creating adequate conditions for workers to perform their job, minimizing the chances of getting infected with COVID-19.","Araya, Felipe",Saf Sci,260,21

Thymosin &#945;1 was administrated with 1.6 mg qd or q12 h for >5 days. The primary outcomes were the 28-day and 60-day mortality, the secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and the total duration of the disease. Subgroup analysis was carried out according to clinical classification. RESULTS: Of the 334 enrolled COVID-19 patients, 42 (12.6%) died within 28 days, and 55 (16.5%) died within 60 days of hospitalization. There was a significant difference in the 28-day mortality between the thymosin &#945;1 and non-thymosin &#945;1-treated groups in adjusted model (P = 0.016), without obvious differences in the 60-day mortality and survival time in the overall cohort (P > 0.05).

AIMS: The aims of the current study were to assess the prevalence of loneliness among young people at the time of COVID-19 and to identify whether selected variables related to the pandemic predicted the level of loneliness. METHOD: A cross-sectional study using WhatsApp and Facebook social media platforms was conducted to survey 1,057 young people aged 15 to 24 years from six Middle Eastern countries. Participants completed survey items including demographic and COVID-19-related questions; the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS); the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS); and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. RESULTS: The prevalence of experienced loneliness was 1 (0.1%), 625 (59.1%), 429 (40.6%), and 2 (0.2%), reflecting low, moderate, moderately high, and high experiences for loneliness, respectively. History of depression or anxiety, being dissatisfied with life, and having depression at the time of COVID-19 were significant predictors of loneliness among youth. The model was significant (F = 44.95, p < .05) and accounted for 29.8% of the variance in UCLA Loneliness Scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the high prevalence rate of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic was correlated with depression and impaired life satisfaction among Middle Eastern youth. Thus, special attention and interventional action plans need to be developed taking into consideration the youths' special situation during COVID-19.","Al Omari, Omar; Al Sabei, Sulaiman; Al Rawajfah, Omar; Abu Sharour, Loai; Al-Hashmi, Iman; Al Qadire, Mohammad; Khalaf, Atika",J Am Psychiatr Nurses Assoc,260,1

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed preferred teaching/learning strategies for graduate students enrolled in at least 1 asynchronous nursing course. Correlational data assessed the relationship between preferred teaching/learning strategies and selected demographic information. METHODS: All graduate nursing students enrolled in at least 1 asynchronous course at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing during a 3-month period were invited to participate in a survey to assess preferred teaching/learning methods. RESULTS: Sixty-six graduate students completed the survey. Most participants were comfortable with computer skills, had previously enrolled in a web-enhanced course, and did not enjoy group work. Preferred teaching/learning strategies included voice-over PowerPoints, simulation, case studies, guest speakers, and faculty communication.

Effective vaccines are one of the most important strategies to limit the pandemic. Here, we report a construction strategy of DNA vaccine candidates expressing full length wild type SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, S1 or S2 region and their immunogenicity in mice. All DNA vaccine constructs of pCMVkan-S, -S1 and -S2 induced high levels of specific binding IgG that showed a balance of IgG1/IgG2a response. However, only the sera from mice vaccinated with pCMKkan-S or -S1 DNA vaccines could inhibit viral RBD and ACE2 interaction. The highest neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer was found in pCMVkan-S group, followed by -S1, while -S2 showed the lowest PRNT50 titers. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) were 2,551, 1,005 and 291 for pCMVkan-S, -S1 and -S2, respectively. pCMVkan-S construct vaccine also induced the highest magnitude and breadth of T cells response. Analysis of IFN-Î³ positive cells after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide pools were 2,991, 1,376 and 1,885 SFC/106 splenocytes for pCMVkan-S, -S1 and -S2, respectively. Our findings highlighted that full-length S antigen is more potent than the truncated spike (S1 or S2) in inducing of neutralizing antibody and robust T cell responses.","Prompetchara, Eakachai; Ketloy, Chutitorn; Tharakhet, Kittipan; Kaewpang, Papatsara; Buranapraditkun, Supranee; Techawiwattanaboon, Teerasit; Sathean-Anan-Kun, Suwitra; Pitakpolrat, Patrawadee; Watcharaplueksadee, Supaporn; Phumiamorn, Supaporn; Wijagkanalan, Wassana; Patarakul, Kanitha; Palaga, Tanapat; Ruxrungtham, Kiat",PLoS One,260,21

METHODS: We searched for and included published articles, preprint manuscripts and reports that estimated numbers of cumulative or daily deaths or cases of COVID-19 in Iran. We found 131 studies and included 29 of them. RESULTS: The included studies provided outputs for a total of 84 study-model/scenario combinations. Sixteen studies used 3-4 compartmental disease models. At the end of month two of the epidemic (2020-04-19), the lowest (and highest) values of predictions were 1,777 (388,951) for cumulative deaths, 20,588 (2,310,161) for cumulative cases, and at the end of month four (2020-06-20), were 3,590 (1,819,392) for cumulative deaths, and 144,305 (4,266,964) for cumulative cases. Highest estimates of cumulative deaths (and cases) for latest date available in 2020 were 418,834 on 2020-12-19 (and 41,475,792 on 2020-12-31). Model estimates predict an ominous course of epidemic progress in Iran. Increase in percent population using masks from the current situation to 95% might prevent 26,790 additional deaths (95% confidence interval 19,925-35,208) by the end of year 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Meticulousness and degree of details reported for disease modeling and statistical methods used in the included studies varied widely. Greater heterogeneity was observed regarding the results of predicted outcomes. Consideration of minimum and preferred reporting items in epidemic estimation studies might better inform future revisions of the available models and new models to be developed. Not accounting for under-reporting drives the models' results misleading.","Pourmalek, Farshad; Rezaei Hemami, Mohsen; Janani, Leila; Moradi-Lakeh, Maziar",BMC Public Health,260,23

In individuals with high-level SCI, abnormal sympathovagal balance (such as during autonomic dysreflexia; paroxysmal hypertension provoked by sensory stimuli below the injury) is proarrhythmogenic. Exercise training is a key component of SCI rehabilitation and management of cardiovascular disease risk, but it is unclear whether exercise training influences susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia. We aimed to evaluate: (i) whether susceptibility to arrhythmia increases in a rodent-model of SCI; (ii) the impact of the sympathomimetic drug dobutamine (DOB) on arrhythmia risk; (iii) whether exercise training ameliorates arrhythmia risk. Twenty-one Wistar rats were divided into 3 subgroups: T2-contusive SCI (T2, nâ¯=â¯7), T2-contusive SCI completing passive hindlimb cycling training (PHLC, nâ¯=â¯7), and T10-contusive SCI (T10, nâ¯=â¯7). Known electrocardiographic arrhythmia markers and heart rate variability parameters were evaluated before (PRE), 1-week (POST) and 5-weeks post-SCI (TERM) at baseline and during DOB infusion (30â¯µg/kg/min). Baseline markers of arrhythmia risk were increased in both T2 and T10 animals. DOB decreased R-R interval (pâ¯<â¯0.001), and increased markers of risk for ventricular arrhythmia, particularly in high-level (T2) animals (pâ¯<â¯0.05). Exercise training blunted the exacerbation of markers of arrhythmia risk in the presence of DOB. Markers of risk for cardiac arrhythmia are increased in experimental SCI, and DOB further increases arrhythmia risk in high-level SCI. Exercise training did not improve markers of arrhythmia risk at rest, but did ameliorate markers of arrhythmia risk during sympathetic stimulation.","Lucci, Vera-Ellen M; Harrison, Emma L; DeVeau, Kathryn M; Harman, Kathryn A; Squair, Jordan W; Krassioukov, Andrei; Magnuson, David S K; West, Christopher R; Claydon, Victoria E",Auton Neurosci,260,15

METHODS: The male Swiss mice received 15 days of treatment with the extract (500 mg kg-1, via gavage) and intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (75 mg kg-1) or saline (0.9%) on the 15th day. After 24 h the last treatment, the animals were anesthetized for blood withdrawal, sacrificed and removal of the organs for analyses (liver, kidney and heart). In the biochemical tests were determined: hematological parameters in blood, aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, glucose and total cholesterol dosages in plasma, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and lipid damage marker were evaluated in different tissues, besides genotoxic and histopathological analyzes. RESULTS: In the extract of Carica papaya leaves, the flavonoids quercetin-3ß-D-glucoside and rutin were identified, besides present positive results for alkaloids, saponins and tannins. This extract increased the activity of glutathione-S-transferase and catalase enzymes in the liver and reduced the levels of reduced glutathione in the kidneys and hematocrit levels, red cell count, and hemoglobin. It promoted the decrease of the reactive species of thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) in the kidneys and the activity of enzyme aspartate aminotransferase in the plasma and was antimutagenic in the micronucleus test.

The spreading of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could be associated with psychiatric implications. We investigated the psychopathological impact of COVID-19 in survivors, also considering the effect of clinical and inflammatory predictors. We screened for psychiatric symptoms 402 adults surviving COVID-19 (265 male, mean age 58), at one month follow-up after hospital treatment. A clinical interview and a battery of self-report questionnaires were used to investigate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptomatology. We collected sociodemographic information, clinical data, baseline inflammatory markers and follow-up oxygen saturation levels. A significant proportion of patients self-rated in the psychopathological range: 28% for PTSD, 31% for depression, 42% for anxiety, 20% for OC symptoms, and 40% for insomnia. Overall, 56% scored in the pathological range in at least one clinical dimension. Despite significantly lower levels of baseline inflammatory markers, females suffered more for both anxiety and depression. Patients with a positive previous psychiatric diagnosis showed increased scores on most psychopathological measures, with similar baseline inflammation. Baseline systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), which reflects the immune response and systemic inflammation based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, positively associated with scores of depression and anxiety at follow-up. PTSD, major depression, and anxiety, are all high-burden non-communicable conditions associated with years of life lived with disability. Considering the alarming impact of COVID-19 infection on mental health, the current insights on inflammation in psychiatry, and the present observation of worse inflammation leading to worse depression, we recommend to assess psychopathology of COVID-19 survivors and to deepen research on inflammatory biomarkers, in order to diagnose and treat emergent psychiatric conditions.","Mazza, Mario Gennaro; De Lorenzo, Rebecca; Conte, Caterina; Poletti, Sara; Vai, Benedetta; Bollettini, Irene; Melloni, Elisa Maria Teresa; Furlan, Roberto; Ciceri, Fabio; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Benedetti, Francesco",Brain Behav Immun,260,3

METHODS: We used King County, WA STI surveillance and sexual health clinic (SHC) data from 1/1/2019-7/31/2020. We calculated mean weekly case counts for gonorrhea, primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, male urethral gonorrhea, and early latent (EL) syphilis for three time periods in 2020: pre-SHSH (1/1-3/23), SHSH (3/24-6/5), and reopening (6/6-7/31). P&S syphilis and male urethral gonorrhea were used as proxies for sexual behavior and EL syphilis was used as a proxy for STI screening. We compared SHC visits (2019 vs. 2020) and SHC gonorrhea treatment practices (across 2020 time periods). RESULTS: Compared to January-July 2019, from January-July 2020, reported cases of gonorrhea, male urethral gonorrhea, P&S syphilis, and EL syphilis decreased by 9%, 5%, 16%, and 22%, respectively. Mean weekly case counts of gonorrhea, male urethral gonorrhea, and EL syphilis decreased pre-SHSH to SHSH, but all returned to pre-SHSH levels during reopening. SHC visits during SHSH were 55% lower in 2020 than 2019. In the SHC during SHSH, ceftriaxone treatment for gonorrhea decreased whereas cefixime/cefpodoxime treatment and gonorrhea treatment with no testing increased. CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in reported STIs concurrent with COVID-19 SHSH may reflect a true decline in STI transmission. However, the larger decreases in asymptomatic infections indicates much of the observed decrease was likely due to decreased screening.","Berzkalns, Anna; Thibault, Christina S; Barbee, Lindley A; Golden, Matthew R; Khosropour, Christine; Kerani, Roxanne P",Sex. transm. dis,260,14

The present study investigates asthma control and children and mothers' psychological functioning (i.e.: psychological well-being, fear of contagion, and mothers' Covid-19 related fears) in 45 asthmatic children aged 7-to-14, compared to a control sample. The subjects were administered an online survey after the lockdown (from 28th May to 23rd August 2020). The analysis shows that asthmatic children presented higher concern in relation to contagion, however, no difference in psychological functioning was displayed between the two cohorts. Mothers reported more Covid-19 related fears, and greater worries according to the resumption of their children's activities. Moreover, they indicated a global worsening of their psychological well-being during the lockdown. Furthermore, regarding the clinical sample, the multivariate regression model showed that a worsening of mothers' psychological and children's physical well-being was associated with a worsening of children's psychological well-being during the lockdown. The results of this study indicate that mothers of asthmatic children can be more prone to experience psychological fatigue in a pandemic scenario.

Social media platforms such as Twitter contain vast amount of information about the general public's needs. However, the sparsity of the information as well as the amount of noisy content present a challenge to practitioners to effectively identify shared information on these platforms. In this study, we propose two novel methods for two distinct but related needs detection tasks: the identification of 1) a list of resources needed ranked by priority, and 2) sentences that specify who-needs-what resources. We evaluated our methods on a set of tweets about the COVID-19 crisis. For task 1 (detecting top needs), we compared our results against two given lists of resources and achieved 64% precision. For task 2 (detecting who-needs-what), we compared our results on a set of 1,000 annotated tweets and achieved a 68% F1-score.","Sarol, M.

Deep learning-based rPPG have demonstrated superior performance over the traditional approaches in controlled context. However, the lighting situation in indoor space is typically complex, with uneven light distribution and frequent variations in illumination. It lacks a fair comparison of different methods under different illuminations using the same dataset. In this paper, we present a public dataset, namely the BH-rPPG dataset, which contains data from twelve subjects under three illuminations: low, medium, and high illumination. We also provide the ground truth heart rate measured by an oximeter. We evaluate the performance of three deep learning-based methods to that of four traditional methods using two public datasets: the UBFC-rPPG dataset and the BH-rPPG dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that traditional methods are generally more resistant to fluctuating illuminations. We found that the rPPGNet achieves lowest MAE among deep learning-based method under medium illumination, whereas the CHROM achieves 1.5 beats per minute (BPM), outperforming the rPPGNet by 60%. These findings suggest that while developing deep learning-based heart rate estimation algorithms, illumination variation should be taken into account. This work serves as a benchmark for rPPG performance evaluation and it opens a pathway for future investigation into deep learning-based rPPG under illumination variations.","Yang, Ze; Wang, Haofei; Lu, Feng",,260,16

Resolving cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with aging in higher mammals is therefore urgently needed. Here, we created young and old non-human primate single-nucleus/cell transcriptomic atlases of lung, heart and artery, the top tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of cell type-specific aging-associated transcriptional changes revealed increased systemic inflammation and compromised virus defense as a hallmark of cardiopulmonary aging. With age, expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was increased in the pulmonary alveolar epithelial barrier, cardiomyocytes, and vascular endothelial cells. We found that interleukin 7 (IL7) accumulated in aged cardiopulmonary tissues and induced ACE2 expression in human vascular endothelial cells in an NF-&#954;B-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment with vitamin C blocked IL7-induced ACE2 expression. Altogether, our findings depict the first transcriptomic atlas of the aged primate cardiopulmonary system and provide vital insights into age-linked susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that geroprotective strategies may reduce COVID-19 severity in the elderly.","Ma, Shuai; Sun, Shuhui; Li, Jiaming; Fan, Yanling; Qu, Jing; Sun, Liang; Wang, Si; Zhang, Yiyuan; Yang, Shanshan; Liu, Zunpeng; Wu, Zeming; Zhang, Sheng; Wang, Qiaoran; Zheng, Aihua; Duo, Shuguang; Yu, Yang; Belmonte, Juan Carlos Izpisua; Chan, Piu; Zhou, Qi; Song, Moshi; Zhang, Weiqi; Liu, Guang-Hui",Cell res,260,20

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have extended their major role in tracking disease patterns, and in identifying possible treatments. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify potential COVID-19 protease inhibitors through shape-based Machine Learning assisted by Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics simulations. METHODS: 31 Repurposed compounds have been selected targeting the main coronavirus protease (6LU7) and a machine learning approach was employed to generate shape-based molecules starting from the 3D shape to the pharmacophoric features of their seed compound. Ligand-Receptor Docking was performed with Optimized Potential for Liquid Simulations (OPLS) algorithms to identify highaffinity compounds from the list of selected candidates for 6LU7, which were subjected to Molecular Dynamic Simulations followed by ADMET studies and other analyses. RESULTS: Shape-based Machine learning reported remdesivir, valrubicin, aprepitant, and fulvestrant as the best therapeutic agents with the highest affinity for the target protein. Among the best shape-based compounds, a novel compound identified was not indexed in any chemical databases (PubChem, Zinc, or ChEMBL). Hence, the novel compound was named 'nCorv-EMBS'. Further, toxicity analysis showed nCorv-EMBS to be suitable for further consideration as the main protease inhibitor in COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Effective ACE-II, GAK, AAK1, and protease 3C blockers can serve as a novel therapeutic approach to block the binding and attachment of the main COVID-19 protease (PDB ID: 6LU7) to the host cell and thus inhibit the infection at AT2 receptors in the lung. The novel compound nCorv- EMBS herein proposed stands as a promising inhibitor to be evaluated further for COVID-19 treatment.","Nayarisseri, Anuraj; Khandelwal, Ravina; Madhavi, Maddala; Selvaraj, Chandrabose; Panwar, Umesh; Sharma, Khushboo; Hussain, Tajamul; Singh, Sanjeev Kumar",Curr Top Med Chem,260,20

The 'right' to healthcare during armed conflict and its lack of enforcement despite a range of United Nations mandated requirements regarding health and healthcare provisions is likely to be a significant feature in future conflicts, as zoonotic-induced pandemics become a more common global public health challenge. The issue of enforcement of health rights assurance and its implications for the public health management of global pandemics such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in and between countries and regions in conflict is the objective of this Review. STUDY DESIGN: A narrative review was conducted. METHODS: Referenced to the framework of International humanitarian law (IHL) and International human rights law (IHRL) to explore and discuss the deficits in health rights assurances in conflict settings and illustrate how gaps in protection and lack of enforcement compounds the disease response. Both IHL, and IHRL can be leveraged to ensure human and health rights are assured in conflict settings. There is a distinct lack of international criteria with regard to standards of healthcare coverage, infrastructure and service preservation to the civilian population during times of armed conflict. This has far reaching consequences when confounded by a pandemic or even localised disease outbreak. RESULTS: We illustrate how in a pandemic disease emergency, such as COVID-19, all life is threatened; and how leaving the citizen population exposed to this contagion is a human rights breach and an indirect method of warfare. The consequences of failure to effectively address such pandemic infections, (i.e. COVID-19), in a conflict setting are potentially catastrophic as prevention and containment responses are severely constrained by state insecurity, political instability, terrorism, repression, rights abuses, and displacement of citizens. Neglect by State actors potentially constitutes a breach of the universal right to life. States cannot justify their failures to mitigate disease based on claims of lack of resources, even when available resources are minimal. Where discrimination of people with a disease, such as COVID-19, or minority groups at the point of access to health facilities occurs, this further breaches the principle of medical neutrality. CONCLUSIONS: The example of the COVID-19 response may offer a viable route to leverage greater access and coverage of healthcare in conflict and humanitarian settings. A radicalised partnership approach during these times of emergency is warranted, based on an ethical 'humanitarian intervention' approach to provide care to all affected by contagious disease in conflict settings.","Van Hout, M C; Wells, J S G",Public Health,260,16

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to shed light on relations between caregiver mental reaction to the pandemic and caregiver distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms, memory impairment progression, and functional impairment of people with neurocognitive disorder during the period of confinement in Greece. METHODS: The study included caregivers of patients with mild (Nâ=â13) and major (Nâ=â54) neurocognitive disorder. The caregiver-based telephone interview was based on items of the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire, the AD8 Dementia Screening Instrument, and the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale. Regarding the mental impact of the COVID-19 crisis on caregivers, four single questions referring to their worries in the last seven days were posed, in addition to the scales Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R). A stepwise linear regression model was employed for studying the relationship between caregiver distress and demographic and clinical data and caregiver mental reaction to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. RESULTS: Caregiver distress severity during the confinement period was influenced not only by memory deficits (pâ=â0.009) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (pâ< â0.001) of patients, but also by caregiver hyperarousal (pâ=â0.003) and avoidance symptoms (pâ=â0.033) and worries directly linked to the COVID-19 crisis (pâ=â0.022). CONCLUSION: These observations provide further evidence for the urgent need for support of caregivers of patients with neurocognitive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alexopoulos, Panagiotis; Soldatos, Rigas; Kontogianni, Evagellia; Frouda, Maria; Loanna Aligianni, Souzana; Skondra, Maria; Passa, Maria; Konstantopoulou, Georgia; Stamouli, Evangelia; Katirtzoglou, Evgenia; Politis, Anastasios; Economou, Polychronis; Alexaki, Maria; Siarkos, Kostas; Politis, Antonios",J. alzheimers dis,260,1

Two experimental conditions are described with the aim of finding whether the ""attractiveness effect"" results from attention to internal or external facial features, or both. Pairs of attractive and less attractive faces (as judged by adults) were shown to newborn infants (mean age 2 days, 9 hours), where each pair had either identical internal features (and different external features) or identical external features (and different internal features). In the latter, but not the former, condition the infants looked longer at the attractive faces. These findings are clear evidence that newborn infants use information about internal facial features in making preferences based on attractiveness.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nine hospitals caring for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: 134 Chinese healthcare professionals (74 doctors and 60 nurses) who were deployed to Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 epidemic were included. A two-round Delphi process was initiated between March and May 2020. In the first round, the participants identified knowledge, technical and behavioural (ie, non-technical) skills that are needed to treat patients, prevent spread of the virus and protect healthcare workers. In round 2, the participants rated each item according to its importance to be included in a training curriculum on COVID-19. Consensus for inclusion in the final list was set at 80%. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge, technical and behavioural (ie, non-technical) skills that could form the basis of a training curriculum for COVID-19 management. RESULTS: In the first round 1398 items were suggested by the doctors and reduced to 67 items after content analysis (treatment of patients: n=47; infection prevention and control: n=20). The nurses suggested 1193 items that were reduced to 70 items (treatment of patients: n=49; infection prevention and control: n=21). In round 2, the response rates were 82% in doctors and 93% in nurses. Fifty-eight items of knowledge, technical and behavioural skills were agreed on by the doctors to include in the final list.

One strategy to avoid the virus infection is to design peptides by extracting the human ACE2 peptidase domain &#945;1-helix, which would bind to the coronavirus surface protein, preventing the virus entry into the host cells. The natural &#945;1-helix peptide has a stronger affinity to SARS-CoV-2 than to SARS-CoV-1. Another peptide was designed by joining &#945;1 with the second portion of ACE2 that is far in the peptidase sequence yet grafted in the spike protein interface with ACE2. Previous studies have shown that, among several &#945;1-based peptides, the hybrid peptidic scaffold is the one with the highest/strongest affinity for SARS-CoV-1, which is comparable to the full-length ACE2 affinity. In this work, binding and folding dynamics of the natural and designed ACE2-based peptides were simulated by the well-known coarse-grained structure-based model, with the computed thermodynamic quantities correlating with the experimental binding affinity data. Furthermore, theoretical kinetic analysis of native contact formation revealed the distinction between these processes in the presence of the different binding partners SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike domains. Additionally, our results indicate the existence of a two-state folding mechanism for the designed peptide en route to bind to the spike proteins, in contrast to a downhill mechanism for the natural &#945;1-helix peptides. The presented low-cost simulation protocol demonstrated its efficiency in evaluating binding affinities and identifying the mechanisms involved in the neutralization of spike-ACE2 interaction by designed peptides. Finally, the protocol can be used as a computer-based screening of more potent designed peptides by experimentalists searching for new therapeutics against COVID-19.","Freitas, Frederico Campos; Ferreira, Paulo Henrique Borges; Favaro, Denize Cristina; Oliveira, Ronaldo Junio de",J Chem Inf Model,260,14

Among these are nineteen antibodies that potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, nine of which exhibited very high potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng ml-1. Epitope mapping showed that this collection of nineteen antibodies was about equally divided between those directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that overlap with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody that targets the RBD, a second that targets the NTD, and a third that bridges two separate RBDs showed that the antibodies recognize the closed, 'all RBD-down' conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","Liu, Lihong; Wang, Pengfei; Nair, Manoj S; Yu, Jian; Rapp, Micah; Wang, Qian; Luo, Yang; Chan, Jasper F-W; Sahi, Vincent; Figueroa, Amir; Guo, Xinzheng V; Cerutti, Gabriele; Bimela, Jude; Gorman, Jason; Zhou, Tongqing; Chen, Zhiwei; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Kwong, Peter D; Sodroski, Joseph G; Yin, Michael T; Sheng, Zizhang; Huang, Yaoxing; Shapiro, Lawrence; Ho, David D",Nature,260,24

Various research revealed that COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are responsible for viral replication and entry into the human body, respectively. Blocking the activity of these enzymes gives a potential therapeutic target for the COVID-19. The objective of the study was to explore phytochemicals from Ageratina adenophora against SARS-CoV-2 through in-silico studies. In this study, 34 phytochemicals of A. adenophora were docked with Mpro and ACE2 through AutoDock Tools-1.5.6 and their binding affinity was studied. Phytochemicals with higher affinity have been chosen for further molecular dynamics simulations to determine the stability with target protein. Molecular dynamics simulations were studied on GROMACS 5.1.4 version. Furthermore, 5-ß-glucosyl-7-demethoxy-encecalin (5GDE) and 2-oxocadinan-3,6(11)-dien-12,7-olide (BODO) were found to be potential blockers with excellent binding affinity with Mpro and ACE2 than their native inhibitors remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine respectively. The drug likeness study and pharmacokinetics of the phytoconstituents present in A. adenophora provide an excellent support for the lead drug discovery against COVID-19.","Neupane, Netra Prasad; Karn, Abhishek Kumar; Mukeri, Imdad Husen; Pathak, Prateek; Sharma, Praveen Kumar; Singh, Samayaditya; Qureshi, Insaf Ahmed; Jha, Tarun; Verma, Amita",Biocatal Agric Biotechnol,260,16

Therefore, knowing the frequency and characteristics of these manifestations of COVID-19 is important for both clinicians and health policy makers. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data on the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of patients with COVID-19 was performed. PubMed and Scopus databases and Google Scholar search engine were searched for published and unpublished preprint articles up to 10 April 2020. Original studies providing information on clinical digestive symptoms or biomarkers of liver function in patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. After quality appraisal, data were extracted. Prevalence data from individual studies were pooled using a random-effects model. Overall, 67 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis, comprising a pooled population of 13 251 patients with confirmed COVID-19. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms were anorexia (10.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.2%-16.4%), diarrhea (8.4%, 95% CI = 6.2%-11.2%), and nausea (5.7%, 95% CI = 3.7%-8.6%), respectively. Decreased albumin levels (39.8%, 95% CI = 15.3%-70.8%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (22.8%, 95% CI = 18.1%-28.4%), and alanine aminotransferase (20.6%, 95% CI = 16.7%-25.1%) were common hepatic findings. After adjusting for preexisting gastrointestinal (5.9%) and liver diseases (4.2%), the most common gastrointestinal findings were diarrhea (8.7%, 95% CI = 5.4%-13.9%), anorexia (8.0%, 95% CI = 3.0%-19.8%), and nausea (5.1%, 95% CI = 2.2%-14.3%).

Although most patients present with mild fever, cough with varying pulmonary shadows, a significant portion still develops severe respiratory dysfunction. And these severe cases are often associated with manifestations outside the respiratory tract. Currently, it is not difficult to find inflammatory cytokines upregulated in the blood of infected patients. However, some complications in addition to respiratory system with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are impossible to explain or cannot be attributed to virus itself. Thus excessive cytokines and their potentially fatal adverse effects are probably the answer to the multiple organ dysfunctions and growing mortality.

The public's fears of COVID-19 cases have led to a negative stigma. As part of health workers in disaster management's main pillars in health services, nurses are most vulnerable to infection and not free from the stigma. Objective: This study aimed to describe the social stigma against nurses taking care of patients with COVID-19 and experiencing suspected or probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases in Indonesia. Methods: This study was a mixed-method study using a sequential explanatory design-participant selection model. The selection of respondents used the convenience sampling technique. The number of respondents in the quantitative stage was 118 respondents. For qualitative data, selected participants were respondents with a stigma score of more than 21 nurses and willing to continue the interview process. There were 11 participants in the qualitative stage. This study used the modified Stigma Scale of the Explanatory Model Interview Catalog for quantitative data and four semi-structured questions to obtain qualitative data. Quantitative data were processed in descriptive statistics, and a thematic analysis was performed to analyze the qualitative data. Results: The highest stigma score of 118 respondents was 37, and the lowest score was zero. The stigma score had a mean of 12.28 (SD +/- 7.9). The higher the score obtained leads to a higher level of stigma received. From a total of 11 participants interviewed, four main themes emerged: rejection, feeling down and afraid, sources of support, and professional vigilance. Conclusion: The social stigma experienced by nurses comes from colleagues and society and impacts psychological distress. Support from families and colleagues strengthens nurses in facing social stigma. Nevertheless, nurses uphold the values to remain grateful and carry out professional responsibilities in taking care of patients. Nurses should be provided with psychological support and be prepared for disasters to provide excellent health services and reduce adverse mental health.","Manik, M.

Em relação aos critérios de seleção adotados, observou-se que criadores do grupo RMN utilizam critérios de seleção relacionados ao padrão racial, como a cor da pelagem. Em contraste, os criadores do grupo MMN utilizam critérios relacionados à produtividade na seleção dos animais, como a conformação corporal e a produção de leite. O sistema extensivo caracterizou-se como o mais usual nos dois grupos de criadores avaliados. A base da alimentação dos animais constituía-se de recursos da Caatinga e suplementação (milho e silagem de sorgo) nas épocas de baixa disponibilidade de alimento. O sistema de manejo diversificado (animais+cultivo) é o mais utilizado pelos criadores. Em geral, tanto os criadores de animais puros como criadores de animais mestiços da raça Morada Nova adotam medidas de manejo muitos semelhantes.

COVID-19 outbreak is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, declared by WHO, that killed more than 2 million people worldwide. Since there are no specific drugs available and vaccination campaigns are in the initial phase, or even have not begun in some countries, the main way to fight the outbreak worldwide is still based on non-pharmacological strategies, such as the use of protective equipment, social isolation and mass testing. Modeling of the disease epidemics have gained pivotal importance to guide health authorities on the decision making and applying of those strategies. Here, we present the use of the Weibull distribution to model predictions of the COVID-19 outbreak based on daily new cases and deaths data, by non-linear regression using Metropolis-Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. It was possible to predict the evolution of daily new cases and deaths of COVID-19 in many countries as well as the overall number of cases and deaths in the future. Modeling predictions of COVID-19 pandemic may be of importance on the evaluation of governments and health authorities mitigation procedures, since it allows one to extract parameters that may help to guide those decisions and measures, slowing down the spread of the disease. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Though early efforts are underway to sustain these changes during and in the wake of the pandemic, there are important areas in which federal and institutional policy are still lacking. Additional steps are needed to successfully implement and sustain telemental health for college students include ensuring student access to technology and Internet; proactive outreach to optimize the student's home environment, addressing concerns about safety and confidentiality; developing the means to track rapidly shifting telemental health policy changes; and developing centralized resources that enable remote providers to become familiar with involuntary commitment laws and emergency protocols.","Huilgol, Yash S; Torous, John; Gold, Jessica A; Goldman, Matthew L",J Am Coll Health,260,16

Elucidating the mechanistic details of this pathway could unlock a large store of information useful to the design of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Proteomic approaches to the questions at hand have generally utilized mass spectrometry (MS), which has been successful in identifying both ubiquitylation substrates and profiling pan-cellular chain linkages, but is generally unable to connect the two. Interacting partners of the deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) have also been reported by MS, although substrates of catalytically competent DUBs generally cannot be. Where they have been used towards the study of ubiquitylation, protein microarrays have usually functioned as platforms for the identification of substrates for specific E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here, we report on the first use of protein microarrays to identify substrates of DUBs, and in so doing demonstrate the first example of microarray proteomics involving multiple (i.e., distinct, sequential and opposing) enzymatic activities. This technique demonstrates the selectivity of DUBs for both substrate and type (mono- versus poly-) of ubiquitylation. This work shows that the vast majority of DUBs are monoubiquitylated in vitro, and are incapable of removing this modification from themselves. This work also underscores the critical role of utilizing both ubiquitin chains and substrates when attempting to characterize DUBs.

High‐capacity screening methods are in place for ligand capture and interaction screening, but a detailed dynamic characterization of molecular interactions under physiological conditions in efficiently separated mixtures with minimal sample consumption is presently provided only by electrophoretic interaction analysis in capillaries, affinity CE (ACE). This has been realized in different fields of biology and analytical chemistry, and the resulting advances and uses of ACE during the last 2.5 years are covered in this review. Dealing with anything from small divalent metal ions to large supramolecular assemblies, the applications of ACE span from low‐affinity binding of broad specificity being exploited in optimizing selectivity, e.g., in enantiomer analysis to miniaturized affinity technologies, e.g., for fast processing immunoassay. Also, approaches that provide detailed quantitative characterization of analyte–ligand interaction for drug, immunoassay, and aptamer development are increasingly important, but various approaches to ACE are more and more generally applied in biological research. In addition, the present overview emphasizes that distinct challenges regarding sensitivity, parallel processing, information‐rich detection, interfacing with MS, analyte recovery, and preparative capabilities remain. This will be addressed by future technological improvements that will ensure continuing new applications of ACE in the years to come.","Schou, Christian; Heegaard, Niels H. H.",Electrophoresis,260,2

Needed also are more public health professionals skilled in non-communicable disease surveillance and interventions. As a result, we surveyed all 57 field epidemiology training programmes (FETPs) that are members of the Training Program in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network (TEPHINET), to evaluate the progress of the FETPs, the only global applied epidemiology network, toward increasing public health capacity globally. METHODS: Data on the FETP programmes and the training they provide were abstracted from TEPHINET membership surveys and verified with FETP directors for all FETPs that were members of TEPHINET in 2012. Data on abstracts submitted to the recent TEPHINET Global Scientific Conference, on recent accomplishments by each FETP, and on quality improvement were also compiled to provide a worldwide view of the public health human resource capacity produced by these programmes. RESULTS: A total of 6980 public health professionals worldwide have graduated from an FETP or from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Epidemiology Intelligence Service (EIS). FETP residents and graduates participate in key public health prevention, control, and response activities. Each FETP has adapted its curriculum and objectives over time to align with its country’s public health priorities. FETPs are well integrated into their national public health infrastructures, and they have many partners at the national, regional and global levels. CONCLUSION: FETPs are a competent and diverse source of highly skilled public health professionals who contribute significantly to public health’s global human resource needs. This finding is evidenced by 1) the training curricula that were adapted over time to meet public health’s human resource needs, 2) the FETPs’ continued support from internal and external partners, 3) the increasing number of FETP residents and graduates and their increasing contribution to effective public health work, and 4) the increased quality improvement initiatives facilitated through the FETPs membership in one global network, TEPHINET.","Subramanian, Renee E; Herrera, Dionisio G; Kelly, Paul M",Hum Resour Health,260,16

METHODS: To address this need, age, clinical symptoms and comorbidities were used to develop a COVID-19 scoring system (CSS) for early prediction of mortality in severe COVID-19 patients. The CSS was developed with scores ranging from 0 to 9. A higher score indicates higher risk with good discrimination quality presented by Mann Whitney U test and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). RESULTS: Patient age of ≥60 y, cough, breathlessness, diabetes and any other comorbidity (with or without diabetes) are significant and independent risk factors for non-survival among COVID-19 patients. The CSS showed good sensitivity and specificity (i.e. 74.1% and 78.5% at CSS≥5, respectively), with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 82.8%, which was close to the diagnostic accuracy detected in the validation cohort (81.9%). In the validation cohort, high (8–9), medium (5–7) and low (0–4) CSS groups had 54.80%, 28.60% and 6.5% observed mortality, respectively, which was very close to the predicted mortality (62.40%, 27.60% and 5.2%, respectively, by scoring cohort). CONCLUSIONS: The CSS shows a positive relationship between a higher score and proportion of mortality and, as its validation showed, it is useful for the prediction of risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients at an early stage, so that referral for triage and admission can be predetermined even before admission to hospital.","Mishra, Prabhaker; Singh, Ratender Kumar; Nath, Alok; Pande, Shantanu; Agarwal, Anil; Sanjeev, Om Prakash; Gupta, Devendra; Singh, Prateek; Ghatak, Tanmoy; Hashim, Zia; Khare, Vansh; Khuba, Sandeep; Rastogi, Amit; Dhiman, Radha K",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,260,14

The specimen collection procedure is time and resource-consuming, but more importantly, it places nurses at risk for potential infection. The practice of allowing patients to self-collect their diagnostic specimens may provide an alternative testing model for the current COVID-19 outbreaks. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy and patient perception of self-collected specimens for respiratory tract infection diagnostics. METHODS: A concise clinical review of the recently published literature was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 11 articles were included the review synthesis. The concept of self-collected specimens has a high patient acceptance rate of 83-99%. Self-collected nasal-swab specimens demonstrated strong diagnostic fidelity for respiratory tract infections with a sensitivity between 80-100%, this is higher than the 76% sensitivity observed with self-collected throat specimens. In a comparative study evaluating a professionally collected to a self-collected specimen for COVID-19 testing, a high degree of agreement (k = 0.89) was observed between the two methods. CONCLUSION: As we continue to explore for testing models to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, self-collected specimens is a practical alternative to nurse specimen collection.","Nguyen, Thang T.; Zeger, Wesley G.; Wadman, Michael C.; Barksdale, Aaron N.",J Emerg Nurs,260,3

METHODS: We report primary data collected between June and August 2019, and protocol refinements completed between 2018 and 2020. Twenty-two members of the study team collaborated in protocol refinement and completed the PRECIS-2 ratings of study pragmatism. We discuss study design refinements made to achieve the desired level of pragmatism vs. experimental control for each of the nine PRECIS-2 dimensions. Study team members received training on PRECIS-2 scoring and were asked to rate the study protocol on the nine PRECIS-2 dimensions. Ratings were compared using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: In general, the PRECIS-2 ratings revealed high levels of pragmatism, but somewhat less pragmatic ratings on the categories of Delivery and Organization (costs and resources). This variation was purposeful, and we provide the rationale for and steps taken to obtain the targeted level of pragmatism on each PRECIS-2 dimension, as well as detail design changes made to a) make the design more pragmatic and b) address COVID-19 issues. There was general agreement among team members and across different types of stakeholders on PRECIS-2 ratings. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss lessons learned from use of PRECIS-2 and experiences in refining the study to be maximally pragmatic on some dimensions and less so on other dimensions. This paper expands on prior research by describing actions to achieve higher levels of pragmatism and revise our protocol fit to the changed context.

Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are limited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal propagation of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to other global locations. Our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related to population migration from Hubei resembling a Lévy flight which is characteristic of human mobility and thus could be controlled by efficient quarantines. Since quarantine is usually applied on a city level, more insight can be obtained in analyzing the epidemic in cities. Our results suggest that the disease spread in a city in China is characterized by two-stages process. At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is close to constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection signs are observed and at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to quarantines. These two stages can explain the significant differences between the propagation in China and in other world-wide locations. While most cities in China control the disease which resulted in the decaying stage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse probably due to less social interactions control and overloaded health systems which reflects in the death and recovery rates.","Gross, Bnaya; Zheng, Zhiguo; Liu, Shiyan; Chen, Xiaoqi; Sela, Alon; Li, Jianxin; Li, Daqing; Havlin, Shlomo",,260,33

Although the benefits of PA for CF populations are well-established, adherence to PA programmes within this population remains low. This study aimed to investigate the factors that influence engagement in physical activity, and to explore exercise preferences, among adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted. Participants were twenty-one adults (mean age 35 years, SD ± 8) with an established diagnosis of CF, living in Ireland. Interview scripts were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged: barriers, motives, value of exercise-related outcomes, and exercise preferences. The main barriers included: low energy levels, time, the weather, and exercise-related confidence. Enjoyment and perceived competence underpinned autonomous motivation. Participants who self-identified as being regularly active valued personally identified exercise-related outcomes such as, accomplishment and affect regulation. Participants indicated a preference for home-based physical activity programs compared to gym- or facility-based programs. CONCLUSION: Interventions aimed at promoting physical activity among adults with CF should involve programs that foster autonomous motivation, enjoyable activities, personally identified outcomes, competence and that can be conducted from the home environment. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: To increase physical activity participation among adults with CF, interventions that can be conducted from the home environment, that pay attention to the patients’ personally-valued exercise outcomes may be required.

However, the molecular antiviral mechanisms of chickens to IBV infection remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted global gene expression profiling of chicken kidney tissue after nephropathogenic IBV infection to better understand the interactions between host and virus. RESULTS: IBV infection contributed to differential expression of 1777 genes, of which 876 were up-regulated and 901 down-regulated in the kidney compared to those of control chickens and 103 associated with immune and inflammatory responses may play important roles in the host defense response during IBV infection. Twelve of the altered immune-related genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Gene ontology category, KEGG pathway, and gene interaction networks (STRING analysis) were analyzed to identify relationships among differentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction, cell adhesion, immune responses, apoptosis regulation, positive regulation of the I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade and response to cytokine stimulus. Most of these genes were related and formed a large network, in which IL6, STAT1, MYD88, IRF1 and NFKB2 were key genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided comprehensive knowledge regarding the host transcriptional response to IBV infection in chicken kidney tissues, thereby providing insight into IBV pathogenesis, particularly the involvement of innate immune pathway genes associated with IBV infection.","Cong, Feng; Liu, Xiaoli; Han, Zongxi; Shao, Yuhao; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang",BMC Genomics,260,2

Insufficient information about viral activity increases the difficulty of forecasting the disease burden and thus hampers official preparation efforts. Here we identified potential meteorological factors that drove the seasonal variations in influenza infections in a subtropical city, Hong Kong. We fitted the meteorological data and influenza mortality data from 2002 to 2009 in a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model. From the results, air temperature was a common significant driver of seasonal patterns and cold temperature was associated with an increase in transmission intensity for most of the influenza epidemics. Except 2004, the fitted models with significant meteorological factors could account for more than 10% of the variance in additional to the null model. Rainfall was also found to be a significant driver of seasonal influenza, although results were less robust. The identified meteorological indicators could alert officials to take appropriate control measures for influenza epidemics, such as enhancing vaccination activities before cold seasons. Further studies are required to fully justify the associations.","Chong, Ka Chun; Goggins, William; Zee, Benny Chung Ying; Wang, Maggie Haitian",Int J Environ Res Public Health,260,21

We aimed to investigate links between mental health and loneliness, companion animal ownership, the human-animal bond, and human-animal interactions; and to explore animal owners’ perceptions related to the role of their animals during lockdown. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of UK residents over 18 years of age was conducted between April and June 2020. The questionnaire included validated and bespoke items measuring demographics; exposures and outcomes related to mental health, wellbeing and loneliness; the human-animal bond and human-animal interactions. RESULTS: Of 5,926 participants, 5,323 (89.8%) had at least one companion animal. Most perceived their animals to be a source of considerable support, but concerns were reported related to various practical aspects of providing care during lockdown. Strength of the human-animal bond did not differ significantly between species. Poorer mental health pre-lockdown was associated with a stronger reported human-animal bond (b = -.014, 95% CI [-.023 - -.005], p = .002). Animal ownership compared with non-ownership was associated with smaller decreases in mental health (b = .267, 95% CI [.079 - .455], p = .005) and smaller increases in loneliness (b = -.302, 95% CI [-.461 - -.144], p = .001) since lockdown. CONCLUSION: The human-animal bond is a construct that may be linked to mental health vulnerability in animal owners. Strength of the human-animal bond in terms of emotional closeness or intimacy dimensions appears to be independent of animal species. Animal ownership seemed to mitigate some of the detrimental psychological effects of Covid-19 lockdown. Further targeted investigation of the role of human-animal relationships and interactions for human health, including testing of the social buffering hypothesis and the development of instruments suited for use across animal species, is required.","Ratschen, Elena; Shoesmith, Emily; Shahab, Lion; Silva, Karine; Kale, Dimitra; Toner, Paul; Reeve, Catherine; Mills, Daniel S.",PLoS One,260,26

DESIGN: Contact investigations with active case finding were used to assess the pattern of spread from 2 COVID-19 index patients. SETTING: A community hospital and university medical center in the United States, in February and March, 2020, early in the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS: Two index patients and 421 exposed healthcare workers. METHODS: Exposed healthcare workers (HCWs) were identified by analyzing the electronic medical record (EMR) and conducting active case finding in combination with structured interviews. Healthcare coworkers (HCWs) were tested for COVID-19 by obtaining oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal specimens, and RT-PCR testing was used to detect SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Two separate index patients were admitted in February and March 2020, without initial suspicion for COVID-19 and without contact or droplet precautions in place; both patients underwent several aerosol-generating procedures in this context. In total, 421 HCWs were exposed in total, and the results of the case contact investigations identified 8 secondary infections in HCWs. In all 8 cases, the HCWs had close contact with the index patients without sufficient personal protective equipment. Importantly, despite multiple aerosol-generating procedures, there was no evidence of airborne transmission. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that, at least in a healthcare setting, most SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely to take place during close contact with infected patients through respiratory droplets, rather than by long-distance airborne transmission.","Bays, Derek J.; Nguyen, Minh-Vu H.; Cohen, Stuart H.; Waldman, Sarah; Martin, Carla S.; Thompson, George R.; Sandrock, Christian; Tourtellotte, Joel; Pugashetti, Janelle Vu; Phan, Chinh; Nguyen, Hien H.; Warner, Gregory Y.; Penn, Bennett H.",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,260,33

It runs along the neuraxis from the orbits down to the coccyx and contains fat, valveless veins, arteries and nerves. This review aims to outline the current knowledge regarding the structural and functional significance of the EDNAC. Methods A narrative review of EDNAC literature was conducted. Results The EDNAC can be organised into four regional enlargements along its length. These are the orbital, lateral sellar, clival and spinal segments with a lateral sellar orbital junction linking the orbital and lateral sellar segments. The orbital EDNAC facilitates movement of the eyeball, while elsewhere it allows limited motility for the meningeal dura. Major nerves and vessels are cushioned and supported by the EDNAC. Raised intraabdominal pressure (IAP) is also conveyed along the spinal EDNAC causing increased venous pressure in the spine and cranium. From a pathological perspective, the EDNAC functions as a low-resistance, extradural passageway that might facilitate tumour encroachment and expansion. Conclusions Clinicians should be aware of the extent and significance of the EDNAC which may impact on skull base/spine surgery and present understanding of tumour spread pathways and growth patterns. Comparatively little research has focussed on the EDNAC since its initial description therefore future investigations will provide more information on this underappreciated component of neuraxial anatomy.","Bond, Jacob D.; Zhang, Ming",World Neurosurg,260,26

In this work we applied laboratory directed evolution to several mammalian ACE2s with the goal of identifying conserved ACE2 mutations that increase spike binding affinity across multiple species. We found the Gln42Leu mutation increased ACE2-spike binding for human as well as four of four other mammalian ACE2s, while the Leu79Ile mutation had a similar effect for human and three of three mammalian ACE2 orthologs. These results are especially notable given the residues’ high levels of representation, i.e, 83% for Gln42 and 56% for Leu79, among annotated mammalian ACE2s. We also found that substitutions at ACE2 position 34, which is relatively variable across mammalian ACE2s, increased binding for multiple ACE2 orthologs. Taken together, these results speak strongly to the plausibility of SARS-CoV-2 strains with increased ability to cross species transmission barriers. Our results can guide further computational and experimental studies to develop biomedical technologies and animal husbandry practices that help protect both humans and livestock from existing and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Heinzelman, Pete; Romero, Philip A.",bioRxiv,260,20

A key question is whether the landscape of clinical research has also changed. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we examined the association of the COVID-19 outbreak with new clinical trial activations. Trial data for all interventional and observational oncology, cardiovascular, and mental health studies from January 2015 through September 2020 were obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov. An interrupted time-series analysis with Poisson regression was used. RESULTS: We examined 62,252 trial activations. During the initial COVID-19 outbreak (February 2020 through May 2020), model-estimated monthly trial activations for US-based studies were only 57% of the expected estimate had the pandemic not occurred (relative risk = 0.57, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.61, p < .001). For non-US-based studies, the impact of the pandemic was less dramatic (relative risk = 0.77, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.82, p < .001), resulting in an overall 27% reduction in the relative risk of new trial activations for US-based trials compared to non-US-based trials (relative risk ratio = 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.81, p < .001). Although a rebound occurred in the initial reopening phase (June 2020 through September 2020), the rebound was weaker for US-based studies compared to non-US-based studies (relative risk ratio = 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths during the initial phase of the pandemic in the USA. Reduced activation of cancer clinical trials will likely slow the pace of clinical research and new drug discovery, with long-term negative consequences for cancer patients. An important question is whether the renewed outbreak period of winter 2020/2021 will have a similarly negative impact on the initiation of new clinical research studies for non-COVID-19 diseases.","Unger, Joseph M.; Xiao, Hong",Trials,260,16

SARS-CoV-2 fluorescent microsphere immunochromatographic test strips were prepared by the combination of time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay with a lateral flow assay. The analytical performance and clinical evaluation of this testing method was done and the clinical significance of the testing method was verified. The LLOD of SARS-CoV-2 antibody IgG and IgM was 0.121U/L and 0.366U/L. The specificity of IgM and IgG strips in healthy people and in patients with non-COVID-19 disease was 94%, 96.72% and 95.50%, 99.49%, respectively; and sensitivity of IgM and IgG strips for patients during treatment and follow-up was 63.02%, 37.61% and 87.28%, 90.17%, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody test strip can provide rapid, flexible and accurate testing, and is able to meet the clinical requirement for rapid on-site testing of virus.

However, arid Middle Eastern countries with hot climate (elevated outdoor temperature and humidity levels) are experiencing a different situation. Unfortunately, these harsh ambient climatic conditions in Middle Eastern countries make it impossible for most buildings to utilize natural/mechanical ventilation systems. Besides, indoor air temperatures of most buildings are very low due to overconsumption of air conditioning, thereby, it can be a potential factor of virus spread in most residential homes and public buildings. Most importantly, habitual indoor burning of incense which is the major source of coarse (PM10; aerodynamic diameter <10 μm) and fine (PM2.5; aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm) particulate matters (PM) could facilitate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus droplets and particles in indoor environments. In fact, it increases the spread of the virus via inhalation in these countries, especially where the wearing of masks is not regulated in public, commercial and residential buildings. It is therefore highly recommended for the relevant public health agencies to critically assess the role of poor indoor environmental conditions including the burning of incense on virus transmissions, which may help to develop control measures for the future viral outbreak effectively.","Amoatey, Patrick; Omidvarborna, Hamid; Baawain, Mahad Said; Al-Mamun, Abdullah",Sci Total Environ,260,1

The systemic inflammatory response is a pathogenic mechanism shared by cancer progression and COVID-19. We investigated systemic inflammation as a driver of severity and mortality from COVID-19, evaluating the prognostic role of commonly used inflammatory indices in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer accrued to the OnCovid study. METHODS: In a multicenter cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer in Europe, we evaluated dynamic changes in neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR); platelet:lymphocyte ratio (PLR); Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), renamed the OnCovid Inflammatory Score (OIS); modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS); and Prognostic Index (PI) in relation to oncological and COVID-19 infection features, testing their prognostic potential in independent training (n=529) and validation (n=542) sets. RESULTS: We evaluated 1071 eligible patients, of which 625 (58.3%) were men, and 420 were patients with malignancy in advanced stage (39.2%), most commonly genitourinary (n=216, 20.2%). 844 (78.8%) had ≥1 comorbidity and 754 (70.4%) had ≥1 COVID-19 complication. NLR, OIS, and mGPS worsened at COVID-19 diagnosis compared with pre-COVID-19 measurement (p<0.01), recovering in survivors to pre-COVID-19 levels. Patients in poorer risk categories for each index except the PLR exhibited higher mortality rates (p<0.001) and shorter median overall survival in the training and validation sets (p<0.01). Multivariable analyses revealed the OIS to be most independently predictive of survival (validation set HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.20, p=0.001; adjusted concordance index score 0.611). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation is a validated prognostic domain in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer and can be used as a bedside predictor of adverse outcome. Lymphocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia as computed by the OIS are independently predictive of severe COVID-19, supporting their use for risk stratification. Reversal of the COVID-19-induced proinflammatory state is a putative therapeutic strategy in patients with cancer.","Dettorre, Gino M; Dolly, Saoirse; Loizidou, Angela; Chester, John; Jackson, Amanda; Mukherjee, Uma; Zambelli, Alberto; Aguilar-Company, Juan; Bower, Mark; Sng, Christopher C T; Salazar, Ramon; Bertuzzi, Alexia; Brunet, Joan; Mesia, Ricard; Sita-Lumsden, Ailsa; Seguí, Elia; Biello, Federica; Generali, Daniele; Grisanti, Salvatore; Seeva, Pavetha; Rizzo, Gianpiero; Libertini, Michela; Maconi, Antonio; Moss, Charlotte; Russell, Beth; Harbeck, Nadia; Vincenzi, Bruno; Bertulli, Rossella; Ottaviani, Diego; Liñan, Raquel; Marrari, Andrea; Carmona-García, M Carmen; Chopra, Neha; Tondini, Carlo Alberto; Mirallas, Oriol; Tovazzi, Valeria; Fotia, Vittoria; Cruz, Claudia Andrea; Saoudi-Gonzalez, Nadia; Felip, Eudald; Roqué, Ariadna; Lee, Alvin J X; Newsom-Davis, Tom; García-Illescas, David; Reyes, Roxana; Wong, Yien Ning Sophia; Ferrante, Daniela; Scotti, Lorenza; Marco-Hernández, Javier; Ruiz-Camps, Isabel; Patriarca, Andrea; Rimassa, Lorenza; Chiudinelli, Lorenzo; Franchi, Michela; Santoro, Armando; Prat, Aleix; Gennari, Alessandra; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke; Tabernero, Josep; Diamantis, Nikolaos; Pinato, David J",J Immunother Cancer,260,24

Here in New York City, we experienced a case fatality rate of 12.2% between March 21, 2020 and May 20, 2020. Once the initial wave subsided, we noted that our ED census was unusually low. In order to avoid cutting staff in response to that ominous trend, we explored the reassignment of staff in order to improve our ED operations. We chose the model of triage liaison physician (TLP), an efficient method of improving patient throughput. This would allow us to maintain staff that might otherwise by furloughed or lost permanently. Study Objectives: We present the results of our departmental performance improvement (PI) initiative, focusing on the metric of door-to-provider time (DPT). Methods: We obtained IRB approval to analyze data from our ED dashboard. We focused on data from ten weeks before the initiation of the TLP to 24 weeks thereafter. We restricted the data to include only patients who arrived between 10:00 AM and 2:00 AM, as those were the hours where a TLP was on duty. We measured median DTP times and created run charts and control charts to demonstrate how the TPL affected the DTP metric. The control chart was our way of determining if any improvement was a process that could be sustainable. Results: For the ten-week period prior to the initiation of the TLP, median DPT was 18 minutes. After initiation of the TLP, our median DTP was 7 minutes. This apparent improvement was supported by a run chart that showed the dramatic decrease, and by a control chart that showed the stability of the new TLP process. Conclusion: Our data suggest that reassigning an attending physician to the role of TPL allows an ED to retain valuable attending physicians while also improving patient safety metrics such as DTP. Future research should focus on other potential benefits of the TLP, such as revenue generated by reducing patients who leave without being seen, earlier detection of sepsis and stroke, and reduced dwell times in the ED.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was undertaken between 17 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 and compared with retrospective data from same time period in 2019. We compared the number of patients requiring acute hospital admission or orthopaedic referrals and indications of referrals from our admission sheets and obtained operative data from our theatre software. RESULTS: Between 17 March to 30 April 2020, there were 48 acute spine referrals as compared to 68 acute referrals during the same time period last year. In the 2019 period, 69% (47/68) of cases referred to the on-call team presented with back pain, radiculopathy or myelopathy compared to 43% (21/48) in the 2020 period. Almost 20% (14/68) of spine referrals consisted of spine trauma as compared to 35% (17/48) this year. There were no confirmed cases of cauda equine last year during this time. Overall, 150 spine cases were carried out during this time period last year, and 261 spine elective cases were cancelled since 17 March 2020. RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend following steps can be helpful to deal with similar situations or new pandemics in future: 24 hours on-call spine service during the pandemic. Clinical criteria in place to prioritize urgent spinal cases. Pre-screening spine patients before elective operating. Start of separate specialist trauma list for patients needing urgent surgeries.

Vitamin D3 has been shown to be beneficial to patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) through its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. Smooth muscle cells are one of the major contributors to airway remodeling in asthma and COPD. We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin D3 treatment on viral-induced TLR3 responses in Bronchial Smooth Muscle Cells (BSMCs) as a mechanism contributing to pulmonary fibrosis in asthma and COPD. Primary BSMCs from patients with asthma (n=4), COPD (n=4), and healthy control subjects (n=6) were treated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (polyI:C), TLR3 agonist in the presence or absence of vitamin D3 (1,25D3). Here we report the mRNA expression and protein levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers (IL-6, IFN-β1, CCL2/MCP-1, fibronectin 1 and type I collagen) among BSMCs groups: asthma, COPD, and healthy controls. We show that at the baseline, prior to polyI:C stimulation, asthma and COPD BSMCs presented increased pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic state compared to healthy control subjects, as measured by quantitative PCR and immunoassays (ELISA/Flow Cytometry. Ligation of TLR3 by polyI:C in BSMCs was associated with increased TLR3 mRNA expression, and 1,25D3 treatment significantly reduced its expression. In addition, 1,25D3 decreased the expression of IL-6, IFN-β1, CCL2, FN1 and COL1A1 induced by polyI:C in BSMCs. The regulatory effect of 1,25D3 treatment on polyI:C-stimulated BSMCs was further confirmed at protein levels. Our findings suggest that vitamin D3 attenuates TLR3 agonist-induced inflammatory and fibrotic responses in BSMCs and support the clinical relevance of vitamin D3 supplementation in patients with viral infections having chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and COPD.","Plesa, Maria; Gaudet, Mellissa; Mogas, Andrea; Jalaleddine, Nour; Halayko, Andrew; Al Heialy, Saba; Hamid, Qutayba",Front Immunol,260,28

Seafood includes a wide variety of edible marine organisms, except fish and mammals. These are molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms and algae. Like any food, seafood can involve hazards transmitted to humans through food, which affect the health of the consumer. These hazards are both biological (viruses, bacteria, parasites) and chemical (toxins, allergens, chemicals, microplastics). The exposure of populations to these hazards through seafood consumption can be notably explained by their mode of production and the dietary habits. Firstly, the sanitary quality of products reflects the quality of the aquatic environment from which they are taken, which can be contaminated by various types of pollution (faecal or chemical, chronic or accidental).

Finally, the dietary habits of seafood favour exposure to certain hazards. Seafood safety must be integrated throughout the food chain, under the responsibility shared by all stakeholders.

Whether cognition predicts adherence to protective behaviors has not been examined in older adults. AIMS: To examine whether specific cognitive abilities predict adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors in older adults, independent of other relevant factors. METHODS: Data from 431 older adults (i.e., ≥ 65 years) who took part in the COVID-19 module of the Health and Retirement Study were included in the present study. Separate binary logistic regression models were used to examine whether performance on measures of immediate and delayed recall and working memory predicted adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors, controlling for demographics, level of COVID-19 concern, depressive symptoms, and medical conditions. RESULTS: For every unit increase in immediate and delayed recall, the probability of adhering to COVID-19 protective behaviors increased by 47% and 69%, respectively. There was no association between the measure of working memory and adherence. DISCUSSION: It is of public interest to understand the factors that reduce adherence to protective behaviors so that we can better protect those most vulnerable and limit community spread. Our findings demonstrate that reduced memory predicts non-adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors, independent of virus concern, and other relevant demographic and health factors. CONCLUSIONS: Public health strategies aimed at increasing adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors in community dwelling older adults, should account for the role of reduced cognitive function in limiting adherence.","O’Shea, Deirdre M.; Davis, Jennifer D.; Tremont, Geoffrey",Aging Clin Exp Res,260,16

Non-symptomatic individuals unaware of the infection risk they pose to others, may perceive themselves –and being perceived by others– as not representing risk of infection. Yet many epidemiological models currently in use do not include a behavioral component, and do not address the potential consequences of risk misperception. To study the impact of behavioral adaptations to the perceived infection risk, we use a mathematical model that incorporates individuals’ behavioral decisions based on a projection of the future system’s state over a finite planning horizon. We found that individuals’ risk misperception in the presence of asymptomatic individuals may increase or reduce the final epidemic size. Moreover, under behavioral response the impact of asymptomatic infections is modulated by symptomatic individuals’ behavior. Finally, we found that there is an optimal planning horizon that minimizes the final epidemic size.","Espinoza, Baltazar; Marathe, Madhav; Swarup, Samarth; Thakur, Mugdha",Res Sq,260,26

We have developed toehold RNA-based sensors across the SARS-CoV-2 genome for direct and ultrasensitive detection of the virus and its prominent variants. Here, isothermal amplification of a fragment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA coupled with activation of our biosensors leads to a conformational switch in the sensor. This leads to translation of a reporter protein, for example, LacZ or nano-lantern that is easily detected using color/luminescence. By optimizing RNA amplification and biosensor design, we have generated a highly sensitive diagnostic assay that is capable of detecting as low as 100 copies of viral RNA with development of bright color. This is easily visualized by the human eye and quantifiable using spectrophotometry. Finally, this PHAsed NASBA-Translation Optical Method (PHANTOM) using our engineered RNA biosensors efficiently detects viral RNA in patient samples. This work presents a powerful and universally accessible strategy for detecting COVID-19 and variants.

Despite its use to treat COVID-19 patients and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on cancer immunotherapy has not been examined. In this study, remarkably, we find that HCQ alone, or in combination with azithromycin (AZ), at doses used to treat patients, decreased the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-1 in cancer immunotherapy. No deleterious effect was seen on untreated tumors. Mechanistically, HCQ and HCQ/AZ inhibited PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, while specifically targeting the anti-PD-1 induced increase in progenitor CD8(+)CD44(+)PD-1(+)TCF1(+) tumor infiltrating T cells (TILs) and the generation of CD8(+)CD44(+)PD-1(+) effectors. Surprisingly, it also impaired the appearance of a subset of terminally exhausted CD8(+) TILs. No effect was seen on the presence of CD4(+) T cells, FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), thymic subsets, B cells, antibody production, myeloid cells, or the vasculature of mice.

First, we present a range of potential solutions to challenges in research, resulting from the pandemic, and discuss strategies for preserving ongoing research efforts. We discuss approaches to scaling back existing protocols, share ideas for adapting lab‐based measures for online administration (e.g., using video chat platforms), and suggest strategies for addressing missing data and reduced sample size due to lower participation rates and funding restrictions. We also discuss the importance of measuring COVID‐19 relevant factors to use as controls or explore as moderators of primary hypotheses. Second, we discuss how the COVID‐19 pandemic represents a scientifically important context for understanding how families adjust and adapt to change and adversity. Increased stress precipitated by the pandemic, varying from acute stress associated with job loss to more chronic and enduring stress, will undoubtedly take a toll.

METHODS: In this IRB‐approved retrospective case series, biopsy specimens of potential cutaneous adverse reactions from the Pfizer‐BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine were identified and reviewed. Clinical information was obtained through the requisition form, referring clinician, or medical chart review. RESULTS: Twelve cases were included. Histopathological features from two injection‐site reactions showed a mixed‐cell infiltrate with eosinophils and a spongiotic dermatitis with eosinophils. Three biopsy specimens came from generalized eruptions that showed interface changes consistent with an exanthematous drug reaction. Three biopsy specimens revealed a predominantly spongiotic pattern, consistent with eczematous dermatitis. Small‐vessel vascular injury was seen in two specimens, which were diagnosed as urticarial vasculitis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis, respectively. There were two cases of new‐onset bullous pemphigoid supported by histopathological examination and direct immunofluorescence studies. Eosinophils were seen in 10 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Dermatopathologists should be aware of potential cutaneous adverse reactions to mRNA‐based COVID‐19 vaccines. Histopathological patterns include mixed‐cell infiltrates, epidermal spongiosis, and interface changes. Eosinophils are a common finding but are not always present.

Although coming from the same family of viruses and sharing certain transmissibility factors, the local health institutions in China had no experience with this new virus, subsequently named SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on their prior experience with the 2003 SARS epidemic, health authorities in China recognized the need for personal protective equipment (PPE). Existing PPE and protocols were limited and reflected early experience with SARS; however, as additional PPE supplies became available, designated COVID-19 hospitals in Hubei Province adopted the World Health Organization guidelines for Ebola to create a protocol specific for treating patients with COVID-19.

Monocyte and neutrophil expression of CD64 and CD11b have been reported as early biomarkers to detect infections. The aim of this study was to study the expression of receptors for IgG (CD64) and adhesion molecules (CD11b, CD15s, CD65, CD162, CD66b) on neutrophils and monocytes in patients with severe COVID-19 after admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: The expression of receptors was analyzed using flow cytometry. EDTA blood from 23 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection was sampled within 48 h of admission to the ICU. Leukocytes were labeled with antibodies to CD11b, CD15s, CD65s, CD162, CD64, and CD66b. Expression of receptors was reported as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) or the percentage of cells expressing receptors. RESULTS: Results are presented as comparison of COVID-19 patients with the healthy group and the receptor expression as MFI. Neutrophil receptors CD64 (2.5 versus 0.5) and CD66b (44.5 versus 34) were increased and CD15 decreased (21.6 versus 28.3) when CD65 (6.6 versus 4.4), CD162 (21.3 versus 21.1) and CD11b (10.5 versus 12) were in the same range. Monocytes receptors CD64 (30.5 versus 16.6), CD11b (18.7 versus 9.8), and CD162 (38.6 versus 36.5) were increased and CD15 decreased (10.3 versus 17.9); CD65 were in the same range (2.3 versus 1.96). CONCLUSION: Monocytes and neutrophils are activated during severe COVID-19 infection as shown by strong upregulation of CD64. High monocyte and neutrophil CD64 can be an indicator of a severe form of COVID19. The adhesion molecules (CD11b, CD162, CD65, and CD15) are not upregulated on otherwise activated neutrophils, which might lead to relative impairment of tissue migration. Low adhesion profile of neutrophils suggests immune dysfunction of neutrophils. Monocytes maintain upregulation of some adhesion molecules (CD11b, CD162) suggesting the persistence of an increased ability to migrate into tissues, even during a severe stage of COVID-19. Future research should focus on CD64 and CD11b kinetics in the context of prognosis.","Karawajczyk, Malgorzata; Douhan Håkansson, Lena; Lipcsey, Miklos; Hultström, Michael; Pauksens, Karlis; Frithiof, Robert; Larsson, Anders",Ther Adv Infect Dis,260,1

Despite the promise of veganic methods in diverse realms such as food safety, environmental sustainability, and animal liberation, it has a small literature base. This article draws primarily on interviews conducted in 2018 with 25 veganic farmers from 19 farms in the United States to establish some baseline empirical research on this farming community. Its qualitative perspectives illuminate farmer perceptions of and experiences with veganic growing, including definitions, knowledge acquisition, values, and challenges. Results highlight a lack of agreement about the meaning of veganic agriculture in terms of allowable inputs and scope. Participants have drawn on a wide array of veganic and non-veganic resources to ascend their veganic production learning curves, also relying on experimentation and trial-and-error. Their farming is motivated by a diversity of real and perceived benefits, most notably consistency with veganism, food safety advantages, and plant and soil health benefits. Veganic product sourcing and the dearth of veganic agriculture-specific resources present considerable challenges to farmers. The article briefly discusses possibilities for developing veganic agriculture in the United States, such as through a US-based certification system and farmers’ associations, based on considerations of the trajectory of the US organic farming movement and veganic developments in Europe. Finally, the article suggests the importance of expanded research into soil health and fertility in plant-based systems to support practicing and potential veganic farmers.","Seymour, Mona; Utter, Alisha",Agric Human Values,260,1

Up to 30% of coronavirus disease 2019 patients with hypertension are more susceptible to death. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been used as primary line of medication for hypertension; nonetheless, conflicting data arises as numerous studies showed contradictory results. MAIN BODY: Aiming to show clinical outcome of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers in hospital treatment of hypertensive patients with coronavirus disease 2019, systematically searched literatures through five databases were intensively appraised using The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation checklists for cohort studies. Based on the result evaluation from retrospective cohorts involving more than 15,000 patients across Asia and other regions of the world, ten encompassed studies divided into two subgroups in this meta-review showed that in-hospital hypertensive coronavirus disease 2019 patients receiving antihypertensive drugs were associated with overall risk reduction in subgroup 1 (hazard ratio, HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.82–1.12) to no outcome association of all-cause mortalities in subgroup 2 (HR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.19–0.34). All appraised studies in synergism showed that mortality outcomes were not augmented with the employment of either ACE inhibitor or ARB in subjects.

Based on our discovery that the glycosaminoglycan dermatan sulfate (DS) displays peculiar affinity to apoptotic cells and autoantigens (autoAgs) and that DS-autoAg complexes cooperatively stimulate autoreactive B1 cell responses, we compiled a database of 751 candidate autoAgs from six human cell types. At least 657 of these have been found to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection based on currently available multi-omic COVID data, and at least 400 are confirmed targets of autoantibodies in a wide array of autoimmune diseases and cancer. The autoantigen-ome is significantly associated with various processes in viral infections, such as translation, protein processing, and vesicle transport. Interestingly, the coding genes of autoAgs predominantly contain multiple exons with many possible alternative splicing variants, short transcripts, and short UTR lengths. These observations and the finding that numerous autoAgs involved in RNA-splicing showed altered expression in viral infections suggest that viruses exploit alternative splicing to reprogram host cell machinery to ensure viral replication and survival. While each cell type gives rise to a unique pool of autoAgs, 39 common autoAgs associated with cell stress and apoptosis were identified from all six cell types, with several being known markers of systemic autoimmune diseases. In particular, the common autoAg UBA1 that catalyzes the first step in ubiquitination is encoded by an X-chromosome escape gene. Given its essential function in apoptotic cell clearance and that X-inactivation escape tends to increase with aging, UBA1 dysfunction can therefore predispose aging women to autoimmune disorders. In summary, we propose a model of how viral infections lead to extensive molecular alterations and host cell death, autoimmune responses facilitated by autoAg-DS complexes, and ultimately autoimmune diseases. Overall, this master autoantigen-ome provides a molecular guide for investigating the myriad of autoimmune sequalae to COVID-19 and clues to the rare but reported adverse effects of the currently available COVID vaccines.","Wang, Julia Y.; Roehrl, Michael W.; Roehrl, Victor B.; Roehrl, Michael H.",bioRxiv,260,20

Studies are ongoing for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease, which is defined as a pandemic. Early diagnosis of this disease is important for human life. This process is progressing rapidly with diagnostic studies based on deep learning. Therefore, to contribute to this field, a deep learning-based approach that can be used for early diagnosis of the disease is proposed in our study. In this approach, a data set consisting of 3 classes of COVID19, normal and pneumonia lung X-ray images was created, with each class containing 364 images. Pre-processing was performed using the image contrast enhancement algorithm on the prepared data set and a new data set was obtained. Feature extraction was completed from this data set with deep learning models such as AlexNet, VGG19, GoogleNet, and ResNet. For the selection of the best potential features, two metaheuristic algorithms of binary particle swarm optimization and binary gray wolf optimization were used. After combining the features obtained in the feature selection of the enhancement data set, they were classified using SVM. The overall accuracy of the proposed approach was obtained as 99.38%. The results obtained by verification with two different metaheuristic algorithms proved that the approach we propose can help experts during COVID-19 diagnostic studies.","Canayaz, Murat",Biomed Signal Process Control,260,16

The specific and sensitive diagnosis of parasitic nematode infections of livestock underpins effective disease control, which is now particularly important given the problems associated with anthelmintic resistance in parasite populations. Traditional diagnostic methods have major limitations, in terms of sensitivity and specificity. This chapter provides an account of the significance of parasitic nematodes (order Strongylida), reviews conventional diagnostic techniques that are presently used routinely and describes advances in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for the specific diagnosis of nematode infections.

Although every vaccine is developed to induce specific protection for a particular pathogen, some vaccine formulations can also promote trained immunity, which is a non-specific memory-like feature developed by the innate immune system. It is thought that trained immunity can protect against a wide variety of pathogens other than those contained in the vaccine formulation. The non-specific memory of the trained immunity-based vaccines (TIbV) seems beneficial for the immunized individual, as it may represent a powerful strategy that contributes to the control of pathogen outbreaks, reducing morbidity and mortality. A wide variety of respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV), cause serious illness in children under 5 years old and the elderly. To address this public health problem, we have developed recombinant BCG vaccines that have shown to be safe and immunogenic against hRSV or hMPV. Besides the induction of specific adaptive immunity against the viral antigens, these vaccines could generate trained immunity against other respiratory pathogens. Here, we discuss some of the features of trained immunity induced by BCG and put forward the notion that recombinant BCGs expressing hRSV or hMPV antigens have the capacity to simultaneously induce specific adaptive immunity and non-specific trained immunity. These recombinant BCG vaccines could be considered as TIbV capable of inducing simultaneously the development of specific protection against hRSV or hMPV, as well as non-specific trained-immunity-based protection against other pathogenic viruses.","Covián, Camila; Ríos, Mariana; Berríos-Rojas, Roslye V.; Bueno, Susan M.; Kalergis, Alexis M.",Front Immunol,260,16

However, the specific role of each immunoglobulin isotype in the overall neutralizing capacity is still not well understood. In this study, we selected plasma from a cohort of Covid-19 convalescent patients and selectively depleted immunoglobulin A, M or G before testing the remaining neutralizing capacity of the depleted plasma. We found that depletion of immunoglobulin M was associated with the most substantial loss of virus neutralization, followed by immunoglobulin G.

The purpose of this study is to explore the diagnostic value of the quantitative computed tomography (CT) method by using different threshold segmentation techniques to distinguish between patients with or without COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A total of 47 patients with suspected COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed, including nine patients with positive real-time fluorescence reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test (confirmed case group) and 38 patients with negative RT-PCR test (excluded case group). An improved 3D convolutional neural network (VB-Net) was used to automatically extract lung lesions. Eight different threshold segmentation methods were used to define the ground glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the performance of various parameters with different thresholds for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: The volume of GGO (VOGGO) and GGO percentage in the whole lung (GGOPITWL) were the most effective values for diagnosing COVID-19 at a threshold of − 300 HU, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.769 and 0.769, sensitivity of 66.67 and 66.67%, specificity of 94.74 and 86.84%. Compared with VOGGO or GGOPITWL at a threshold of − 300 Hounsfield units (HU), the consolidation percentage in the whole lung (CPITWL) with thresholds at − 400 HU, − 350 HU, and − 250 HU were statistically different. There were statistical differences in the infection volume and percentage of the whole lung, right lung, and lobes between the two groups. VOGGO, GGOPITWL, and volume of consolidation (VOC) were also statistically different at the threshold of − 300 HU. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative CT provides an image quantification method for the auxiliary diagnosis of COVID-19 and is expected to assist in confirming patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in suspected cases.

Second, to explore the influence of therapeutic orientations on therapeutic interventions in in‐person versus remote psychotherapy. METHOD: Psychotherapists (N = 217) from Austria were recruited, who in turn recruited their patients (N = 133). The therapeutic orientation of the therapists was psychodynamic (22.6%), humanistic (46.1%), systemic (20.7%) or behavioural (10.6%). All the data were collected remotely via online surveys. Therapists and patients completed two versions of the ‘Multitheoretical List of Therapeutic Interventions’ (MULTI‐30) (version 1: in‐person; version 2: remote) to investigate differences between in‐person and remote psychotherapy in the following therapeutic interventions: psychodynamic, common factors, person‐centred, process‐experiential, interpersonal, cognitive, behavioural and dialectical‐behavioural. RESULTS: Therapists rated all examined therapeutic interventions as more typical for in‐person than for remote psychotherapy. For patients, three therapeutic interventions (psychodynamic, process‐experiential, cognitive interventions) were more typical for in‐person than for remote psychotherapy after correcting for multiple testing. For two therapeutic interventions (behavioural, dialectical‐behavioural), differences between the four therapeutic orientations were more consistent for in‐person than for remote psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic interventions differed between in‐person and remote psychotherapy and differences between therapeutic orientations in behavioural‐oriented interventions become indistinct in remote psychotherapy.","Probst, Thomas; Haid, Barbara; Schimböck, Wolfgang; Reisinger, Andrea; Gasser, Marion; Eichberger‐Heckmann, Heidrun; Stippl, Peter; Jesser, Andrea; Humer, Elke; Korecka, Nicole; Pieh, Christoph",Clin Psychol Psychother,260,24

Studies of national wellbeing and emotional responses to infection rates during a pandemic have been rare thus far. While several disciplines offer theoretical priors in the case of individuals, far less attention has been paid to the wellbeing and emotional response at a national level. Our paper contributes to the literature by applying a time-series approach to the relationship between wellbeing, emotions and the passage of a pandemic. As such we contribute to a wider literature on macro responses to exogenous shocks. Our analysis involves the use of a wellbeing index and emotional time-series derived from Big Data in the form of tweets originating within New Zealand. The index captures the daily evaluative mood of the country several weeks before the first domestic case of COVID-19 was recorded until several weeks of no new COVID-19 cases. We find distinct reactions to the pandemic: a initial fall in national wellbeing generated by a decrease in the emotions ‘joy’, ‘anticipation’ and ‘trust’. Following a rapid and severe lockdown designed to limit domestic transmission of the virus national wellbeing recovered relatively quickly. Gaining insight into the wellbeing (happiness) reponse to pandemics at the national level is important because the average level of happiness within countries is known to be associated with a range of economic, social, health and political outcomes.","Morrison, Philip S.; Rossouw, Stephanié; Greyling, Talita",Appl Res Qual Life,260,30

This analysis compares person-based contact tracing among two populations in Salt Lake County, Utah, from March–May 2020. METHODS: : All laboratory-confirmed positive cases among PEH (n=169) and documented in Utah's surveillance system were included in this analysis. The general population comparison group (n=163) were systematically selected from all laboratory-confirmed cases identified during the same period. RESULTS: : Ninety-three PEH cases (55%) were interviewed compared to 163 (100%) cases among the general population (p<0.0001). PEH were more likely to be lost to follow-up at end of isolation (14.2%) versus the general population (0%; p-value<0.0001) and provided fewer contacts per case (0.31) than the general population (4.7) (p-value<0.0001). Contacts of PEH were more often unreachable (13.0% vs. 7.1%; p-value<0.0001).

This review describes the mathematical background behind supervised AI algorithms, and discusses selected AI ECG cardiac screening algorithms including those for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, episodic atrial fibrillation from a tracing recorded during normal sinus rhythm, and other structural and valvular diseases. The ability to learn from big data sets, without the need to understand the biological mechanism, has created opportunities for detecting non-cardiac diseases as COVID-19 and introduced challenges with regards to data privacy. Like all medical tests, the AI ECG must be carefully vetted and validated in real-world clinical environments. Finally, with mobile form factors that allow acquisition of medical-grade ECGs from smartphones and wearables, the use of AI may enable massive scalability to democratize healthcare.","Attia, Zachi I; Harmon, David M; Behr, Elijah R; Friedman, Paul A",Eur Heart J,260,32

Hence, an in-silico study was done by selecting eighteen well reported antiviral phytochemicals from some spices commonly used in Indian kitchen viz. Curcuma longa (Turmeric), Nigella sativa (Black cumin), Piper nigrum (Black pepper), Trachyspermum ammi (Carom) and Zingiber officinale (Ginger) to find out whether they can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Firstly, we predicted the structure of TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2), a host protein that truncates spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 thereby facilitating its endocytosis, and then docked against its catalytic domain the selected phytochemicals and camostat (a well-known synthetic inhibitor of TMPRSS2). Thereafter, stability of seven best docked phytochemicals and camostat were scrutinized by Molecular Dynamic Simulation (MDS). MDS analysis indicated bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC), carvacrol and thymol as better inhibitors than the camostat due to their stable binding with TMPRSS2 in its oxyanion hole and inducing subtle modification in the spatial arrangement of the catalytic triad residues.

The trimeric S protein binds the receptor using the distal receptor-binding domain (RBD) causing conformational changes in S protein that allow priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling the dynamic structural features used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal novel therapeutic targets. Using structures determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, we performed structural analysis and atomic comparisons of the different conformational states adopted by the SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Results Here, we determined the key structural components induced by the receptor and characterized their intramolecular interactions. We show that κ-helix (also known as polyproline II) is a predominant structure in the binding interface and in facilitating the conversion to the active form of the S protein. We demonstrate a series of conversions between switch-like κ-helix and β-strand, and conformational variations in a set of short α-helices which affect the proximal hinge region. This conformational changes lead to an alternating pattern in conserved disulfide bond configurations positioned at the hinge, indicating a possible disulfide exchange, an important allosteric switch implicated in viral entry of various viruses, including HIV and murine coronavirus. The structural information presented herein enables us to inspect and understand the important dynamic features of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and propose a novel potential therapeutic strategy to block viral entry. Overall, this study provides guidance for the design and optimization of structure-based intervention strategies that target SARS-CoV-2.","Meirson, Tomer; Bomze, David; Markel, Gal",bioRxiv,260,26

Moreover, with the rise of newer strains, the period ahead has to be tread carefully to prevent resurgence of infections. There have been recommendations regarding the ideal setup to operate orthopaedic cases in this pandemic scenario. However, many of the hospitals in India with financial and logistic constraints are unable to implement these structural changes into their existing setup. We propose a model which can be used in an existing operation theatre which has a single entry and exit corridor, which is the layout in many hospitals. METHODOLOGY: A protocol with the consultation of a panel of health care professionals was designed on the basis of WHO guidelines in a way so as to remain dynamic. Prior to its implementation, online classes were conducted and a dry run of the protocol was done with the whole team involved. The theatre layout is one with a single entry and exit and had predesignated rooms. The personnel were divided into 3 teams, each with a fixed set of people and preset workflow, to be followed during entry and exit. Five COVID positive cases have been operated since then using the protocol and has been used as a pilot study to further amend the protocol. CONCLUSION: This model can be used as a guideline by hospitals having a limited infrastructure, to develop their own protocol to operate on COVID positive cases, in the present situation of increasing trauma cases post the relaxation of lockdown and also in any subsequent waves of infection with newer strains. Simulation and periodic stringent audits with the entire team would prove successful in rectifying errors and avoiding any possible contamination.","Bhat, Anil K.; Vijayan, Sandeep; Acharya, Ashwath M.; Shetty, Sourab; Ampar, Nishanth; Kanhangad, Madhava Pai; Hegde, Nikhil",J Clin Orthop Trauma,260,16

TRE possessed considerable amounts of phenolics (282.73 mg tannic acid equivalents/g of extract) and flavonoids (101.43 mg naringin equivalents/g of extract). IC(50) values for reducing power and DPPH radical scavenging activity were 52.51 and 47.83 μg, respectively. The H(2)O(2) scavenging capacity of TRE was found to be 57.68 μM × μg(−1) min(−1). By examining the effects of TRE on SH-SY5Y cells injured by H(2)O(2), we found that after incubation of cells with TRE prior to H(2)O(2) exposure, the H(2)O(2) induced cytotoxicity was significantly reversed and the apoptotic features such as change in cellular morphology, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation was inhibited. Moreover, TRE was very effective attenuating the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptotic cell death induced by H(2)O(2). TRE extract effectively suppressed the up-regulation of Bax, Caspase-3 and -9, and down-regulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, TRE pretreatment evidently increased the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings demonstrate that TRE protects SH-SY5Y cells against H(2)O(2)-induced injury and antioxidant properties may account for its neuroprotective actions and suggest that TRE might potentially serve as an agent for prevention of neurodegenerative disease associated with oxidative stress.","Choi, Bong-Suk; Sapkota, Kumar; Kim, Seung; Lee, Hyo Jeong; Choi, Han-Seok; Kim, Sung-Jun",Neurochem Res,260,1

In this study, we conceptualized a framework capturing recurring troublesome elements of mental states such as depression and general anxiety, assessing them by applying standard clinical inventory. The study explores the extent to which danger control and fear control under the Extended Parallel Processing Model (EPPM) threat impact job insecurity, with uncertainty phenomenon causing afflicting effect on the experiential nature of depression heightened by anxiety. With the aim to explore the job insecurity relationship with anxiety and depression, and measure the impact of EPPM threat, an empirical study was conducted in the United States on a sample of 347 white collar employees. Demographic data, EPPM threat, job insecurity, anxiety, and depression data were collected via a standardized questionnaire during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The questionnaire consisting of multi-item scales was distributed online. All the scale items were evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale. SEM software AMOS version 23 was used to perform confirmatory factor analysis with maximum likelihood estimation. In the structural model, relationships between the threat of COVID-19, job insecurity, anxiety, and depression were assessed. The findings of the study suggest that job insecurity has a significant impact on depression and anxiety, whereas the threat of COVID-19 has a significant impact on depression. Mediating effects of job insecurity and EPPM threat impact on anxiety were not established in the study. The study contributes to the apprehension of the repercussions of major environmental disruptions on normal human functioning, and it investigates the effects of self-reported protective behaviors on risk perception. The study also explains the underlying mechanisms of coping behavior as possible antecedents to mental disorders. When subjected to stressful events, heightened psychological arousal causes physical and psychological challenges of affected employees to manifest as behavioral issues.","Obrenovic, Bojan; Du, Jianguo; Godinic, Danijela; Baslom, Mohammed Majdy M; Tsoy, Diana",Front Psychol,260,1

Prolonged glucocorticoid overtreatment causes multiple morbidities. HYPOTHESIS: We tested the hypotheses that the DGRD, empirically determined by individual patient titration, is lower than that of the Endocrine Society guidelines and tolerated without evidence of glucocorticoid under-replacement. METHODS: We empirically determined the DGRD in 25 otherwise healthy adults with AI by titrating the DGRD to the lowest dose tolerated as judged by body mass index, blood pressure, serum sodium concentration and AI symptoms. Patients received either HC or prednisone (PRED). The HC equivalent of PRED was assumed to be 4:1. RESULTS: The mean empirically determined DGRD, expressed as HC equivalent, was significantly less than the midpoint of the Endocrine Society’s recommended DGRD (7.6 ± 3.5 mg/m(2) vs 11.8 mg/m(2); P < 0.001). The DGRD in the adrenalectomy group was not significantly different than the DGRD of those with other AI causes (7.9 ± 4.0 mg/m(2) vs 7.3 ± 3.1 mg/m(2); P = ns), demonstrating that the empirically determined DGRD was not biased by residual cortisol secretion. There was no evidence of glucocorticoid under-replacement as determined by measured biometrics and AI symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that an empirically determined DGRD is significantly lower than that of the Endocrine Society guidelines and tolerated without evidence of glucocorticoid under-replacement.","Caetano, Celina M; Sliwinska, Aleksandra; Madhavan, Parvathy; Grady, James; Malchoff, Carl D",J Endocr Soc,260,20

METHODS: In March 2020, Leipzig University Hospital established an outpatient clinic for patients potentially infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Confirmed cases with mild to moderate symptoms self-isolated at home and were followed-up by daily telephone calls for at least 14 days. Symptoms and course of illness of these patients are reported here. RESULTS: From March 20 to April 17, 2020, 1460 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by naso- or oropharyngeal swab for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Covid-19 was confirmed in 91 (6.2%) patients, of which 87 were included in the final analysis. Patients presented for testing after a mean of 5.9 days (IQR = 2.0–8.5). The median age was 37.0 years (IQR = 28.5–53), and 48 (55.2%) were female. Five (5.7%) patients required hospital admission during the course of illness. Most frequently reported symptoms were fatigue (n = 64, 74%), cough (n = 58, 67%), and hyposmia/hypogeusia (n = 44, 51%). In contrast to previous reports, fever occurred in less than a third of patients (n = 25, 29%). By day 14, more than half of the patients had recovered completely (n = 37/70, 52.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Fever seems to be less common in patients of relatively young age diagnosed with mild to moderate Covid-19. This suggests that body temperature alone may be an insufficient indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Schneider, Anne; Kirsten, Holger; Lordick, Franziska; Lordick, Florian; Lübbert, Christoph; von Braun, Amrei",PLoS One,260,16

During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health issues have grown increasingly more prevalent in the population. Due to social distancing and other limitations during the pandemic, there is a need for home-based, flexible interventions that can improve mental health. The Yoga of Immortals (YOI) mobile application provides a structured intervention that can be used on any mobile device and applied from the user's home. Methods: A total of 1,505 participants were enrolled in the study and used the YOI app for an 8-week period. Participants were asked to fill out three questionnaires: The Patient Health Questionnaire, 8 items (PHQ-8), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). These three items were completed by 1,297 participants a total of four times: before starting YOI, two more times during use, and a fourth time after the 8-week usage period. Changes in PHQ8, GAD7 and ISI in participants were compared to a control group, who did not use the YOI app but completed all questionnaires (590 controls finished all questionnaires). Results: Participants reported significant decreases in depression and anxiety-related symptoms. Compared to baseline, PHQ-8 scores decreased 50% on average after the 8-week period. GAD-7 scores also decreased by 40–50% on average, and ISI scores decreased by 50%. These changes were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that observed in the control group. Participants who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and generalized anxiety reported significantly larger decreases in PHQ-8 and GAD-7 as compared to participants with no prior diagnosis (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Regular use of the YOI intervention over an 8-week period led to significant decreases in symptoms of both depression and anxiety, as well as alleviation of insomnia.","Verma, Sadhna; Donovan, James; Tunuguntla, Hari S.; Tunuguntla, Renuka; Gupta, Babu V.; Nandi, Ayon; Shivanand, Ishan",Front Psychiatry,260,29

Strain v2163 increased IL-1α, IL-6, MIP-1α, MCP-1, and RANTES in mice, and high IL-6 expression correlated with mortality. The infection largely mimicked human disease, but lung pathology lacked hyaline membrane formation. In vitro efficacy against v2163 was shown with known inhihibitors of SARS-CoV replication. In v2163-infected mice, Ampligen™ was fully protective, stinging nettle lectin (UDA) was partially protective, ribavirin was disputable and possibly exacerbated disease, and EP128533 was inactive.

I do so at both global (175 countries) and national (Canada and the USA) scales. The analyses reveal that mean per capita CO(2) emissions are nearly three times higher in countries with net immigration than in countries with net emigration. Those differences project a cumulative migration-induced annual increase in global emissions of approximately 1.7 billion tonnes. For Canada and the United States, the projected total emissions attributable to migration from 2021 to 2030 vary between 0.7 and 0.9 billion tonnes. Although staggering, the annual and total emissions represent a small fraction of current global emissions totalling 36 billion tonnes per annum. Even so, the projected decadal immigration of nearly 4 million humans to Canada, and 10 million to the USA, represent significant additional challenges in reducing CO(2) emissions. The challenges pale in comparison with poor nations that are minor contributors to climate change.

This review examines the emerging role of unconventional T cell subsets, including γδ T cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in human SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some of these T cell subsets have been shown to play protective roles in anti-viral immunity by suppressing viral replication and opsonising virions of SARS-CoV.

Unconventional T cells are already under investigation as cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. We discuss the potential use of these cells as therapeutic agents in the COVID-19 setting. Due to the rapidly evolving situation presented by COVID-19, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of this disease and the mechanisms underlying its immune response.

Residual ozone concentration inside the aerosol chamber was also measured. RSV’s sensitivity resulted in testing its resistance to aerosolization and sampling processes instead of ozone exposure. The results showed that without supplement and with STM, a reduction in influenza A infectivity of four orders of magnitude was obtained with an exposure to 1.70 ± 0.19 ppm of ozone at 76% RH for 80 min. Consequently, ozone could be considered as a virucidal disinfectant for airborne influenza A.

Specifically, the Italian regions are a metapopulation represented by network nodes and the network links are the interactions between those regions. Then, we modify the network-based SIR model in order to take into account the different lockdown measures adopted by the Italian Government in the various phases of the spreading of the COVID-19. Our results indicate that the network-based model better predicts the daily cumulative infected individuals when time-varying lockdown protocols are incorporated in the classical SIR model.","Pizzuti, Clara; Socievole, Annalisa; Prasse, Bastian; Van Mieghem, Piet",Appl Netw Sci,260,1

However, few studies have examined sleep problems, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms among the general adult population during the COVID-19 outbreak, and little is known about coping behaviors. This survey was conducted online in China from February 1st to February 10th, 2020. Quota sampling was used to recruit 2993 Chinese citizens aged ≥18 years old. Mental health problems were assessed with the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Exposure to COVID-19 was measured with questions about residence at outbreak, personal exposure, media exposure, and impact on livelihood. General coping style was measured by the brief Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Respondents were also asked 12 additional questions about COVID-19 specific coping behaviors. Direct exposure to COVID-19 instead of the specific location of (temporary) residence within or outside the epicenter (Wuhan) of the pandemic seems important (standardized beta: 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02–0.09). Less mental health problems were also associated with less intense exposure through the media (standardized beta: −0.07, 95% CI: −0.10–−0.03). Perceived negative impact of the pandemic on livelihood showed a large effect size in predicting mental health problems (standardized beta: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.10–0.19). More use of cognitive and prosocial coping behaviors were associated with less mental health problems (standardized beta: −0.30, 95% CI: −0.34–−0.27). Our study suggests that the mental health consequences of the lockdown impact on livelihood should not be underestimated. Building on cognitive coping behaviors reappraisal or cognitive behavioral treatments may be most promising.","Guo, Jing; Feng, Xing Lin; Wang, Xiao Hua; van IJzendoorn, Marinus H.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,260,6

To overcome this, we evaluated the quantitative effect of homogenisation, centrifugation, filtration, chloroform treatment and random amplification on a mock-virome (containing nine highly diverse viruses) and a bacterial mock-community (containing four faecal bacterial species) using quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing. This resulted in an optimised protocol that was able to recover all viruses present in the mock-virome and strongly alters the ratio of viral versus bacterial and 16S rRNA genetic material in favour of viruses (from 43.2% to 96.7% viral reads and from 47.6% to 0.19% bacterial reads). Furthermore, our study indicated that most of the currently used virome protocols, using small filter pores and/or stringent centrifugation conditions may have largely overlooked large viruses present in viromes. We propose NetoVIR (Novel enrichment technique of VIRomes), which allows for a fast, reproducible and high throughput sample preparation for viral metagenomics studies, introducing minimal bias. This procedure is optimised mainly for faecal samples, but with appropriate concentration steps can also be used for other sample types with lower initial viral loads.","Conceição-Neto, Nádia; Zeller, Mark; Lefrère, Hanne; De Bruyn, Pieter; Beller, Leen; Deboutte, Ward; Yinda, Claude Kwe; Lavigne, Rob; Maes, Piet; Ranst, Marc Van; Heylen, Elisabeth; Matthijnssens, Jelle",Sci Rep,260,20

This study aims to perform a survey of their knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was designed to gather information regarding the COVID-19 related KAP among undergraduates during the home isolation in the outbreak. Subjects were recruited from 10 universities in Shaanxi Province, China. Enrollees voluntarily submitted their answers to a pre-designed questionnaire online. RESULTS: A total of 872 subjects (female, 534; male, 338) were enrolled with ages from 17 to 25 years old. This cohort included 430 medical and 442 non-medical students, 580 freshmen and 292 higher school year students. There were 453 from public schools and 442 from private school, residing in 28 regions and provinces at the time of study. Results showed that appropriate knowledge was acquired by 82.34% subjects; the levels were significantly higher in undergraduates from public universities and medical majors than those from private schools and non-medical majors (p<0.05). 73.81% subjects reported positive attitudes; females showed significantly higher levels of positive attitudes than males (p<0.05). Proactive practice was found in 87.94% subjects. Using a common scoring method, the overall scores for Knowledge, Attitude and Practice were 4.12 ± 0.749 (range: 0 ~ 5), 8.54 ± 1.201 (range: 0 ~ 10), and 8.91 ± 1.431 (range: 0 ~ 10), respectively. There was a positive correlation between attitude and practice (r = 0.319, p < 0.05) in the whole study group. Total KAP score was 21.57 ± 2.291 (range: 0 ~ 25), which was significantly different between gender groups and major groups. CONCLUSIONS: Most undergraduates acquired necessary knowledge, positive attitude and proactive practice in response to COVID-19 outbreak; but their KAP scores significantly varied by gender, major and school types.","Peng, Yaling; Pei, Chenchen; Zheng, Yan; Wang, Juan; Zhang, Kui; Zheng, Zhaohui; Zhu, Ping",BMC Public Health,260,11

Beyond playing a crucial role in cell defence by transactivating cytoprotective genes encoding antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes, Nrf2 is also implicated in a wide network regulating anti-inflammatory response and metabolic reprogramming. Such a broad spectrum of actions renders the factor a key regulator of cell fate and a strategic player in the control of cell transformation and response to viral infections. The Nrf2 protective roles in normal cells account for its anti-tumour and anti-viral functions. However, Nrf2 overstimulation often occurs in tumour cells and a complex correlation of Nrf2 with cancer initiation and progression has been widely described. Therefore, if on one hand, Nrf2 has a dual role in cancer, on the other hand, the factor seems to display a univocal function in preventing inflammation and cytokine storm that occur under viral infections, specifically in coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). In such a variegate context, the present review aims to dissect the roles of Nrf2 in both cancer and COVID-19, two widespread diseases that represent a cause of major concern today. In particular, the review describes the molecular aspects of Nrf2 signalling in both pathological situations and the most recent findings about the advantages of Nrf2 inhibition or activation as possible strategies for cancer and COVID-19 treatment respectively.","Emanuele, Sonia; Celesia, Adriana; D’Anneo, Antonella; Lauricella, Marianna; Carlisi, Daniela; De Blasio, Anna; Giuliano, Michela",Int J Mol Sci,260,18

Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from humans with HIV-1 infection exhibit such activity but vaccine immunogens based on structures containing their epitopes have not been successful for their elicitation. All known broadly neutralizing mAbs (bnmAbs) are immunoglobulin (Ig) Gs (IgGs) and highly somatically hypermutated which could impede their elicitation. Ig Ms (IgMs) are on average significantly less divergent from germline antibodies and are relevant for the development of vaccine immunogens but are underexplored compared to IgGs. Here we describe the identification and characterization of several human IgM-derived mAbs against HIV-1 which were selected from a large phage-displayed naive human antibody library constructed from blood, lymph nodes and spleens of 59 healthy donors. These antibodies bound with high affinity to recombinant envelope glycoproteins (gp140s, Envs) of HIV-1 isolates from different clades. They enhanced or did not neutralize infection by some of the HIV-1 primary isolates using CCR5 as a coreceptor but neutralized all CXCR4 isolates tested although weakly. One of these antibodies with relatively low degree of somatic hypermutation was more extensively characterized. It bound to a highly conserved region partially overlapping with the coreceptor binding site and close to but not overlapping with the CD4 binding site. These results suggest the existence of conserved structures that could direct the immune response to non-neutralizing or even enhancing antibodies which may represent a strategy used by the virus to escape neutralizing immune responses. Further studies will show whether such a strategy plays a role in HIV infection of humans, how important that role could be, and what the mechanisms of infection enhancement are. The newly identified mAbs could be used as reagents to further characterize conserved non-neutralizing, weakly neutralizing or enhancing epitopes and modify or remove them from candidate vaccine immunogens.","Chen, Weizao; Zhu, Zhongyu; Liao, Huaxin; Quinnan, Gerald V.; Broder, Christopher C.; Haynes, Barton F.; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.",Viruses,260,16

The environmental analysis shows that the epidemic severeness significantly affects the electricity and the petroleum demand, both directly and indirectly. The outputs of the model stated that the elasticity of petroleum and electricity demand toward the population of the infected people is −0.1% and −0.65%, respectively. The mentioned results show that pandemic status has a significant impact on energy demand, and also its impacts can be tracked into every corner of human society.","Norouzi, Nima; Zarazua de Rubens, Gerardo; Choubanpishehzafar, Saeideh; Enevoldsen, Peter",Energy Res Soc Sci,260,20

In addition, the virus has been detected in different clinical specimens, suggesting a potential transmission by other routes, including blood transfusion. However, the potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via blood products is still unclear. The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors from South-Eastern Italy. Moreover, in the seropositive donors, we searched for the presence of the virus in nasopharyngeal swabs and in plasma samples. Overall, 1,797 blood donors from the Apulia region were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, using a commercially available assay. Only 18/1,797 donors (1.0%) tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; in none of them SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs and in plasma samples. Our results indicate that most of the blood donors in Apulia remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic; further, none had detectable virus both in nasopharyngeal swabs and in blood samples.

Methods: An IRB approved prospective registry was initiated of all gynecologic oncology patients with COVID-19 infections at a health care system in New York City from March 1 to June 1 2020. Clinical and demographic data was abstracted from the electronic medical record. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with development of an adverse event defined as the composite of death, intubation, or ICU admission. Results: In total, 57 gynecologic cancer patients with documented COVID-19 positivity were identified. The median age of identified patients was 68 years (range 32 - 91years). 29 patients (50.9%) required hospital admission and 28 (49.1%) patients required supplemental oxygen. 17 patients (30%) experienced an adverse event, defined as the composite of death, intubation, or ICU admission. Specifically 7 (12%) were intubated, 13 (23%) were admitted to the ICU, and 16 (27%) patients died from acute complications of COVID-19. All patients who were intubated and/or admitted to the ICU died from COVID-19 complications. Patients with elevated white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and/or elevated prothrombin time (PT) were significantly more likely to experience an adverse event (WBC: 47 vs 12%, p=0.01; ANC: 37 vs 8%, p=0.04; PT: 61 vs 17%, p=0.04). On multivariable analysis, ECOG status of 1 or greater was associated with a 26-fold increase in the odds of an adverse event (OR=26, 95% CI: 2 - 415, p=0.02), and seven or more abnormal lab values was associated with a 305-fold increase in the odds of an adverse event (p=0.007).

OBJECTIVE: We offer a systematic analysis of NASBA design with a view toward expanding its applicability. METHODS: We examine the parameters that effect dimer formations, and we provide a framework for designing NASBA primers that will reduce false-positive results and make NASBA suitable for more POC diagnostic applications. Then we compare three different oligonucleotide sets to examine (1) the inhibitory effect of dimer formations, (2) false positives with poorly designed primers, and (3) the effect of beacon target location during real-time NASBA. The required T7 promoter sequence adversely affects the reaction kinetics, although the common abridged sequence can improve kinetics without sacrificing accuracy. RESULTS: We demonstrate that poorly designed primers undergo real-time exponential amplification in the absence of target RNA, resulting in false positives with a time to half of the peak value (t (1/2)) of 50 min compared to 45 min for true positives. Redesigning the oligonucleotides to avoid inhibitory dimers eliminated false positives and reduced the true positive t (1/2) by 10 min. Finally, we confirm the efficacy of two molecular beacon design schemes and discuss their multiplexing utility in two clinical scenarios.

For this reason, diagnostic tools, patient management and therapeutic approaches have been tested along the way, in the desperate race to break free from the widespread infection and its fatal respiratory complications. Current medical knowledge and research on severe and critical patients’ management and experimental treatments are still evolving, but several protocols on minimizing risk of infection among the general population, patients and healthcare workers have been approved and diffused by International Health Authorities.","Charitos, Ioannis A; Ballini, Andrea; Bottalico, Lucrezia; Cantore, Stefania; Passarelli, Pier Carmine; Inchingolo, Francesco; D'Addona, Antonio; Santacroce, Luigi",World J Clin Cases,260,1

Kuwait reported its first imported cases of COVID-19 on February 24, 2020. Analysis of data from the first three months of community transmission of the COVID-19 outbreak in Kuwait can provide important guidance for decision-making when dealing with future SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave management. The analysis of intervention scenarios can help to evaluate the possible impacts of various outbreak control measures going forward which aim to reduce the effective reproduction number during the initial outbreak wave. Herein we use a modified susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic-infectious-removed (SEAIR) transmission model to estimate the outbreak dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kuwait. We fit case data from the first 96 days in the model to estimate the basic reproduction number and used Google mobility data to refine community contact matrices. The SEAIR modelled scenarios allow for the analysis of various interventions to determine their effectiveness. The model can help inform future pandemic wave management, not only in Kuwait but for other countries as well.","Tyshenko, M. G.; Oraby, T.; Longenecker, J.

Whether infected HCW acquire protective immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. METHODS: In a Norwegian prospective cohort study, we enrolled 607 HCW before and after the first COVID-19 wave. Exposure history, COVID-19–like symptoms, and serum samples were collected. SARS-CoV-2–specific antibodies were characterized by spike-protein IgG/IgM/IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent and live-virus neutralization assays. RESULTS: Spike-specific IgG/IgM/IgA antibodies increased after the first wave in HCW with, but not in HCW without, COVID-19 patient exposure. Thirty-two HCW (5.3%) had spike-specific antibodies (11 seroconverted with ≥4-fold increase, 21 were seropositive at baseline). Neutralizing antibodies were found in 11 HCW that seroconverted, of whom 4 (36.4%) were asymptomatic. Ninety-seven HCW were tested by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during follow-up; 8 were positive (7 seroconverted, 1 had undetectable antibodies). CONCLUSIONS: We found increases in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in infected HCW, especially after COVID-19 patient exposure. Our data show a low number of SARS-CoV-2–seropositive HCW in a low-prevalence setting; however, the proportion of seropositivity was higher than RT-PCR positivity, highlighting the importance of antibody testing.","Trieu, Mai-Chi; Bansal, Amit; Madsen, Anders; Zhou, Fan; Sævik, Marianne; Vahokoski, Juha; Brokstad, Karl Albert; Krammer, Florian; Tøndel, Camilla; Mohn, Kristin G I; Blomberg, Bjørn; Langeland, Nina; Cox, Rebecca J",J Infect Dis,260,1

Due to the novel antigenic properties of this virus, the world population could not develop immunity effectively and this led to the subsequent spread of COVID-19. This caused an unprecedented emergency situation with significant negative effects on health and well-being both on an individual and societal level. Apart from health, economic and social consequences, the impact of this pandemic on mental health is increasingly being reported in the scientific literature. The present review aimed to provide a comprehensive discussion of the possible neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, together with the related underlying molecular pathways. In addition, the present review focused on populations which are at a higher risk of developing psychiatric disturbances due to the COVID-19 pandemic and discussed possible routes of clinical management and therapeutics to minimize the burden associated with psychiatric disorders. Moreover, research findings exploring the prevalence of COVID-19-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms across vulnerable groups, including children, adolescents and COVID-19 survivors are presented, with particular emphasis on those with severe disease who required hospitalization and/or intensive care unit admission. Based on the available literature, the identification of potential determinants associated with PTSD across the different populations is underlined.

Furthermore, though some previous studies have investigated the association of demographic factors such as race with SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk, fewer have correlated exposure risk to surrogates for socioeconomic status such as health insurance coverage. METHODS: We used a highly specific serological assay utilizing the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein to identify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in remnant blood samples collected by the University of North Carolina Health system. We estimated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort with Bayesian regression, as well as the association of critical demographic factors with higher prevalence odds. FINDINGS: Between April 21(st) and October 3(rd) of 2020, a total of 9,624 unique samples were collected from clinical sites in central NC and we observed a seroprevalence increase from 2·9 (1·7, 4·3) to 9·1 (7·2, 11·1) over the study period. Individuals who identified as Latinx were associated with the highest odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 exposure at 7·77 overall (5·20, 12·10). Increased odds were also observed among Black individuals and individuals without public or private health insurance. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggests that for this care-accessing cohort, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was significantly higher than cumulative total cases reported for the study geographical area six months into the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina. The increased odds of seropositivity by ethnoracial grouping as well as health insurance highlights the urgent and ongoing need to address underlying health and social disparities in these populations.","Lopez, Cesar A.; Cunningham, Clark H.; Pugh, Sierra; Brandt, Katerina; Vanna, Usaphea P.; Delacruz, Matthew J.; Guerra, Quique; Goldstein, Samuel Jacob; Hou, Yixuan J.; Gearhart, Margaret; Wiethorn, Christine; Pope, Candace; Amditis, Carolyn; Pruitt, Kathryn; Newberry-Dillon, Cinthia; Schmitz, John; Premkumar, Lakshmanane; Adimora, Adaora A.; Emch, Michael; Boyce, Ross; Aiello, Allison E.; Fosdick, Bailey K.; Larremore, Daniel B.; de Silva, Aravinda M.; Juliano, Jonathan J; Markmann, Alena J.",medRxiv,260,30

With a progressive interpretation of the clinical, molecular, and genomic factors at play in diseases, more effective and personalized medical treatments are anticipated for many disorders. Understanding patient’s metabolomics and genetic make-up in conjunction with clinical data will significantly lead to determining predisposition, diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers and paths ultimately providing optimal and personalized care for diverse, and targeted chronic and acute diseases. In clinical settings, we need to timely model clinical and multi-omics data to find statistical patterns across millions of features to identify underlying biologic pathways, modifiable risk factors, and actionable information that support early detection and prevention of complex disorders, and development of new therapies for better patient care. It is important to calculate quantitative phenotype measurements, evaluate variants in unique genes and interpret using ACMG guidelines, find frequency of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants without disease indicators, and observe autosomal recessive carriers with a phenotype manifestation in metabolome. Next, ensuring security to reconcile noise, we need to build and train machine-learning prognostic models to meaningfully process multisource heterogeneous data to identify high-risk rare variants and make medically relevant predictions. The goal, today, is to facilitate implementation of mainstream precision medicine to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice of medicine, and allow earlier interventions using predictive diagnostics and tailoring better-personalized treatments. We strongly recommend automated implementation of cutting-edge technologies, utilizing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for the multimodal data aggregation, multifactor examination, development of knowledgebase of clinical predictors for decision support, and best strategies for dealing with relevant ethical issues.","Ahmed, Zeeshan",Hum Genomics,260,16

METHODS: Serum/plasma samples of 75 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 320 pre-pandemic serum samples of healthy blood donors were subjected to two IgG and three total antibody SARS-CoV-2-immunoassays. All test setups were automated workflows. RESULTS: Positivity of assays (onset of symptoms > 10 days) ranged between 68.4% and 81.6% (Diasorin 68.4%, Euroimmun 70.3%, Siemens 73.7%, Roche 79.0% and Wantai 81.6%). All examined assays demonstrated high specificity of >99% (Euroimmun, Diasorin: 99.1%, Wantai: 99.4%) but only two reached levels above 99.5% (Roche: 99.7%, Siemens 100%). Interestingly, there was no overlap in false positive results between the assays. The strongest correlation of quantitative results was observed between the Diasorin and Euroimmun IgG tests (r(2) = 0.76). Overall, we observed no difference in the distribution of test results between female and male patients (p-values: 0.18-0.87). A significant difference between severely versus critically ill patients was demonstrated for the Euroimmun, Diasorin, Wantai and Siemens assays (p-values < 0.041). CONCLUSION: All assays showed good clinical performance. Our data confirm that orthogonal test strategies as recommended by the CDC can enhance clinical specificity.

Here we describe a discovery platform that utilizes self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors for the surface display of high-affinity single-chain variable region (scFv) antibody fragments on human cells and lentivirus particles. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Bivalent scFvFc human antibodies were fused in frame with different transmembrane (TM) anchoring moieties to allow efficient high-level expression on human cells and the optimal TM was identified. The addition of an eight amino acid HIV-1 gp41 envelope incorporation motif further increased scFvFc expression on human cells and incorporation into lentiviral particles. Both antibody-displaying human cells and virus particles bound antigen specifically. Sulfation of CDR tyrosine residues, a property recently shown to broaden antibody binding affinity and antigen recognition was also demonstrated. High level scFvFc expression and stable integration was achieved in human cells following transduction with IRES containing bicistronic SIN lentivectors encoding ZsGreen when scFvFc fusion proteins were expressed from the first cassette. Up to 10(6)-fold enrichment of antibody expressing cells was achieved with one round of antigen coupled magnetic bead pre-selection followed by FACS sorting. Finally, the scFvFc displaying human cells could be used directly in functional biological screens with remarkable sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This antibody display platform will complement existing technologies by virtue of providing properties unique to lentiviruses and antibody expression in human cells, which, in turn, may aid the discovery of novel therapeutic human mAbs.","Taube, Ran; Zhu, Quan; Xu, Chen; Diaz-Griffero, Felipe; Sui, Jianhua; Kamau, Erick; Dwyer, Markryan; Aird, Daniel; Marasco, Wayne A.",PLoS One,260,19

The androgen sensitivity model explains why males are more likely to develop severe symptoms while children are ostensibly resistant to infection. Further, the model explains the difference in COVID‐19 mortality rates among different ethnicities. Androgen sensitivity is determined by genetic variants of the androgen receptor. The androgen receptor regulates transcription of the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is required for SARS‐CoV‐2 infectivity. TMPRSS2 primes the Spike protein of the virus, which has two consequences: diminishing viral recognition by neutralizing antibodies and activating SARS‐CoV‐2 for virus‐cell fusion. Genetic variants that have been associated with androgenetic alopecia, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia and polycystic ovary syndrome could be associated with host susceptibility. In addition to theoretical epidemiological and molecular mechanisms, there are reports of high rates of androgenetic alopecia of from hospitalized COVID‐19 patients due to severe symptoms. Androgen sensitivity is a likely determinant of COVID‐19 disease severity. We believe that the evidence presented in this communication warrants the initiation of trials using anti‐androgen agents.","Wambier, Carlos Gustavo; Goren, Andy; Vaño‐Galván, Sergio; Ramos, Paulo Müller; Ossimetha, Angelina; Nau, Gerard; Herrera, Sabina; McCoy, John",Drug Dev Res,260,16

SETTING: This study comprises 91 cases, including 24 cases with anosmia due to SARS-CoV-2, 38 patients with olfactory dysfunction (OD) due to viral infection other than SARS-CoV-2, and a control group of 29 normosmic cases. METHODS: All cases had paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT), and cases with OD had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dedicated to the olfactory nerve. The OC width and volumes were measured on CT, and T2-weighted signal intensity (SI), olfactory bulb volumes, and olfactory sulcus depths were assessed on MRI. RESULTS: This study showed 3 major findings: the right and left OC widths were significantly wider in anosmic patients due to SARS-CoV-2 (group 1) or OD due to non–SARS-CoV-2 viral infection (group 2) when compared to healthy controls. OC volumes were significantly higher in group 1 or 2 than in healthy controls, and T2 SI of OC area was higher in groups 1 and 2 than in healthy controls. There was no significant difference in olfactory bulb volumes and olfactory sulcus depths on MRI among groups 1 and 2.

However, most positive-strand RNA viruses replicate within a modified organelle co-opted from intracellular membranes of the endomembrane system, which shields viral products from cellular innate immune sensors. Targeting innate RNA sensors to the endomembrane system may enhance their ability to sense RNA generated by viruses that use these compartments for replication. Here, we reveal that an isoform of oligoadenylate synthetase 1, OAS1 p46, is prenylated and targeted to the endomembrane system. Membrane localization of OAS1 p46 confers enhanced access to viral replication sites and results in increased antiviral activity against a subset of RNA viruses including flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, our human genetic analysis shows that the OAS1 splice-site SNP responsible for production of the OAS1 p46 isoform correlates with protection from severe COVID-19. This study highlights the importance of endomembrane targeting for the antiviral specificity of OAS1 and suggests that early control of SARS-CoV-2 replication through OAS1 p46 is an important determinant of COVID-19 severity.","Soveg, Frank W; Schwerk, Johannes; Gokhale, Nandan S; Cerosaletti, Karen; Smith, Julian R; Pairo-Castineira, Erola; Kell, Alison M; Forero, Adriana; Zaver, Shivam A; Esser-Nobis, Katharina; Roby, Justin A; Hsiang, Tien-Ying; Ozarkar, Snehal; Clingan, Jonathan M; McAnarney, Eileen T; Stone, Amy EL; Malhotra, Uma; Speake, Cate; Perez, Joseph; Balu, Chiraag; Allenspach, Eric J; Hyde, Jennifer L; Menachery, Vineet D; Sarkar, Saumendra N; Woodward, Joshua J; Stetson, Daniel B; Baillie, John Kenneth; Buckner, Jane H; Gale, Michael; Savan, Ram",eLife (Cambridge),260,1

One serious adverse event was reported, which was found to be unrelated to vaccination. All three vaccine formulations resulted in robust immune responses comparable to a panel of convalescent serum. No significant differences were observed between the 3-g and 6-g Algel-IMDG groups. Neutralizing responses to homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains were detected in all vaccinated individuals. Cell-mediated responses were biased to a Th-1 phenotype. Conclusions BBV152 induced binding and neutralising antibody responses and with the inclusion of the Algel-IMDG adjuvant, this is the first inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been reported to induce a Th1-biased response. Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers were reported with two divergent SARS-CoV-2 strains. BBV152 is stored between 2{degrees}C and 8{degrees}C, which is compatible with all national immunization program cold chain requirements. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for the phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are underway.","Ella, R.; Mohan, K.; Jogdand, H.; Prasad, S.; Reddy, S.; Sarangi, V.

A Narrative Review,16.617228,7.7276173,2021-09-19,"Imprinting of the specific molecular image of a given protein antigen into immunological memory is one of the hallmarks of immunity. A later contact with a related, but different antigen should not trigger the memory response (because the produced antibodies would not be effective). The preferential expansion of cross-reactive antibodies, or T-lymphocytes for that matter, by a related antigen has been termed the original antigenic sin and was first described by Thomas Francis Jr. in 1960. The phenomenon was initially described for influenza virus, but also has been found for dengue and rotavirus. The antibody dependent enhancement observed in feline coronavirus vaccination also may be related to the original antigenic sin. For a full interpretation of the effectivity of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, as well as for the success of vaccination, the role of existing immunological memory against circulating corona viruses is reviewed and analyzed.","Rijkers, Ger T.; van Overveld, Frans J.",,260,16

However, the effect of these individual NPI and vaccination measures across space and time has not been sufficiently explored. By the decay ratio in the suppression of COVID-19 infections, we investigated the performance of different NPIs across waves in 133 countries, and their integration with vaccine rollouts in 63 countries as of 25 March 2021. The most effective NPIs were gathering restrictions (contributing 27.83% in the infection rate reductions), facial coverings (16.79%) and school closures (10.08%) in the first wave, and changed to facial coverings (30.04%), gathering restrictions (17.51%) and international travel restrictions (9.22%) in the second wave. The impact of NPIs had obvious spatiotemporal variations across countries by waves before vaccine rollouts, with facial coverings being one of the most effective measures consistently. Vaccinations had gradually contributed to the suppression of COVID-19 transmission, from 0.71% and 0.86% within 15 days and 30 days since Day 12 after vaccination, to 1.23% as of 25 March 2021, while NPIs still dominated the pandemic mitigation. Our findings have important implications for continued tailoring of integrated NPI or NPI-vaccination strategies against future COVID-19 waves or similar infectious diseases.","Ge, Y.; Zhang, W.; Liu, H.; Ruktanonchai, C.

To date, when deciding between dialysis and conservative care, patients have had to rely on evidence from small observational studies. Clinicians recognize that like is not being compared with like in these studies, and interpret the results differently. Furthermore, support differs considerably between renal units. What patients choose therefore depends on which renal unit they attend. To address this, a programme of work has been underway in the UK. After reports on survival and symptoms from a small number of renal units, a national, mixed-methods study—the Conservative Kidney Management Assessment of Practice Patterns Study—mapped out conservative care practices and attitudes in the UK. This led to the Prepare for Kidney Care study, a randomized controlled trial comparing preparation for dialysis versus preparation for conservative care. Although powered to detect a positivist 0.345 difference in quality-adjusted life years between the two treatments, this trial also takes a realist approach with a range of person-centred secondary outcomes and embedded qualitative research. To understand generalizability, it is nested in an observational cohort study, which is nested in a CKD registry. Challenges to recruitment and retention have been rapidly identified and addressed using an established embedded mixed methods approach—the QuinteT recruitment intervention.

The underlying etiology for arrhythmia in these cases are mostly multifactorial as those patients may suffer from one or more of the following predisposing mechanisms; catecholamine surge, hypoxia, myocarditis, cytokine storm, QTc prolongation, electrolyte disturbance, and pro-arrhythmic drugs usage. Obviously, the risk for arrhythmia and the associated lethal outcome would rise dramatically among patients with preexisting cardiac disease such as myocardial ischemia, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and hereditary arrhythmias. Considering all of these variables, the management strategy of COVID-19 patients should expand from managing a viral infection and related host immune response to include the prevention of predictable causes for arrhythmia. This may necessitate the need to investigate the role of some drugs that modulate the pathway of arrhythmia generation. Of these drugs, we discuss the potential role of adrenergic antagonists, trimetazidine, ranolazine, and the debatable angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors drugs. We also recommend monitoring the level of: unbound free fatty acids, serum electrolytes, troponin, and QTc (even in the absence of apparent pro-arrhythmic drug use) as these may be the only indicators for patients at risk for arrhythmic complications.","Nabeh, Omnia Azmy; Helaly, Maiada Mohamed; Menshawey, Rahma; Menshawey, Esraa; Nasser, Mohammed Mansoor Matooq; Diaa El-deen, Ahmed Mohamed",Egypt Heart J,260,24

Objective: To describe the demographic and public health characteristics of inquiries, trends, and correlation of inquiries with national COVID-19 case reports. We summarize the results of real-time CDC clinician consultation service provided during 11 March to 31 July 2020 to understand the impact and utility of this service by CDC for the COVID-19 pandemic emergency response and for future outbreak responses. Design: Clinicians documented inquiries received including information about the call source, population for which guidance was sought, and a detailed description of the inquiry and resolution. Descriptive analyses were conducted, with a focus on characteristics of callers as well as public health and clinical content of inquiries. Setting: Real-time telephone consultations with CDC Clinicians in Atlanta, GA. Participants: Health care providers and public health professionals who called CDC with COVID-19 related inquiries from throughout the United States. Main Outcome Measures: Characteristics of inquiries including topic of inquiry, inquiry population, resolution, and demographic information. Results: A total of 3154 COVID-19 related telephone inquiries were answered in real-time. More than half (62.0%) of inquiries came from frontline healthcare providers and clinical sites, followed by 14.1% from state and local health departments. The majority of inquiries focused on issues involving healthcare workers (27.7%) and interpretation or application of CDC’s COVID-19 guidance (44%). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a substantial number of inquiries to CDC, with the large majority originating from the frontline clinical and public health workforce. Analysis of inquiries suggests that the ongoing focus on refining COVID-19 guidance documents is warranted, which facilitates bidirectional feedback between the public, medical professionals, and public health authorities.","Wozniczka, Daniel; Demeke, Hanna B.; Thompson-Paul, Angela M.; Ijeoma, Ugonna; Williams, Tonya R.; Taylor, Allan W.; Tan, Kathrine R.; Chevalier, Michelle S.; Agyemang, Elfriede; Dowell, Deborah; Oduyebo, Titilope; Shiferaw, Miriam; Coleman King, Sallyann M.; Minta, Anna A.; Shealy, Katherine; Oliver, Sara E.; McLean, Catherine; Glover, Maleeka; Iskander, John",Int J Environ Res Public Health,260,16

Efficient egress of infectious bronchitis virus (a gamma coronavirus, CoV) requires neutralization of Golgi pH by the envelope (E) protein. This results in reduced rates of cargo traffic and disrupts Golgi morphology, but it protects the spike protein from aberrant proteolysis. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV-1 E protein does not disrupt the Golgi, however. We show here that in transfected cells, the ORF3a protein of SARS CoV-1 disrupts Golgi morphology, cargo trafficking and luminal pH. Unlike the infectious bronchitis virus E protein, these functions of the SARS CoV-1 3a protein appear to require its viroporin activity. Thus, neutralization of acidic compartments may be a universal feature of CoV infection, although different viral proteins and mechanisms may be used to achieve this outcome.","Gonzales, Rex R.; Machamer, Carolyn E.",bioRxiv,260,31

Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are more susceptible to get severe forms of VRI due to their altered lung mechanics, leading to several complications, such as increased hospital stay, longer mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality. This study aimed to identify the frequency of VRI in children with CHD undergoing cardiac surgery, and to compare the major outcomes according to the presence or absence of a VRI. METHODS: This was a longitudinal, observational cohort study. Nasopharyngeal secretion samples were collected pre- and postoperatively for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, from May 2013 to May 2014. Respiratory viruses were detected using CLART Pneumovir®. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were enrolled. We found a VRI preoperatively in 16 children with CHD before surgery (33.3%), and the frequency of new infections was 8.3% (4 patients). However, in this study, in univariate analyses, the two groups did not differ in any of the studied outcomes. In the multivariate regression models, adjusting for age and STAT category, the presence of a VRI did not show a significant effect on the major outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, VRI was frequent in children undergoing open-heart surgery, but the presence of a VRI did not impact on major outcomes in this cohort.","Silva, Thalis Henrique da; Pinho, João Renato Rebello; Silva Junior, Tarcísio José da; Carmona, Fabio",Prog Pediatr Cardiol,260,17

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the recent epidemiological trend of pulmonary TB (PTB) in mainland China based on the national surveillance data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study collected demographic and clinical data of all patients reported in the national Tuberculosis Information Management System of China from January 1, 2005, to November 21, 2016. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. EXPOSURES: Pulmonary TB was defined as bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed TB in the lung parenchyma or the tracheobronchial tree. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Temporal and spatial variation of annual incidence and demographic features of PTB in mainland China. RESULTS: In total, 10 582 903 patients with PTB were reported in mainland China from 2005 to 2016. The median age of patients with PTB was 46 (interquartile range [IQR], 30-61) years, and 28.53% were 60 years or older. Most patients with PTB were male (69.8%) and farmers or herders (70.0%). The mean (SD) incidence of PTB was 66.61 (8.09) per 100 000 population. The annual incidence decreased from 72.95 per 100 000 population in 2005 to 52.18 per 100 000 population in 2016, and the reduction was greater in the eastern and central regions (31.6%; from 69.43 to 47.48 per 100 000 population) than in the western region (21.0%; from 82.06 to 64.82 per 100 000 population). Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (135.03 per 100 000 population), Guizhou Province (115.98 per 100 000 population), and the Tibet Autonomous Region (101.98 per 100 000 population) had the highest mean annual incidences. The median time from onset of illness to diagnosis decreased from 36 (IQR, 16-92) days from 2005 to 2007 to 31 (IQR, 15-63) days in 2008 and later (P < .001) and was longer in the western region than in the eastern and central regions (41 [IQR, 20-91] vs 30 [IQR, 13-61] days; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although this study found that the incidence of PTB in mainland China showed a downward trend from 2005 to 2016, to achieve the World Health Organization 2035 goal, innovative and more efficient prevention and control strategies are needed, particularly among the most susceptible population, that is, farmers and herders in western China.","Jiang, Hui; Liu, Mengyang; Zhang, Yingjie; Yin, Jinfeng; Li, Zhiwei; Zhu, Chendi; Li, Qihuan; Luo, Xiangyu; Ji, Tingting; Zhang, Junjie; Yang, Yang; Wang, Xiaonan; Luo, Yanxia; Tao, Lixin; Zhang, Feng; Liu, Xiangtong; Li, Weimin; Guo, Xiuhua",JAMA Netw Open,260,30

The Blackfeet Tribal Reservation, the northern Montana home of the sovereign Blackfeet Nation, with an estimated population of 10,629 (2), detected the first COVID-19 case in the community on June 16, 2020. Following CDC guidance,* and with free testing widely available, the Indian Health Service and Blackfeet Tribal Health Department began investigating all confirmed cases and their contacts on June 25. The relationship between three community mitigation resolutions passed and enforced by the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council and changes in the daily COVID-19 incidence and in the distributions of new cases was assessed. After the September 28 issuance of a strictly enforced stay-at-home order and adoption of a mask use resolution, COVID-19 incidence in the Blackfeet Tribal Reservation decreased by a factor of 33 from its peak of 6.40 cases per 1,000 residents per day on October 5 to 0.19 on November 7. Other mitigation measures the Blackfeet Tribal Reservation used included closing the east gate of Glacier National Park for the summer tourism season, instituting remote learning for public school students throughout the fall semester, and providing a Thanksgiving meal to every household to reduce trips to grocery stores. CDC has recommended use of routine public health interventions for infectious diseases, including case investigation with prompt isolation, contact tracing, and immediate quarantine after exposure to prevent and control transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (3). Stay-at-home orders, physical distancing, and mask wearing indoors, outdoors when physical distancing is not possible, or when in close contact with infected or exposed persons are also recommended as nonpharmaceutical community mitigation measures (3,4).

However, because most previous studies have assessed satisfaction with one’s life as a whole, we know little about whether specific domains of life satisfaction (e.g., satisfaction with family life, income) might be responsible for longitudinally driving better health and well-being. METHODS: Data were from 13,752 participants in the Health and Retirement Study—a prospective and nationally representative cohort of US adults aged > 50. We evaluated if positive changes in seven individual domains of life satisfaction (between t(0); 2008/2010 and t(1); 2012/2014) were associated with 35 indicators of physical, behavioral, and psychosocial health and well-being (at t(2); 2016/2018). RESULTS: Most domains of life satisfaction were associated with psychological outcomes: satisfaction with family and non-work activities showed the largest associations (sometimes double in magnitude) with subsequent psychological factors, followed by satisfaction with financial situation and income. Further, some domains showed associations with specific physical health outcomes (e.g., mortality, number of chronic conditions, physical functioning limitations), health behaviors (e.g., sleep problems), and social factors (e.g., loneliness). CONCLUSIONS: As countries seek innovative and cost-effective methods of enhancing the health and well-being of our rapidly aging populations, findings from our study suggest that some domains of life satisfaction have a substantially larger influence on health and well-being outcomes than others. Individual domains of life satisfaction might be novel targets for interventions and policies seeking to enhance specific facets of health and well-being.

Multiple mechanisms are believed to contribute to the death of epithelia; however, limited data propose a role for epigenetic modifiers. In this study, we report that a chromatin modulator protein arginine N-methyltransferase 4/coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT4/CARM1) is elevated in human lung tissues with pneumonia and in experimental lung injury models. Here PRMT4 is normally targeted for its degradation by an E3 ubiquitin ligase, SCF(FBXO9), that interacts with PRMT4 via a phosphodegron to ubiquitinate the chromatin modulator at K228 leading to its proteasomal degradation. Bacterial-derived endotoxin reduced levels of SCF(FBXO9) thus increasing PRMT4 cellular concentrations linked to epithelial cell death. Elevated PRMT4 protein caused substantial epithelial cell death via caspase 3-mediated cell death signaling, and depletion of PRMT4 abolished LPS-mediated epithelial cell death both in cellular and murine injury models. These findings implicate a unique molecular interaction between SCF(FBXO9) and PRMT4 and its regulation by endotoxin that impacts the life span of lung epithelia, which may play a key role in the pathobiology of tissue injury observed during critical respiratory illness.","Lai, Yandong; Li, Xiuying; Li, Tiao; Nyunoya, Toru; Chen, Kong; Kitsios, Georgios D.; Nouraie, Seyed Mehdi; Zhang, Yingze; McVerry, Bryan J.; Lee, Janet S.; Mallampalli, Rama K.; Zou, Chunbin",Cell Death Dis,260,16

Therefore, to facilitate comparison of different samples, an external RNA reference was used for normalisation whereby each sample was spiked with the RNA virus, Canine Enteric Coronavirus (CECov), prior to RNA extraction, for comparative purposes. Real-time RT-PCR was carried out with two primer sets designed to amplify either a 156 bp region of the BVDV 5′-UTR or a 280 bp region of the CECov nucleocapsid protein gene. Linearity and efficiency of the assay was established and the method assessed using samples from BVDV-challenged calves. Viral RNA was quantified on days 6 and 14 post-challenge by real-time RT-PCR. Infectious virus isolation by traditional cell culture was negative after day 7. This study demonstrates encouraging results for rapid, sensitive and reliable detection of acute BVDV infection and provides an alternative real-time RT-PCR method for use on whole blood samples or samples where suitable housekeeping genes are not available.","Young, N.J.; Thomas, C.J.; Collins, M.E.; Brownlie, J.",J Virol Methods,260,24

However, fused GFP itself may occasionally affect the expression and/or stability of the targeted membrane protein, leading to both false-positive and false-negative results in expression screening. Furthermore, GFP fusion technology is not well suited for some membrane proteins, depending on their membrane topology. Here, we developed an FSEC assay utilizing nanobody (Nb) technology, named FSEC-Nb, in which targeted membrane proteins are fused to a small peptide tag and recombinantly expressed. The whole-cell extracts are solubilized, mixed with anti-peptide Nb fused to GFP for FSEC analysis. FSEC-Nb enables the evaluation of the expression, monodispersity and thermostability of membrane proteins without the need for purification but does not require direct GFP fusion to targeted proteins. Our results show FSEC-Nb as a powerful tool for expression screening of membrane proteins for structural and functional studies.","Jin, Fei; Shen, Cheng; Wang, Yao; Wang, Mengqi; Sun, Minxuan; Hattori, Motoyuki",Commun Biol,260,29

However, the mechanism of its action on proteins in aqueous solution is not well understood. We have carried out a systematic analysis of the conformation and environment of MPD molecules bound to proteins. We find that the majority of MPD molecules adopt their most stable conformer. They prefer to bind to hydrophobic sites with a distinct preference for leucine side chains. Most MPD binding sites involve amino‐acid residues in helical or β‐sheet structures. MPD binding to proteins is penetrative, leading to displacement of water molecules in grooves and cavities (sometimes ligand‐binding and active sites) on the protein surface. This results in a large reduction of solvent‐accessible area, which can have significant implications for protein stability. The packing of the MPD molecules by the protein is not optimal and usually some other solvent molecules are also bound along with it. Our analysis suggests that MPD is not as strong a denaturant as often suggested. It promotes stabilization of the protein by preferential hydration, which is facilitated by attachment of MPD molecules to the hydrophobic surface.","Anand, Kanchan; Pal, Debnath; Hilgenfeld, Rolf",Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr,260,11

Italy had already witnessed a very fast spread that brought the Government to place the entire country under quarantine on March 11, reaching more than 30,700 fatalities in 2 months. We hypothesized that the pandemic and related compulsory quarantine would lead to an increase of anxiety state and protective behaviors to avoid infections. We aimed to investigate whether protective behaviors might have been enhanced or limited by anxiety and emotional reactions to previous experience of stressful conditions. We collected data from 618 Italian participants, by means of an online survey. Participants were asked to rate their level of worry for the pandemic, and to complete two questionnaires measuring the anxiety level: the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI-Y) and the Pre-traumatic stress reaction checklist (Pre-Cl). Finally, the respondents were also asked to report about their compliance with protective behaviors suggested to avoid the spread of the virus (e.g., washing hands). Results show that respondents with higher levels of worry reported higher levels of anxiety and pre-traumatic reactions, with positive correlations among the three measurements, and that higher frequency of the three protective behaviors were put in place by respondents with higher levels of worry. Moreover, regression analysis showed that worry for COVID-19 was most predicted by age, anxiety levels, and Pre-traumatic stress. These results could be interpreted in an evolutionary framework, in which the level of worry leads persons to become more cautious (protective behaviors) maximizing long-term survival at the cost of short-term dysregulation (anxiety).","Prete, Giulia; Fontanesi, Lilybeth; Porcelli, Piero; Tommasi, Luca",Front Psychol,260,32

In this study, the impact of the social distancing measures on the concentrations of the three main primary air pollutants (PM(10), NO(2) and CO) was analyzed. CO levels showed the most significant reductions (up to 100%) since it is related to light-duty vehicular emissions. NO(2) also showed reductions (9.1%–41.8%) while PM(10) levels were only reduced in the 1st lockdown week. The decrease of pollutants was not directly proportional to the vehicular flux reduction, because it depends on other factors such as the transport of air masses from industrial and rural areas.

In this research paper, we set forward a statistical model called SIR-Poisson that predicts the evolution and the global spread of infectious diseases. The proposed SIR-Poisson model is able to predict the range of the infected cases in a future period. More precisely, it is used to infer the transmission of the COVID-19 in the three Maghreb Central countries (Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco). Using the SIR-Poisson model and based on daily reported disease data, since its emergence until end April 2020, we attempted to predict the future disease period over 60 days. The estimated average number of contacts by an infected individual with others was around 2 for Tunisia and 3 for Algeria and Morocco. Relying on inferred scenarios, although the pandemic situation would tend to decline, it has not ended. From this perspective, the risk of COVID-19 spreading still exists after the deconfinement act. It is necessary, therefore, to carry on the containment until the estimated infected number achieves 0.","Ben Hassen, Hanen; Elaoud, Anis; Ben Salah, Nahla; Masmoudi, Afif",Arab J Sci Eng,260,16

Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has a bad clinical outcome, and some reports emphasized the role of cytokine storm and dysfunctions of multiple organs. However, the etiology of severe COVID-19 has been largely unknown. Similar as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is also thought derived from bat coronaviruses. However, it is not pathogenic for bat at all, because free DNA in cytoplasm or blood cannot bring up violent immune response in bat; but it can produce severe inflammations in human. I hypothesized that the damage induced by free DNA is a reason for severe COVID-19, which can explain many symptoms of this disease, such as cytokine storm, ARDS and muscus plug, acute injuries of heart, liver and kidney, and some special symptoms of COVID-19.

There is, however, no effective antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. Built on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), we extended a recently developed approach, EvoDesign, to design multiple peptide sequences that can competitively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to inhibit the virus from entering human cells. The protocol starts with the construction of a hybrid peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from the interface of the hACE2 protein (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, which is followed by the redesign and refinement simulations of the peptide sequence to optimize its binding affinity to the interface of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The binding experiment analyses showed that the designed peptides exhibited a significantly stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type hACE2 receptor (with -53.35 vs. -46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit scores for the top designed and wild-type peptides, respectively). This study demonstrates a new avenue to utilize computationally designed peptide motifs to treat the COVID-19 disease by blocking the critical spike-RBD and hACE2 interactions.","Huang, Xiaoqiang; Pearce, Robin; Zhang, Yang",Aging (Albany NY),260,22

In Euope and North America, however, their use has been stigmatised for a long time, although this view has radically changed during the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Notwithstanding this, it is still unclear whether face masks worn by COVID-19 carriers may indeed prevent viral transmission and environmental contamination. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical face masks in filtering SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Four male patients with COVID-19 were recruited for the study. Two patients wore a surgical mask for 5 h, while two others did not. The spread of the virus in the environment was evaluated through the approved Allplex 2019-nCoV assay. RESULTS: In the room with the two patients without surgical masks, the swab performed on the headboard and sides of the beds was positive for SARS-CoV-2 contamination. In the other room, where two patients were wearing surgical masks, all of the swabs obtained after 5 h tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study add to the growing body of literature supporting the use of face masks as a measure to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by retaining potentially contagious droplets that can infect other people and/or contaminate surfaces.

Limited antigen presentation skills of CNS cells in comparison to peripheral tissues is because of a total lack of dendritic cells and feeble expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins in neurons and glia. However, research over the past two decades has identified immune effector mechanisms intrinsic to the CNS for immediate tackling, attenuating and clearing of viral infections, with assistance pouring in from peripheral circulation in the form of neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T cells at a later stage. Specialized CNS cells, microglia and astrocytes, were regarded as sole sentinels of the brain for containing a viral onslaught but neurons held little recognition as a potential candidate for protecting itself from the proliferation and pathogenesis of neurotropic viruses. Accumulating evidence however indicates that extracellular insult causes neurons to express immune factors characteristic of lymphoid tissues. This article aims to comprehensively analyze current research on this conditional alteration in the protein expression repertoire of neurons and the role it plays in CNS innate immune response to counter viral infections.","Chakraborty, Swarupa; Nazmi, Arshed; Dutta, Kallol; Basu, Anirban",Neurochem Int,260,8

Its main characteristic is inflammatory mediators and cytokines as well as agglutinating chemokines that injure target cells. Interleukin (IL)-35 is a newly identified IL-12 cytokine family member with structural similarities to other IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27 cytokines but unique immunological functions. How IL-35 functions in ARDS is unclear. The purpose of our study was to determine what role IL-35 played in the development of ARDS. Here we found serum IL-35 concentrations were significantly elevated in patients with ARDS relative to healthy people. Moreover, we established a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide- and cecal ligation and puncture-induced ARDS treated with neutralizing antibodies (anti-IL-35 Ebi3 or anti-IL-35 P35); the results showed that lung injury occurred more often than in untreated models and the inflammatory cytokines CXCL-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, and IL-17A increased significantly after neutralizing antibody treatment in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum. Therefore IL-35 can protect against the development of ARDS. Even more interesting in our study was that we discovered IL-35 expression differed between lung and spleen across different ARDS models, which further demonstrated that the spleen likely has an important role in extrapulmonary ARDS model only, improving the ratio of CD4(+)/CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)(Tregs). Meanwhile in our clinical work, we also found that the concentration of IL-35 and the ratio of CD4(+)/Treg in the serum are higher and the mortality is lower than those with the spleen deficiency in patients with extrapulmonary ARDS. Therefore, IL-35 is protective in ARDS by promoting the ratio of splenic CD4(+)/Tregs in extrapulmonary ARDS, and as such, may be a therapeutic target.","Wang, Chuan-jiang; Zhang, Mu; Wu, Hua; Lin, Shi-hui; Xu, Fang",Int Immunopharmacol,260,16

We aimed to determine factors predicting poor outcomes in hospitalized diabetic patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all adult diabetic patients with radiological or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who hospitalized between 20 February 2020 and 27 April 2020 in Alborz province, Iran. Data on demographic, medical history, and laboratory test at presentation were obtained from electronic medical records. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was self-reported. Comorbidities including cancer, rheumatism, immunodeficiency, or chronic diseases of respiratory, liver, and blood were classified as “other comorbidities” due to low frequency. The assessed poor outcomes were in-hospital mortality, need to ICU care, and receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. Self-reported. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to quantify the predictors of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 in patients with DM.

Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the YHV ORF2 gene encodes a basic protein (pI =9.9) of 146 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 16,325.5Da. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated a predominance of basic (15.1%), acidic (9.6%) and hydrophilic polar (34.3%) residues and a high proportion proline and glycine residues (16.4%). The ORF2 gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a M r =21kDa His6-protein that reacted with YHV nucleoprotein (p20) monoclonal antibody.

Australia has implemented major reforms to expand the provision of subsidised psychological services for individuals with a diagnosed mental disorder. But there are gaps in knowledge about demand for PIs (i.e., use of and perceived need for PIs) across the population. This study uses nationally representative survey data from the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing to analyse demand for PIs. It also provides a method for analysing survey data to estimate demand for PIs when new survey data becomes available, along with suggestions to inform future survey development. METHODS: Nationally representative community survey respondents (n = 8841, 16–85 years) indicated their perceived need for nine types of help for mental health problems in the past 12 months, including three PIs (cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy, and counselling), and whether these needs were unmet, partially met, or fully met. Types of help were grouped as: PIs only; PIs plus other; and other only. Chi-square analyses were used to examine the association between type of intervention, sociodemographic and clinical factors, and type of professional consulted; multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of type of intervention(s) received. RESULTS: 7.9% (95%CI: 7.2–8.6) received PIs. Receipt of PIs was positively associated with higher education and consulting a mental health specialist. Twice as many respondents received PIs plus medication as compared to PIs only (4.2% vs. 2.0%). Almost half (45.4, 95%CI 36.5–54.6) incurred out-of-pocket costs for treatment. The most common reason for partially met need for PIs was cost (24.8, 95%CI 17.2–34.3); for unmet need, it was preference for self-management (33.9, 95%CI 21.2–49.5). Perceived unmet need for PIs only (3.1, 95%CI 2.1–4.6) or PIs plus other interventions (5.2, 95%CI 3.9–6.9%) was lower than for other interventions only (22.8, 95%CI 18.7–27.6). CONCLUSIONS: Continued reforms in Australia means that on-going monitoring of demand for PIs, using nationally representative data, is required. This study provides a baseline for comparison of the long-term effects of these reforms; this comparison may be undertaken using data from the third iteration of Australia’s NSMHWB, due for completion in 2021–22.","Page, Imogen S.; Sparti, Claudia; Santomauro, Damian; Harris, Meredith G.",BMC Health Serv Res,260,28

Interestingly, some recent studies have indicated that pAPN is not a functional receptor for PEDV. To date, there is a lack of a direct evidence for the interaction between pAPN and PEDV S protein in vitro. Here, we prepared pAPN ectodomain and the truncated variants of PEDV S protein in Drosophila S2 cells. These recombinant proteins were homogeneous after purification by metal-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. We then assayed the purified target proteins through immunogenicity tests, PEDV binding interference assays, circular dichroism (CD) measurements, pAPN activity assay and structural determination, demonstrating that they were biologically functional. Finally, we characterized their interactions by gel filtration chromatography, native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses. The results showed that their affinities were too low to form complexes, which suggest that pAPN may be controversial as the genuine receptor for PEDV.

Once an immunological complication like cytokine storm occurs, anti-viral based monotherapy alone is not enough. Additional anti-inflammatory treatment is recommended. It must be noted that anti-inflammatory drugs such as JAK inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, TNF-α inhibitors, colchicine, etc., have been either suggested or are under trials for managing cytokine storm in COVID-19 infections. Natural astaxanthin (ASX) has a clinically proven safety profile and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. There is evidence from preclinical studies that supports its preventive actions against ALI/ARDS. Moreover, ASX has a potent PPARs activity. Therefore, it is plausible to speculate that ASX could be considered as a potential adjunctive supplement. Here, we summarize the mounting evidence where ASX is shown to exert protective effect by regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. We present reports where ASX is shown to prevent against oxidative damage and attenuate exacerbation of the inflammatory responses by regulating signaling pathways like NF-ĸB, NLRP3 and JAK/STAT. These evidences provide a rationale for considering natural astaxanthin as a therapeutic agent against inflammatory cytokine storm and associated risks in COVID-19 infection and this suggestion requires further validation with clinical studies.","Talukdar, Jayanta; Bhadra, Bhaskar; Dattaroy, Tomal; Nagle, Vinod; Dasgupta, Santanu",Biomed Pharmacother,260,16

Surprisingly, the possible differences and similarities in the protein structural conformation between the various human-infecting CoV spike proteins have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we utilized a computational approach to generate models and analyze the seven human-infecting CoV spike proteins, namely: HCoV 229E, HCoV OC43, HCoV NL63, HCoV HKU1, SARS CoV, MERS CoV, and SARS2. Model quality assessment of all CoV models generated, structural superimposition of the whole protein model and selected S1 domains (S1-CTD and S1-NTD), and structural comparison based on RMSD values, Tm scores, and contact mapping were all performed. We found that the structural orientation of S1-CTD is a potential structural feature associated to both the CoV phylogenetic cluster and lineage. Moreover, we observed that spike models in the same phylogenetic cluster or lineage could potentially have similar protein structure. Additionally, we established that there are potentially three distinct S1-CTD orientation (Pattern I, Pattern II, Pattern III) among the human-infecting CoVs. Furthermore, we postulate that human-infecting CoVs in the same phylogenetic cluster may have similar S1-CTD and S1-NTD structural orientation. Taken together, we propose that the SARS2 spike S1-CTD follows a Pattern III orientation which has a higher degree of similarity with SARS1 and some degree of similarity with both OC43 and HKU1 which coincidentally are in the same phylogenetic cluster and lineage, whereas, the SARS2 spike S1-NTD has some degree of similarity among human-infecting CoVs that are either in the same phylogenetic cluster or lineage.","Cueno, Marni E.; Imai, Kenichi",Front Med (Lausanne),260,13

CF services had to rapidly adapt to the changing circumstances and traditional roles were blurred as services were redesigned to try to maintain quality CF care alongside minimising risk of COVID-19. Objective: To examine the impact of COVID-19 on the prescribing practice of CF physiotherapist non-medical prescribers (CFPT-NMPs) in the UK. Method: A bespoke online questionnaire was sent to all members of the ACPCF NMP group in July 2020. Results: 19/27 CFPT-NMPs completed the questionnaire (6 adults, 12 kids and 1 both). A greater proportion of adult CFPT-NMPs (6/6, 100%) than kids (3/12, 25%) or both (0/1, 0%) had been redeployed to non-CF areas. All reported COVID-19 had changed their prescribing practice, with an overall trend towards prescribing outside their CF speciality 5/8 (63%). In adults the trend was towards less frequent prescribing (4/5, 80%) with an increase in the different types of medication prescribed (3/4, 75%);in kids there was an increase in frequency of prescribing (7/10, 70%) but no trend in change of types of medication prescribed. 14/18 (78%) reported a delay or cessation in completing non-urgent drug response assessments (DRAs). The 22% of respondents reporting no delay in DRAs were working in kids. The 11/18 (61%) who had completed DRAs reported large variability within the DRA process, specifically around use of PPE and outcome measures. Conclusion: COVID-19 has significantly impacted the delivery of CF care and CFPT-NMP's prescribing practice. Many DRAs, the gateway to pwCF accessing appropriate inhaled medications, have been delayed. This was more likely in the adult population, highlighting the greater impact COVID-19 has had on adult CF services. COVID-19-specific DRA guidance has subsequently been produced by our ACPCF NMP group, facilitating timely and safe practice nationally.","Brown, C.; Archer, M.; Carson, L.; Collins, N.; Daniels, T.; Gates, A.; Johnstone, Z.; Patel, N.; Rashid, R.; Whitehouse, J.

Furthermore, to enable lab to lab, country to country comparisons we utilised the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin to report neutralisation findings in International Units. These findings demonstrate a significant reduction in the ability of first wave convalescent plasma to neutralise the VOCs. In addition, Patients and HCWs with more severe COVID-19 were found to have higher antibody titres and to neutralise the VOCs more effectively than individuals with milder symptoms. Widespread use of the WHO International Standard by laboratories in different countries will allow for cross-laboratory comparisons, to benchmark and to establish thresholds of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and levels of immunity in different settings and countries.","Cantoni, D.; Mayora-Neto, M.; Nadesalingam, A.; Wells, D.

However, it is now accepted that this family of inhibitors can also affect the activity of cell proteases. Since the replication of many virus species requires the activity of host cell proteases, investigating the effects of PIs on the life cycle of viruses other than HIV would be of interest. Here, the potent inhibition induced by saquinavir and nelfinavir on the replication of both vesicular stomatitis and influenza viruses is described. These are unrelated enveloped RNA viruses infecting target cells upon endocytosis and intracellular fusion. The PI-induced inhibition was apparently a consequence of a block at the level of the fusion between viral envelope and endosomal membranes. These findings would open the way towards the therapeutic use of PIs against enveloped RNA viruses other than HIV.","Federico, Maurizio",Virology,260,20

The implementation of unprecedented public health measures, alongside the augmentation of the treatment capacity for those severely affected by COVID-19, are compromising and limiting the delivery of essential care to people with severe substance use problems and, in some cases, widening extreme social inequities such as poverty and homelessness. This global pandemic is severely challenging current working practices. However, these challenges can provide a unique opportunity for a flexible and innovative learning approach, bringing certain interventions into the spotlight. Harm reduction responses are well-established evidenced approaches in the management of opioid dependence but not so well-known or implemented in relation to alcohol use disorders. In this position paper, we explore the potential for expanding harm reduction approaches during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond as part of substance use treatment services. We will examine alcohol use and related vulnerabilities during COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on substance use services, and the potential philosophical shift in orientation to harm reduction and outline a range of alcohol harm reduction approaches. We discuss relevant aspects of the Structured Preparation for Alcohol Detoxification (SPADe) treatment model, and Managed Alcohol Programs (MAPs), as part of a continuum of harm reduction and abstinence orientated treatment for alcohol use disorders. In conclusion, while COVID-19 has dramatically reduced and limited services, the pandemic has propelled the importance of alcohol harm reduction and created new opportunities for implementation of harm reduction philosophy and approaches, including programs that incorporate the provision of alcohol as medicine as part of the substance use treatment continuum.","Kouimtsidis, Christos; Pauly, Bernadette; Parkes, Tessa; Stockwell, Tim; Baldacchino, Alexander Mario",Front Psychiatry,260,24

SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), was the first emerged virus from this family, followed by MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV or COVID 19), which is newly emerged. Many studies have been conducted on the application of chemical and natural drugs for treating these coronaviruses and they are mostly focused on inhibiting the proteases of viruses or blocking their protein receptors through binding to amino acid residues. Among many substances which are introduced to have an inhibitory effect against coronaviruses through the mentioned pathways, natural components are of specific interest. Secondary and primary metabolites from plants, are considered as potential drugs to have an inhibitory effect on coronaviruses. IC50 value (the concentration in which there is 50% loss in enzyme activity), molecular docking score and binding energy are parameters to understand the ability of metabolites to inhibit the specific virus. In this study we did a review of 154 papers on the effect of plant metabolites on different coronaviruses and data of their IC50 values, molecular docking scores and inhibition percentages are collected in tables.

While the scientific evidence base for many sports and exercise medicine and sports physical therapy interventions is robust, real-world implementation and evolution to scale remains an ongoing challenge. Dissemination and implementation research is important to generate evidence-informed, cost-effective and context-specific strategies for implementation partners and stakeholders to effectively apply and sustain the best research evidence in public health and clinical practice. However, this field of inquiry remains underexplored in sports and exercise medicine and sports physical therapy. Most intervention studies in sports and exercise medicine and sports physical therapy are terminated at the efficacy trial stage without considerations for best practices for translation to community and clinical settings. Lack of context-specific dissemination and implementation strategies to drive the translation of evidence-based interventions results in poor execution of, and attrition from, interventions, and this is associated with suboptimal outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Theory-driven quality research informing the successful dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions is needed to address lingering evidence-to-practice gaps. Dissemination and implementation research completes the final stage in the research-to-practice pipeline. It seeks to close evidence-to-practice gaps, thereby ensuring speedy application of research evidence to achieve desired public health outcomes while making more efficient use of limited resources.

They quickly confirm COVID-19, but weakly rule out infection. Test performance depends on prevalence and testing protocol. Both affect predictive values. OBJECTIVES: - To use original mathematics and visual logistics for interpreting COVID-19 rapid antigen test performance patterns, gauge the influence of prevalence, and evaluate repeated testing. DESIGN: - Mathematica and open access software helped graph relationships, perform recursive computations, and compare performance patterns. PubMed retrieved articles addressing endemic COVID-19. RESULTS: - Tiered sensitivity/specificity comprise: T1) 90%/95%; T2) 95%/97.5%; and T3) 100%/≥99%, respectively. Performance of self- and home antigen tests with Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization peaks in low prevalence. Fall-off in performance appears with increasing prevalence because suboptimal sensitivity creates false negatives. The rate of false omissions limits clinical use because of prevalence boundaries based on tolerance for risk. Mathematical analysis supports testing twice to improve predictive values and extend prevalence boundaries nearly to levels of herd immunity. CONCLUSIONS: - COVID-19 is quickly becoming endemic. Suboptimal sensitivity of rapid antigen tests limits performance in high prevalence. Risk of contagion in packed spaces (e.g., airplanes) might be avoided with dual testing 36 hours apart, allowing time for viral load to increase. Awareness of community prevalence and proof of improved performance with repeated testing will help manage COVID-19 risk, while meeting rapid decision-making needs for highly contagious and new variants (e.g., Delta). New COVID-19 variants call for high quality, low cost, readily accessible, fast, user friendly, and ubiquitous point-of-care testing.","Kost, Gerald J",Arch. pathol. lab. med. (1976),260,5

However, the expression and purification of membrane protein structure is difficult despite tremendous progress. In this study, the 3 D structure is modeled followed by intensive validation and molecular dynamics simulation. The lack of suitable homologous templates (>30% sequence identities) leads us to construct the membrane protein models using template-free modeling (de novo or ab initio) approach with Robetta and trRosetta servers. Comparing with other model structures, it is evident that trRosetta (TM-score: 0.64; TM region RMSD: 2 Å) can provide the best model than Robetta (TM-score: 0.61; TM region RMSD: 3.3 Å) and I-TASSER (TM-score: 0.45; TM region RMSD: 6.5 Å). 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations are performed on the model structures by incorporating membrane environment. Moreover, secondary structure elements and principal component analysis (PCA) have also been performed on MD simulation data. Finally, trRosetta model is utilized for interpretation and visualization of interacting residues during protein-protein interactions. The common interacting residues including Phe103, Arg107, Met109, Trp110, Arg131, and Glu135 in the C-terminal domain of M protein are identified in membrane-spike and membrane-nucleocapsid protein complexes. The active site residues are also predicted for potential drug and peptide binding. Overall, this study might be helpful to design drugs and peptides against the modeled membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2 to accelerate further investigation. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The inhibitory effect of 4-OI and DMF extends to the replication of several other pathogenic viruses including Herpes Simplex Virus-1 and-2, Vaccinia virus, and Zika virus through a type I interferon (IFN)-independent mechanism.

In conclusion, NRF2 agonists 4-OI and DMF induce a distinct IFN-independent antiviral program that is broadly effective in limiting virus replication and in suppressing the pro-inflammatory responses of human pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV2.","Olagnier, David; Farahani, Ensieh; Thyrsted, Jacob; Blay-Cadanet, Julia; Herengt, Angela; Idorn, Manja; Hait, Alon; Hernaez, Bruno; Knudsen, Alice; Iversen, Marie Beck; Schilling, Mirjam; Jørgensen, Sofie E.; Thomsen, Michelle; Reinert, Line S.; Lappe, Michael; Hoang, Huy-Dung; Gilchrist, Victoria H.; Hansen, Anne Louise; Ottosen, Rasmus; Nielsen, Camilla G.; Møller, Charlotte; van der Horst, Demi; Peri, Suraj; Balachandran, Siddharth; Huang, Jinrong; Jakobsen, Martin; Svenningsen, Esben B.; Poulsen, Thomas B.; Bartsch, Lydia; Thielke, Anne L.; Luo, Yonglun; Alain, Tommy; Rehwinkel, Jan; Alcamí, Antonio; Hiscott, John; Mogensen, Trine; Paludan, Søren R.; Holm, Christian K.",Nat Commun,260,24

All patients underwent a CXR at presentation. Follow-up CXR was performed when clinically indicated. Two radiologists in each center reviewed images and classified them as suggestive or not for interstitial pneumonia, recording the presence of ground-glass opacity (GGO), reticular pattern or consolidation and their distribution. Pearson’s χ(2) test for categorical variables and McNemar test (χ(2) for paired data) were performed. Patients mean age 63.3 years, 767 were males (65.5%). The main result is the large proportion of positive CXR in COVID-19 patients. Baseline CXR was positive in 940 patients (80.3%), with significant differences in age and sex distribution between patients with positive and negative CXR. 382 patients underwent a follow-up CXR. The most frequent pattern on baseline CXR was the GGO (66.1%), on follow-up was consolidation (53.4%). The most common distributions were peripheral and middle-lower lung zone. We described key-patterns and their distribution on CXR in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients: GGO was the most frequent finding on baseline CXR, while we found an increase in the proportion of lung consolidation on follow-up CXR. CXR proved to be a reliable tool in our cohort obtaining positive results in 80.3% of the baseline cases.","Vespro, Valentina; Andrisani, Maria Carmela; Fusco, Stefano; Di Meglio, Letizia; Plensich, Guido; Scarabelli, Alice; Stellato, Elvira; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Scudeller, Luigia; Coppola, Andrea; Gori, Andrea; Pesenti, Antonio; Grasselli, Giacomo; Aliberti, Stefano; Blasi, Francesco; Villa, Chiara; Ippolito, Sonia; Pirrò, Barbara; Damiani, Guglielmo; Galli, Massimo; Rizzardini, Giuliano; Catena, Emanuele; Orlandi, Matteo Agostino; Magnani, Sandro; Cipolla, Giuseppe; Ianniello, Andrea Antonio; Petrillo, Mario; Xhepa, Genti; Scamporrino, Antonio; Cazzulani, Alberto; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Intern Emerg Med,260,16

Twenty-one diseased pigs were diagnosed with the PRRS virus (PRRSV) and other 7 virus primers by PCR/RT-PCR in the lung and spleen samples. Enterobacteria were isolated using MacConkey agar from 5 visceral samples of PRRS pigs, and identified by 16S rDNA sequencing. PRRSV was positive in 100% of the lung samples and 81.0% of the spleen samples. Seven diseased pigs were diagnosed with only PRRSV infection (33.3%), 7 pigs with PRRSV and 1 or 2 other viruses (33.3%) and 7 pigs with PRRSV and more than 2 types of other viruses (33.3%). PRRSV was more inclined to co-infect pigs with porcine group A rotavirus (PARV) with the co-infection rate of 52.4% (11/21). Approximately 13 types of bacteria were successfully isolated from lung, spleen, liver, kidney and lymph node samples of different PRRS pigs. Enterobacteria were isolated in 100% of lung, liver and lymph samples from pigs infected with PRRSV alone. However, the isolation rates were significantly decreased in the more than 3 viruses co-infection group. Escherichia coli was the most prevalent bacterium, followed by Morganella, Proteus, Shigella, Salmonella, Klebsiella and Aeromonas. Most of the isolated enterobacteria were opportunistic pathogens.

To stem the tide of this pandemic, there was acceleration of the development, testing and prelicensure approval for emergency use of some COVID-19 vaccine candidates. This led to raised public concern about their safety and efficacy, compounding the challenges of vaccine hesitancy. The onus of managing and administering these vaccines to a sceptical populace when they do become available rests mostly on the shoulders of healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, the vaccine confidence levels of HCWs become critical to the success of vaccination endeavours. This proposed study aims to estimate the level of vaccine confidence and the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among future HCWs and their trainers at a specific university in Cape Town, South Africa, and to identify any vaccination concerns early for targeted intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This proposed study is a cross-sectional survey study. An online questionnaire will be distributed to all current staff and students of the Faculty of Medicine Health Sciences of Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa. No sampling strategy will be employed. The survey questionnaire will consist of demographic questions (consisting of six items) and vaccine confidence questions (comprising six items in Likert scale format). Log binomial models will be employed to identify factors associated with vaccine confidence and intention. The strength of association will be assessed using the OR and its 95% CI. Statistical significance will be defined at a p value <0.05. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained for the study from Stellenbosch University (Human Research Ethics Committee reference number S19/01/014 (PhD)). The results will be shared with relevant health authorities, presented at conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.","Oduwole, Elizabeth O; Mahomed, Hassan; Ayele, Birhanu T; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",BMJ Open,260,8

It begins in the external auditory canal and rapidly progresses through the skull base, leading to osteomyelitis and may result in cranial neuropathy, especially of the facial nerve. Here we describe a rare neurological presentation of MEO in a 65-year old diabetic man, who presented with an 8-month progressing left otitis externa and evolved with ipsilateral proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, blindness, facial palsy, hearing loss and contralateral evolvement of the temporal bone with hearing impairment. He was initially treated with oral ciprofloxacin and after one week was transferred to our tertiary hospital, where antibiotic therapy was switched to meropenem and vancomycin due to the severity of the case and to the hospital’s microbiological profile. The patient underwent left canal wall-up mastoidectomy with insertion of ear ventilation tube bilaterally, with good recovery of right ear hearing capacity, but with no improvements of neurological deficits nor left hearing function. All microbiological tests performed were negative, and this was interpreted as a possible consequence of the early use of antibiotics.

METHODS: The research is planned in a descriptive type. Nurses and midwives working in any health institution in Turkey constituted the population of the research. The questionnaire form of the study was shared on social media tools between 01 and 14 April 2020 and a total of 758 nurses and midwives were included in the study sample. Personal Information Form, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale were used as data collection tools. RESULTS: Participants who attended the study were 56.9% of nurses and 43.1% of midwives. Approximately half of the nurses and midwives (48.8%) participating in our study contacted the patient with suspected COVID-19, and 29.8% provided care to the patient diagnosed with COVID-19. Nurses and midwives were scored 52.75 ± 9.80 for State Anxiety, 44.87 ± 7.92 for Trait Anxiety Inventory and 35.16 ± 9.42 for Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale. It has been determined that 54.5% of nurses and midwives have been making their lives worse since the outbreak started, 62.4% had difficulties in dealing with the uncertain situation in the outbreak, 42.6% wanted psychological support and 11.8% had alienated from their profession. It was determined that there was a difference between scale scores and difficulties in work, family and private life due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: As a result, it is seen that the midwives and nurses in our country have high psychological effects due to the COVID-19 outbreak.","Aksoy, Yasemin Erkal; Koçak, Vesile",Arch Psychiatr Nurs,260,3

The FDA has granted an emergency use authorization for the rheumatoid arthritis treatment drug, baricitinib (Olumiant), for the treatment of COVID-19 in some cases. For this reason, investigators have paid considerable attention to the association between commonly used drugs and the outcome of patients with COVID-19. Aspirin and ibuprofen have been reported to reduce the mortality rate. Omeprazole can increase mortality. In addition, some studies have demonstrated that famotidine diminishes mortality, while others have indicated that famotidine leads to a poorer prognosis. The present study used UK Biobank (UKB) data to assess the association of commonly used drugs with COVID-19 mortality. Data processing was performed on Minerva, a Linux mainframe with Centos 7.6. The UK Biobank Data Parser (ukbb_parser) was used, a python-based package that allows easy interfacing with the large UK Biobank dataset. The results revealed that aspirin and omeprazole were associated with an elevated mortality rate. Ibuprofen-related mortality was lower than laxative-related mortality. Aspirin users were also significantly older than other subjects. The association with mortality of cholesterol-lowering medications, blood pressure-lowering medications, hormone replacement and oral contraceptives in 134 female subjects revealed insignificant variability. The association of nutritional supplements in 238 subjects with mortality indicated that variability was insignificant. The lower mortality linked to the supplementation of vitamin D and vitamin B, presumably B complex, has been previously observed. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that although some of the associations described among drugs and COVID-19 are not novel, the utility of a new source, UKB, may prove to be useful in further examining these associations.","LEHRER, STEVEN; RHEINSTEIN, PETER H.",Int J Funct Nutr,260,24

There seems to be no limit to the ability to raise antibodies to everything. (ii) once stimulated, B-cells can perfect their antibodies through affinity maturation to complement every nook and cranny of the epitope and (iii) that the pathogen remains genetically stable and does not change to any great extent. Thus, antibodies produced against the vaccine and subsequent boosts recognize the viral virulent field isolates in future encounters and effectively knock them out. However, some vaccine targets, such as flu virus and HIV, are extremely genetically dynamic. The rapid genetic drift of these viruses renders them moving targets which assist in their ability to evade immune surveillance. Here we postulate that in the case of hyper-variable pathogens the B-cell response actually might be “too good”. We propose that restricting B-cell activities may prove effective in counteracting the genetic diversity of variant viruses such as flu and HIV. We suggest two levels of “B-cell restriction”: (i) to focus the B-cell response exclusively towards neutralizing epitopes by creating epitope-based immunogens; (ii) to restrict affinity maturation of B-cells to prevent the production of overly optimized exquisitely specific antibodies. Together, these “B-cell restrictions” provide a new modality for vaccine design.","Gershoni, Jonathan M.",Hum Vaccin Immunother,260,16

The study focuses on understanding population specific variations attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions particularly in USA. Rigorous phylogenomic network analysis of complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes (245) inferred five central clades named a (ancestral), b, c, d and e (subtype e1 & e2). The clade d & e2 were found exclusively comprising of USA. Clades were distinguished by 10 co-mutational combinations in Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2 and Nsp6. Our analysis revealed that only 67.46% of SNP mutations were at amino acid level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase protein stability in 238 strains except 6 strains which were marked as ancestral type; whereas co-mutation (P409L & Y446C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes from USA highlighting its 100% co-occurrence. Docking highlighted mutation (D614G) caused reduction in binding of Spike proteins with ACE2, but it also showed better interaction with TMPRSS2 receptor contributing to high transmissibility among USA strains. We also found host proteins, MYO5A, MYO5B, MYO5C had maximum interaction with viral proteins (N, S, M). Thus, blocking the internalization pathway by inhibiting MYO5 proteins which could be an effective target for COVID-19 treatment. The functional annotations of the HPI network were found to be closely associated with hypoxia and thrombotic conditions confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection. We also screened CpG islands in Nsp1 & N conferring ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and trigger ZAP activity inside host cell. Importance In the current study we presented a global view of mutational pattern observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. This provided a who-infect-whom geographical model since the early pandemic. This is hitherto the most comprehensive comparative genomics analysis of full-length genomes for co-mutations at different geographical regions specially in USA strains. Compositional structural biology results suggested that mutations have balance of contrary forces effect on pathogenicity suggesting only few mutations to effective at translation level but not all. Novel HPI analysis and CpG predictions elucidates the proof of concept of hypoxia and thrombotic conditions in several patients. Thus, the current study focuses the understanding of population specific variations attributing high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in specific geographical regions which may eventually be vital for the most severely affected countries and regions for sharp development of custom-made vindication strategies.","Gupta, Vipin; Haider, Shaiza; Verma, Mansi; Singhvi, Nirjara; Ponnusamy, Kalaiarasan; Malik, Md.

SETTING: The Western Cape province of South Africa. METHODS: We administered an online survey, with closed and open-ended questions, to 83 Stellenbosch University postgraduate PC nursing students and alumni working in the Western Cape, between 03 July and 01 September 2020. RESULTS: The results indicated that 43.3% of participants were confident about the infection, prevention, and control (IPC) training they received and 56.7% felt prepared to provide direct care to suspected cases of COVID-19. Primary care nurses were more comfortable to triage (78.3%) than to manage persons with COVID-19 (42.2%), indicating that they may not be functioning to the full capacity of their education and training. Adequate infrastructure was reported by less than a third of the participants (30.1%) and 59.1% reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) was always available. Primary care nurses needed support in coping with stress (57.8%) although few (14.5%) reported access to mental health services. CONCLUSION: Primary care nurses were not prepared optimally for the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges included adequate training, infrastructure, the availability of personal protective equipment, COVID-19 testing of health care workers and management support.

Guidelines often require 2 years or more to develop, but certain circumstances necessitate the development of rapid guidelines (RGs) in a short period of time. Upholding methodological rigor while meeting the reduced development timeframe presents a challenge for developing RGs. Our objective was to review current practices and standards for the development of RGs. This is the first of a series of three articles addressing methodological issues around RGs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic survey of methods manuals and published RGs to identify reasons for the development of RGs. Data sources included existing guideline manuals, published RGs, Trip Medical Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE and communication with guideline developers until February 2018. RESULTS: We identified 46 guidelines that used a shortened timeframe for their development. Nomenclature describing RGs varied across organisations, wherein the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention produced ‘Interim Guidelines’, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom developed ‘Short Clinical Guidelines’, and WHO provided ‘Rapid Advice’. The rationale for RGs included response to emergencies, rapid increases in cases of a condition or disease severity, or new evidence regarding treatment. In general, the methods to assess the quality of evidence, the consensus process and the management of the conflict of interest were not always clear. While we identified another 11 RGs from other institutions, there was no reference to timeframe and reasons for conducting a RG. The three organisations mentioned above provide guidance for the development of RGs. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of standardised nomenclature and definitions regarding RGs and there is inconsistency in the methods described in manuals and in RG. It is therefore important that all RGs provide a detailed and transparent description of their methods in order for readers and end-users to be able to assess their quality and validate their findings.

We employed Multilevel Linear Modeling (MLM) for the three longitudinal analyses in this study to model determinants of reduction in daily trips to grocery stores, parks, and transit stations; using travel data from Google and accounting for the hierarchical (two-level) structure of the data. We found that the challenges of practicing social distancing in compact areas are not related to minimizing essential trips. Quite the opposite, residents of compact areas have significantly higher reduction in trips to essential destinations such as grocery stores/pharmacies, and transit stations. However, residents of compact counties have significantly lower reduction in their trips to parks possibly due to the smaller homes, lack of private yards, and the higher level of anxiety amid the pandemic. This study offers a number of practical implications and directions for future research.","Hamidi, Shima; Zandiatashbar, Ahoura",Landsc Urban Plan,260,1

Many essential oils are found to have proconvulsant effects. Here we report a small case series of 3 adults with eseential oil‐related status epilepticus. METHODS: This was an observational study conducted in a tertiary care hospital in south India from January 2018 to December 2019. We collected the demographic, clinical, and imaging features of all cases of status epilepticus resulting from exposure to essential oils. Cases of status epilepticus secondary to all other causes were excluded. RESULTS: There were 3 young adults with essential oil‐related status epilepticus. Two had de novo generalized tonic–clonic status epilepticus, and 1 with posttraumatic occipital lobe epilepsy had focal‐impaired awareness status epilepticus. The first 2 cases presented with histories of ingestion of eucalyptus oil. The third case had focal‐impaired awareness status epilepticus after topical application of various balms containing eucalyptus and camphor. CONCLUSIONS: Proconvulsant essential oils of eucalyptus and camphor can cause both generalized and focal status epilepticus. Physicians dealing with patients of status epilepticus should enquire about the exposure to proconvulsant essential oils.","Mathew, Thomas; John, Saji K.; Kamath, Vikram; Kumar R, Shiva; Jadav, Rakesh; Shaji, Asha; Nadig, Raghunandan; Sarma, Gosala Raja Kukkuta; Parry, Gareth J.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,260,1

Degradation of pericancerous extracellular matrix leading to cancer cell invasion by matrix metalloproteases is well known evidence. On the other hand, several cell-surface proteases, including type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), also induce progression through activation of growth factors, protease activating receptors and other proteases. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) known as a multifunctional growth factor that upregulates cancer cell motility, invasiveness, proliferative, and anti-apoptotic activities through phosphorylation of MET (a specific receptor of HGF). HGF secreted as inactive zymogen (pro-HGF) from cancer associated stromal fibroblasts, and the proteolytic activation by several TTSPs including matriptase and hepsin is required. The activation is strictly regulated by HGF activator inhibitors (HAIs) in physiological condition. However, downregulation is frequently observed in cancers. Indeed, overactivation of MET by upregulation of matriptase and hepsin accompanied by the downregulation of HAIs in urological cancers (prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and bladder cancer) are also reported, a phenomenon observed in cancer cells with malignant phenotype, and correlated with poor prognosis. In this review, we summarized current reports focusing on TTSPs, HAIs, and MET signaling axis in urological cancers.","Mukai, Shoichiro; Yamasaki, Koji; Fujii, Masato; Nagai, Takahiro; Terada, Naoki; Kataoka, Hiroaki; Kamoto, Toshiyuki",Int J Mol Sci,260,1

With the increasing number of hospitalizations, medical and nursing personnel resources were soon inadequate. As a consequence, medical volunteers became a key human resource and young medical residents in any specialty were hired on a voluntary basis to contribute to take care of patients with COVID-19. This study reports on the lived experience of residents in child neuropsychiatry who volunteered in Italian hotspot COVID-19-designated hospitals during the epidemic outbreak. METHODS: A phenomenological, qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions was used to obtain in-depth narratives of the experience of residents in child neuropsychiatry volunteering in North Italy COVID-19-designated hospitals. All residents (n = 8) participated in the study. Interviews were conducted by an expert researcher trained in qualitative methods. Data analysis was performed by independent coders. RESULTS: Five core themes could be identified from the interviews: acting as mediators on two fronts, facing the shock of COVID-19 reality, capitalizing from specialty education, growing as persons and professionals, and humanizing medical care. CONCLUSIONS: This study is unique in providing an in-depth understanding of the experience of young residents in child neuropsychiatry volunteering in general hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy. The findings suggest that this experience may be highly beneficial for both the residents and the hospital quality of care. Insights for an accurate planning of residents’ engagement in future healthcare emergencies are provided.","Parravicini, Stefano; Provenzi, Livio; Barello, Serena; Nania, Tiziana; Grumi, Serena; Rinaldi, Elisa; Orcesi, Simona; Borgatti, Renato",Acad Psychiatry,260,24

HCFMUSP has been converted into a reference center for coronavirus disease 2019. The Division of Plastic Surgery postponed non-essential surgeries and outpatient consultations, accomplishing new guidelines (ANG) of national and international organizations. Even with these challenges arising from the pandemic, alternatives were considered to maintain institutional characteristics. This study aims to analyze this new scenario and the impact on patients’ assistance and Plastic Surgery residents training. METHODS: Total number of surgeries, type of procedures, and outpatient consultations in 2020, before (pre-ANG) and after (post-ANG) ANG, were compared with the same period in 2019 (2019-pre and 2020-post). RESULTS: A marked reduction in the total number of surgeries and outpatient consultations was observed in the post-ANG period. In the post-ANG period, 267 operations were performed (26.7 ± 20.3/week), while in the 2019-post period, 1036 surgeries were performed (103.6 ± 9.7/week) (p = 0.0002). Similarly, 1571 consultations were conducted in the post-ANG period (157.1 ± 93.6/week), while in the 2019-post period, 3907 were performed (390.7 ± 43.1/week) (p = 0.0003). However, in the post-ANG period, an increase in the proportion of reconstructive compared with aesthetic surgery was observed. The maintenance of highly complex procedures such as microsurgical transplants was also identified. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant profile of reconstructive surgeries at the Division of Plastic Surgery allowed the continuity of procedures at all technical complexity levels, patient care maintenance, and Plastic Surgery residents training.

Due to the absence of effective treatment or biomedical prevention, understanding potential post infection immunity has important implications for epidemiologic assessments. For this reason, increasing number of in vitro diagnostic companies are developing serological assays to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, but most of them lack the validation by third parties in relation to their quality, limiting their usefulness. We submitted to serological screening by two different immunochromatographic (IC) rapid testing for detection of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2, 151 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic healthcare workers previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in order to evaluate the performance of rapid assays. Results showed discrepancies between molecular and IC results, and an inconsistency of immunoglobulins positivity patterns when compared to ELISA/CLIA results, highlighting the absolute necessity of assays performance validation before their marketing and use, in order to avoid errors in the results evaluation at both clinical and epidemiological level.","Bartolini, A.; Scapaticci, M.; Bioli, M.; Lazzarotto, T.; Re, M.

Early symptoms of the virus include trouble breathing, fever and fatigue and over 60% of people experience a dry cough. Due to the devastating impact of COVID-19 and the tragic loss of lives, it is of the utmost urgency to develop methods for the early detection of the disease that may help limit its spread as well as aid in the development of targeted solutions. Coughs and other vocal sounds contain pulmonary health information that can be used for diagnostic purposes, and recent studies in chaotic dynamics have shown that nonlinear phenomena exist in vocal signals. The present work investigates the use of symbolic recurrence quantification measures with MFCC features for the automatic detection of COVID-19 in cough sounds of healthy and sick individuals. Our performance evaluation reveals that our symbolic dynamics measures capture the complex dynamics in the vocal sounds and are highly effective at discriminating sick and healthy coughs. We apply our method to sustained vowel ’ah’ recordings, and show that our model is robust for the detection of the disease in sustained vowel utterances as well. Furthermore, we introduce a robust novel method of informative undersampling using information rate to deal with the imbalance in our dataset, due to the unavailability of an equal number of sick and healthy recordings. The proposed model achieves a mean classification performance of 97% and 99%, and a mean [Formula: see text] -score of 91% and 89% after optimization, for coughs and sustained vowels, respectively.","Mouawad, Pauline; Dubnov, Tammuz; Dubnov, Shlomo",SN Comput Sci,260,1

Methods: This was a retrospective observational study. The study population was selected from children with respiratory diseases who attended Xiamen Children's Hospital from January 1, 2018 to January 31, 2021. All children were screened for influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The changes in respiratory virus detection rates before and after the SARS-CoV-2 intervention were analyzed using an interrupted time-series model. Polynomial curve fitting was also used to predict future short-term trends in respiratory virus detection. Results: A total of 56,859 children were seen at Xiamen Children's Hospital from January 1, 2018 to Jan 31, 2021, of which 32,120 were tested for respiratory viruses via pharyngeal swabs. The overall positive detection rates of the four respiratory viral infections decreased significantly (P = 0.0017) after the implementation of the quarantine and school suspension measures in January 2020. Among them, the detection rate of RSV decreased most significantly (P = 0.008), and although there was no statistically significant difference in the detection rates of the influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus, a downward trend in the graph was observed. The positive detection rates of RSV in the 0–1-, 1–3-, and 3–7-year-old groups all decreased significantly (P = 0.035, 0.016, and 0.038, respectively). The change in the positive detection rate of RSV was relatively stable in the 7–18-year-old group. A total of 10,496 samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and no positive cases were reported. Conclusions: The combination of preventive and control measures for COVID-19 reduced the detection rate of four common respiratory viruses, with the greatest impact on RSV. If prevention and control measures continue to be maintained, the overall detection rate or absolute number of detections for the four respiratory viruses will remain low in the short term. However, this trend is likely to vary with the changes in measures.","Wang, Jinhui; Xiao, Tiantian; Xiao, Feifan; Hong, Shaoxian; Wang, Shunqin; Lin, Jiancheng; Li, Yong; Wang, Xiaochuan; Yan, Kai; Zhuang, Deyi",Front Pediatr,260,20
