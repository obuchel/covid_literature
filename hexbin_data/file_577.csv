To our knowledge, despite promising studies analyzing smartwatch battery data, there has been little research that has analyzed the battery usage of a diverse set of smartwatches in a real-world setting. To address this challenge, this paper utilizes a smartwatch dataset collected from 832 real-world users, including different smartwatch brands and geographic locations. First, we employ clustering to identify common patterns of smartwatch battery utilization; second, we introduce a transparent low-parameter convolutional neural network model, which allows us to identify the latent patterns of smartwatch battery utilization. Our model converts the battery consumption rate into a binary classification problem; i.e., low and high consumption. Our model has 85.3% accuracy in predicting high battery discharge events, outperforming other machine learning algorithms that have been used in state-of-the-art research. Besides this, it can be used to extract information from filters of our deep learning model, based on learned filters of the feature extractor, which is impossible for other models. Third, we introduce an indexing method that includes a longitudinal study to quantify smartwatch battery quality changes over time. Our novel findings can assist device manufacturers, vendors and application developers, as well as end-users, to improve smartwatch battery utilization.","Homayounfar, Morteza; Malekijoo, Amirhossein; Visuri, Aku; Dobbins, Chelsea; Peltonen, Ella; Pinsky, Eugene; Teymourian, Kia; Rawassizadeh, Reza",Sensors (Basel),577,1

The association between obesity and a wide range of viruses was assessed using VirScan, a pan-viral serological profiling tool. Serum specimens from 457 Qatari adults (lean = 184; obese = 273) and 231 Qatari children (lean = 111; obese = 120) were analyzed by VirScan. Associations with obesity were determined by odds ratio (OR) and Fisher’s test (p values), and by multivariate regression analysis to adjust for age and gender. Although there was no association of viral infections with obesity in the pediatric population, a nominal association of obesity with seropositivity to members of the Herpesviridae family is observed for the adult population (OR = 1.5–3.3; p < 0.05). After adjusting p values for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni correction) the odds of being obese is significantly higher in herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) seropositive Qatari adults (OR = 3.3; 95% CI 2.15–4.99; p = 2.787E − 08). By VirScan, the sero-prevalence of HSV1 is 81.3% and 57.1% among Qatari obese and lean adult populations, respectively. Higher prevalence of antibodies against several peptide epitopes of HSV-1/2 is positively associated with obesity (OR = 2.35–3.82; p ≤ 3.981E − 05). By multivariate regression analysis, HSV-1 was independently associated with obesity irrespective of age and gender. Our results suggest that obesity among Qataris may be associated with a higher prevalence of herpesvirus infections, in particular HSV-1. Furthermore, the high prevalence of antibodies against peptide antigens specific to HSV-1 and -2 in the obese population suggests that these viral peptides may play a role in adipogenesis. Further studies with these candidate peptides in cell culture or animal models may confirm their adipogenic roles.","Hasan, Mohammad Rubayet; Rahman, Mahbuba; Khan, Taushif; Saeed, Amira; Sundararaju, Sathyavathi; Flores, Annaliza; Hawken, Phillip; Rawat, Arun; Elkum, Naser; Hussain, Khalid; Tan, Rusung; Tang, Patrick; Marr, Nico",Sci Rep,577,1

The mismatch between the ability to generate large data sets and the computing skill to analyze them is arguably the most striking within the life sciences. The Digital Image and Vision Applications in Science (DIVAS) project describes a scaffolded series of interventions implemented over the span of a year to build the coding and computing skill of undergraduate students majoring primarily in the natural sciences. The program is designed as a community of practice, providing support within a network of learners. The program focus, images as data, provides a compelling ‘hook’ for participating scholars. Scholars begin the program with a one-credit spring semester seminar where they are exposed to image analysis. The program continues in the summer with a one-week, intensive Python and image processing workshop. From there, scholars tackle image analysis problems using a pair programming approach and can finish the summer with independent research. Finally, scholars participate in a follow-up seminar the subsequent spring and help onramp the next cohort of incoming scholars. We observed promising growth in participant self-efficacy in computing that was maintained throughout the project as well as significant growth in key computational skills. DIVAS program funding was able to support seventeen DIVAS over three years, with 76% of DIVAS scholars identifying as women and 14% of scholars identifying as members of an underrepresented minority group. Most scholars (82%) entered the program as first year students, with 94% of DIVAS scholars retained for the duration of the program and 100% of scholars remaining a STEM major one year after completing the program. The outcomes of the DIVAS project support the efficacy of building computational skill through repeated exposure of scholars to relevant applications over an extended period within a community of practice.","Durham Brooks, Tessa; Burks, Raychelle; Doyle, Erin; Meysenburg, Mark; Frey, Tim",PLoS One,577,22

One of the risk factors for HF is cardiac hypertrophy (CH), which is frequently accompanied by cardiac fibrosis (CF). CH and CF are controlled by master regulators mTORC1 and TGF‐β, respectively. Type‐2‐phosphatidylinositol‐5‐phosphate‐4‐kinase‐gamma (Pip4k2c) is a known mTORC1 regulator. It is shown that Pip4k2c is significantly downregulated in the hearts of CH and HF patients as compared to non‐injured hearts. The role of Pip4k2c in the heart during development and disease is unknown. It is shown that deleting Pip4k2c does not affect normal embryonic cardiac development; however, three weeks after TAC, adult Pip4k2c(−/−) mice has higher rates of CH, CF, and sudden death than wild‐type mice. In a gain‐of‐function study using a TAC mouse model, Pip4k2c is transiently upregulated using a modified mRNA (modRNA) gene delivery platform, which significantly improve heart function, reverse CH and CF, and lead to increased survival. Mechanistically, it is shown that Pip4k2c inhibits TGFβ1 via its N‐terminal motif, Pip5k1α, phospho‐AKT 1/2/3, and phospho‐Smad3. In sum, loss‐and‐gain‐of‐function studies in a TAC mouse model are used to identify Pip4k2c as a potential therapeutic target for CF, CH, and HF, for which modRNA is a highly translatable gene therapy approach.","Magadum, Ajit; Singh, Neha; Kurian, Ann Anu; Sharkar, Mohammad Tofael Kabir; Sultana, Nishat; Chepurko, Elena; Kaur, Keerat; Żak, Magdalena M.; Hadas, Yoav; Lebeche, Djamel; Sahoo, Susmita; Hajjar, Roger; Zangi, Lior",Adv Sci (Weinh),577,1

Multimorbidity is also becoming more common in this population as more people live longer with breast cancer and experience late effects of cancer treatment. Breast cancer survivors have heightened risk of depression, but to what extent multimorbidity affects the mental health of this population is less clear. This study aims to investigate the association between multimorbidity and depression among women living with and beyond breast cancer in the UK Biobank cohort. METHODS: Data from UK Biobank (recruitment during 2006 to 2010, aged 40–70 years) were used to identify 8438 women with a previous diagnosis of breast cancer via linked cancer registries in England, Scotland and Wales. The lifetime number of chronic conditions was self-reported and multimorbidity defined as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5+. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) was used to define participants that were likely to have depression based on their symptom reporting at baseline. Logistic regression models were used to analyse the associations between multimorbidity and depression, accounting for a number of potential sociodemographic confounding variables (including age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, education level and marital status) and characteristics related to the cancer (number of years since diagnosis and recurrence/secondary cancer). RESULTS: Multimorbidity was common among breast cancer survivors, with 32.9% of women experiencing one and 30.1% experiencing two or more chronic health conditions. Hypertension (25.8%), painful conditions (18.3%), and asthma (11.6%) were the three most common co-morbid conditions. 5.3% of participants had current depression. A strong, dose-response relationship was found between multimorbidity and the likelihood of depression (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.56–2.79 for two conditions and OR = 6.06, 95% CI: 3.63–10.14 for five or more conditions). CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity and depression were strongly associated among female UK Biobank participants with a previous breast cancer diagnosis. This association became increasingly pronounced as the number of chronic comorbid conditions increased. As more people survive cancer for longer, increasing recognition and support for multimorbidity and its impact on mental health is needed.

Mast cells are both sensors and effectors in the interaction between the nervous and immune systems. As first responders to stress, mast cells can initiate, amplify and prolong neuroimmune responses upon activation. Corticotropin-releasing hormone plays a pivotal role in triggering stress responses and related diseases by acting on its receptors in mast cells. Corticotropin-releasing hormone can stimulate mast cell activation, influence the activation of immune cells by peripheral nerves and modulate neuroimmune interactions. The latest evidence shows that the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone induces the degranulation of mast cells under stress conditions, leading to disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which plays an important role in neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent studies suggest that stress increases intestinal permeability and disrupts the blood-brain barrier through corticotropin-releasing hormone-mediated activation of mast cells, providing new insight into the complex interplay between the brain and gastrointestinal tract. The neuroimmune target of mast cells is the site at which the corticotropin-releasing hormone directly participates in the inflammatory responses of nerve terminals. In this review, we focus on the neuroimmune connections between corticotropin-releasing hormone and mast cells, with the aim of providing novel potential therapeutic targets for inflammatory, autoimmune and nervous system diseases.","Bhuiyan, Piplu; Wang, Yi-Wei; Sha, Huan-Huan; Dong, Hong-Quan; Qian, Yan-Ning",Neural Regen Res,577,17

The WHO has listed S. aureus as one of the ESKAPE pathogens requiring urgent research and development efforts to fight against it. Yet there is a major layback in the advancement of effective vaccines against this multidrug-resistant pathogen. SdrD and SdrE proteins are attractive immunogen candidates as they are conserved among all the strains and contribute specifically to bacterial adherence to the host cells. Furthermore, these proteins are predicted to be highly antigenic and essential for pathogen survival. Therefore, in this study, using the immunoinformatics approach, a novel vaccine candidate was constructed using highly immunogenic conserved T-cell and B-cell epitopes along with specific linkers, adjuvants, and consequently modeled for docking with human Toll-like receptor 2. Additionally, physicochemical properties, secondary structure, disulphide engineering, and population coverage analysis were also analyzed for the vaccine. The constructed vaccine showed good results of worldwide population coverage and a promising immune response. For evaluation of the stability of the vaccine-TLR-2 docked complex, a molecular dynamics simulation was performed. The constructed vaccine was subjected to in silico immune simulations by C-ImmSim and Immune simulation significantly provided high levels of immunoglobulins, T-helper cells, T-cytotoxic cells, and INF-γ. Lastly, upon cloning, the vaccine protein was reverse transcribed into a DNA sequence and cloned into a pET28a (+) vector to ensure translational potency and microbial expression. The overall results of the study showed that the designed novel chimeric vaccine can simultaneously elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and is a reliable construct for subsequent in vivo and in vitro studies against the pathogen.","Chatterjee, Rahul; Sahoo, Panchanan; Mahapatra, Soumya Ranjan; Dey, Jyotirmayee; Ghosh, Mrinmoy; Kushwaha, Gajraj Singh; Misra, Namrata; Suar, Mrutyunjay; Raina, Vishakha; Son, Young-Ok",Vaccines (Basel),577,1

In the human genome the major classes of peptidases are represented by cysteine-, serine- and metalloenzymes, which possess a wide spectrum of substrate specificity and physiological functions. The identification of many novel peptidases from genome sequencing programmes has suggested potential new therapeutic targets. In addition, several well characterised peptidases were recently shown to possess new and unexpected biological roles in neuroinflammation, cancer and angiogenesis, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegeneration.

Particular attention will be paid to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), neprilysin (NEP) and adamalysin (ADAM) families of proteases and their pathophysiological roles with a particular emphasis on cancer and neurodegeneration. The roles and mechanisms of protein shedding which primarily involve the ADAMs family of metallopeptidases will be explained using amyloid protein precursor (APP) processing cascades as a well characterized example.

Inflammatory cytokines are key elements in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS, and the occurrence of an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines leads to additional non-pulmonary organ dysfunction which contributes to excess mortality rates. Treatment of these patients includes nutrition support with lipids, usually soybean oil-based lipid emulsions, which are rich in omega (n)-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and deficient in n-3 PUFAs; however, too much n-6 PUFAs are detrimental due to their pro-inflammatory effects. Conversely, a large amount of experimental studies and some randomized clinical trials showed the benefits of the n-3 PUFA administration in the context of ALI because of their anti-inflammatory properties. Based on these data, several scientific societies recommended in their guidelines, with an A or B grade of recommendation, the use of n-3 PUFAs in ALI/ARDS patients. However, at present, the issue of lipid therapy in ALI/ARDS is still controversial due, at least in part, to inconclusive or contradicting results in several recent clinical trials using n-3 PUFAs.","Cotogni, Paolo; Trombetta, Antonella; Muzio, Giuliana; Brizzi, Maria Felice; Canuto, Rosa Angela",Diet and Nutrition in Critical Care,577,16

METHOD: We aimed to evaluate ADR reports for pediatric patients in the JADER. We used spontaneous ADR reports included in the JADER since April 1, 2004, to December 31, 2017, which was downloaded in April 2018. In a total of 504,407 ADR reports, the number of spontaneous reports was 386,400 (76.6%), in which 37,534 (7.4%) were unknown age reports. After extraction of 27,800 ADR reports for children aged < 10 and 10–19 years, we excepted for ADR reports associated with a vaccine (n = 6355) and no-suspected drug reports (n = 86). A total of 21,359 (4.2%) reports were finally included in this analysis. RESULTS: More than half of the ADR reports were for children aged < 10 years. Approximately 30% of ADR reports had multiple suspected drugs, which did not differ by age. The percentages of fatal outcomes of ADRs among patients aged < 10 and 10–19 years were 4.7 and 3.9%, respectively.

A total of nine textile physical properties were modeled (e.g., abrasion, elasticity, pilling). Overall, the simpler yarn representation strategy obtained better predictive results. Moreover, for eight fabric properties (e.g., elasticity, pilling) the addition of finishing features improved the quality of the predictions. The best ML models obtained low predictive errors (from 2% to 7%) and are potentially valuable for the textile company, since they can be used to reduce the number of production attempts (saving time and costs).","Ribeiro, Rui; Pilastri, André; Moura, Carla; Rodrigues, Filipe; Rocha, Rita; Morgado, José; Cortez, Paulo",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,577,24

This approach is based on the unstructured moving grid finite volume method, which has adopted the space-time unified domain for control volume. Thus, it can accurately express such a moving mesh. However, due to the difficulty of mesh control in viscous flows and the need to maintain the stability of computation, it is restricted to only inviscid flows. In this paper, the multi axes sliding mesh approach was extended to viscous flows to understand detailed flow phenomena around a complicated moving body. The strategies to solve several issues not present in inviscid flow computations are described. To show the validity of the approach in viscous flows, it was applied to the flow field of a sphere in uniform flow. Multiple domains that slide individually were placed around the sphere, and it was confirmed that the sliding mesh did not affect the flow field. The usability of the approach is expected to be applied to practical viscous flow computations.","Yamakawa, Masashi; Chikaguchi, Satoshi; Asao, Shinichi; Hamato, Shotaro",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,577,4

These environments present students with a shared objective and provide them with a means to communicate, which allows them to share information, ask questions, construct explanations, and work together toward their shared goal. A key challenge in collaborative learning is that students may engage in unproductive discourse, which may affect learning activities and outcomes. Collaborative game-based learning environments that can detect this off-task behavior in real-time have the potential to enhance collaboration between students by redirecting the conversation back to more productive topics. This paper investigates the use of dialogue analysis to classify student conversational utterances as either off-task or on-task. Using classroom data collected from 13 groups of four students, we trained off-task dialogue models for text messages from a group chat feature integrated into Crystal Island: EcoJourneys, a collaborative game-based learning environment for middle school ecosystem science. We evaluate the effectiveness of the off-task dialogue models, which use different word embeddings (i.e., word2vec, ELMo, and BERT), as well as predictive off-task dialogue models that capture varying amounts of contextual information from the chat log. Results indicate that predictive off-task dialogue models that incorporate a window of recent context and represent the sequential nature of the chat messages achieve higher predictive performance compared to models that do not leverage this information. These findings suggest that off-task dialogue models for collaborative game-based learning environments can reliably recognize and predict students’ off-task behavior, which introduces the opportunity to adaptively scaffold collaborative dialogue.","Carpenter, Dan; Emerson, Andrew; Mott, Bradford W.; Saleh, Asmalina; Glazewski, Krista D.; Hmelo-Silver, Cindy E.; Lester, James C.",Artificial Intelligence in Education,577,24

The association between Usher syndrome-causative genes and resultant Usher syndrome phenotypes in patients are highly variable. In the present study, a Chinese family with Usher syndrome was recruited, and targeted next-generation sequencing, Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis were performed. The expression profiles and functional effects of the pathogenic variants of USH2A identified were analyzed. Novel nonsense compound heterozygous variants, c.T449G (p.L150*) and c.T10695A (p.Y3565*), were identified in the USH2A gene, which showed co-segregation with the disease phenotype causing Usher syndrome type IIA in the recruited Chinese pedigree. The p.L150* variant was predicted to produce a truncated protein which lacked almost all the functional domains of USH2A, whereas the p.Y3565* variant is located in one of the fibronectin type 3 domains, resulting in the loss of several fibronectin type 3 domains at the C-terminus of USH2A by producing the truncated protein. It was shown that Ush2a mRNA expression levels were higher in the retina compared with those in the eye tissues (lens, sclera and cornea), uterus, ovary, breast, testis, spleen, kidney, liver, intestine, brain, skeletal muscle and blood. Additionally, the protein structure was shown to be highly conserved by comparing Homo sapiens USH2A to eight other species. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to identify two novel pathogenic variants, c.T449G (p.L150*) and c.T10695A (p.Y3565*), in the USH2A gene in a patient with Usher syndrome type IIA, thereby expanding the known spectrums of USH2A causative mutations. The present discovery may assist in understanding the molecular pathogenesis underlying the development of RP and Usher syndrome type IIA, and in the development of diagnostic, therapeutic and genetic counseling strategies in patients with Usher syndrome type IIA disease.","Fu, Jiewen; Cheng, Jingliang; Zhou, Qi; Khan, Md.

In California, as well as in many water-scarce areas, water reclamation, recycling, and reuse are integral components of water resource planning and management. Historically, the driving motivation for water recycling was to supplement scarce resources and to provide alternatives to effluent disposal into surface waters. The California State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) adopted a Recycled Water Policy that moves towards the sustainable management of surface waters and groundwater, together with enhanced water conservation, water reuse, and the use of stormwater. In California, the practice of planned potable reuse has occurred in the form of indirect potable reuse (IPR), including an environmental buffer, for over 50 years. California's experience has demonstrated that planned potable reuse using IPR can be practiced without having any apparent detrimental effects on public health. In 2018 the State Water Board adopted surface water augmentation regulations(1) that establish minimum uniform water recycling criteria for he planned placement of recycled water into a surface water reservoir that is used as a source of domestic drinking water supply. The transition from IPR to direct potable reuse has the potential to modify conventional public health practices by removing the environmental buffer between wastewater disposal and water supply. California is currently developing regulations that would govern potable reuse situations that have either no environmental buffer and/or a reduced buffer.","Olivieri, Adam W.; Pecson, Brian; Crook, James; Hultquist, Robert",,577,1

On the surface, the vote, initiated by LDK, was the consequence of a conflict over the appropriate Corona strategy. A two-month power struggle under the extraordinary circumstances of Corona-related restriction followed, resulting in a new LDK-led government in early June. The political crisis in Kosovo in the early-phase of Corona has to be analyzed against the background of a political crisis with legacies in the post-conflict period, the polarization between Vetevendosje and other parties, and the strong influence of external actors in Kosovo. In this forum article, I ask how the discourse on the “state of emergency” and the pandemic has influenced power struggles in Kosovo and how the conflicts have challenged the democratic competition and institutions. My main argument is that the pandemic indeed did not lead to any form of cooperation, but the political competitors used the pandemic for an intensification of their power struggle, which—for now—led to the restoration of a government of established elites, supported by diplomatic interventions from external actors.","Distler, Werner",Z Friedens und Konflforsch,577,16

This work aims to identify differences between several commercial grades of PP and demonstrate the development of N95 filtration media with the intent that the industry partners can pivot and help address N95 shortages. Three commercial grades of high melt flow index PP were melt blown at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and broadly characterized by several methods including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and neutron scattering. Despite the apparent similarities (high melt flow and isotacticity) between PP feedstocks, the application of corona charging and charge enhancing additives improve each material to widely varying degrees. From the analysis performed here, the most differentiating factor appears to be related to crystallization of the polymer and the resulting electret formation. Materials with higher crystallization onset temperatures, slower crystallization rates, and larger number of crystallites form a stronger electret and are more effective at filtration.","Larsen, Gregory S.; Cheng, Yongqiang; Daemen, Luke L.; Lamichhane, Tej N.; Hensley, Dale K.; Hong, Kunlun; Meyer, Harry M.; Monaco, Steven J.; Levine, Alan M.; Lee, Richard J.; Betters, Emma; Sitzlar, Kim; Heineman, Jesse; West, Justin; Lloyd, Peter; Kunc, Vlastimil; Love, Lonnie; Theodore, Merlin; Paranthaman, Mariappan Parans",ACS Appl Polym Mater,577,24

Game theory approaches have been explored in security to model malicious behaviors and design reliable defense for the system in a mathematically grounded manner. However, modeling the system as a single player, as done in prior works, is insufficient for the system under partial compromise and for the design of fine-grained defensive strategies where the rest of the system with autonomy can cooperate to mitigate the impact of attacks. To deal with such issues, we propose a new self-adaptive framework incorporating Bayesian game theory and model the defender (i.e., the system) at the granularity of components. Under security attacks, the architecture model of the system is translated into a Bayesian multi-player game, where each component is explicitly modeled as an independent player while security attacks are encoded as variant types for the components. The optimal defensive strategy for the system is dynamically computed by solving the pure equilibrium (i.e., adaptation response) to achieve the best possible system utility, improving the resiliency of the system against security attacks. We illustrate our approach using an example involving load balancing and a case study on inter-domain routing.","Li, Nianyu; Zhang, Mingyue; Kang, Eunsuk; Garlan, David",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,577,1

Virtual communication via telecommunication and video-calling is more important than ever, but with minimal clinician education, preparation and relevant technological infrastructure available in the context of a global pandemic, we have recognised communication as an area for improvement as junior doctors working on a COVID-19 ward. METHODS: We interviewed via telephone 22 nominated next of kin relatives of patients admitted to a COVID-19 ward in the University Hospital of Llandough during May 2020 using a pre-prepared survey. We then provided relatives with the opportunity to engage with video-call updates from a doctor (with the patient’s permission). In appropriate scenarios, we used video calling to break bad news and to facilitate difficult communications with family members. These video calls were provided via Accurx, an NHS approved video communication system. RESULTS: Initial survey results showed an average understanding score of their relative’s current clinical plan of 5.5/10, with 63% of respondents saying they did not feel well informed. Nearly a quarter of respondents (22%) had received difficult news over the phone during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 86% said they would find video communication useful. Post-intervention survey results suggested a unanimous improvement in relative satisfaction, with relatives reporting an increased understanding around the admission, reassurance around the quality of care being given and less isolation from the patient. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has provided novel communication challenges to physicians, promoting flexibility and adaptation to some of the core inter-personal skills we develop throughout training. Technology plays a huge role in this, and the use of video calling in particular can preserve non-verbal communication within the doctor-relative relationship and improve emotional connection between patients and their loved ones.","White, H; Tuck, A; Pyrke, B; Murphy, E; Figg, K; Cartwright, G; Abdalla, B",Age Ageing,577,1

Most pathogens infiltrate the body from mucosal sites, primarily from the oral and pulmonary region and reach the systemic circulation where disease manifestation starts. Traditional needle-based vaccines are usually not capable of inducing immunity at the mucosal sites where pathogen infiltrates start, but induces systemic immunity. In contrast to needle-based vaccines, mucosally administered vaccines induce immunity at both the mucosal sites and systemically. The oral route of immunization is the most convenient way to administer the vaccines. However, due to the complicated and hostile gastrointestinal structure and environment, vaccines need to overcome major hurdles while retaining their stability and immunogenicity. AREA COVERED: This review will briefly discuss different barriers to oral vaccine development. It gives a brief overview of different types of nano/microparticle-based oral vaccines and discusses how physicochemical characteristics of the particles influence overall immunity after oral immunization. EXPERT OPINION: Formulation strategies using novel lipid and polymer-based nano/microparticle platforms retain stability and antigenicity of vaccines against the harsh gastrointestinal condition.

Methods: We analyzed questionnaire data from the end of May 2020 from 180 hospitals (total of 102,578 beds) with acute medical centers. Results: A total of 4,938 hospitalized patients with COVID–19 were confirmed. Of 1,100 severe COVID–19 inpatients, 112 remained hospitalized and 138 died. There were 4,852 patients presumed to be severe COVID–19 patients who were confirmed later to be not infected. Twenty–seven hospitals (15% of 180 hospitals) converted their intensive care unit (ICU) to a unit for COVID–19 patients only, and 107 (59%) had to manage both severe COVID–19 patients and others in the same ICU. Restriction of ICU admission occurred in one of the former 27 hospitals and 21 of the latter 107 hospitals. Shortage of N95 masks was the most serious concern regarding personal protective equipment. As for issues that raised ICU bed occupancy, difficulty undertaking or progressing rehabilitation for severe patients (42%), and the improved patients (28%), long–lasting severely ill patients (36%), and unclear isolation criteria (34%) were mentioned. Many acute medicine physicians assisted regional governmental agencies, functioning as advisors and volunteer coordinators. Conclusion: The mortality rate of COVID–19 in this study was 4.1% of all hospitalized patients and 12.5% (one in eight) severe patients. The hospitals with dedicated COVID–19 ICUs accepted more patients with severe COVID–19 and had lower ICU admission restrictions, which could be helpful as a strategy in the next pandemic.","(Jun Oda), 織田 順; (Takashi Muguruma), 六車 崇; (Shigenari Matsuyama), 松山 重成; (Seizan Tanabe), 田邉 晴山; (Tetsuro Nishimura), 西村 哲郎; (Yoko Sugawara), 菅原 洋子; (Shinji Ogura), 小倉 真治",,577,16

Scientists at all academic levels had to think creatively and design, if possible, engaging remote projects for their students. Based on journal reviews from renowned educators, we decided to perform a systematic literature review of publicly available material to summarize information about SARS‐CoV‐2, the virus responsible for the current pandemic, which has affected 87.5 million people with 1.89 million deaths worldwide (as of Jan 7, 2021). Using the PubMed Central (PMC) advanced search builder, we were able to narrow the initial 93,999 results for COVID‐19 related articles published in the past year (Nov 2019 – Nov 2020) to 543 publications that were related to SARS‐CoV‐2, spike protein structure and its receptor. Relevant articles in peer‐reviewed journals were identified from this list and comprehensive analysis of ~40 research articles were conducted and summarized. This compilation was used in a case‐study model to narrate a story simplifying the complexities of COVID‐19 infection while providing detailed qualitative information, which would otherwise be difficult and sensitive to discuss. This model for summer research enhanced students’ critical thinking skills necessary to ponder questions related to COVID‐19 in preparation to enter the healthcare profession. This directed patient case study was designed by using data from real life situations and applying it to fictitious patients to maintain anonymity. The storyline follows three individuals (85‐year‐old male, 80‐year‐old female, and a 50‐year‐old male) and their families during the 2019–2020 coronavirus outbreak in the United States. The timeline of patients’ infections, testing, interventions, and outcomes are discussed. Additional sections on COVID‐19 gender disparities and atypical symptoms are also provided. Students in upper‐level biology and health science courses, such as physiology and pathophysiology, will research the symptoms, susceptibility, mechanism of action, progression of the infection, opportunistic infections, extrapulmonary complications and treatments. The case concludes with an assignment to discuss the most current information available regarding the progress made in designing novel treatments. This project was presented at the Natural Science Summer Research program and parts of it will be introduced to students in local high schools as part of Benedictine University's (BenU) outreach activity. We are in the process of submitting a detailed version of this case to the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science. Working on the various aspects of the case, including instructor notes, answer key and presentations, honed the critical analysis and communication skills of the research students. Despite various tragedies and challenges, the pandemic offered the unique opportunity to identify novel topics and techniques to circumvent original project goals and traditional undergraduate research methods, as well as provide freedom for innovation that can ultimately benefit the academic community.","Simkeviciute, Gerda; Mehmood, Daniyal; Donner, Faith; Perez Morales, Tiara; Sarathy, Jayashree",FASEB J,577,9

To this end, we develop a novel microcantilever immunosensor using nanobodies (Nbs) as receptors. As the smallest antibody (Ab) entity comprising an intact antigen-binding site, Nbs achieve dense receptor layers and short distances between antigen-binding regions and sensor surfaces, which significantly elevate the generation and transmission of surface stress. Owing to the inherent thiol group at the C-terminus, Nbs are covalently immobilized on microcantilever surfaces in directed orientation via one-step reaction, which further enhances the stress generation. For microcantilever-based nanomechanical sensor, these advantages dramatically increase the sensor sensitivity. Thus, Nb-functionalized microcantilevers can detect picomolar concentrations of tumor markers with three orders of magnitude higher sensitivity, when compared with conventional Ab-functionalized microcantilevers. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates an ultrasensitive, label-free, rapid, and low-cost method for tumor marker detection. Moreover, interestingly, we find Nb inactivation on sensor interfaces when using macromolecule blocking reagents. The adsorption-induced inactivation is presumably caused by the change of interfacial properties, due to binding site occlusion upon complex coimmobilization formations. Our findings are generalized to any coimmobilization methodology for Nbs and, thus, for the construction of high-performance immuno-surfaces.

The most important and challenging problem here is to design an effective and robust diagnosis model. To this end, there are three challenges to overcome: (1) The lack of training samples limits the success of existing deep‐learning‐based methods. (2) Many public COVID‐19 data sets contain only a few images without fine‐grained labels. (3) Due to the explosive growth of suspected cases, it is urgent and important to diagnose not only COVID‐19 cases but also the cases of other types of pneumonia that are similar to the symptoms of COVID‐19. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Unsupervised Meta‐Learning with Self‐Knowledge Distillation to address the problem of differentiating COVID‐19 from pneumonia cases. During training, our model cannot use any true labels and aims to gain the ability of learning to learn by itself. In particular, we first present a deep diagnosis model based on a relation network to capture and memorize the relation among different images. Second, to enhance the performance of our model, we design a self‐knowledge distillation mechanism that distills knowledge within our model itself. Our network is divided into several parts, and the knowledge in the deeper parts is squeezed into the shallow ones. The final results are derived from our model by learning to compare the features of images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher performance than other state‐of‐the‐art methods. Moreover, we construct a new COVID‐19 pneumonia data set based on text mining, consisting of 2696 COVID‐19 images (347 X‐ray + 2349 CT), 10,155 images (9661 X‐ray + 494 CT) about other types of pneumonia, and the fine‐grained labels of all.

The social accounting matrix (SAM) multiplier model, built on the most up‐to‐date SAM (2017) for Ethiopia, shows that the country suffered a 14.3% loss in GDP (Birr 43.5 billion or US$1.9 billion) during the lockdown period compared to the no‐COVID case during the same period. Nearly two‐thirds of the losses come from the services sector. Although no direct restrictions were imposed on the agriculture sector, which is the primary means of livelihood for most, the sector faces a 4.7% loss in output due to its linkages with the rest of the economy. We find dissimilar income and poverty effects across households by income quintile and level of urbanization. The study also considers two recovery scenarios and generates relevant insights on the potential impacts of COVID‐19 by the end of 2020. The earmarked relief and recovery plan resources can only help the economy to recover if targeted in an efficient way towards sectors most affected by COVID‐19, and further resources are mobilized to support strategic sectors—those with the highest economywide multiplier effects—and vulnerable communities.","Aragie, Emerta; Taffesse, Alemayehu Seyoum; Thurlow, James",Afr Dev Rev,577,1

In this context, the Colombian government has implemented a series of security measures and programs to address this increasing violence and provide protection to social leaders at risk. Thus, this paper analyzes the conceptual framework of “protection” and “security” underlying these governmental initiatives as well as the implementation procedures, that have proven to have serious difficulties and failures in providing effective protection to threatened civil society actors. As this article shows, the Colombian security paradigm and protection policies for human rights activists and social leaders do not seem to have an effective long-term, comprehensive and participative approach, increasing even in some cases the risk of those who should protect. In order to discuss these points, this paper will address the following questions: What are the main characteristics and dilemmas of the Colombian state protection policy?

SUMMARY ANSWER: For study participants, elements such as empathy, communication, collaboration and trust are important factors in increasing compliance and satisfaction with treatment. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In the literature, the doctor-patient relationship is seen as fundamental in the treatment of infertility, due to the emotional implications of fertilization procedures. However, not much data is available specifically for this relationship. Communication and interpersonal skills, empathy, trust, collaboration, compliance and satisfaction are essential elements in this medical context. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and June 2020 and follows the methods of a quantitative analysis, the data being collected using questionnaires. The research plan is one specific to the path analysis with mediation effect, in which the hypotheses were tested. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The research group consists of 151 women diagnosed with infertility, voluntarily recruited through online support communities. Self-reported questionnaires provided socio-demographic information, information related to infertility, as well as information on the relationship of patients with specialists. In order to test the proposed hypotheses, an analysis of structural equations was performed, using the AMOS 20 program. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: According to statistical indicators, CMIN / DF = 2.124, RMSEA = .087 and the p value of the Chi-square is less than 5% significance level, the model proposed is accepted. Based on the reported NFI and CFI values ​​(.777 and .867), as well as the values of ​​RFI = .763, IFI = .868 and TLI = .859, it can be concluded that the model is appropriate for the sample data. The p value of all constructors is less than .05, except for trust in doctor - cognitive empathy and patient satisfaction. All the others paths are significant: the effect of communication on treatment compliance, mediated by trust in specialist and collaboration; the effect on communication on treatment compliance, mediated by affective empathy, trust in specialist and collaboration; the effect on communication on patient satisfaction, mediated by affective empathy and trust in doctor; the direct effect of communication on trust in doctor, as well as the mediated effect by affective empathy. Regarding the relationship with doctor during the COVID–19 pandemic, 33% of the study participants stated that the pandemic affected the relationship with doctor, and 44% discontinued contact with specialist and medical procedures between March and June 2020. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Only infertile, voluntary women participated in this study, which limits the generalizability to other populations. Because the data are cross-sectional and correlational, the direction of causation is not proven. Additional experimental research on larger populations is needed to examine the effects of communication on patient satisfaction and compliance. Wider implications of the findings: The study draws attention to the importance of basic concepts in the relationship of specialists with infertile patients. Thus, it is necessary for health care providers in assisted human reproduction to participate in programs for the continuous training of empathic communication skills, given the sensitivity of this diagnosis.

Each of these books considers the future of capitalism. Boettke’s Struggle sees capitalism as the only morally and economically justifiable system but that continual effort is necessary to ensure the capitalist enterprise succeeds. Bromley’s Crisis sees capitalism as a spent force that no longer does what it was meant to do—namely, improve the economic well-being of households. There are surprisingly many points of agreement in these books, most notably a concern for the downtrodden in society and an appreciation for the legitimation crisis confronting capitalism. There are also important differences that will give anyone interested in the future of capitalism much to ponder. Boettke sees unconstrained government as the primary threat to legitimacy; Bromley identifies the possessive individualism that lies at the heart of our current capitalist system as the source of the crisis. Both books make a significant contribution to our understanding of the institutions governing capitalist economies and powerful arguments as we contemplate the future of capitalism.","Murtazashvili, Ilia",Rev Austrian Econ,577,1

Several specific challenges like the information technology used, the geographical distribution and the lack of personal contact between team members make it difficult to share knowledge. Current studies on influencing factors of effective knowledge sharing in virtual teams focus either mainly on technical or social factors. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the role of social presence as an interdisciplinary construct. Social presence means the individual or joint experience of a sense of togetherness despite physical distance, which arises in the interaction between the team members while using the existing technology. The present study examines to what extent the experience of social presence influences the success of knowledge sharing in virtual teams. Based on the Critical Incident Technique 26 interviews were conducted with members of virtual teams. The participants described situations in which the virtual knowledge exchange was successful or unsuccessful. The evaluation showed that social presence occurred more frequently in successful situations and emphasized its significance for a successful exchange of knowledge. Practical relevance: Social presence can be positively influenced by media richness and support social processes and relationships in virtual teams. The results can be used to derive implications for virtual collaboration with the aim of optimizing knowledge sharing processes.","Tietz, Stephanie; Kneisel, Evi; Werner, Katja",Z Arbeitswiss,577,13

Its diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, hemodynamic, and oxygenation criteria. The purpose of this review is to examine the current definition for ARDS and to discuss why this definition may not be the most appropriate definition for this syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS We will briefly review our current understanding of ARDS, discuss the problems with its current diagnosis, and present clinical, pathological, and biochemical evidences supporting a more appropriate definition for ARDS. In addition, we will discuss recent efforts to identify biological markers for lung injury in pulmonary edema fluid and blood collected from critically ill patients. SUMMARY On the basis of current evidence, it is time for a change in the ARDS definition. A newer classification system that recognizes different severities of pulmonary dysfunction is needed. Such a system should be able to identify patients that would be most responsive to supportive therapies and those unlikely to benefit because of the severity of their disease.","Villar, Jesús; Blanco, Jesús; Kacmarek, Robert M",Current opinion in critical care,577,16

Chi-square tests, Cramer's V were used to study association between gender, age-group and education of parents with their knowledge, practice and attitude about otitis media. Out of 425 valid responses, overall most parents displayed adequate knowledge (77%), positive attitude (61%) and good care-seeking practices (70%). There was a positive correlation of knowledge and practice with level of education. This study shows acceptable levels of knowledge, attitude and practices in parents about otitis media. Parents who did not seek treatment from health centre attributed the behaviour to poverty, ignorance and lack of health insurance. The positive correlation of knowledge and practices with level of education highlights the importance of role of education in modifying parental awareness and care seeking behaviour.

However, the role of laparoscopy has not been clearly defined specifically in cases after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. This study aimed to assess the impact of preoperative radiotherapy on the feasibility of laparoscopic rectal excision with sphincter preservation for rectal cancer. METHODS From 1999 to 2010, the authors considered all patients treated by laparoscopic rectal excision with sphincter preservation for rectal cancer. Patients treated by long-course preoperative radiochemotherapy (45 Gy during 5 weeks) were compared with those treated by surgery alone. The end points of the study were mortality, conversion, and overall and surgical morbidity. RESULTS Among 422 patients treated by laparoscopic conservative rectal excision, 292 received preoperative radiotherapy, and 130 had surgery alone. The two groups were similar in sex, age, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. The mortality rate was 0.3% in the radiotherapy group and 0.8% in the surgical group (P = 0.52). The two groups did not differ in terms of conversion (19 vs. 15%; P = 0.39), overall morbidity (37 vs. 29%; P = 0.14), surgical morbidity (20 vs. 18%; P = 0.60), or anastomotic leakage (13 vs. 11%; P = 0.54). Multivariate analysis showed male gender and synchronous metastasis as independent factors of surgical morbidity. The independent factors of conversion were male gender, obesity, tumor stage, and type of anastomosis. Preoperative radiotherapy influenced neither conversion nor surgical morbidity. CONCLUSION Long-course radiochemotherapy does not have an impact on the feasibility or short-term outcome of laparoscopic conservative rectal excision for rectal cancer.","Denost, Quentin; Laurent, Christophe; Paumet, Thomas; Quintane, Laurence; Martenot, Mathieu; Rullier, Eric",Surgical endoscopy,577,1

RESULTS The technical success rate was 94.6% and 34 patients (95%) had no complications. There were no conversions to open RFA and no operative mortality. The primary effectiveness rate 1 month after the procedure was 100%. The overall recurrence rates at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the laparoscopic RFA were 8.1%, 14.4%, 25%, and 35.7%, respectively. The local tumor progression rate was 4.2% at 6 months and 8.7% at 9 months. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic RFA is a safe and effective treatment for HCC cases that are unsuitable for percutaneous RFA.","Na, Byung Gon; Kim, Jong Man; Oh, Dong Kyu; Lee, Kyo-Won; Kang, Tae-Wook; Choi, Gyu-Seong; Lee, Min Woo; Kwon, Choon Hyuck David; Lim, Hyun Chul; Joh, Jae-Won",Annals of surgical treatment and research,577,1

However, in the nutritionally stringent environment of the macrophage phagolysosome, Mtb relies mainly on cholesterol. In previous studies, we demonstrated that Mtb can accumulate and utilize cholesterol as the sole carbon source. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that a lipid-rich environment may have a much broader impact on the pathogenesis of Mtb infection than previously thought. Therefore, we applied high-resolution transcriptome profiling and the construction of various mutants to explore in detail the global effect of cholesterol on the tubercle bacillus metabolism. The results allow re-establishing the complete list of genes potentially involved in cholesterol breakdown. Moreover, we identified the modulatory effect of vitamin B12 on Mtb transcriptome and the novel function of cobalamin in cholesterol metabolite dissipation which explains the probable role of B12 in Mtb virulence. Finally, we demonstrate that a key role of cholesterol in mycobacterial metabolism is not only providing carbon and energy but involves also a transcriptome remodeling program that helps in developing tolerance to the unfavorable host cell environment far before specific stress-inducing phagosomal signals occur.","Pawełczyk, Jakub; Brzostek, Anna; Minias, Alina; Płociński, Przemysław; Rumijowska-Galewicz, Anna; Strapagiel, Dominik; Zakrzewska-Czerwińska, Jolanta; Dziadek, Jarosław",Scientific reports,577,19

STUDY DESIGN An observational cross-sectional study. Sixty preterm infants, categorized into nCPAP (n=37) and HHHFNC groups (n=23). Pain response was assessed using Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), duration of first cry and salivary-cortisol concentrations. RESULT The PIPP scores were significantly higher in the nCPAP compared with HHHFNC group (10 (7-12) vs 4 (2-6), P<0.01). None of the infants in the HHHFNC group had severe pain defined as a PIPP score >12, compared with 5 (13.5%) infants in the nCPAP group. Salivary-cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in nCPAP group compared with the HHHFNC group (5.0 (3.6-5.9) vs 1.6 (1.0-2.3) nmol l(-1), P<0.01). A lower incidence of cry was observed for infants in the HHHFNC group compared with the nCPAP group (11 (47.8%) vs 30 (81.1%), P<0.001), however, the duration of first cry was not significantly different between groups. The respiratory rate was significantly lower after application of HHHFNC compared with nCPAP (P<0.001). There were no significant differences between groups with regard to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2) and heart rate.

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL. STUDY SELECTION Randomized trials of TAVI compared with SAVR in patients with a mean perioperative risk of death <8%. REVIEW METHODS Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for outcomes important to patients that were selected a priori by a parallel guideline committee, including patient advisors. We used the GRADE system was used to quantify absolute effects and quality of evidence. RESULTS 4 trials with 3179 patients and a median follow-up of two years were included. Compared with SAVR, transfemoral TAVI was associated with reduced mortality (risk difference per 1000 patients: -30, 95% confidence interval -49 to -8, moderate certainty), stroke (-20, -37 to 1, moderate certainty), life threatening bleeding (-252, -293 to -190, high certainty), atrial fibrillation (-178, -150 to -203, moderate certainty), and acute kidney injury (-53, -39 to -62, high certainty) but increased short term aortic valve reintervention (7, 1 to 21, moderate certainty), permanent pacemaker insertion (134, 16 to 382, moderate certainty), and moderate or severe symptoms of heart failure (18, 5 to 34, moderate certainty). Compared with SAVR, transapical TAVI was associated higher mortality (57, -16 to 153, moderate certainty, P=0.015 for interaction between transfemoral versus transapical TAVI) and stroke (45, -2 to 125, moderate certainty, interaction P=0.012). No study reported long term follow-up, which is particularly important for structural valve deterioration. CONCLUSIONS Many patients, particularly those who have a shorter life expectancy or place a lower value on the risk of long term valve degeneration, are likely to perceive net benefit with transfemoral TAVI versus SAVR.

However, the reported prevalence of these deficits in smell and taste varies widely, and the reason for the differences between studies is unclear. We determined the pooled prevalence of such chemosensory deficits in a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched the COVID-19 portfolio of the National Institutes of Health for studies that reported the prevalence of smell and/or taste deficits in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. One-hundred-four studies reporting on 38,198 patients qualified and were subjected to a systematic review and meta-analysis. Estimated random prevalence of olfactory dysfunction was 43.0%, of taste dysfunction was 44.6%, and of overall chemosensory dysfunction was 47.4%. We examined the effects of age, gender, disease severity, and ethnicity on chemosensory dysfunction. Prevalence of smell and/or taste dysfunction decreased with older age, male gender, and with disease severity. Ethnicity was highly significant: Caucasians had a three times higher prevalence of chemosensory dysfunctions (54.8%) than Asians (17.7%). The finding of geographic differences points to two, not mutually exclusive causes. A virus mutation (D614G) may cause differing infectivity, while, at the host level, genetic, ethnicity-specific variants of the virus-binding entry proteins may facilitate virus entry in the olfactory epithelium and taste buds. Both explanations have major implications for infectivity, diagnosis and management of the COVID-19 pandemic.","VON Bartheld, Christopher S; Hagen, Molly M; Butowt, Rafal",ACS chemical neuroscience,577,33

The ORF1 of HEV encodes a nonstructural polyprotein of 1,693 amino acids. It is not clear whether the ORF1 polyprotein (pORF1) is processed into distinct enzymatic domains. Many researchers have attempted to understand the mechanisms of pORF1 processing. However, these studies gave various results and could never convincingly establish the mechanism of pORF1 processing. In this study, we demonstrated the possible role of thrombin and factor Xa in pORF1 processing. We observed that the HEV pORF1 polyprotein bears conserved cleavage sites of thrombin and factor Xa. Using a reverse genetics approach, we demonstrated that an HEV replicon having mutations in the cleavage sites of either thrombin or factor Xa could not replicate efficiently in cell culture. Further, we demonstrated in vitro processing when we incubated recombinant pORF1 fragments with thrombin, and we observed the processing of pORF1 polyprotein. The treatment of a liver cell line with a serine protease inhibitor as well as small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of thrombin and factor Xa resulted in significant reduction in the replication of HEV. Thrombin and factor Xa have been well studied for their roles in blood clotting. Both of these proteins are believed to be present in the active form in the blood plasma. Interestingly, in this report, we demonstrated the presence of biologically active thrombin and factor Xa in a liver cell line. The results suggest that factor Xa and thrombin are essential for the replication of HEV and may be involved in pORF1 polyprotein processing of HEV.IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes a liver disorder called hepatitis in humans, which is mostly an acute and self-limiting infection in adults. A high mortality rate of about 30% is observed in HEV-infected pregnant women in developing countries. There is no convincing opinion about HEV ORF1 polyprotein processing owing to the variability of study results obtained so far. HEV pORF1 has cleavage sites for two host cellular serine proteases, thrombin and factor Xa, that are conserved among HEV genotypes. For the first time, this study demonstrated that thrombin and factor Xa cleavage sites on HEV pORF1 are obligatory for HEV replication. Intracellular biochemical activities of the said serine proteases are also essential for efficient HEV replication in cell culture and must be involved in pORF1 processing. This study sheds light on the presence and roles of clotting factors with respect to virus replication in the cells.","Kanade, Gayatri D; Pingale, Kunal D; Karpe, Yogesh A",Journal of virology,577,27

In clinical studies, there is a time gap between observed adverse electromyographic (EMG) changes and examination of vocal cord function. This study evaluates the impact of intraoperative EMG changes on synchronous vocal cord contractility by simultaneous use of continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring (C-IONM) and accelerometry for registration of actual vocal cord function at a given change of EMG amplitude. METHODS EMG was obtained following vagus nerve stimulation by use of C-IONM. A vocal cord accelerometer probe that could be attached to the vocal cords was developed based on a LIS3DH ultra low-power high performance three axis linear accelerometer (STMicroelectronics, Geneva, Switzerland). Accelerometer data were registered continuously together with EMG data during traction injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) until an amplitude depression ≤100 μV. RESULTS Six RLN from four immature domestic pigs were studied. Vocal cord contractility assessed by vocal cord accelerometry decreased in parallel with EMG amplitude, with significant correlations ranging from 0.707 to 0.968. CONCLUSION Decrease of EMG amplitude during traction injury to the RLN injury is closely associated with a parallel drop in vocal cord contractility.

We posited that the habitat relevance of a trait begets its underlying genomic complexity, so that traits within the repertoire would be differentially more complex in species successfully thriving in that habitat than in close species that cannot. To test this for the case of bloom-forming cyanobacteria, we curated 17 potentially relevant query metabolic pathways and five core pathways selected according to existing ecophysiological literature. The available 113 genomes were split into those of blooming (45) or nonblooming (68) strains, and an index of genomic complexity for each strain's version of each pathway was derived. We show that strain versions of all query pathways were significantly more complex in bloomers, with complexity in fact correlating positively with strain blooming incidence in 14 of those pathways. Five core pathways, relevant everywhere, showed no differential complexity or correlations. Gas vesicle, toxin and fatty acid synthesis, amino acid uptake, and C, N, and S acquisition systems were most strikingly relevant in the blooming repertoire. Further, we validated our findings using metagenomic gene expression analyses of blooming and nonblooming cyanobacteria in natural settings, where pathways in the repertoire were differentially overexpressed according to their relative complexity in bloomers, but not in nonbloomers. We expect that this approach may find applications to other habitats and organismal groups.IMPORTANCE We pragmatically delineate the trait repertoire that enables organismal niche specialization. We based our approach on the tenet, derived from evolutionary and complex-system considerations, that genomic units that can significantly contribute to fitness in a certain habitat will be comparatively more complex in organisms specialized to that habitat than their genomic homologs found in organisms from other habitats. We tested this in cyanobacteria forming harmful water blooms, for which decades-long efforts in ecological physiology and genomics exist. Our results essentially confirm that genomics and ecology can be linked through comparative complexity analyses, providing a tool that should be of general applicability for any group of organisms and any habitat, and enabling the posing of grounded hypotheses regarding the ecogenomic basis for diversification.","Cao, Huansheng; Shimura, Yohei; Steffen, Morgan M; Yang, Zhou; Lu, Jingrang; Joel, Allen; Jenkins, Landon; Kawachi, Masanobu; Yin, Yanbin; Garcia-Pichel, Ferran",mBio,577,26

It was postulated that the use of MCTI is associated with improved patient outcome without causing harm. METHODS All patients with an acute ischaemic stroke and CT-based imaging within 24 h from the ASTRAL (Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne) registry were included. Preceding demographic, clinical, biological, radiological and follow-up data were collected. Significant predictors of MCTI use were identified retrospectively to go on to fit a multivariable analysis. Then, patients undergoing additional CT angiography (CTA) or CTA and perfusion CT (CTP) were compared with non-contrast CT only patients with regard to 3-month favourable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score ≤2), 12-month mortality, stroke mechanism, short-term renal failure, use of ancillary diagnostic tests, duration of hospitalization and 12-month stroke recurrence. RESULTS Of the 1994 included patients, 273 had only non-contrast CT, 411 had both non-contrast CT and CTA and 1310 had all three examinations. Factors independently associated with MCTI were younger age, low pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale score, low creatinine value, known stroke onset, anterior circulation stroke, anticoagulation or antihypertensive therapy (CTA only) and higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (CTP only). After adjustment, MCTI was associated with a 50% reduction of 12-month mortality and a lower likelihood of unknown stroke mechanism. No association was found between MCTI and 3-month outcome, contrast-induced nephropathy, hospitalization duration, number of ancillary diagnostic tests or with stroke recurrence. CONCLUSION Our study shows an association of MCTI use with lower adjusted 12-month mortality, better identification of the stroke mechanism and no signs of harm.","Bill, O; Faouzi, M; Meuli, R; Maeder, P; Wintermark, M; Michel, P",European journal of neurology,577,31

Fast induction of anesthesia, maintenance of healthy vital rates, and predictable recoveries are priorities. From September 2010 to May 2012, we investigated these attributes in captive and wild grizzly bears anesthetized with a combination of a reversible α2 agonist (dexmedetomidine [dexM], the dextrorotatory enantiomer of medetomidine) and a nonreversible N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) agonist and tranquilizer (tiletamine and zolazepam [TZ], respectively). A smaller-than-expected dose of the combination (1.23 mg tiletamine, 1.23 mg zolazepam, and 6.04 µg dexmedetomidine per kg bear) produced reliable, fast ataxia (3.7 ± 0.5 min, x̄±SE) and workable anesthesia (8.1 ± 0.6 min) in captive adult grizzly bears. For wild bears darted from a helicopter, a dose of 2.06 mg tiletamine, 2.06 mg zolazepam, and 10.1 µg dexmedetomidine/kg produced ataxia in 2.5 ± 0.3 min and anesthesia in 5.5 ± 1.0 min. Contrary to published accounts of bear anesthesia with medetomidine, tiletamine, and zolazepam, this combination did not cause hypoxemia or hypoventilation, although mild bradycardia (<50 beats per min) occurred in most bears during the active season. With captive bears, effective dose rates during hibernation were approximately half those during the active season. The time to first signs of recovery after the initial injection of dexMTZ was influenced by heart rate (P<0.001) and drug dose (P<0.001). Intravenous (IV) injection of the reversal agent, atipamezole, significantly decreased recovery time (i.e., standing on all four feet and reacting to the surrounding environment) relative to intramuscular injection. Recovery times (25 ± 8 min) following IV injections of the recommended dose of atipamezole (10 µg/µg of dexmedetomidine) and half that dose (5 µg/µg) did not differ. However, we recommend use of the full dose based on the appearance of a more complete recovery. Field trials confirmed that the dexMTZ + atipamezole protocol is safe, reliable, and predictable when administered to wild grizzly bears, especially during helicopter capture operations.","Teisberg, Justin E; Farley, Sean D; Nelson, O Lynne; Hilderbrand, Grant V; Madel, Michael J; Owen, Patricia A; Erlenbach, Joy A; Robbins, Charles T",Journal of wildlife diseases,577,17

Existing theories propose that during motoric response-conflict, inappropriate motor activity is actively (and perhaps non-selectively) suppressed by an inhibitory fronto-basal ganglia mechanism. We here tested this theory across three experiments. First, using scalp-EEG, we found that both outright action-stopping and response-conflict during action-selection invoke low-frequency activity of a common fronto-central source, whose activity relates to trial-by-trial behavioral indices of inhibition in both tasks. Second, using simultaneous intracranial recordings from the basal ganglia and motor cortex, we found that response-conflict increases the influence of the subthalamic nucleus on M1-representations of incorrect response-tendencies. Finally, using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we found that during the same time period when conflict-related STN-to-M1 communication is increased, cortico-spinal excitability is broadly suppressed. Together, these findings demonstrate that fronto-basal ganglia networks buttress action-selection under response-conflict by rapidly and non-selectively net-inhibiting inappropriate motor tendencies.","Wessel, Jan R; Waller, Darcy A; Greenlee, Jeremy Dw",eLife,577,24

This study aimed to identify correlated factors for depression/anxiety among children and adolescents after COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS An online survey by cluster sampling was conducted after lockdown in 5175 Chinese children and adolescents with informed consents from their parents. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scales with 10-point cutoff were used to measure depression and anxiety, separately. Stepwise logistic regression was conducted. Stata 15.1 Version was used. RESULTS 12.33% and 6.26% of all participants reported depression and anxiety after lockdown, separately. Suicidal ideation, quarreling with parents, insomnia, difficulty in concentrating during online learning, and anxious and depressed mood during lockdown were positively associated with depression and anxiety after lockdown. Missing teachers was negatively associated with both depression and anxiety. Living in urban and not living with parents were positively associated with depression. LIMITATIONS The past history and familial history of mental disorders have not been collected. The recall biases for collecting self-reporting information might exist, and the causal inferences cannot be drawn. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents might decline a bit after lockdown but is still at a high level after lockdown.

This prospective and randomized study included 92 patients who would undergo lower abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were randomized by closed envelope method and divided into two groups. Group I (n:46) included the patients who would receive warming with forced-air warming upper body blanket, and Group II (n:46) consisted of the patients who received warming with forced-air warming underbody blanket. Central body temperature was recorded by measuring with a temperature probe placed in distal esophagus. Demographic data, amount of fentanyl, crystalloid and blood products used, duration of operation, type of operation, hemodynamic parameters, shivering and thermal damage information were recorded. There was not any statistically significant difference among the patients in terms of demographic data, amount of fentanyl, crystalloid and blood products used, duration and type of operation and hemodynamic parameters. No difference was found between the groups in terms of body temperatures (Group I:36.1 °C, Group II:36.3 °C, respectively) (P > 0.05). Forced air warming underbody blanket can be as effective as forced-air warming upper body blankets in preventing intraoperative hypothermia. They can be alternative in cases where use of forced-air warming upper body blankets is not feasible.","Alparslan, Volkan; Kus, Alparslan; Hosten, Tulay; Ertargin, Mehmet; Ozdamar, Dilek; Toker, Kamil; Solak, Mine",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,577,1

The objective of this study was to evaluate healthcare workers' mental health problems during the common COVID-19 exposure scenario in Mexico, comparing those on the frontline with other healthcare workers according to gender and profession, determining the main risk factors for the most frequent mental health problems. METHODS A cross-sectional online study was conducted with a non-probabilistic sample of 5,938 Mexican healthcare workers who completed brief screening measures of mental health problems and ad hoc questions about sociodemographic professional characteristics, conditions related to increased risk of COVID-19 infection, life stressors during the COVID-19 emergency, and perceived need to cope with COVID-19. RESULTS The identified mental health problems were insomnia, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), all of which were more frequent in frontline healthcare workers (52.1, 37.7, and 37.5%, respectively) and women (47.1, 33.0 %, and 16.3%, respectively). A lack of rest time was the main risk factor for insomnia (OR = 3.1, 95%CI 2.6-3.7, p ≤ 0.0001). Mourning the death of friends or loved ones due to COVID-19 was the main risk factor for depression (OR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.8-2.7, p ≤ 0.0001), and personal COVID-19 status was the main risk factor for PTSD (OR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.7-2.9, p ≤ 0.0001). CONCLUSION The most frequent mental health problems during the common exposure scenario for COVID-19 in Mexico included the short-term psychological consequences of intense adversity. A comprehensive strategy for preventing mental health problems should focus on individuals with cumulative vulnerability and specific risk factors.","Robles, Rebeca; Rodríguez, Evelyn; Vega-Ramírez, Hamid; Álvarez-Icaza, Dení; Madrigal, Eduardo; Durand, Sol; Morales-Chainé, Silvia; Astudillo, Claudia; Real-Ramírez, Janet; Medina-Mora, María-Elena; Becerra, Claudia; Escamilla, Raúl; Alcocer-Castillejos, Natasha; Ascencio, Leticia; Díaz, Dulce; González, Hugo; Barrón-Velázquez, Evalinda; Fresán, Ana; Rodríguez-Bores, Lorena; Quijada-Gaytán, Juan-Manuel; Zabicky, Gady; Tejadilla-Orozco, Diana; González-Olvera, Jorge-Julio; Reyes-Terán, Gustavo",Revista brasileira de psiquiatria,577,27

There are 3 stages of infection: (1) early upper respiratory tract infection with fever and lymphopenia (2) pulmonary phase and (3) hyperinflammatory phase with the clinical signs of organ failure such as ARDS/shock. Hyperinflammation, which is triggered by activation of T cells and monocytes/macrophages, is essential for organ pathologies. Interferon IFN-ɣ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-10 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) play important roles as mediators of inflammation. In analogy to the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after CAR-T cell therapy, the therapeutic activity of the IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab is investigated in clinical studies.The coagulation system is activated during the inflammatory phase of COVID infection, most likely on the pathophysiological basis of immune thrombosis. Clinically, there is a significantly increased incidence of venous (especially pulmonary artery embolism), but also arterial thromboembolism (TE). In laboratory chemistry, the D-dimer, fibrinogen but also vWF and FVIII are significantly increased. Guidelines for the prophylaxis and therapy of COVID-associated coagulopathy have been developed. Analogous to other viral infections, there are approaches to passive immunization using convalescent plasma. Its administration has shown promising activity in first uncontrolled case series and is currently being examined in clinical studies worldwide for its therapeutic activity.","Spiekermann, Karsten; Subklewe, Marion; Hildebrandt, Martin; Humpe, Andreas; von Bergwelt-Baildon, Michael",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,577,31

Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19 classification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of clinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep Forest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images. Specifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then, in order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the relatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn high-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature selection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the redundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively incorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed AFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and AUC achieved by our method are 91.79%, 93.05%, 89.95% and 96.35%, respectively.

These radicals are not only a physiological mechanism for pathogen clearance but also result in many pathological consequences. Low concentrations of radicals can promote viral replication; however, high concentrations of radicals can also inhibit viral replication and are detrimental to the cell due to their mitogenic activity. We reviewed the detailed mechanisms behind oxygen and nitrogen radical production and focused on how viruses induce radical production. In addition, we examined the effects of oxygen and nitrogen radicals on both the virus and host. We also reviewed enzymatic and chemical detoxification mechanisms and recent advances in therapeutic antioxidant applications. Many molecules that modulate the redox balance have yielded promising results in cell and animal models of infection. This encourages their use in clinical practice either alone or with existing therapies. However, since the redox balance also plays an important role in host defence against pathogens, carefully designed clinical trials are needed to assess the therapeutic benefits and secondary effects of these molecules and whether these effects differ between different types of viral infections.","Molteni, C G; Principi, N; Esposito, S",Free radical research,577,1

This dynamic may reflect increased exposure from public health efforts as well as health misinformation shared on social media. METHODS We analyzed the dynamics of calls to the Regional Center for Poison Control and Prevention serving Massachusetts and Rhode Island (MARI PCC) and tweets discussing treating COVID-19 with house cleaners from January 20, 2020 to May 5, 2020. We obtained publicly available tweets discussing the use of household cleaners to ""cure COVID"" from the same time period with geographic co-ordinates indicating that they were emitted from the Greater Boston Area. RESULTS Our main finding is that public health efforts were followed by a sustained increase in calls after March 15, 2020 (10 ± 2 calls per day before to 15 ± 2.5 after) while misinformation on social media was associated with intermittent spikes in calls. Overall, calls significantly increased during the study period by 34% as compared to the previous 8 years, mostly reporting unintentional ingestions with no serious effects. The daily volume of tweets and retweets was significantly correlated with daily call rates to MARI PCC for the surrounding 7-10 days. CONCLUSIONS Health misinformation on social media about using household cleaning agents to treat COVID-19 and public health efforts lead to different dynamics in PCC calls. Public health efforts were followed by a sustained increase in calls after March 15, 2020 while misinformation on social media was followed by intermittent spikes in calls. This analysis is the first to link the geospatial dynamics of social media and public health interventions to poison center calls about exposure to household cleaners.","Chary, Michael A; Overbeek, Daniel L; Papadimoulis, Alexandria; Sheroff, Adina; Burns, Michele M",Clinical toxicology,577,12

Activation of oncogenic signalling proteins AKT and ERK by phosphorylation has an established role in the development of lung cancer and has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of emphysema. The aim of this study was to compare the protein level and phosphorylation status of AKT and ERK in paired lung cancer and emphysema tissue using a highly sensitive phosphoprotein analysis approach. METHODS An antibody-based, nanocapillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) assay was used to determine the relative quantities and phosphorylation status of AKT and ERK in tumour and matched lung tissue from patients, with or without evidence of emphysema, undergoing curative resection for non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS 20 patients with adenocarcinoma (n=9) or squamous cell carcinoma (n=11) of the lung were included (mean age 67.3 years (SD 7.5, range 47-80 years)), 12 were men and all were current (n=10) or former smokers (n=10). Paired macroscopically normal lung tissue was either histologically normal (n=7) or showed emphysema (n=13). Total and phosphorylated AKT levels were fourfold (p=0.0001) and fivefold (p=0.001) higher in tumour compared with matched lung, respectively. There was no correlation with tumour histology, stage or differentiation; however, total AKT signal in tumour was significantly correlated with fluorodeoxyglucose avidity on positron emission tomography-CT scan (r=0.53, p=0.035). Total ERK was not differentially expressed, but doubly phosphorylated (activated) ERK was threefold higher in emphysema (23.5%, SD 9.2) than either matched tumour (8.8%, SD 8.6) or normal lung tissue (8.3%, SD 9.0) and correlated with the histological severity of emphysema (p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS cIEF offers opportunities for quantifying subtle shifts in the phosphorylation status of oncoproteins in nanogram amounts of lung tissue.

IPF is responsible for changes in the micro-architecture of the lung parenchyma, such as thickening of the alveolar walls, which reduces compliance and elasticity. In this study, we verify the hypothesis that changes in the micro-architecture of the lung parenchyma can be characterized by exploiting multiple scattering of ultrasound waves by the alveolar structure. Ultrasound propagation in a highly scattering regime follows a diffusion process, which can be characterized using the Diffusion Constant. We hypothesize that in a fibrotic lung, the thickening of the alveolar wall reduces the amount of air (compared to a healthy lung), thereby minimizing the scattering events. Pulmonary fibrosis is created in Sprague-Dawley rats by instilling bleomycin into the airway. The rats are studied within 3 week after bleomycin administration. Using a 128-element linear array transducer operating at 7.8 MHz, in-vivo experimental data is obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats and the transport mean free path (L*) and Backscatter Frequency Shift (BFS) are evaluated.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic potential of phenotypic methods for carbapenemase [carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamases (CHDLs) and metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs)] production, by comparing with molecular detection of genes. Methods One hundred and fifty clinical CRAB isolates collected between August 2013 and January 2014 were studied. Multiplex PCR was performed to identify the carbapenemases produced (class D blaOXA-51, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-58; class B blaVIM, blaNDM-1, blaIMP; class A blaKPC). Each isolate was evaluated for carbapenemase production by studying the pattern of imipenem hydrolysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Results The most commonly encountered carbapenemase genes were blaOXA-51(100%), blaOXA-23(98%), blaVIM(49.3%), blaNDM-1(18.7%) and blaOXA-58(2%). MALDI-TOF MS was able to detect 30.6 per cent carbapenemases within three hours (P=0.001 for MBL and P>0.05 for CHDL) and 65.3 per cent within six hours (P=0.001 for MBL and P>0.05 for CHDL). Interpretation & conclusions MALDI-TOF MS reliably detected carbapenemase activity within a short span of time, thus helping in tailoring patient therapy.

Although HCV is curable, there is an unmet need for the development of effective and affordable treatment options. Through a cell-based high-throughput screen, we identified chlorcyclizine HCl (CCZ), an over-the-counter drug for allergy symptoms, as a potent inhibitor of HCV infection. CCZ inhibited HCV infection in human hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes. The mode of action of CCZ is mediated by inhibiting an early stage of HCV infection, probably targeting viral entry into host cells. The in vitro antiviral effect of CCZ was synergistic with other anti-HCV drugs, including ribavirin, interferon-α, telaprevir, boceprevir, sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, and cyclosporin A, without significant cytotoxicity, suggesting its potential in combination therapy of hepatitis C. In the mouse pharmacokinetic model, CCZ showed preferential liver distribution. In chimeric mice engrafted with primary human hepatocytes, CCZ significantly inhibited infection of HCV genotypes 1b and 2a, without evidence of emergence of drug resistance, during 4 and 6 weeks of treatment, respectively. With its established clinical safety profile as an allergy medication, affordability, and a simple chemical structure for optimization, CCZ represents a promising candidate for drug repurposing and further development as an effective and accessible agent for treatment of HCV infection.","He, Shanshan; Lin, Billy; Chu, Virginia; Hu, Zongyi; Hu, Xin; Xiao, Jingbo; Wang, Amy Q; Schweitzer, Cameron J; Li, Qisheng; Imamura, Michio; Hiraga, Nobuhiko; Southall, Noel; Ferrer, Marc; Zheng, Wei; Chayama, Kazuaki; Marugan, Juan J; Liang, T Jake",Science translational medicine,577,24

Immunoevasive and immunomodulatory mechanisms underlie the chronic persistence of the bacterium and the active proinflammatory effect of life-long H. pylori infection. In contrast to tumorigenic viruses, which frequently possess factors to influence the host ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), nothing is yet known about potential effects of H. pylori in this respect. The majority of H. pylori isolates worldwide possess a pathogenicity island (PAI), the cagPAI, which is involved in IL-8 production and chronic inflammation. We hypothesized that H. pylori and its cagPAI may have an influence on host cell ubiquitin pathways. The effect of H. pylori wild type and isogenic mutants lacking the complete cagPAI (or CagA) on host deubiqutinating enzymes (DUBs) was tested in coincubation experiments with human gastric epithelial cells, using DUB activity profiling. Specific DUBs were identified to be active in gastric cells. Effects on the activity and expression of DUBs were observed in H. pylori-infected cells. In particular, H. pylori caused a strong decrease in the expression and activity of the DUB USP7 which was partially cagPAI- and CagA-dependent. The reduction in USP7 in infected cells at the protein and transcript levels coincided with a decrease in the amounts of the major innate immune hub protein TRAF6 and the tumor suppressor p53. These results are a basis for further investigations into H. pylori modulators of ubiquitin-dependent cellular signaling and their biological function.","Coombs, Nina; Sompallae, Ramakrishna; Olbermann, Patrick; Gastaldello, Stefano; Göppel, Daniela; Masucci, Maria G; Josenhans, Christine",International journal of medical microbiology : IJMM,577,8

However, real-life experience is limited, although case series are increasingly reported. OBJECTIVES We aimed to evaluate the value of cTBB performed under real-life conditions in a tertiary care center for ILDs. METHODS Data on all patients undergoing a cTBB for evaluation of suspected ILD between October 2015 and January 2017 were included in this retrospective case series. Procedure details, complication rates, histopathological results, and diagnostic consensus reached by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion were collated and evaluated. RESULTS A total of 109 patients (mean age 64 years, range 19-85; 66% male, 38% never smokers) referred to our center with features suggestive of ILD underwent cTBB. The mean FVC% predicted was 77% (range 41-131), with a mean DLCO of 51% (range 20-86), and a 6-min walking test (6MWT) of 402 m (range 100-642). On average, 4 samples were taken from each patient (range 1-8), with a mean biopsy diameter of 5 mm (range 2-12). Complications included pneumothorax (11.9%), all treated with chest drain. Moderate bleeding occurred in 28.4% (all resolved without active measures). No acute disease exacerbations and no deaths occurred. A histopathological pattern diagnosis was possible in 80 cases (73.4%), and 26.6% of cases were considered nonspecific. An MDT consensus diagnosis was reached in 83.5% of cases. Subsequent SLB was proposed in 13 cases and performed in 8 cases. CONCLUSIONS In the real-world setting, cTBB has a meaningful diagnostic value in the context of a MDT approach and may enable histopathological assessment even in patients with more advanced disease unsuitable for SLB.","Wälscher, Julia; Groß, Benjamin; Eberhardt, Ralf; Heussel, Claus Peter; Eichinger, Monika; Warth, Arne; Lasitschka, Felix; Herth, Felix J F; Kreuter, Michael",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,577,31

The cause of preterm birth is complex, multifactorial, and likely dependent, at least in part, on the gestational age of the fetus. Intrauterine infection is frequent in preterm deliveries that occur at <32 weeks gestation; understanding how the fetus responds to proinflammatory insult will be an important step towards early preterm birth prevention. However, animal studies of infection and inflammation in prematurity commonly use older fetuses that possess comparatively mature immune systems. OBJECTIVE Aiming to characterize acute fetal responses to microbial agonist at a clinically relevant gestation, we used 92-day-old fetuses (62% of term) to develop a chronically catheterized sheep model of very preterm pregnancy. We hypothesized that any acute fetal systemic inflammatory responses would be driven by signaling from the tissues exposed to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide that is introduced into the amniotic fluid. STUDY DESIGN Eighteen ewes that were carrying a single fetus at 92 days of gestation had recovery surgery to place fetal tracheal, jugular, and intraamniotic catheters. Animals were recovered for 24 hours before being administered either intraamniotic E coli lipopolysaccharide (n = 9) or sterile saline solution (n = 9). Samples were collected for 48 hours before euthanasia and necroscopy. Fetal inflammatory responses were characterized by microarray analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS Intraamniotic lipopolysaccharide reached the distal trachea within 2 hours. Lipopolysaccharide increased tracheal fluid interleukin-8 within 2 hours and generated a robust inflammatory response that was characterized by interleukin-6 signaling pathway activation and up-regulation of cell proliferation but no increases in inflammatory mediator expression in cord blood RNA. CONCLUSIONS In very preterm sheep fetuses, lipopolysaccharide stimulates inflammation in the fetal lung and fetal skin and stimulates a systemic inflammatory response that is not generated by fetal blood cells. These data argue for amniotic fluid-exposed tissues that play a key role in driving acute fetal and intrauterine inflammatory responses.","Kemp, Matthew W; Molloy, Timothy J; Usuda, Haruo; Woodward, Eleanor; Miura, Yuichiro; Payne, Matthew S; Ireland, Demelza J; Jobe, Alan H; Kallapur, Suhas G; Stock, Sarah J; Spiller, Owen B; Newnham, John P; Saito, Masatoshi",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,577,16

The effect of the flow perfusion bioreactor culturing conditions was investigated in vitro for 0, 7, 14 and 28 days on scaffolds seeded with dermal fibroblasts. The cultured constructs were subsequently studied subcutaneously (SC) in an in vivo animal model. The results of in vitro studies demonstrated that the perfusion system facilitated increased cell proliferation and homogenous distribution in the PLLA-collagen scaffolds compared to static conditions. A highly cellularised 3D-tissue construct was formed by 7 days incubation under perfusion conditions, with increased cellularity by the 28 day time point. The in vivo model demonstrated that implanting constructs with high cellularity resulted in exceptional cell stabilisation, with the survival of implanted cells and expression of the phenotypically-relevant extracellular matrix proteins collagen types I and III, studied by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and immunohistochemistry.

We describe an easy method for fixation of the anvil using a one-handed sliding-knot technique after the anvil has been inserted into the esophagus. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE After removing the stomach, the main operator makes a whip stitch at the end of the esophagus using a long piece of monofilament string. Both ends of the string are pulled out from the port. A knot is then made and brought close the esophagus twice (sliding granny knots). After inserting the anvil into the esophagus, the main operator pulls the main standing string with one hand, applying vibration only. This causes the knots to tighten the anvil. Then, one or two knots are added to make sure that the anvil is firmly fixed in place. In addition, we routinely add one more ligation with a ready-made ligating loop. DISCUSSION This method is easy and reliable, and does not require special devices or skills when performing reconstruction after laparoscopic total gastrectomy. Because of these factors, it has the potential to be widely used to perform esophagojejunostomy.","Yamada, Takanobu; Shirai, Junya; Osaragi, Tomohiko; Sujishi, Ken; Kumazu, Yuta; Kamiya, Mariko; Sugano, Nobuhiro; Hatori, Shinsuke; Yoneyama, Katsuya; Kasahara, Akio; Oshima, Takashi; Yukawa, Norio; Rino, Yasushi; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Masuda, Munetaka; Yamamoto, Yuji",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,577,1

Here, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the impact of individual and municipal-level social inequalities on the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City. METHODS We analyzed suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, from the Mexico City Epidemiological Surveillance System from February 24th, 2020, to March 31 st, 2021. COVID-19 outcomes included rates of hospitalization, severe COVID-19, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. We evaluated socioeconomic occupation as an individual risk, and social lag, which captures municipal-level social vulnerability, and urban population density as proxies of structural risk factors. Impact of reductions in vehicular mobility on COVID-19 rates and the influence of risk factors were also assessed. Finally, we assessed discrepancies in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 excess mortality using death certificates from the General Civil Registry. RESULTS We detected vulnerable groups who belonged to economically unfavored sectors and experienced increased risk of COVID-19 outcomes. Cases living in marginalized municipalities with high population density experienced greater for COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, policies to reduce vehicular mobility had differential impacts modified by social lag and urban population density. Finally, we report an under-registry of COVID-19 deaths along with an excess mortality closely related to marginalized and densely populated communities in an ambulatory setting.

We compared patients with lower extremity injuries directly admitted to a tertiary hospital for definitive care with patients transferred to that hospital following initial treatment elsewhere. METHODS PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched. Participants sustained lower extremity injuries, definitively treated at a tertiary hospital. Interventions were direct admission to a tertiary hospital for definitive care and patients transferred to that hospital for definitive care after initial management at another location. PRISMA, Cochrane, and grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation certainty-evidence guidelines were implemented. RESULTS Nineteen studies published from 1991 to 2020 compared 3,367 patients directly admitted with 1,046 patients transferred to a hospital for definitive management of lower extremity injuries. Direct admission to a tertiary center, compared with transfer, decreased time to first definitive surgical procedure (standard mean difference, -0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.57 to -0.16; p = 0.0006; participants, 788; studies, 6; I2 = 34%; high-certainty evidence) and wound infections (risk ratio [RR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.19-0.77; p = 0.007; participants, 475; studies, 7; I2 = 27%; high-certainty evidence).

113963,113963,113963,Pulse Oximetry with Two Infrared Wavelengths without Calibration in Extracted Arterial Blood.,16.833834,8.21099,2018,"We present studies of spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP) using ternary xenon-nitrogen-helium gas mixtures at high xenon partial pressures (up to 1330 Torr partial pressure at loading, out of 2660 Torr total pressure) in a 500-mL volume SEOP cell, using two automated batch-mode clinical-scale 129Xe hyperpolarizers operating under continuous high-power (~170 W) pump laser irradiation. In this pilot study, we explore SEOP in gas mixtures with up to 45% 4He content under a wide range of experimental conditions. When an aluminum jacket cooling/heating design was employed (GEN-3 hyperpolarizer), 129Xe polarization (%PXe) of 55.9 ± 0.9% was observed with mono-exponential build-up rate γSEOP of 0.049 ± 0.001 min-1 for the 4He-rich mixture (1000 Torr Xe/900 Torr He, 100 Torr N2), compared to %PXe of 49.3 ± 3.3% at γSEOP of 0.035 ± 0.004 min-1 for the N2-rich gas mixture (1000 Torr Xe/100 Torr He, 900 Torr N2). When forced-air cooling/heating was used (GEN-2 hyperpolarizer), %PXe of 83.9 ± 2.7% was observed at γSEOP of 0.045 ± 0.005 min-1 for the 4He-rich mixture (1000 Torr Xe/900 Torr He, 100 Torr N2), compared to %PXe of 73.5 ± 1.3% at γSEOP of 0.028 ± 0.001 min-1 for the N2-rich gas mixture (1000 Torr Xe and 1000 Torr N2). Additionally, %PXe of 72.6 ± 1.4% was observed at a build-up rate γSEOP of 0.041 ± 0.003 min-1 for a super-high-density 4He-rich mixture (1330 Torr Xe/1200 Torr 4He/130 Torr N2), compared to %PXe = 56.6 ± 1.3% at a build-up rate of γSEOP of 0.034 ± 0.002 min-1 for an N2-rich mixture (1330 Torr Xe/1330 Torr N2) using forced air cooling/heating. The observed SEOP hyperpolarization performance under these conditions corresponds to %PXe improvement by a factor of 1.14 ± 0.04 at 1000 Torr Xe density and by up to a factor of 1.28 ± 0.04 at 1330 Torr Xe density at improved SEOP build-up rates by factors of 1.61 ± 0.18 and 1.21 ± 0.11 respectively. Record %PXe levels have been obtained here: 83.9 ± 2.7% at 1000 Torr Xe partial pressure and 72.6 ± 1.4% at 1330 Torr Xe partial pressure. In addition to improved thermal stability for SEOP, the use of 4He-rich gas mixtures also reduces the overall density of produced inhalable HP contrast agents; this property may be desirable for HP 129Xe inhalation by human subjects in clinical settings-especially in populations with heavily impaired lung function. The described approach should enjoy ready application in the production of inhalable 129Xe contrast agent with near-unity 129Xe nuclear spin polarization.","Birchall, Jonathan R; Nikolaou, Panayiotis; Irwin, Robert K; Barlow, Michael J; Ranta, Kaili; Coffey, Aaron M; Goodson, Boyd M; Pokochueva, Ekaterina V; Kovtunov, Kirill V; Koptyug, Igor V; Chekmenev, Eduard Y",Journal of magnetic resonance,577,1

The purpose of this study is to share the experience of a distant online lecture on a surgical procedure and related anatomy in a three-dimensional virtual reality workspace and to compare it with reported teaching methods, i.e., an in-person class and a Zoom online class. The lecture was delivered by three authors of this article in a virtual-reality workspace that enables people to meet through VR. The lectures were about combinations of dental surgical procedures and related clinical anatomy. Physically, the attendees could have been located anywhere in the world, so lecturers joined from USA and the attendees were all from Japan. VR environment and its flexibility enabled attendees to join the lecture actively, helping them to gain understanding of the surgical procedure and anatomy more efficiently. The use of VR technology with a live communication tool demonstrated in this study has several advantages over previous education methods, although there are still technical issues or disadvantages that need to be addressed. Development of the technology and app/software is required so that more data can be processed at higher speed. Use of VR technology with a live communication tool could be an alternative teaching method. Its overall advantages are a closer look at the slides/monitor and concurrent observation of the multiple assets in various directions by multiple attendees. These advantages cannot be achieved by any other teaching method without VR assets with the workspace provided by Spatial. Even during the mandatory social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this could enable us to foster three-dimensional understanding of surgery and related anatomy. Further study is now needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this newly proposed teaching method by comparing it with traditional in-person and online classes with a live communication tool.

The hypothesis of the present study is that attending lessons in Greek traditional dance is an effective method for managing anxiety and stress in patients diagnosed with cancer of any type both during and after treatment. The study was conducted on 300 cancer patients (150 experimental subjects, 150 controls) selected by Attica hospitals and nonprofit cancer patients' organizations. Each patient in the experimental group attended an 8-week Greek traditional dance lesson program. Lessons were held twice per week, lasting 60 min each. A similar group of cancer patients not participating in any organized physical activity during the same time period served as a control group. Data were collected using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (Dass-21) questionnaire and subjected to reliability analysis (Cronbach's alpha) and deviation-dependent analysis (one-way repeated). Both stress and anxiety values decreased significantly in the experimental group (stress value: initial mean = 16.27, second mean = 2.58, final mean = 6.77, p < 0.001; anxiety value: initial mean = 15.59, second mean = 2.81, final mean = 5.35, p < 0.001). In contrast, no significant fluctuation was observed in the control group. Thus, there was a significant decrease in stress and anxiety values in cancer patients who attended Greek traditional dances lessons with important psychotherapeutic significance.","Karathanou, Ioanna; Bebetsos, E; Filippou, F; Psirri, A; Konas, I",Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,577,1

METHODS Sets of panoramic (PAN) - cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of 218 patients were assessed for ILTM classification, contact with mandibular canal, contact and resorption of the lower second molar (LSM), intraoperative planning and postoperative expectations. RESULTS Percentage agreement and McNemar test compared PAN vs CBCT assessments. Logistic regression analyzed the dependency of change in surgical planning considering the changes in diagnostic features; descriptive statistics was used to observe the expectation of postoperative complications and paresthesia. Differences were found between PAN vs CBCT for classification of impaction and positioning, LSM relationship, choice for crown and root sectioning and expectation of postoperative complications (all with p < 0.001). Logistic regression indicated that the change in diagnosis caused by CBCT examination did not change the clinical decision to extract ILTM but altered the planning of intraoperative steps such as osteotomy, crown sectioning and relaxing incision. The expectation of postoperative complications decreased when professionals planned the ILTM removal using 3D images. CONCLUSIONS We concluded that changes in the diagnosis after CBCT examination can lead to alterations in the treatment plan of impacted lower third molar.","Mendonça, Lucas Moreira; Gaêta-Araujo, Hugo; Cruvinel, Pedro Bastos; Tosin, Ingrid Wenzel; Azenha, Marcelo Rodrigues; Ferraz, Emanuela Prado; Oliveira-Santos, Christiano; Tirapelli, Camila",Dento maxillo facial radiology,577,1

However, on March 26, 2020, six leading medical organizations released a joint statement warning clinicians that attempting this technique could lead to poor outcomes and high mortality. Nevertheless, hospitals around the United States and abroad are considering this technique out of desperation (eg, New York), but there is little data to guide their approach. The overall objective of this study is to utilize a computational model of mechanically ventilated lungs to assess how patient-specific lung mechanics and ventilator settings impact lung tidal volume (VT). METHODS We developed a lumped-parameter computational model of multiple patients connected to a shared ventilator and validated it against a similar experimental study. We used this model to evaluate how patient-specific lung compliance and resistance would impact VT under 4 ventilator settings of pressure control level, PEEP, breathing frequency, and inspiratory:expiratory ratio. RESULTS Our computational model predicts VT within 10% of experimental measurements. Using this model to perform a parametric study, we provide proof-of-concept for an algorithm to better match patients in different hypothetical scenarios of a single ventilator shared by > 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS Assigning patients to preset ventilators based on their required level of support on the lower PEEP/higher [Formula: see text] scale of the National Institute of Health's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ARDS Clinical Network (ARDSNet), secondary to lung mechanics, could be used to overcome some of the legitimate concerns of placing multiple patients on a single ventilator. We emphasize that our results are currently based on a computational model that has not been validated against any preclinical or clinical data. Therefore, clinicians considering this approach should not look to our study as an exact estimate of predicted patient VT values.","Kheyfets, Vitaly O; Lammers, Steven R; Wagner, Jennifer; Bartels, Karsten; Piccoli, Jerome; Smith, Bradford J",Respiratory care,577,5

Many viruses enter the host cell through an endocytic pathway and hijack endosomes for their journey towards sites of replication. For delivery of their genome to the host cell cytoplasm and to avoid degradation, viruses have to escape this endosomal compartment without host detection. Viruses have developed complex mechanisms to penetrate the endosomal membrane and have evolved to co-opt several host factors to facilitate endosomal escape. Conversely, there is an extensive variety of cellular mechanisms to counteract or impede viral replication. At the level of cell entry, there are cellular defense mechanisms that recognize endosomal membrane damage caused by virus-induced membrane fusion and pore formation, as well as restriction factors that block these processes. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and accompanying poster, we describe the different mechanisms that viruses have evolved to escape the endosomal compartment, as well as the counteracting cellular protection mechanisms.

The aim of this study was to identify Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) biomarkers, to investigate their correlation with disease severity and to evaluate their usefulness for follow-up. Methods Fifty patients diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 were included in March 2020. Clinical and biological data were collected at admission, during hospitalization and one month after discharge. Patients were divided into two severity groups: non-ICU (28) and ICU and/or death (22) to stratify the risk. Results Blood parameters in COVID-19 patients at admission showed increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (100%), ferritin (92%), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (80%), white blood cell (WBC) count (26%) with lymphopenia (52%) and eosinopenia (98%). There were significant differences in levels of CRP, ferritin, D-dimers, fibrinogen, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) among the two severity groups. Mapping of biomarker's kinetics distinguished early and late parameters. CRP, ferritin, LDH, lymphopenia and eosinopenia were present upon admission with a peak at the first week. Late biomarkers such as anemia, neutrophilia and elevated liver biomarkers appeared after one week with a peak at three weeks of hospitalization. Conclusions We confirmed that high-values of CRP, NLR, D-dimers, ferritin as well as lymphopenia and eosinopenia were consistently found and are good markers for risk stratification. Kinetics of these biomarkers correlate well with COVID-19 severity.

Despite the new available criteria, its early diagnosis remains difficult, highlighting the necessity of looking for a valid muscle wasting biomarker. Myostatin, a muscle mass negative regulator, is one of the potential candidates. The aim of this work is to point out various factors affecting the potential of myostatin as a biomarker of muscle wasting. Based on the literature review, we can say that recent studies produced conflicting results and revealed a number of potential confounding factors influencing their use in sarcopenia diagnosing. These factors include physiological variables (such as age, sex and physical activity) as well as a variety of disorders (including heart failure, metabolic syndrome, kidney failure and inflammatory diseases) and differences in laboratory measurement methodology. Our conclusion is that although myostatin alone might not prove to be a feasible biomarker, it could become an important part of a recently proposed panel of muscle wasting biomarkers. However, a thorough understanding of the interrelationship of these markers, as well as establishing a valid measurement methodology for myostatin and revising current research data in the light of new criteria of sarcopenia, is needed.","Baczek, Jan; Silkiewicz, Marta; Wojszel, Zyta Beata",Nutrients,577,16

Previous studies have highlighted the importance of distinguishing between DNA methylation in discrete functional regions; however, integrated non-promoter DNA methylation and gene expression analyses across a wide number of tumor types and corresponding normal tissues have not been performed. Through integrated analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, we examined 32 tumor types and identified 57 tumor suppressors and oncogenes out of 260 genes exhibiting a correlation of > 0.5 between gene body methylation and gene expression in at least 1 tumor type. The lymphocyte-specific gene CARD11 exhibits robust association between gene body methylation and expression across 19 of 32 tumor types examined. It is significantly overexpressed in kidney renal cell carcinoma (KIRC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumor tissues in comparison to respective control samples; and is significantly associated with lower overall survival in KIRC. Contrary to its canonical function in lymphocyte NF-kB activation, CARD11 activates the mTOR pathway in KIRC and LUAD, resulting in suppressed autophagy. Furthermore, demethylation of a CpG island within the gene body of CARD11 decreases gene expression.

Germany has widely adopted postoperative protocols for pain management including oral opioids for rescue medication, but the effectiveness of such protocols has only been evaluated longitudinally in a before and after setting. The aim of this cohort analysis was to compare the effectiveness of an oral opioid rescue medication algorithm for postoperative management of pain to the gold standard of patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA). MATERIAL AND METHODS This study compared cohorts of patients of two prospective observational studies undergoing elective total hip replacement. After surgery patients received piritramide to achieve a pain score of ≤3 on the numeric rating scale (NRS 0-10). A protocol was started consisting of oral long-acting oxycodone and ibuprofen (basic analgesia). Cohort 1 (C1, 126 patients) additionally received an oral opioid rescue medication (hydromorphone) when reporting pain >3 on the NRS. Cohort 2 (C2, 88 patients) was provided with an opioid by PCIA (piritramide) for opioid rescue medication. Primary endpoints were pain intensity at rest, during movement, and maximum pain intensity within the first 24 h postoperative. Secondary endpoints were opioid consumption, functional outcome and patient satisfaction with pain management. RESULTS Pain during movement and maximum pain intensity were higher in C1 compared to C2: pain on movement median 1st-3rd quartile: 6 (3.75-8) vs. 5 (3-7), p = 0.023; maximum pain intensity: 7 (5-9) vs. 5 (3-8), p = 0.008. There were no differences in pain intensity at rest or between women and men in either group. The mean opioid consumption in all patients (combined PACU, baseline, and rescue medication; mean ± SD mg ME) was 126.6 ± 51.8 mg oral ME (median 120 (87.47-154.25) mg ME). Total opioid consumption was lower in C1 than C2 (117 ± 46 mg vs 140 ± 56 mg, p = 0.002) due to differences in rescue opioids (C1: 57 ± 37 mg ME, C2: 73 ± 43 mg ME, p = 0.006, Z = -2.730). Basic analgesia opioid use was comparable (C1: 54 ± 31 mg ME, C2: 60 ± 36 mg ME, p = 0.288, Z = -1.063). There were no differences in respect to the addition of non-opioids and reported quality of mobilization, sleep, frequency of nausea and vomiting, or general satisfaction with pain management. CONCLUSION In this study PCIA provided a better reduction of pain intensity, when compared to a standardized protocol with oral opioid rescue medication. This effect was associated with increased opioid consumption. There were no differences in frequencies of opioid side effects. This study was a retrospective analysis of two cohorts of a major project. As with all retrospective studies, our analysis has several limitations to consider. Data can only represent the observation of clinical practice. It cannot reflect the quality of a statement of a randomized controlled trial.

However, it is often necessary to manage such patients with deep sedation because their cooperation cannot be obtained. During deep sedation, undetected hypoventilation can lead to severe complications, such as hypoxia. Recently, capnographic monitoring has been advocated as a useful technique for preventing hypoxia during sedation. This randomized control trial evaluated whether the use of capnography reduces the incidence of hypoxia during the deep sedation of patients for dental treatment. This study involved patients with intellectual disabilities who underwent dental treatment under sedation. The subjects were randomized to the intervention group (I-group) or control group (C-group). All of the patients underwent routine monitoring, as well as bispectral index (BIS) and capnographic monitoring; however, only an independent observer had access to the patients' capnographic data during the dental procedures. Sedation was maintained at a BIS of 50 to 70 by administration of propofol. In the I-group, the independent observer signaled to the dental anesthesiologist if the capnogram indicated that the patient had been suffering from alveolar hypoventilation or apnea for >15 s. In the C-group, the observer signaled to the dental anesthesiologist if the capnogram indicated that the patient had been suffering from alveolar hypoventilation or apnea for >60 s. In both groups, the dental anesthesiologists responded to the signals using appropriate airway management strategies. The primary endpoint of this study was the incidence of hypoxia during dental treatment, which was defined as oxygen saturation of <95%. Hypoxemic episodes occurred in 13.4% and 34.8% of cases in the I-group and C-group, respectively. The incidence of hypoxia was significantly lower in the I-group. These results suggest that capnographic monitoring during deep sedation for dental treatment prevents hypoxemic episodes by allowing the early detection of hypoventilation. Knowledge Transfer Statement: This is the first randomized controlled trial to examine whether the use of capnography reduces the incidence of hypoxia during deep sedation for dental treatment. The findings of this study can be used by clinicians to aid decision-making regarding dental sedation standards at individual clinics. Moreover, they can be used as high-level evidence during the production or updating of clinical guidelines for dental sedation by leading associations.","Takaya, K; Higuchi, H; Ishii-Maruhama, M; Yabuki-Kawase, A; Honda, Y; Tomoyasu, Y; Maeda, S; Miyawaki, T",JDR clinical and translational research,577,7

We hypothesized that diminished TOF-MRA signal intensity distal to an intracranial stenosis predicts stroke risk. METHODS TOF-MRA was acquired prospectively in the SONIA-WASID trials. The distal/proximal signal intensity ratio (SIR) was calculated from 3 mm regions of interest, blinded to outcome. Univariate and multivariate analyses included clinical variables, SIR, and invasive angiography measures to identify predictors for risk of stroke in the territory. RESULTS 189 patients with 50-99% symptomatic intracranial stenosis in SONIA-WASID had TOF-MRA available. In univariate analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) for stroke in the territory of the symptomatic artery with SIR < .9 was 5.2 (1.8, 15.3; P < .001) as compared to SIR ≥ .9. Multivariate analysis correcting for baseline systolic blood pressure, LDL, centrally measured percent stenosis, recency of symptoms, TICI and downstream collaterals, the HR for SIR < .9 was 10.9 (2.0, 58.9; P < .001). In those with <70% stenosis, a SIR < .9 maintained a significant association with recurrent stroke in the territory (P = .006), with a 2-year event rate of 17.3%. CONCLUSIONS Fractional flow assessed by TOF-MRA SIR may be a useful noninvasive tool to identify high-risk intracranial lesions.

T cells are necessary for viral clearance, and many age-dependent intrinsic T cell defects have been documented. However, the development of robust T cell responses in the lung also requires respiratory DCs (rDCs), which must process antigen and migrate to draining LNs (DLNs), and little is known about age-related defects in these T cell-extrinsic functions. Here, we show that increases in prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) expression in mouse lungs upon aging correlate with a progressive impairment in rDC migration to DLNs. Decreased rDC migration resulted in diminished T cell responses and more severe clinical disease in older mice infected with respiratory viruses. Diminished rDC migration associated with virus-specific defects in T cell responses and was not a result of cell-intrinsic defect, rather it reflected the observed age-dependent increases in PGD(2) expression. Blocking PGD(2) function with small-molecule antagonists enhanced rDC migration, T cell responses, and survival. This effect correlated with upregulation on rDCs of CCR7, a chemokine receptor involved in DC chemotaxis. Our results suggest that inhibiting PGD(2) function may be a useful approach to enhance T cell responses against respiratory viruses in older humans.","Zhao, Jincun; Zhao, Jingxian; Legge, Kevin; Perlman, Stanley",The Journal of clinical investigation,577,24

The competency-based curriculum started in India last year onwards allotted more hours to practical teaching than lectures. As the lockdown extended, there was a need to shift laboratory teaching to online mode. We describe our experience of developing and implementing a framework to rapidly shift practical lab teaching of preclinical subjects to online mode. Methods A mixed method study was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown period in a public funded medical institute of India. A framework utilizing the principles of small group teaching using the available resources was developed and implemented. Online feedback was obtained from students, while in-depth telephonic interview was conducted for teachers. Results A Demonstrate-Engage-Assess framework for online Practical teaching of Preclinical subjects (DEAPP) was developed and implemented. Feedback was obtained from 103 first year students and six teachers from preclinical subjects. Around 62%-80% students were satisfied with online practical teaching or agreed with benefits of various online tools used in the teaching sessions. Teachers found the framework more planned, and resource efficient, while students found it to be more engaging, enjoyable, and motivated for learning. No face-to-face interaction, non-experiential learning, and adaptation to newer technology were the main barriers perceived in online practical laboratory teaching. Conclusion DEAPP framework was found to be feasible for rapid online transition of practical lab teaching and reported by the students and teachers as engaging, enjoyable and motivated learning.","Khan, Amir Maroof; Patra, Somdatta; Vaney, Neelam; Mehndiratta, Mohit; Chauhan, Renu","Medical journal, Armed Forces India",577,1

This study characterizes the epidemiology of Kawasaki disease in Taiwan between 2003 and 2006. METHODS Using Taiwan's 2003-2006 national health insurance claims, we investigated the epidemiologic features of Kawasaki disease (ICD-9-CM code 446.1) and coronary artery aneurysm formation (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 414.11) and compared the incidences of these diseases with those occurring between 1996 and 2002 in Taiwan and those reported by other countries. RESULTS During our 4-year study period, 3877 children and adolescents <20 years of age were hospitalized for Kawasaki disease. Ninety percent of these children were <5 years of age, and the male/female ratio was 1.62:1. The annual incidence of Kawasaki disease was 153 in 100000 children <1 year of age, 111 in children 1 year of age, 58 in children 2 years of age, 30 in children 3 years of age, 19 in children 4 years of age, and 5.2 in children 5 to 9 years of age. The overall incidence was 69 cases per 100000 for children <5 years of age. Kawasaki disease recurred in 1.5% of all cases. Kawasaki disease occurred most frequently in the summer and least frequently in the winter. Coronary artery aneurysm occurred in 7.2% (279 of 3877) of all Kawasaki disease cases. CONCLUSIONS The overall incidence of Kawasaki disease was 69 in 100000 children <5 years of age between 2003 and 2006 in Taiwan, comparable with the incidence of 66 in 100000 children between 1996 and 2002. Taiwan has the third highest incidence of Kawasaki disease in the world, after Japan and Korea. In Taiwan, it occurs more frequently during the summer.","Huang, Wen-Chan; Huang, Li-Min; Chang, I-Shou; Chang, Luan-Yin; Chiang, Bor-Luen; Chen, Pei-Jer; Wu, Mei-Hwan; Lue, Hung-Chi; Lee, Chun-Yun",Pediatrics,577,24

Enabling student contribution during clinical placements can enhance student learning and quality of care. Our medical student RACF placement includes a learning task where students recommend improvements to resident care. This study aimed to identify these recommendations and measure how many were adopted. METHODS Students completed a medical assessment of a resident during their RACF placement, summarising their recommendations in a letter to the resident's general practitioner (GP). Recommendations were categorised for quantification and audit. Three months after the time of recommendation residents' files were audited. Definitions and descriptive statistics of the types of recommendations, and whether they had been implemented, are reported. RESULTS Forty residents and 43 students participated in the study. In total, 391 recommendations were made. Medication recommendations were most common (47%), followed by allied health referrals (12%), lifestyle changes (10%) and GP review (10%). Smaller numbers of recommendations for nursing care, investigations, specialist review and patient education were made. Seventy-seven recommendations were adopted. DISCUSSION Student learning is enhanced when contributing to resident care, and educators can structure clinical placements to support this. Using an existing student learning task to feed into genuine quality improvements for care is one example of how this might be implemented. This study gives insight into types of recommendations students make, suggesting further research to explore barriers and enablers to maximise the benefits of student contributions.","Dallas, Anthea; Lau, Jenny Tu Yung; Ong, Jake Shen Loong; Green, Damaris; Presser, Jennifer",The clinical teacher,577,1

Different methods of adhesion prevention have been developed, including coated meshes and separate antiadhesive barriers (SABs). In this study one type of mesh was tested with different SABs, which were fixed to the sutured mesh using fibrin sealant. The primary aim was to compare adhesion prevention between different SABs. Secondary aims were the assessment of tissue integration and evaluation of SAB fixation with fibrin sealant. METHODS Thirty-two rats were randomized to one of three treatment groups (SurgiWrap, Prevadh and Seprafilm) or a control group (no SAB). Animals were operated on with an open IPOM technique (8 per group). One macroporous polypropylene mesh per animal (2 × 2 cm) was fixed with four non-absorbable sutures. An antiadhesive barrier of 2·5 × 2·5 cm was fixed with fibrin sealant. After 30 days, adhesion formation, tissue integration, seroma formation, inflammation and vascularization were evaluated macroscopically and by histology. RESULTS Prevadh and Seprafilm groups showed a significant reduction in adhesion formation compared with the control group. Tissue integration of the mesh was reduced in these groups. Fibrin sealant fixed the SAB to the mesh securely in all groups. CONCLUSION Prevadh and Seprafilm are potent materials for the reduction of adhesion formation. A potential relationship between effective adhesion prevention and impaired tissue integration of the implant was observed. Fibrin sealant proved an excellent agent for SAB fixation.","Gruber-Blum, S; Petter-Puchner, A H; Brand, J; Fortelny, R H; Walder, N; Oehlinger, W; Koenig, F; Redl, H",The British journal of surgery,577,29

Effective HCMV vaccines would need to induce potent and balanced humoral and cellular immune responses. In this pilot study, immunogenicity studies were conducted in mice to examine HCMV antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses when a heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy was tested. DNA vaccines expressing either targets of protective antibody responses (gB and gM/gN) or well characterized T cell immunogens (pp65, pp150, and IE1) were used as the priming immunization while the live attenuated HCMV vaccine Towne strain was used as the boost, which may act like an inactivated vaccine due to the inability of HCMV to replicate in a mouse host. Our data indicate that while DNA vaccines were effective in priming HCMV-specific antibody responses, the final titers of gB- or gM-specific antibodies were not much different from those elicited by using multiple immunizations of HCMV alone. In contrast, DNA priming significantly enhanced T cell responses against gB, pp65, and IE1 as measured by IFN-γ. However, HCMV alone was not effective in eliciting strong T cell immune responses when used in a mouse host. Our data indicate that the complexity of antigen composition from a large virus, such as HCMV, may affect the profile of immune responses when viral vaccines are used as a boost.","Gil, Anna; Shen, Siyuan; Coley, Scott; Gibson, Laura; Diamond, Don J; Wang, Shixia; Lu, Shan",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,577,24

There is evidence from preclinical models that blocking programmed death receptor 1 (PD1) protects against RNA virus infections, which suggests that patients with cancer receiving ICB may have lower rates of viral infection. However, given the heterogeneity of patient characteristics, this would be difficult to demonstrate using population-based registries or in clinical trials. Most studies of the impact of ICB therapy on the course of COVID-19 have centered in studying its potential detrimental impact on the course of the COVID-19 infection, in particular on the development of the most severe inflammatory complications. This is a logical concern as it is becoming clear that complications of COVID-19 such as severe respiratory distress syndrome are related to interferon signaling, which is the pathway that leads to expression of the PD1 ligand PD-L1. Therefore, PD1/PDL1 ICB could potentially increase inflammatory processes, worsening the disease course for patients. However, review of the current evidence does not support the notion that ICB therapy worsens complications from COVID-19, and we conclude that it supports the continued use of ICB therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic provided that we now collect data on the effects of such therapy on COVID-19 vaccination.","Ribas, Antoni; Garassino, Marina Chiara",Cancer immunology research,577,28

In certain clinical scenarios, examining tissue samples for identification of the infectious organism becomes important. As culture-based methods rarely yield results, the performance of an Aspergillus-specific nested PCR in fresh tissue or pleural effusion samples was evaluated. Fresh tissue (n = 59) and effusion (n = 47) specimens from 79 immunocompromised patients were subjected to an Aspergillus-specific PCR assay. Twenty-six patients had proven (n = 20) or probable (n = 6) IFD, according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria, while the remaining patients were classified as having either possible IFD (n = 30) or no IFD (n = 23). IA was identified as the underlying IFD in 21/26 proven/probable cases. PCR positivity was observed for 18/21 proven/probable and 6 possible IA cases; cases classified as no IA did not show positive signals. Patients with proven IFD (n = 5) with cultures positive for non-Aspergillus molds also had negative Aspergillus PCR results. Aspergillus PCR performance analysis yielded sensitivity and specificity values of 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65% to 95%) and 100% (95% CI, 86% to 100%), respectively, thus leading to a diagnostic odds ratio of >200. In this analysis, good diagnostic performance of the PCR assay for detection of IA was observed for tissue samples, while effusion samples showed lower sensitivity rates. PCR testing represents a complementary tool; a positive PCR result strengthens the likelihood of IA, whereas IA seems unlikely in cases with negative results but findings could indicate non-Aspergillus IFD. Thus, PCR testing of these specimens enhances the diagnostic capabilities.","Reinwald, M; Spiess, B; Heinz, W J; Heussel, C P; Bertz, H; Cornely, O A; Hahn, J; Lehrnbecher, T; Kiehl, M; Laws, H J; Wolf, H H; Schwerdtfeger, R; Schultheis, B; Burchardt, A; Klein, M; Dürken, M; Claus, B; Schlegel, F; Hummel, M; Hofmann, W-K; Buchheidt, D",Journal of clinical microbiology,577,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional epidemiological study using a model of the city of Tyumen was conducted on a representative sample of the population among males of mature age (4564 years). Based on standard epidemiological methods, IHD was established according to strict epidemiological criteria definite IHD. The study of the factors of psycho-emotional stress (depression, hostility, life exhaustion) was carried out according to the algorithms of the World Health Organization program MONICA-psychosocial. When calculating the odds ratio for the development of IHD, a low level of psycho-emotional stress factors was regarded as the absence of a sign, a combination of medium and high levels as a presence. RESULTS The prevalence of ischemic heart disease in the open population (on the model of Tyumen) according to strict epidemiological criteria in men aged 4554 years was 8.2%, at the age of 5564 years 19.2%, a predominance of painless form of ischemic heart disease was revealed. According to the levels of factors of psychoemotional stress in mature men, mainly the average level of depression and life exhaustion, a high level of hostility were established. In men of an open population (on the model of Tyumen), depending on the psychoemotional stress, a high risk of developing a certain coronary heart disease was established in the age categories 4554 and 5564 years old in the presence of depression, at the age of 5564 years in the presence of hostility or life exhaustion. CONCLUSION Consequently, the data obtained indicate the importance of further studying the factors of psychoemotional stress in men of mature age in Siberian populations, their relationships with conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease, as well as the advisability of preventive measures aimed at weakening the influence of not only conventional risk factors, but also factors of psycho-emotional stress. among the Russian population.","Akimova, E V; Akimov, M Y; Kayumova, M M; Gafarov, V V",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,577,1

METHODS PS was evaluated in 4 neonatal and 6 adult ventilators using a bench model to evaluate triggering, pressurization, and cycling in both the absence and presence of leaks. Delivered tidal volumes were also assessed. Three patients were simulated: a preterm infant (resistance 100 cm H2O/L/s, compliance 2 mL/cm H2O, inspiratory time of the patient [TI] 400 ms, inspiratory effort 1 and 2 cm H2O), a full-term infant (resistance 50 cm H2O/L/s, compliance 5 mL/cm H2O, TI 500 ms, inspiratory effort 2 and 4 cm H2O), and a child (resistance 30 cm H2O/L/s, compliance 10 mL/cm H2O, TI 600 ms, inspiratory effort 5 and 10 cm H2O). Two PS levels were tested (10 and 15 cm H2O) with and without leaks and with and without the leak compensation algorithm activated. RESULTS Without leaks, only 2 neonatal ventilators and one adult ventilator had trigger delays under a given predefined acceptable limit (1/8 TI). Pressurization showed high variability between ventilators. Most ventilators showed TI in excess high enough to seriously impair patient-ventilator synchronization (> 50% of the TI of the subject). In some ventilators, leaks led to autotriggering and impairment of ventilation performance, but the influence of leaks was generally lower in neonatal ventilators. When a noninvasive ventilation algorithm was available, this was partially corrected. In general, tidal volume was calculated too low by the ventilators in the presence of leaks; the noninvasive ventilation algorithm was able to correct this difference in only 2 adult ventilators. CONCLUSIONS No ventilator performed equally well under all tested conditions for all explored parameters. However, neonatal ventilators tended to perform better in the presence of leaks. These findings emphasize the need to improve algorithms for assisted ventilation modes to better deal with situations of high airway resistance, low pulmonary compliance, and the presence of leaks.","Vignaux, Laurence; Piquilloud, Lise; Tourneux, Pierre; Jolliet, Philippe; Rimensberger, Peter C",Respiratory care,577,1

METHODS We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model from a United Kingdom NHS perspective, informed by published analyses of patient-level data. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of THA and TKA in adults with hip or knee osteoarthritis compared with having no arthroplasty surgery during the ten-year time horizon. RESULTS THA and TKA cost < £7,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained at all preoperative scores below the absolute referral thresholds calculated previously (40 for OHS and 41 for OKS). Furthermore, THA cost < £20,000/QALY for patients with OHS of ≤ 45, while TKA was cost-effective for patients with OKS of ≤ 43, since the small improvements in quality of life outweighed the cost of surgery and any subsequent revisions. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that there is little uncertainty around the conclusions. CONCLUSION If society is willing to pay £20,000 per QALY gained, THA and TKA are cost-effective for nearly all patients who currently undergo surgery, including all patients at and above our calculated absolute referral thresholds.

For poorly adherent patients with HIV, barriers to remaining adherent may be overcome by the implementation of targeted interventions delivered via mobile devices. This systematic review is focused specifically on mobile phone technologies to deliver adherence interventions in HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) populations. METHODS This review (PROSPERO #CRD42017065131) systematically extracted data from published literature from five databases on mobile phone interventions to improve adherence to ART for HIV. The reported studies had been conducted between 2007 and 2017. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane method ranking each criterion as low, high, or unclear risk of bias. RESULTS Of the 835 articles returned, we identified 26 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective and prospective cohort trials, or mixed method studies with a comparison group that fit criteria for inclusion. No standard measure of adherence was consistent throughout the examined studies, and assessments by self-report, pill counting, and medication event monitoring system (MEMS) were utilized. The studies reported mixed results, with 17 reporting significant improvements to adherence, 3 reporting improvements without supplying p-values, and 6 reporting no significant change or a reduction in adherence. CONCLUSION The mixed nature of the results exemplifies the need for more comprehensive approaches and larger scale trials to confirm results observed in limited cohort sizes. To better retain satisfactory adherence within the HIV population, and especially in low-resource settings, we recommend that future interventions incorporate multiple strategies: mobile-based reminders, social support structures, and personalized content.","Quintana, Yuri; Gonzalez Martorell, Eduardo A; Fahy, Darren; Safran, Charles",Applied clinical informatics,577,8

These channels facilitate microaspiration of subglottic secretions, which is the main pathogenic mechanism leading to intubation-related pneumonia. Ultrathin polyurethane (PU)-cuffed ETTs are developed to minimize channel formation in the cuff wall and therefore the risk of microaspiration and respiratory infections. METHODS We systematically reviewed the available literature for laboratory and clinical studies comparing fluid leakage or microaspiration and/or rates of respiratory infections between ETTs with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cuffs and ETTs with PU cuffs. RESULTS The literature search revealed nine in vitro experiments, one in vivo (animal) experiment, and five clinical studies. Among the 9 in vitro studies, 10 types of PU-cuffed ETTs were compared with 17 types of PVC-cuffed tubes, accounting for 67 vs. 108 experiments with 36 PU-cuffed tubes and 42 PVC-cuffed tubes, respectively. Among the clinical studies, three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that involved 708 patients. In this review, we provide evidence that PU cuffs protect more efficiently than PVC cuffs against fluid leakage or microaspiration. All studies with leakage and/or microaspiration as the primary outcome demonstrated significantly less leakage (eight in vitro and two clinical studies) or at least a tendency toward more efficient sealing (one in vivo animal experiment). In particular, high-risk patients intubated for shorter periods may benefit from the more effective sealing capacity afforded by PU cuffs. For example, cardiac surgery patients experienced a lower risk of early postoperative pneumonia in one RCT. The evidence that PU-cuffed tubes prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is less robust, probably because microaspiration is postponed rather than eliminated. One RCT demonstrated no difference in VAP risk between patients intubated with either PU-cuffed or PVC-cuffed tubes, and one before-after trial demonstrated a favorable reduction in VAP rates following the introduction of PU-cuffed tubes. CONCLUSIONS Current evidence can support the use of PU-cuffed ETTs in high-risk surgical patients, while there is only very limited evidence that PU cuffs prevent pneumonia in patients ventilated for prolonged periods.","Blot, Stijn I; Rello, Jordi; Koulenti, Despoina",Critical care,577,1

Although strength training in children is expected to reduce this differential, a synchronous adaptation in the tendon must be achieved to ensure forces continue to be transmitted to the skeleton with efficiency while minimizing the risk of strain-related tendon injury. We hypothesized that resistance training (RT) would alter tendon mechanical properties in children concomitantly with changes in force production characteristics. Twenty prepubertal children (age 8.9 ± 0.3 yr) were equally divided into control (nontraining) and experimental (training) groups. The training group completed a 10-wk RT intervention consisting of 2-3 sets of 8-15 plantar flexion contractions performed twice weekly on a recumbent calf-raise machine. Achilles tendon properties (cross-sectional area, elongation, stress, strain, stiffness, and Young's modulus), electromechanical delay (EMD; time between the onset of muscle activity and force), rate of force development (RFD; slope of the force-time curve), and rate of electromyographic (EMG) increase (REI; slope of the EMG time curve) were measured before and after RT. Tendon stiffness and Young's modulus increased significantly after RT in the experimental group only (∼29% and ∼25%, respectively); all other tendon properties were not significantly altered, although there were mean decreases in both peak tendon strain and strain at a given force level (14% and 24%, respectively; not significant) which may have implications for tendon injury risk and muscle fiber mechanics. A decrease of ∼13% in EMD was found after RT for the experimental group, which paralleled the increase in tendon stiffness (r = -0.59); however, RFD and REI were unchanged. The present data show that the Achilles tendon adapts to RT in prepubertal children and is paralleled by a change in EMD, although the magnitude of this change did not appear to be sufficient to influence RFD. These findings are of importance within the context of the efficiency and execution of movement.","Waugh, C M; Korff, T; Fath, F; Blazevich, A J",Journal of applied physiology,577,12

In COPD, adherence is generally suboptimal and is impaired by treatment complexity. Objective To estimate the clinical and economic impact of an improvement in treatment adherence due to an increased use of once-daily single-inhaler triple therapy (SITT) in patients with COPD. Patients and Methods A 7-state Markov model with monthly cycles was developed. Patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD, for whom triple therapy is indicated, were included. Outcomes and costs were estimated and compared for two scenarios: current distribution of adherent patients treated with multiple inhaler triple therapies (MITT) vs a potential scenario where patients shifted to once-daily SITT. In the potential scenario, adherence improvement due to once-daily SITT attributes was estimated. Costing was based on the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective (€2019). A 3-year time horizon was defined considering a 3% discount rate for both costs and outcomes. Results A target population of 185,111 patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD currently treated with MITT was estimated. A 20% increase in the use of once-daily SITT in the potential scenario raised adherence up to 52%. This resulted in 6835 exacerbations and 532 deaths avoided, with 775 LYs and 594 QALYs gained. Total savings reached €7,082,105. Exacerbation reduction accounted for 61.8% (€4,378,201) of savings. Conclusion Increasing the use of once-daily SITT in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD treated with triple therapy would be associated with an improvement in adherence, a reduction of exacerbations and deaths, and cost savings for the Spanish NHS.","Miravitlles, Marc; Marín, Alicia; Huerta, Alicia; Carcedo, David; Villacampa, Alba; Puig-Junoy, Jaume",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,577,20

The purpose of this retrospective matched cohort study is to evaluate the effect of flow diversion on the patency of the ophthalmic artery when treating ophthalmic artery aneurysms. METHODS A retrospective review of our prospectively collected institutional database identified 19 ophthalmic artery aneurysms treated with a PED. These were matched according to aneurysm diameter in a 1:2 fashion to ophthalmic artery aneurysms treated via coil embolization, although it is important to note that there was a statistically significance difference in the neck diameter between the two groups (p=0.045). Clinical and angiographic outcomes were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS On follow-up angiography, decreased flow through the ophthalmic artery was observed in 26% of the PED cohort and 0% of the coil embolization cohort (p=0.003). No ophthalmologic complications were noted in either cohort. Complete occlusion at 12 months was more common following PED treatment than coil embolization (74% vs 47%; p=0.089), although lower than reported in previous trials. This may be due to inflow into the ophthalmic artery keeping the aneurysm patent. Retreatments were more common following coil embolization than PED (24% vs 11%), but this was not significant (p=0.304). Permanent morbidity rates were not significantly different between the PED (11%) and coil embolization (3%) cohorts (p=0.255). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that ophthalmic artery aneurysms may be adequately and safely treated with either the PED or coil embolization. However, treatment with the PED carries a higher risk of impeding flow to the ophthalmic artery, although this did not result in clinical sequelae in the current study.","Durst, Christopher R; Starke, Robert M; Clopton, David; Hixson, H Robert; Schmitt, Paul J; Gingras, Jean M; Ding, Dale; Liu, Kenneth C; Crowley, R Webster; Jensen, Mary E; Evans, Avery J; Gaughen, John",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,577,5

Responding to the challenge of limited testing capacity, large-scale (>20 000 tests per day) standardized and fully-automated laboratory (Huo-Yan) was built as an ad-hoc measure. There is so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since quarantine. Methods: Based on the suspected case data released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and the daily testing data of Huo-Yan Laboratory, the impact of detection capabilities on the realization of ""clearing"" and ""clearing the day"" of supected cases was simulated by establishing a novel non-linear and competitive compartments differential model. Results: Without the establishment of Huo-Yan, the suspected cases would increase by 47% to 33 700, the corresponding cost of quarantine would be doubled, the turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of ""daily settlement"" (all newly discovered suspected cases are diagnosed according to the nucleic acid testing result) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. If the Huo-Yan Laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases could start to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44%, and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%. Ideally, if a daily testing capacity of 10 500 tests was achieved immediately after the Hubei lockdown, ""daily settlement"" for all suspected cases could be achieved. Conclusions: Large-scale, standardized clinical testing platform, with nucleic acid testing, high-throughput sequencing, and immunoprotein assessment capabilities, need to be implemented simultaneously in order to maximize the effect of quarantine and minimize the duration and cost of the quarantine.

They also exhibited increased adhesion on type I collagen, and hyperresponsive CRP and CLEC-2-induced α and dense granule release compared with wild-type platelets. Furthermore, using intravital microscopy to ferric chloride (FeCl3)-injured mesenteric arterioles and laser-induced injury of cremaster muscle arterioles, we herein show that thrombi formed in Cc2(-/-) mice were larger and more stable than wild-type controls in vivo. Thus, CEACAM2 is a novel platelet immunoreceptor that acts as a negative regulator of platelet GPVI-collagen interactions and of ITAM receptor CLEC-2 pathways.","Alshahrani, Musaed M; Yang, Eunice; Yip, Jana; Ghanem, Simona S; Abdallah, Simon L; deAngelis, Anthony M; O'Malley, Cindy J; Moheimani, Fatemeh; Najjar, Sonia M; Jackson, Denise E",Blood,577,1

Objectives To review published prevalence rates as well as possible predictors for sleep disturbances in these vulnerable groups, including pre-migration stress, acculturation, and trauma before, during, and after migration, integration, and lifestyle in the host country with implications for predictive, preventive, and personalized medical approach (3PM). Data sources Electronic databases PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Knowledge were searched using (combined) search terms ""migrant,"" ""asylum seeker,"" ""refugee,"" ""sleep disturbances,"" ""sleep disorder,"" ""insomnia,"" and ""sleep wake disorder."" Study eligibility criteria Peer-reviewed studies from 2000 to 2018 reporting data on prevalence and/or predictors of any measure of sleep disturbance were included. Participants Studies on international migrants and refugees, as well as internally displaced populations, were included. Methods We conducted a systematic review on the topic of sleep disorders in migrant and refugee populations. Only published articles and reviews in peer-reviewed journals were included. Results We analyzed five studies on sleep disorders in migrants, five studies on adult refugees, and three on refugee children and adolescents. Prevalence of sleep disorders in migrants and refugees ranges between 39 and 99%. In migrant workers, stress related to integration and adaptation to the host society is connected to higher risks of snoring, metabolic diseases, and insomnia. Sleep disturbances in refugees are predicted by past war experience. Sleep difficulties in adult and child refugees are strongly correlated to trauma. Torture of parents and grandparents can predict sleep disorders in refugee children, while being accompanied by parents to the host country has a protective effect on children's sleep. Conclusions and implications Considering the differences in risk factors, vulnerability, and traumatic life events for different migrant populations, origins of sleep difficulties vary, depending on the migrant populations. Effects on sleep disturbances and sleep quality may be a result of integration in the host country, including changes of lifestyle, such as diet and working hours with implication for OSAS (obstructive sleep apnea) and insomnia. Compared with migrant populations, sleep disturbances in refugee populations are more correlated with mental health symptoms and disorders, especially PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), than with psychosocial problems. In juvenile refugee populations, psychological problems and disturbed sleep are associated with traumatic experiences during their journey to the host country. Findings highlight the need for expert recommendations for development of 3P approach stratified in the following: (1) prediction, including structured exploration of predisposing and precipitating factors that may trigger acute insomnia, screening of the according sleep disorders by validated translated questionnaires and sleep diaries, and a face-to-face or virtual setting and screening of OSAS; (2) target prevention by sleep health education for female and male refugees and migrant workers, including shift workers; and (3) personalized medical approach, including translated cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) and imagery rehearsal therapy for refugees and telehealth programs for improved CPAP adherence in migrants, with the goal to enable better sleep health quality and improved health economy.","Richter, Kneginja; Baumgärtner, Lisa; Niklewski, Günter; Peter, Lukas; Köck, Melanie; Kellner, Stefanie; Hillemacher, Thomas; Büttner-Teleaga, Antje",The EPMA journal,577,16

This had a major negative impact on the wellbeing of residents and their family members. In response, residents and family members increasingly resorted to mediated communication to maintain social contact. To facilitate high-quality mediated social contact between residents in nursing homes and remote family members, we developed an augmented reality (AR)-based communication tool. In this study, we compared the user experience (UX) of AR-communication with that of video calling, for 10 pairs of residents and family members. We measured enjoyment, spatial presence and social presence, attitudes, behavior and conversation duration. In the AR-communication condition, residents perceived a 3D projection of their remote family member onto a chair placed in front of them. In the video calling condition, the family member was shown using 2D video. In both conditions, the family member perceived the resident in the video calling mode on a 2D screen. While residents reported no differences in their UX between both conditions, family members reported higher spatial presence for the AR-communication condition compared to video-calling. Conversation durations were significantly longer during AR-communication than during video calling. We tentatively suggest that there may be (unconscious) differences in UX during AR-based communication compared to video calling. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Abels, E. A.

This is made possible by constructing a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model and with it the authors arrive at noteworthy conclusions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper estimates both fixed and time-varying weights GVAR models for 15 Islamic stock markets with 5,000 bootstrap replications and reports impulse response functions. It simulates four shocks associated with the pandemic: first, a standard error negative shock to oil price;second, a standard error negative shock to the global Islamic stock markets;third, a standard error positive shock to equity-based uncertainty index;and fourth, a standard error negative shock to economic activity (inflation). Findings: The paper shows that the pandemic engenders immediate negative impacts on the Islamic stock markets with the biggest impacts borne by the USA and China and the least by markets in the Middle East. The study documents the magnitudes of the responses to the shocks and shows that the impacts of the pandemic will take about 20 months to wither completely. Originality/value: The findings throw up diversification benefits for investors toward the UAE, Oman, Bahrain and other Middle East markets especially during crisis. It further reveals the need for counter-cyclical measures in all countries to curtail the negative impacts of the pandemic which could linger for up to 20 months. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adediran, I.

Sixteen growing female pigs weighing 10.5 to 14.0 kg were randomly allotted to four treatment supplemented maize feed ingredient with 0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5% SMLM w/w in a completely randomized design with four animals and two replicates per treatment as shown in table1. Results confirmed diurnal variation in temperature-humidity index THI (morning and evening). This variation affects respiratory rate, animal thermal stability and heartbeat rate. There was positive and strong relationship in ameliorating temperature changes in housing environment as animals cope better in diet supplemented with SMLM than control. Respiratory rates were similar across all treatments both morning and evening measurements. However, from table 2, there was significant difference (p<0.05) between control and other treatments with T2 and T3 been similar. Highest values of heart rates were observed in T3 indicating some contribution to involuntary physiological actives in pigs which may be effect of some biocomponents of Spondias sp to cerebella actions in animal brain controlling such involuntary muscle activities.

We examined SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibodies in a longitudinal cohort, comparing antibody decay in individuals who received an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. We completed a longitudinal cohort of healthcare workers (HWs) between June 2020 and September 2021. HWs were included if they had a serum sample collected after SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or a serum sample collected [≥] 14 days after second dose of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Linear regression models adjusting for vaccine type, age, and sex were used to compare post-vaccination antibody levels between 1) HWs with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and 2) HWs with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection [≤] 90 days and > 90 days prior to first vaccine. Serum was collected from 98 HWs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and before vaccine, and 1960 HWs [≥] 14 days following second vaccine dose. Serum spike antibody levels were higher after vaccination than after natural infection. Compared to SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals, those with prior infection maintained higher post-vaccination mean spike IgG values at 1, 3, and 6 months, after adjusting for age, sex, and vaccine type. Individuals with PCR-confirmed infection > 90 days before vaccination had higher post-vaccination antibody levels than individuals infected [≤] 90 days before vaccination. Individuals with three exposures to spike protein maintain the highest antibody levels particularly when first and second exposures were greater than 90 days apart.

Osteoblasts produce the soluble receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) that binds to its receptor RANK on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells to promote osteoclastogenesis, a process that involves cell-cell fusion and assembly of molecular machinery to ultimately degrade the bone. CD13 is a transmembrane aminopeptidase that is highly expressed in cells of myeloid lineage has been shown to regulate dynamin-dependent receptor endocytosis and recycling and is a necessary component of actin cytoskeletal organization. In the present study, we show that CD13-deficient mice display a normal distribution of osteoclast progenitor populations in the bone marrow, but present a low bone density phenotype. Further, the endosteal bone formation rate is similar between genotypes, indicating a defect in osteoclast-specific function in vivo. Loss of CD13 led to exaggerated in vitro osteoclastogenesis as indicated by significantly enhanced fusion of bone marrow-derived multinucleated osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL, resulting in abnormally large cells with remarkably high numbers of nuclei with a concomitant increase in bone resorption activity. Similarly, we also observed increased formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGC) in CD13KO bone marrow progenitor cells stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13, suggesting that CD13 may regulate cell-cell fusion events via a common pathway, independent of RANKL signaling. Mechanistically, while expression levels of the fusion-regulatory proteins dynamin and DC-STAMP are normally downregulated as fusion progresses in fusion-competent mononucleated progenitor cells, in the absence of CD13 they are uniformly sustained at high levels, even in mature multi-nucleated osteoclasts. Taken together, we conclude that CD13 may regulate cell-cell fusion by controlling expression and localization of key fusion proteins that are critical for both osteoclast and MGC fusion.","Ghosh, Mallika; Kalajzic, Ivo; Aguila, Hector Leonardo; Shapiro, Linda H",bioRxiv,577,24

Empirical evidence clearly shows that the volatility of trading value was affected by COVID-19's new, confirmed, and deaths cases within the first pandemic period more than during the second pandemic period. Nevertheless, during the third pandemic period there is no evidence that the new, confirmed, and deaths cases significantly influenced trading value. Furthermore, the results show that COVID-19's new and deaths cases have a negative coefficient that indicated the trading value-buy/sell decreased in response to COVID-19's new and deaths cases, whereas the confirmed COVID-19 cases have a positive coefficient that indicated the trading value-buy/sell increased in response to COVID's confirmed cases.

Estimates of the impact of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission are critical for decision making in this and future outbreaks. We here aim to assess the impact of these NPIs on disease transmission by estimating changes in the basic reproduction number (R0) at national and cantonal levels in relation to the timing of these NPIs. We estimate the time- varying R0 nationally and in twelve cantons by fitting a stochastic transmission model explicitly simulating within hospital dynamics. We use individual-level data of >1,000 hospitalized patients in Switzerland and public daily reports of hospitalizations and deaths. We estimate the national R0 was 3.15 (95% CI: 2.13-3.76) at the start of the epidemic. Starting from around March 6, we find a strong reduction in R0 with an 85% median decrease (95% quantile range, QR: 83%-90%) to a value of 0.44 (95% QR: 0.27-0.65) in the period of March 29-April 5. At the cantonal-level R0 decreased over the course of the epidemic between 71% and 94%. We found that reductions in R0 were synchronous with changes in mobility patterns as estimated through smartphone activity, which started before the official implementation of NPIs. We found that most of the reduction of transmission is due to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 3% of the total reduction in effective transmission. As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of R0 well below one are promising. However most of inferred transmission reduction was due to behaviour change (<3% due to natural immunity buildup), with an estimated 97% (95% QR: 96.6%-97.2%) of the Swiss population still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as of April 24. These results warrant a cautious relaxation of social distance practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers.","Lemaitre, Joseph Chadi; Perez-Saez, Javier; Azman, Andrew; Rinaldo, Andrea; Fellay, Jacques",,577,27

Energy systems are evolving in response to a combination of law and policy changes, developments in energy technologies, and market forces. [...]given both the entrenched nature of fossil fuel economies and the varied social, political, economic, and environmental factors that shape energy transition, pathways to decarbonization are bound to be beset with complex trade-offs, such as those between energy security and environmental objectives, or between energy choice and economies of scale. [...]this is an area in need of experimentation and iterative learning. Transnational Environmental Law (TEL) is particularly well suited to advance scholarly inquiry at the frontier of energy transition. Since its inception TEL has helped to identify the grey areas between national and international legal development, and to explore the rapidly expanding body of law that fills and pushes at the edges of these interstitial spaces.","Thijs, Etty Heyvaert Veerle Carlarne Cinnamon Huber Bruce Peel Jacqueline Josephine van Zeben",Transnational Environmental Law,577,1

The wellbeing of families during the lockdown has been studied to some extent, but few studies have focused on children under school age. In May 2020, we sent a survey to the 82 families originally recruited in our study on supporting social-emotional development in early childhood education units, which had been interrupted by the pandemic. Twenty families responded to questionnaires about the impacts of the lockdown on the wellbeing of the children and their parents. Parents reported a decline in children’s prosocial behavior compared to the time before the pandemic and assessed that the children who stayed at home were lonelier than children who remained in daycare. Otherwise, being at home or in care was not associated with children’s physical or mental wellbeing. Parents had experienced increased mental strain and increased problems in marital relationships and the disruption of children’s participation in daycare was associated with deterioration in the parent–child relationship. Due to the small sample size, these results should be interpreted with caution.","Linnavalli, Tanja Kalland Mirjam",Education Sciences,577,1

Integrating primary care with social services could more efficiently utilise resources, and improve experiences for patients, their families and carers. There is limited evidence on progress including key barriers and drivers of integration to inform large-scale national change. Aim: To elicit stakeholder views on drivers and barriers of integrated primary care and social services. and highlight opportunities for successful implementation. Design and setting: A qualitative interview study. Method: Semi-structured interviews with maximum variation sampling to capture stakeholder views across services and professions. Results: Thirty-seven interviews were conducted across England including GPs, nurses, social care staff, commissioners, local government, voluntary and private sectors, patients and carers. Drivers of integration included groups of like-minded individuals supported by good leadership, expanded interface roles to bridge gaps between systems and co-location of services. Barriers included structural and interdisciplinary tension between professions, organisational self-interest and challenges in record-sharing. Conclusions: Drivers and barriers to integration identified in other contexts are also present in primary care and social services. Benefits of integration are unlikely to be realised if these are not addressed in the design and execution of new initiatives. Efforts should go beyond local and professional level change to include wider systems and policy-level initiatives. This will support a more systems-wide approach to integrated care reform, which is necessary to meet the complex and growing needs of an ageing multimorbid population.","Dambha-Miller, H.; Simpson, G.

Although many studies have evaluated the impact of these interventions, there is a lack of mapping between model parameters and actual geographic areas. In this study, a non-pharmaceutical intervention model of COVID-19 based on a discrete grid is proposed from the perspective of geography. This model can provide more direct and effective information for the formulation of prevention and control policies. First, a multi-level grid was introduced to divide the geographical space, and the properties of the grid boundary were used to describe the quarantine status and intensity in these different spaces;this was also combined with the model of hospital isolation and self-protection. Then, a process for the spatiotemporal evolution of the early COVID-19 spread is proposed that integrated the characteristics of residents’ daily activities. Finally, the effect of the interventions was quantitatively analyzed by the dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. The results showed that quarantining is the most effective intervention, especially for infectious diseases with a high infectivity. The introduction of a quarantine could effectively reduce the number of infected humans, advance the peak of the maximum infected number of people, and shorten the duration of the pandemic. However, quarantines only function properly when employed at sufficient intensity;hospital isolation and self-protection measures can effectively slow the spread of COVID-19, thus providing more time for the relevant departments to prepare, but an outbreak will occur again when the hospital reaches full capacity. Moreover, medical resources should be concentrated in places where there is the most urgent need under a strict quarantine measure.","Cao, Wen Dai Haoran Zhu Jingwen Tian Yuzhen Peng Feilin",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,577,1

The students reported 39 digital media involved in their escapist activities, with media sharing networks having a dominant role. From the analysis of their discussion of the motivations and different forms of escapist activities using social media, 5 different but interrelated discourses emerged: (1) Social media have both positive and negative aspects;(2) Social media escapism distorts reality;(3) Social media offer easy and affordable ways to escape;(4) Social media escapism needs to be managed to avoid addiction;and (5) Social media escapism enhances English language skills. The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic through restrictions on socializing, face-to-face interaction and online teaching were discussed within and across the identified discourses.

Methods: This is a narrative review. Most current information (focused on the measures that the healthcare system has adopted to integrate telehealth in the coronavirus response measures) was obtained from peer-reviewed journals and the website of payers, pharmacies, and professional organizations. Results: Response and management of COVID-19 has seen a surge in the use of telehealth and mobile applications. Health insurance providers have reformed their payer policies to integrate telehealth in COVID-19 response. Waiving premiums, co-pays, and cost-sharing are the most common changes across the industry. For example, Cleveland Clinic has reported a 1,665% increase in the number of telemedicine visits, recording 60,000 visits in March compared to 3,400 before coronavirus. The expansion of telehealth in the era of COVID-19 has presented practical challenges stymying progress.

The need to investigate various aspects of digital transformation for cultural organizations has been heightened during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This paper explores how city cultural organizations can utilize digital stories for impression management to enhance public perceptions of a city. The aim of this study is to understand how end-users are affected by a city cultural digital storytelling information system and the benefits of using such a system. Design/methodology/approach: An interpretive case study was conducted on a digital storytelling initiative carried out by three cultural organizations in a medium-sized city in Canada. Data collection included 95 interviews with the general public, questionnaires and the gathering of documents. Findings: Findings suggest that digital storytelling can be a viable tool to share city cultural heritage information and positively affect end-user perceptions of a city. The overall outcome of creating/maintaining a positive favorable impression is shaped through a layered experience of benefits by users. Through digital stories, users are first personally engaged and informed about a city's cultural heritage, and then they are influenced and inspired positively toward the city. Further, factors, such as leisure learning, cultural heritage information and cultural organizations, situate this context of use. Originality/value: The study sheds light on how the art of storytelling in the digital age can serve as a powerful tool for conveying information effectively and influencing public perceptions. This paper provides a context-specific model to understand the use of digital storytelling by city cultural organizations for the purpose of impression management. Theoretical insights and practical recommendations are provided to explore the utilization of digital storytelling for raising interest and awareness in a city and managing public perceptions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Nosrati, F.; Detlor, B.",Information Technology and People,577,16

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the seasonal influenza vaccination attitudes in Greece and to identify factors associated with a positive change in participants’ choice to vaccinate against the flu. METHODS This is a sub-analysis of a cross-sectional nationwide survey (n=1004) that was conducted between 28 April and 3 May 2020 using a mixed methodology for data collection: computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and computer assisted web interviewing (CAWI). Sampling followed a proportionate, stratified by region, systematic procedure to ensure a nationally representative sample of the urban/rural population. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire consisting of four parts: 1) demographics;2) knowledge about COVID-19;3) attitudes toward COVID-19;and 4) practices to control COVID-19 and vaccination against the flu. RESULTS Of the respondents, 66.3% (n=665) had not been vaccinated for seasonal influenza during the 2019–2020 season, the period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, of those, 21.8% showed willingness to receive the vaccine (n=145) the upcoming flu season 2020–2021. Factors independently associated with increased intention to vaccinate in those that had not been vaccinated the previous flu season included: age ≥65 years;the belief that vaccination against the flu is considered preventive against the spread of the coronavirus;not believing that coronavirus was man-made in a laboratory;and not believing that the pandemic will end once a large percentage of the population is infected.

The study of inversions in natural populations is reliant on polytene chromosome analysis by expert cytogeneticists, a process that is limited by the rarity of trained specialists, low throughput, and restrictive sampling requirements. To overcome this barrier, we ascertained tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are highly correlated with inversion status (inverted or standard orientation). We compared the performance of the tag SNPs using two alternative high throughput molecular genotyping approaches versus traditional cytogenetic karyotyping of the same 960 individual An. gambiae and An. coluzzii mosquitoes sampled from Burkina Faso, West Africa. We show that both molecular approaches yield comparable results, and that either one performs as well or better than cytogenetics in terms of genotyping accuracy. Given the ability of molecular genotyping approaches to be conducted at scale and at relatively low cost without restriction on mosquito sex or developmental stage, molecular genotyping via tag SNPs has the potential to revitalize research into the role of chromosomal inversions in the behavior and ongoing adaptation of An. gambiae and An. coluzzii to environmental heterogeneities.","Love, R.

The virus enters host cells through binding of the Spike protein to ACE2 receptor and subsequent S priming by the TMPRSS2 protease. Herein we aim to assess differences in both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in normal tissues from oral cavity-pharynx-larynx and lung tissues as well as neoplastic tissues from the same histological areas. The information provided in this study may contribute to better understanding of SARS-coronavirus 2 ability to interact with different biological systems and contributes to cumulative knowledge on potential mechanisms to inhibit its diffusion. Materials and Methods The study has been conducted using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Regina Elena Institute (IRE) databases and validated by experimental model in HNSCC and Lung cancer cells. Data from one COVID19 positive patient who was operated on for HNSCC was also included. We have analyzed 478 tumor samples and 44 normal samples from TCGA HNSCC cohort for whom both miRNA and mRNA sequencing was available. The dataset included 391 HPV- and 85 HPV+ cases, with 331 P53 mutated and 147 P53 wild type cases respectively. 352 out of 478 samples were male and 126 female. In IRE cohort we analyzed 66 tumor samples with matched normal sample for miRNA profiling and 23 tumor\normal matched samples for mRNA profiling. 45 out of 66 tumors from IRE cohort were male and 21 female, 38 were P53 mutated and 27 wild type. Most patients (63 of 66) in IRE cohort were HPV negative. Normalized TCGA HNSCC gene expression and miRNA expression data were obtained from Broad Institute TCGA Genome Data Analysis Center (http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/). mRNA expression data from IRE cohort used in this study has been deposited to NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible through GEO series accession number GSE107591. In order to inference about potential molecular modulation of TMPRSS2, we also included miRNAs expression for the 66 IRE cohort matched tumor and normal samples from Agilent platform. DNA methylation data for TCGA tumors were obtained from Wanderer (http://maplab.imppc.org/wanderer/). We used miRWalk and miRNet web tools for miRNA-target interaction prediction and pathway enrichment analysis. The correlation and regression analyses as well as the miRNA and gene modulation and the survival analysis were conducted using Matlab R2019. Results TMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC was significantly reduced compared to the normal tissues and had a prognostic value in HNSCC patients. Reduction of TMPRSS2 expression was more evident in women than in men, in TP53 mutated versus wild TP53 tumors as well as in HPV negative patients compared to HPV positive counterparts. Functionally, we assessed the multivariate effect on TMPRSS2 in a single regression model. We observed that all variables had an independent effect on TMPRSS2 in HNSCC patients with HPV negative, TP53 mutated status and with elevated TP53-dependent Myc-target genes associated with low TMPRSS2 expression. Investigation of the molecular modulation of TMPRSS2 in both HNSCC and lung cancers revealed that expression of microRNAs targeting TMPRSS2 anti-correlated in both TCGA and IRE HNSCC datasets, while there was not evidence of TMPRSS2 promoter methylation in both tumor cohorts. Interestingly, the anti-correlation between microRNAs and TMPRSS2 expression was corroborated by testing this association in a SARS-CoV-2 positive HNSCC patient. Conclusions Collectively, these findings suggest that tumoral tissues, herein exemplified by HNSCC and lung cancers might be more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2. The protective mechanism might occur, at least partially, through the aberrant activation of TMPRSS2 targeting microRNAs; thereby providing strong evidence on the role of non-coding RNA molecule in host viral infection. These observations may help to better assess the frailty of SARS-CoV-2 positive cancer patients.","Sacconi, Andrea; Donzelli, Sara; Pulito, Claudio; Ferrero, Stefano; Morrone, Aldo; Rigoni, Marta; Pimpinelli, Fulvia; Ensoli, Fabrizio; Sanguineti, Giuseppe; Pellini, Raul; Agrawal, Nishant; Izumchenko, Evgeny; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Giannì, Aldo; Muti, Paola; Strano, Sabrina; Blandino, Giovanni",bioRxiv,577,1

Despite the flaws of securitization as a causal theory, alternative explanations remain unexplored. This research seeks to address an alternative explanation, ""moralization."" The article begins with a brief history of changes in the US response to the global AIDS crisis since the 1980s, followed by a description of securitization theory as an alleged explanation for the aid increase in the early 2000s. Next, this research problematizes the AIDS-security nexus and proceeds to show how a humanitarian approach to the epidemic invoked a moral obligation to respond urgently to the catastrophic epidemic.

The goals have been two-folded: leasing costs had to be optimized and patients had to be served as soon as possible. Decisions as to when to lease which services at which facility locations shaped the success of these goals. At the heart of these decisions lies a complex optimization problem, which we call the Online Non-metric Facility Service Leasing problem (non-metric OFSL), a generalization of the well-known Online Non-metric Facility Leasing problem (non-metric OFL) in which facility locations are leased for different facility-time durations. In non-metric OFSL, each facility location may provide a number of services leased for different service-time durations. Additionally, each service is associated with a dormant fee that needs to be paid for each day at which the service is not leased. The optimization goal is to minimize the total leasing costs, dormant fees, and the distances between patients and the facilities they are connected to. We develop the first online algorithm for non-metric OFSL, evaluated using the notion of competitive analysis. The latter is a worst-case analysis used to measure the quality of online algorithms, in which the online algorithm's output is compared to the optimal offline solution for all instances of the problem. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The objective of this prospective study was to explore the side effects of mRNA vaccine Tozinameran and possible differences in their incidence between different categories of employees at the National Cancer Institute in Bratislava, Slovakia (NCI). Methods: Four hundred and thirteen subjects (89 men) were enrolled into this ongoing prospective study in January, 2021. Median age was 47 years (range 19-79 years). Majority were healthcare professionals (N=306), including nurses (N=125), medical-technical workers (N=89), and physicians (N=42). Presence of side effects was entered by the physicians into electronic data files and their accuracy validated for each subject by an independent investigator. Number of adverse events in the subgroups were compared with log-rank test. Results: At median follow up of 4 weeks, injection site pain (63.0%), pain in the extremity (45.5%), and fatigue (28,6%) belonged among the most common adverse events of Tozinameran. Median number of side effects was 2 (range 0- 13). Adverse event incidence was significantly higher in females compare to males (median number 2 vs. 1, P &lt; 0.00001). In a subgroup of healthcare professionals, we found a significantly higher incidence of side effects compared to non-healthcare workers (median number 2 vs. 1, P = 0.00017).

Additionally, data from respiratory specimen analysis from the past year show that current mask mandates established for COVID-19 have inadvertently reduced the rates of other respiratory diseases, including influenza. Thus, the question arises as to whether comparatively mild measures should be kept in place after the pandemic to reduce the impact of influenza. In this study, we employed a series of differential equations to simulate past influenza seasons, assuming people wore face masks. This was achieved by introducing a variable to account for the efficacy and prevalence of masks and then analyzing its impact on influenza transmission rate in an SEIR model fit to the actual past seasons. We then compared influenza rates in this hypothetical scenario with the actual rates over the seasons. Our results show that several combinations of mask efficacy and prevalence can significantly reduce the burden of seasonal influenza. Particularly, our simulations suggest that a minority of individuals wearing masks greatly reduce the number of influenza infections. Considering the efficacy rates of masks and the relatively insignificant monetary cost, we highlight that it may be a viable alternative or complement to influenza vaccinations. We conclude with a brief discussion of our results and other practical aspects.","Froese, H.; A. Prempeh, A. G.",,577,15

Yet, efforts to treat ARDS patients with liquid instillations of exogenous surfactant have so far failed. One of the ongoing challenges in surfactant therapy is obtaining a homogeneous distribution of surfactant within the lungs despite an inherent tendency to non-uniform spreading, owing amongst others to the influence of gravity. Here, we show that liquid foam therapy (LiFT), where surfactant is foamed prior to intratracheal administration, may improve notably surfactant distribution while maintaining safety and efficacy. We first show quantitatively that a foamed surrogate surfactant solution distributes more uniformly in ex vivo pig lungs compared to endotracheal instillations of the liquid solution, while maintaining pulmonary airway pressures within a safe range. Next, we demonstrate that a foamed commercial surfactant preparation (Infasurf) is effective in an established in vivo rat lung lavage model of ARDS. Our results suggest that LiFT may be more effective than liquid instillations for treating ARDS and serve as a proof-of-principle towards large animal and clinical trials.","Fishler, Rami; Ostrovski, Yan; Frenkel, Avital; Dorfman, Simon; Brod, Vera; Haas, Tali; Waisman, Dan; Sznitman, Josué",bioRxiv,577,1

Currently, the world is suffering from the outbreak of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in which the COVID-19 virus has infected more than one hundred and twenty million people worldwide with more than two million deaths. Consequently, people tend to share COVID-19-related content on social media extensively.

This research explores the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on Saudi users' tweeting behavior. In particular, the research adopts a social network analysis (SNA) for COVID-19 Arabic tweets. This approach is interesting, as it is based on analysis of social structures, such as Twitter users and the relationships among them, through the use of networks and graph theory without the contents of the tweets themselves.

How individual job-changers and jobseekers make sense of their experiences and shape their own conduct is explored here, drawing inspiration from the emergent turn to ‘economic theology’ to consider the continued influence of Christian legacies of pilgrimage. To supplement Turner’s understanding of pilgrimage as liminal ritual, the article adapts Weber’s Protestant Ethic thesis and Foucault’s later works on ‘modes of veridiction’, forms of tests and trials which ‘tell the truth’ about the subject. Thus, jobseeking pilgrimages are less seasonal collective religious ritual than a continuous individualised ethic;contemporary jobseeking involves pilgrimages of constantly deciphering signs, putting oneself to the test via the market and self-purification and transformation.

For the high vaccine acceptance rate, it is important to determine the vaccine willingness of individuals and the barriers to vaccination. We aimed to determine the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine and the effect of attitudes, perception and beliefs on vaccination willingness among medical students. Methods: In February 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted online among medical student. A total of 734 medical students out of 980 medical students answered the questionnaire forms (response rate: 75.4%). The online questionnaire collected socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes, risk perception and beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy, rejection and acceptance were determined by self-report of medical students. Results: Total of 739 medical students included study. Students declared that 60.1% (n = 444) of them to be willing to vaccinated, 14.2% (n = 105) refused and 25.7% (n = 190) were not sure.

Positive attitudes skor and higher knowledge scores were related with highly willingness to be vaccinated. High beliefs score (positive beliefs) was found to be associated with a higher willingness to be vaccinated (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Although the majority of the study population willingness to be vaccinated, one-third of medical students are hesitant about vaccination. Education, positive attitude and beliefs are related to higher willingness to vaccination.The COVID-19 pandemic immunization programs should be designed to remove barriers to negative vaccine beliefs and perception.","Kaya, M.

We aimed to quantify the number and temporal trends of out-of-state introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Washington. Methods We conducted a molecular epidemiologic analysis of 11,422 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID sampled between December 2019 and September 2020. We used maximum parsimony ancestral state reconstruction methods on time-calibrated phylogenies to enumerate introductions/exports, their likely geographic source (US, non-US, and between eastern and western Washington), and estimated date of introduction. To incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty into our estimates, we conducted 5,000 replicate analyses by generating 25 random time-stratified samples of non-Washington reference sequences, 20 random polytomy resolutions, and 10 random resolutions of the reconstructed ancestral state. Findings We estimated a minimum 287 introductions (range 244-320) into Washington and 204 exported lineages (range 188-227) of SARS-CoV-2 out of Washington. Introductions began in mid-January and peaked on March 29, 2020. Lineages with the Spike D614G variant accounted for the majority (88%) of introductions. Overall, 61% (range 55-65%) of introductions into Washington likely originated from a source elsewhere within the US, while the remaining 39% (range 35-45%) likely originated from outside of the US. Intra-state transmission accounted for 65% and 28% of introductions into eastern and western Washington, respectively. Interpretation The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Washington was continually seeded by a large number of introductions. Our findings highlight the importance of genomic surveillance to monitor for emerging variants due to high levels of inter- and intra-state transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

In this research, a machine learning based classifier model has been made to determine the opinion or sentiment of the tweet. The dataset used is a set of tweets containing the phrase WHO and COVID-19 in period of March 1st until May 6th, 2020 consisting of 4000 tweets with positive sentiments and 4000 tweets with negative sentiments. The proposed classifier model combined Support Vector Machine (SVM), N-Gram and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The classifier model performance is evaluated using the value of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Area Under ROC Curve (AUC). Based on experiments conducted, the combination of SVM, N-gram (bigram), and PSO produced a pretty good performance in classifying tweet sentiment with values of Accuracy 0,755, Precision 0,719, Recall 0,837, and AUC 0,844.","Hafidz, Noor; Yanti Liliana, Dewi; id,",Jurnal Resti (Rekayasa Sistem Dan Teknologi Informasi),577,17

Methods: We conducted a cohort study to determine the etiology of ILI (influenza like illness) among 2,519 K-12 students during the 2012-13 influenza season. We obtained nasal swabs from students with ILI-related absences. Generalized linear mixed-effect regressions determined associations of outcomes, including ILI and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection, with school grade and other covariates. Results: Overall, 459 swabs were obtained from 552 ILI-related absences. Respiratory viruses were found in 292 (63.6%) samples. Influenza was found in 189 (41.2%) samples. with influenza B found in 134 (70.9%). Rates of influenza B were significantly higher in grades 1 (10.1%, 95% CI 6.8%-14.4%), 2 (9.7%, 6.6%-13.6%), 3 (9.3%, 6.3%-13.2%), and 4 (9.9%, 6.8%-13.8%) than in kindergarteners (3.2%, 1.5%-6.0%). After accounting for grade, sex and self-reported vaccination status, influenza B infection risk was lower among kindergarteners in half-day programs compared to kindergarteners in full-day programs (OR = 0.19; 95% CI 0.08-0.45). Conclusions: ILI and influenza infection is concentrated in younger schoolchildren. Reduced infection by respiratory viruses is associated with a truncated school day for kindergarteners, but requires further investigation in other grades and populations.","Read, Jonathan M; Zimmer, Shanta; Vukotich, Charles; Schweizer, Mary Lou; Galloway, David; Lingle, Carrie; Yearwood, Gaby; Calderone, Patti; Noble, Eva; Quandelacy, Talia; Grantz, Kyra; Rinaldo, Charles; Gao, Hongjiang; Rainey, Jeanette; Uzicanin, Amra; Cummings, Derek A.T.",,577,27

If there is no control, these platforms may be used to propagate hate speech. In fact, in recent years, hate speech has increased on social media. Therefore, there is a need to monitor and prevent hate speech on these platforms. However, manual control is not feasible due to the high traffic of content production on social media sites. Moreover, the language used and the length of the messages provide a challenge when using classical machine learning approaches as prediction methods. This paper presents a genetic programming (GP) model for detecting hate speech where each chromosome represents a classifier employing a universal sentence encoder as a feature. A novel mutation technique that affects only the feature values in combination with the standard one-point mutation technique improved the performance of the GP model by enriching the offspring pool with alternative solutions. The proposed GP model outperformed all state-of-the-art systems for the four publicly available hate speech datasets.","Aljero, M. K. A.; Dimililer, N.",Ieee Access,577,9

This could help policy makers, public health experts, and clinicians to better plan preventive and management strategies to curb COVID-19 related mortality. Method This was a hospital record based, retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study, at a tertiary care hospital in Rishikesh, India. The study included all deceased patients between March 2020 and January 2021 (first wave) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and were hospitalized. The study was done to describe demography, clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, treatment given and associated complications of all COVID-19 deaths. Result Out of 424 mortalities, 298 (70.38%) were males and 126 (29.62%) were females. Mean age of patients was 55.85 (SD=16.24 years), out of which 19.5 percent were less than 45 years old, 33.6 percent were 45 to 60 years old and 41.8% were more than 60 years old. Comorbidity in the form of type 2 diabetes mellitus was present in 41.4% [95% CI (41.4-51.1)], hypertension in 39.8% [95% CI (35.1-44.6)], and coronary artery disease in 15.2% [95% CI (11.8-18.8)]. At the time of presentation, shortness of breath was present in 73.6% [95% CI (69.1-77.7)], fever in 64.92% [95% CI (60.1-69.4)], and cough in 46.1%, [95% CI (41.1-50.8)]. Deranged laboratory parameters were lymphopenia in 90.2% [95% CI (86.8-92.7)], transaminitis in 59.7% [95% CI (54.8-64.3)], and hypercreatinemia in 37.7% [95% CI (33.1-42.5)]. Complications manifested were acute respiratory distress syndrome in 78.3% [95% CI (74-82.1)] and shock in 54.7% [95% CI (49.8-59.5)]. Median time duration between onset of symptom and hospital admission was 5 days (IQR = 3-5 days) and median length of hospital stay was 9 days (IQR = 4-14 days). Conclusion During first pandemic wave, COVID-19 related mortality was 2.37 times higher among males, 2.14 times in age group >60 than <45 years. Most common associated comorbidities (>40%) were type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Most common associated symptoms (>60%) were shortness of breath and fever. Lymphopenia was seen in >90% cases while liver involvement in 60% and kidney in 38% cases. Median hospital stay was doubled the pre-hospital illness.","Tendulkar, P.; Pragya,; Panda, P.

Students learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL) engaged in multiple practices when attending English writing classes in both modes. However, the practices they engaged in and the benefits they perceived were reportedly of limited benefit. This study asks: What are the practices of students that emerge during synchronous and asynchronous English writing classes? What are the benefits of synchronous and asynchronous English writing classes from the student's perspective? Group and one-to-one interviews were conducted with twelve students majoring in computer science and information technology at a Saudi university. Thematic analysis revealed that students engage in practices including using the split view on iPads, opening additional windows to search for information, searching using smartphone apps, and writing notes and highlighting key concepts when attending English writing classes regardless of learning mode. It also revealed that synchronous classes offered students real-time communication and provided immediate feedback, while asynchronous classes allowed students to navigate the challenges of distance learning, complementing the synchronous English writing classes and providing students with a sense of security. This paper concludes by advising language teachers to record synchronous classes, raise students' awareness of the benefits of attending both types of classes and encourage students to apply practices reported by previous students to maximize their English language learning.","Bin Dahmash, N.",Arab World English Journal,577,9

The semi-permeable protective clothing and the prolonged working hours make the thermal comfort a critical issue for HCWs. Although there are many commercially available personal cooling products for PPE systems, they are either heavy in weight or have limited durability. Besides, most of the existing solutions cannot relieve the perspiration efficiently within the insolation gowns. To avoid heat strain and ensure a longtime thermal comfort, new strategies that provide efficient personal thermal and moisture management without compromising health protection are required. This paper reviews the emerging materials for protective gown layers and advanced technologies for personal thermal and moisture management of PPE systems. These materials and strategies are examined in detail with respect to their fundamental working principles, thermal and mechanical properties, fabrication methods as well as advantages and limitations in their prospective applications, aiming at stimulating creative thinking and multidisciplinary collaboration to improve the thermal comfort of PPEs.","Lou, Lun Chen Kaikai Fan Jintu",Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports,577,1

However, some eukaryotic protists such as slime molds generate diverse and complex structures while remaining in a multinucleated syncytial state. It is unknown if different regions of these giant syncytial cells have distinct transcriptional responses to environmental encounters, and if nuclei within the cell diversify into heterogeneous states. Here we performed spatial transcriptome analysis of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum in the plasmodium state under different environmental conditions, and used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to dissect gene expression heterogeneity among nuclei. Our data identifies transcriptome regionality in the organism that associates with proliferation, syncytial substructures, and localized environmental conditions. Further, we find that nuclei are heterogenous in their transcriptional profile, and may process local signals within the plasmodium to coordinate cell growth, metabolism, and reproduction. To understand how nuclei variation within the syncytium compares to heterogeneity in single-nucleated cells, we analyzed states in single Physarum amoebal cells. We observed amoebal cell states at different stages of mitosis and meiosis, and identified cytokinetic features that are specific to nuclei divisions within the syncytium. Notably, we do not find evidence for predefined transcriptomic states in the amoebae that are observed in the syncytium. Our data shows that a single-celled slime mold can control its gene expression in a region-specific manner while lacking cellular compartmentalization, and suggests that nuclei are mobile processors facilitating local specialized functions. More broadly, slime molds offer the extraordinary opportunity to explore how organisms can evolve regulatory mechanisms to divide labor, specialize, balance competition with cooperation, and perform other foundational principles that govern the logic of life.","Gerber, Tobias; Loureiro, Cristina; Schramma, Nico; Chen, Siyu; Jain, Akanksha; Weber, Anne; Weigert, Anne; Santel, Malgorzata; Alim, Karen; Treutlein, Barbara; Camp, J.

A large number of studies of applying deep learning models to histopathological images have been published in recent years. While many studies claim high accuracies, they may fall into the pitfalls of overfitting and lack of generalization due to the high variability of the histopathological images. We use the example of Osteosarcoma to illustrate the pitfalls and how the addition of model input variability can help improve model performance. We use the publicly available osteosarcoma dataset to retrain a previously published classification model for osteosarcoma. We partition the same set of images into the training and testing datasets differently than the original study: the test dataset consists of images from one patient while the training dataset consists images of all other patients. The performance of the model on the test set using the new partition schema declines dramatically, indicating a lack of model generalization and overfitting.We also show the influence of training data variability on model performance by collecting a minimal dataset of 10 osteosarcoma subtypes as well as benign tissues and benign bone tumors of differentiation. We show the additions of more and more subtypes into the training data step by step under the same model schema yield a series of coherent models with increasing performances. In conclusion, we bring forward data preprocessing and collection tactics for histopathological images of high variability to avoid the pitfalls of overfitting and build deep learning models of higher generalization abilities.","Tang, H.; Sun, N.; Shen, S.",,577,28

Methods: A digital survey was administered to stakeholders affected by cerebral palsy across the US. Our analysis focused on variables related to personal interests, travel, and study-specific elements. Statistical tests investigated the effects of responder type, cerebral palsy type, and Gross Motor Function Classification System level on travel and study-specific element variables. Recommendations were informed by responses reflecting the majority of respondents. Results: Based on 233 responses, we found that respondents highly valued research participation (on average 88.2/100) and compensation (on average 62.3/100). Motivators included the potential for direct benefit (62.2%) and helping others (53.4%). The primary barriers to participation were schedule limitations (48.9%) and travel logistics (32.6%). Schedule limitations were especially pertinent to caregivers, while individuals with more severe cerebral palsy diagnoses reported the necessity of additional items to comfortably travel. Conclusions: Overall, we encourage the involvement of stakeholders affected by cerebral palsy in the research process. Researchers should consider offering flexible study times, accommodating locations, and compensation for time and travel expenses. We recommend a minimum compensation of $15/hour and a maximum time commitment of 4 hours/day to respect participants' time and increase likelihood of research participation.

Parosmia is the triggered perception of distorted odours whereas phantosmia is the perception of odours in the absence of a trigger. Both can arise from post-infectious anosmia and have increased substantially since the outbreak of COVID-19. Methodology/Principal: Thematic analysis of a social media support group for parosmia and phantosmia was used to articulate the perspectives and concerns of those affected by these debilitating olfactory disorders. Results: A novel symptom (olfactory perseveration) was identified where a triggered, identifiable, and usually unpleasant olfactory percept persisted in the absence of an ongoing stimulus. Fluctuations in intensity and duration of perseveration, parosmia and phantosmia were observed. Coffee, meat, onion, and toothpaste were identified as common triggers of these disorders, but people struggled to describe the distortions, using words associated with disgust and revulsion. Common strategies to avoid triggers may result in a diet lacking in both nutrition and reward. The emotional aspect of living with qualitative olfactory dysfunction was evident and highlighted the detrimental impact on mental health. Conclusions: The data acquired can inform rehabilitation strategies and drive our ongoing research into understanding the molecular triggers associated with parosmia, and research into patient benefit.","Parker, J.

MetaCortex captures intra-species diversity by searching for signatures of local variation along assembled sequences in the underlying assembly graph and outputting these sequences in sequence graph format. MetaCortex also implements a novel assembly algorithm for representing intra-species diversity in standard linear format. We show that MetaCortex produces accurate assemblies with higher genome coverage and contiguity than other popular metagenomic assemblers on mock viral communities with high levels of strain level diversity, and on simulated communities containing simulated strains.

Despite the lack of specific therapies, international societies have introduced new guidelines and launched several trials to test the efficacy of new protocols and drugs. Drug repurposing has been a fundamental strategy to find quick ways to fight the pathogen, even if it is new compounds that are drawing the attention of the scientific community. Tailored therapy should be considered to be a milestone in treatment in order to increase drug efficacy and to reduce drug toxicity. Therefore, both drug characteristics (i.e., pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety) and the patient characteristics (i.e., stage of disease, comorbidity, concomitant treatments and the mutation of single nucleotides) could represent the key to achieving this objective. In the present study we performed a narrative review of the pharmacological treatment used to date in the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Marcianò, Gianmarco Roberti Roberta Palleria Caterina Mirra Davida Rania Vincenzo Casarella Alessandro De Sarro Giovambattista Gallelli Luca",Applied Sciences,577,1

The Standards for Maternity Care Report includes reference to interpreting services mandating they should be available for “women where English is not their first language”.1 All NHS Trusts have provisions for some degree of language interpretation but anecdotally we suspect COVID-19 has had a significant service impact. Methods: With Caldicott Guardian approval, BadgerNet records for deliveries during 2020 were reviewed. We surveyed the anaesthetists based in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital Maternity Unit during October 2020 to explore their experiences with interpretation services before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Of the 5129 deliveries in our unit during 2020, 6.9% required an interpreter. 18 obstetric anaesthetists responded to our survey: 8 consultants, 6 ST3+ and 4 core trainees. Prior to the pandemic the vast majority of anaesthetist interactions with interpreters were face-to-face (94%). In 84% of cases, the interpreter accompanied the patient into theatre to translate. Only with post-operative reviews did telephone interpretation exceed that in person (65% to 53% respectively). There was general satisfaction from the services, with 20% describing a perceived poor translation and 15% of anaesthetists describing communication difficulty. Following the pandemic, only two anaesthetists had utilised a face-to-face translator pre-theatre, with only one interpreter coming to theatre. All obstetric anaesthetists surveyed had utilised a telephone interpreter since the pandemic, with 35% continuing telephone interpretation in theatre. 65% felt that telephone translations were poor and 70% struggled to communicate. Discussion: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant reduction in face-to-face interpretation and an overall poor perception of the quality of telephone interpretation. The requirement for PPE is an added barrier to communication, arguably making access to interpreting services more important now than ever. Alarmingly the majority of patients did not have a formal translator available in theatre. Following these findings, tablet computers were commissioned to simplify contacting our interpretation service and we developed a pathway to standardise the process. We aim to re-survey to assess any impact. Whilst Glasgow has the largest ethnic minority population of all Scottish cities, the impact of global migration will undoubtedly have a far-reaching effect and we believe local departments should develop rigid protocols for ensuring effective interpretation is secured regardless of barriers.","Dickerson, J.; Breckenridge, F.; Primrose, A.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,577,1

Personalized knowledge graphs (PKGs) are one of the recently proposed methods to store users' information in a structured form and tailor answers to their liking. Personalization, however, is prone to amplifying bias and contributing to the echo-chamber phenomenon. In this paper, we discuss different types of biases in conversational search systems, with the emphasis on the biases that are related to PKGs. We review existing definitions of bias in the literature: people bias, algorithm bias, and a combination of the two, and further propose different strategies for tackling these biases for conversational search systems.

The government’s strategy revolved around the two poles of technocratic and expedient governance on the one hand and social solidarity, targeted at vulnerable or weaker segments of society, on the other. A crucial factor in implementing this dual strategy is Singapore’s smallness, in spatial and demographic terms, meaning that there are natural limits to emulation by others. At the same time, Singapore’s approach was not flawless. In particular, the wildfire-like spread of the virus in migrant workers’ dormitories emerged as an embarrassing blind spot. Other serious Covid-19-related challenges remain. The most significant of these are managing the narrative to preserve high levels of government trust and a further reckoning with the stark socio-economic disparity exacerbated by the crisis. The latter in particular may be a harbinger of wider socio-political change in Singapore which will continue to unfold long after the immediate health emergency has passed. © the several contributors 2021.","De Visser, M.; Straughan, P.",Covid-19 in Asia: Law and Policy Contexts,577,1

Recent studies suggest a decreased risk of severe COVID-19 in RMD-patients treated with biologics. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess courses of RMD patients treated with TNF-inhibitors (TNF-I) included in the German COVID-19 registry. Methods: In the German physician-reported COVID-19-RMD registry, patients with an RMD and confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection were documented (data entered between March 30, 2020 and January 30, 2021). We analysed TNF-I treated patients, their course and outcome of the infection. Data were compared to RMD-patients treated with other immunomodulatory drugs (OID) than TNF-I. Results: A total of 269 patients were treated with a TNF-I (57% female) compared to 874 patients who were treated with OID (68% female). Median age was 52 years (range: 19-87) in the TNF-I-group versus 58 years (range: 18-91) in the OID-group. Rheumatoid arthritis was the most common diagnosis (38% in TNF-I-group vs. 52% in the OID-group), followed by ankylosing spondylitis (32% vs. 6%), psoriatic arthritis (22% vs. 11%) and other RMD (9% vs. 31%). Adalimumab (35%) and etanercept (35%) were the most frequently used TNF-I (tab. 1). Glucocorticoids (GC) were used in 22% of TNF-I-treated patients and in 42% of the OID-group. Under TNF-I, stable disease was reported prior to the SARS-CoV-2-infection in 53% of the patients (OID-group: 47%), followed by low disease activity in 35% (OID: 34%), moderate disease activity in 6% (OID: 12%) and high disease activity in 4% (OID: 3%). Most frequent comorbidities were arterial hypertension (29% under TNF-I vs. 35% under OID), diabetes (8% vs. 11%) and cardiovascular diseases (7% vs. 12%). The most common reported COVID-19 symptoms were dry cough (57% vs. 55%), fever (53% vs. 61%) and fatigue (50% vs. 49%). Hospitalization due to SARSCoV infection was required in only 12% of the TNF-I-treated cases vs. in 29% in the OID-group. Oxygen treatment was necessary in 5% of the patients under TNF-I compared to 22% under OID and invasive ventilation in 2% in the TNF-Igroup compared to 6% under OID. Most notably, no fatal courses of COVID-19 were reported among the 269 RMD-patients treated with TNF-I versus 49 deaths in the 874 cases (5.6%) treated with OID. Focussing on the hospitalizated TNF-I patients, the rate of concomitant GC use (p<0.001) and higher disease activity (p=0.005) was significant higher (tab.1). Conclusion: High or moderate RMD-disease activity is an important factor associated with severity of COVID-19 including mortality. In this large cohort RMD patients treated with TNF-I show a low hospitalisation rate and no fatal course. This is reassuring for patients and treating rheumatologists to use TNF-I to control RMD disease activity. The use of glucocorticoids and high disease activity seem to counteract possible protective effects of TNF-I.","Hasseli, R.; Hoyer, B. F.; Krause, A.; Lorenz, H.

Measles virus is highly infectious and can cause severe symptoms and even death. Because imported cases are necessary drivers of outbreaks in non-endemic settings, predicting measles outbreaks in the US depends on predicting imported cases. To assess the predictability of imported measles cases, we performed a regression of imported measles cases in the US against an inflow variable that combines air travel data with international measles surveillance data. To understand the contribution of each data type to these predictions, we repeated the regression analysis with alternative versions of the inflow variable that replaced each data type with averaged values and with versions of the inflow variable that used modeled inputs. We assessed the performance of these regression models using correlation, coverage probability, and area under the curve statistics, including with resampling and cross-validation. Our regression model had good predictive ability with respect to the presence or absence of imported cases in a given state in a given year (AUC = 0.78) and the magnitude of imported cases (Pearson correlation = 0.84). By comparing alternative versions of the inflow variable averaging over different inputs, we found that both air travel data and international surveillance data contribute to the model's ability to predict numbers of imported cases, and individually contribute to its ability to predict the presence or absence of imported cases. Predicted sources of imported measles cases varied considerably across years and US states, depending on which countries had high measles activity in a given year. Our results emphasize the importance of the relationship between global connectedness and the spread of measles.","Poterek, M. L.; Kraemer, M. U. G.; Watts, A.; Khan, K.; Perkins, A.",,577,1

Delays in presentation and diagnosis may lead to more advanced disease and worse patient outcomes. We evaluated the impact of the pandemic on patients (pts) with melanoma (mel). Methods: A single-institution, retrospective comparison of pts with newly diagnosed invasive mel or metastatic recurrence prior to (pre-cohort, n = 246) and after (post-cohort, n = 246) declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020. 492 pts were evaluated between March 1, 2019 and January 12, 2021. Key variables collected included demographics, pathology, stage at diagnosis, surgical management, receipt of adjuvant or systemic therapy, and follow up. Categorical variables were compared using the two-sided Fisher's exact test, continuous variables were compared using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, and survival endpoints were evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method. This study was exempt from review by the IRB. Results: 200 (81.3%) pts presented with early-stage disease and 46 (18.7%) pts presented with metastatic disease in the postcohort, compared to 209 (85%) and 37 (15%) pts in the pre-cohort, respectively. In the post-cohort there was a significant decrease in stage I pts (28.5% vs 40.7%, p = 0.006), a significant increase in stage III pts (30.5% vs 21.1%, p = 0.023), and a significant increase in pts with metastatic recurrence (7.7% vs 3.3%, p = 0.046) compared to the pre-cohort. There was also a significant increase in pts with brain metastases (BM) in the post-cohort (6.5% vs 1.6%, p = 0.010). For pts with early-stage disease, there was a significant increase in median Breslow depth (2.0 vs 1.4 mm, p = 0.047) and mitotic rate &gt; 1 (78.1% vs 66%, p = 0.008) in the post-cohort. There were trends toward increased ulceration, lymphovascular/perineural invasion, and microsatellite presence. Pts receiving adjuvant therapy in the post-cohort were significantly more likely to receive oral targeted therapy (37.6% vs 27.5%) compared to IV immunotherapy (62.4% vs 72.5%), p = 0.034, perhaps reflecting an attempt to minimize in-person visits. There was not a significant difference between the 2 groups in the type of systemic therapy administered in the metastatic setting. Median progression-free and overall survival were not reached due to a limited number of events in each arm. Conclusions:There was a significant decrease in pts with stage I mel along with a significant increase in pts with stage III mel, metastatic recurrence, and BMs presenting to our institution during the pandemic. Findings are likely related to delays from both the patient (to avoid interaction with the healthcare system - including primary care, dermatology, and oncology) and from the system itself, with some clinics potentially evaluating pts in a limited capacity. These data reaffirm the importance of early detection and evaluation of melanoma.","Shaikh, S.; Yang, X.; Fortman, D.; Wang, H.; Davar, D.; Luke, J. J.; Zarour, H. M.; Kirkwood, J. M.; Najjar, Y.

The purpose of this study is twofold: to bring digital storytelling to the forefront as a literacy practice within classrooms that seeks to privilege students’ voices and experiences and also to encapsulate the authors’ different experiences and perspectives as teachers. The authors sought to understand how pre-teacher education candidates analyzed, understood and made meaning from their classmates’ digital stories using the seven elements of digital storytelling (Dreon et al., 2011).Design/methodology/approachUsing grounded theory (Charmaz, 2008) as a framework, the question of how do high school pre-teacher education program candidates reflectively peer review their classmates’ digital stories is addressed and discussed through university and high school instructors’ narrative reflections. Through peer reviews of their fellow classmates’ digital stories, students were able to use the digital storytelling guide that included the seven elements of digital storytelling planning to critique and offer suggestions. The authors used the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 cohorts’ digital stories, digital storytelling guides and peer reviews to discover emerging categories and themes and then made sense of these through narrative analysis. This study looks at students’ narratives through the contexts of peer reviews.FindingsThe seven elements of digital storytelling, as noted by Dreon et al. (2011, p. 5), which are point of view, dramatic question, emotional content, the gift of your voice, the power of the soundtrack, economy and pacing, were used as starting points for coding students’ responses in their evaluations of their peers’ digital stories. Situated on the premise of 21st century technologies as important promoters of differentiated ways of teaching and learning that are highly interactive (Greenhow et al., 2009), digital stories and students’ reflective practices of peer reviewing were the foundational aspects of this paper.Research limitations/implicationsThe research the authors have done has been in regards to reviewing and analyzing students’ peer reviews of their classmates’ digital stories, so the authors did not conduct a research study empirical in nature. What the authors have done is to use students’ artifacts (digital story, digital storytelling guides and reflections/peer reviews) to allow students’ authentic voices and perspectives to emerge without their own perspectives marring these. The authors, as teachers, are simply the tools of analysis.Practical implicationsIn reading this paper, teachers of different grade levels will be able to obtain ideas on using digital storytelling in their classrooms first. Second, teachers will be able to obtain hands-on tools for implementing digital storytelling. For example, the digital storytelling guide to which the authors refer (Figure 1) can be used in different subject areas to help students plan their stories. Teachers will also be able to glean knowledge on using students’ peer reviews as a kind of authentic assessment.Social implicationsThe authors hope in writing and presenting this paper is that teachers and instructors at different levels, K-12 through higher education, will consider digital storytelling as a pedagogical and learning practice to spark deeper conversations within the classroom that flow beyond margins and borders of instructional settings out into the community and beyond. The authors hope that others will use opportunities for storytelling, digital, verbal, traditional writing and other ways to spark conversations and privilege students’ voices and lives.Originality/valueAs the authors speak of the original notion of using students’ crucial events as story starters, this is different than prior research for digital storytelling that has focused on lesson units or subject area content. Also, because the authors have used crucial events, this is an entry point to students’ lives and the reation of rapport within the classroom.","Romero-Ivanova, Christina Louise Cook Paul Faurote Greta",English Teaching,577,16

Its increased severity was noted in aged patients usually over 65 years of age. Children and young people have an asymptomatic or mild course of the disease. Unfortunately, the number of children with problems after mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 recovery is increasing and their troubles resemble Kawasaki disease, although the laboratory findings seem to be different. This condition is called pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS), and it is a new disease seen in children directly influenced by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There is an urgent need to explore an effective path for tourism to recover and revitalize. With the normalization of the epidemic, tourism destinations will pay more attention to the prevention, warning, and coping strategies of the epidemic, and this focus will also be evident in the study of tourism destination resilience in the post-epidemic period. Some studies on the epidemic and the resilience of tourism are currently underway, but few of them are integrated with research on the resilience of tourism destinations in the post-epidemic period, although no systematic research ideas or methods have been found.

The network of the HWM system involves important decisions such as facility locating, inventory management, and transportation management. Moreover, with growing concerns towards sustainable development objectives, HWM systems should address its environmental and social aspects as well as its economic and technical characteristics.

Within the proposed model, the first objective function aims to minimize the transportation costs, processing costs, and establishment costs. The second objective function aims to minimize environmental risks and emissions related to the transportation of waste between facilities. The third objective function aims to maximize job creation opportunities.

To describe the process used for applying FAO's SFNE Capacity Assessment Tool in El Salvador. A cross-sectional qualitative study conducted through the following 5 phases: 1) setting up an FAO's facilitation team;2) a SFNE stakeholder mapping (n = 15, from government/NGOs staff to teachers and families);3) background research of national secondary data, policies, reports, and materials relevant to SFNE;4) interviews with key actors (n = 7) and facilitation of multi-stakeholder consultative workshops (n = 5);and 5) report and follow-up. The tool comprises a series of guiding questions to assess individual SFNE capacities, as well as organizational capacity and the policy environment. Key variables of interest comprised policy frameworks, political commitment, program-related capacities, school system, individual training schemes, among others. Descriptive content analysis was carried out to synthesize the results from each dimension. Main capacity gaps identified were: weak institutional coherence, exclusion of SFNE in the formal school curriculum, lack of opportunities to engage all school-level stakeholders in learning activities, and insufficient educational materials for all schools. Key strengths focused on the inclusion of SFNE into key policies, and the availability of SFNE training schemes for front-line educators. Prioritized proposed solutions centered around advocacy for the allocation of SFNE-specific government budget, leveraging on existing multisector platforms to enhance institutional coherence, and strengthening of training of curriculum developers. The application of the tool evidenced key SFNE capacity gaps that needed to be addressed at national level, and provided a clear and nationally-endorsed roadmap to enhance the impact of SFNE in El Salvador.

The decisions that many colleges and universities made to halt on-campus activities and deconcentrate their communities left scores of us scrambling to pack up some of the things we hoped would help us withstand a few weeks away from our offices and classrooms. When I think back on those frenzied days, I often chuckle at how naive I was about the extent to which the pandemic would radically upend our lives, forcing us to rethink every aspect of our ways of being in the world. I was in the middle of leading a discussion on The Tempest in my dramaturgy course when the official word came down from university administrators that all classes would move online and most students would have to vacate their residence halls. A palpable feeling of dread quickly swept over the stuffy classroom. Students began to weep and to wonder out loud what the news would mean for, say, their senior thesis projects or the department's futuristic mounting of The Tempest, which would have to shutter before its second weekend of scheduled performances. I tried my best to remain optimistic, even as I too began to question what the fast-moving changes would mean for how we would finish out the semester. I felt a special call to offer comfort, reaffirming my commitment to supporting students no matter what was ahead.","Wooden, Isaiah Matthew",Theatre Survey,577,10

Anxiety and sleep disorders are the focal point in admissions for psychiatric care in individuals that are impacted by these changes.ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of anxiety and sleep disorders among the patients admitted to our hospital. The state of pandemia was declared on the 11th of March but it had already become a main stream media subject in our country at the beginning of the month.MethodsA retrospective study was performed at the Psychiatric Hospital ‘Elisabeta Doamna’ Galati, using the exact same period, between 01.03 and 30.09, in both 2019 and 2020. ICD-10 criteria were used and pacients with either F41.x or F51.x as discharge diagnosis were included.ResultsIn total, 7638 cases were admitted during the period in 2019, of which 621 (8,13%) had anxiety disorders and 225 (2,94%) sleep disorders. In comparison in 2020 out of 4050 admitted patients, the number had risen to 1003 (24,76%) anxiety disorders and 388 (9,58%) sleep disorders.ConclusionsAnalysis of the data shows a three times increase in the percentage of both classes of disorders among our patients. Even considering the lower admition rates, there is a clear shift in the general profile of our average pacient and this has to be taken into consideration in the long and short term treatment of any psychiatric patient.","Rădulescu, I.

Few studies, however, have analyzed the contributions and impact of their labor in international contexts and on global communities. For instance, it is estimated that over CAD 5 billion-worth of remittances originate from Canada, yet no studies to date have examined the contributions of these remittances from Canadian workers, especially from urbanized regions consisting of VM and immigrants who live and/or work in diverse and multicultural places like Toronto. The present study is the first to investigate health and LTC workers’ roles and behaviors as related to remittances. The rationale for this study is to fill important knowledge gaps. Accordingly, this study asked: Do health/LTC workers in the site of study send remittances? If so, which workers send remittances, and who are the recipients of these remittances? What is the range of monetary value of annual remittances that each worker is able to send? What is the purpose of these remittances? What motivates the decision to send remittances? This mixed-methods study used a single-case design and relied on interviews and a survey. The results indicate that many LTC workers provided significant financial support to transnational families, up to CAD 15,000 annually, for a variety of reasons, including support for education and healthcare costs, or as gifts during cultural festivals. However, the inability to send remittances was also a source of distress for those who wanted to assist their families but were unable to do so. These findings raise important questions that could be directed for future research. For example, are there circumstances under which financial remittances are funded through loans or debt? What are the implications for the sustainability and impact of remittances, given the current COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effect of dampening incomes and wages, worsening migrants’ health, wellbeing, and quality of life, as well as adversely affecting recipient economies and the quality of life of global communities?. © 2021 by the author.

Now, idol groups are struggling in the transition of such events to computer-mediated communication because these events had emphasized meeting face-to-face over communicating, as we can infer from their length of time. I anticipated that investigating this emerging transition would provide implications because their communication has a unique characteristic that is distinct from well-studied situations, such as workplace communication and intimate relationships. Therefore, I first conducted a quantitative survey to develop a precise understanding of the transition, and based on its results, had semi-structured interviews with idol fans about their perceptions of the transition. The survey revealed distinctive approaches, including one where fans gathered at a venue but were isolated from the idol member by an acrylic plate and talked via a video call. Then the interviews not only provided answers to why such an approach would be reasonable but also suggested the existence of a large gap between conventional offline events and emerging online events in their perceptions. Based on the results, I discussed how we can develop interaction techniques to support this transition and how we can apply it to other situations outside idol culture, such as computer-mediated performing arts.","Yakura, Hiromu",,577,24

However, quantitative data on carnivore species coexisting with humans in different land-use types remain largely missing. Thus, this paper investigated the effect of anthropogenic land-use and landscape drivers on carnivore species richness and distribution in the Faragosa-Fura Landscape, Gamo Zone, southern Ethiopia. To collect data, we employed the line transect method using three complementary field surveys techniques: sign survey, camera-trapping, and opportunistic sighting survey during wet and dry seasons in 2020 and 2021. We stratified the study landscape into five land-use types-forest, wetland, grassland, agricultural land, and settlement. The result proved the occurrence of 12 carnivore species belonging to six families, including vulnerable Felidae species - Panthera pardus. Family Felidae and Herpestidae were composed of a greater number of species, while Hyaenidae and Mustelidae were each represented by single species. Out of identified species, only two species (Panthera pardus and Crocuta crocuta) were large-sized, while the rest were medium and small-sized carnivores. Overall, the mean richness of the study area was 5.73±0.284(SE). The species richness was highest in the wetland (n = 12, mean = 7.67±0.494(SE)) and lowest in the settlement (n = 5, mean = 4.25±0.479(SE)). The regression analysis showed that most of the carnivores displayed a strong negative relationship with agriculture, roads, and settlement while displayed a strong positive relationship with wetland and forest. In general, out of 32 species recorded in Ethiopia, this study quantified 12 carnivore species that signify the area is an important area for wildlife conservation in Ethiopia. Further, the study concluded that the wetland is the most important habitat, particularly for larger-sized and habitat specialists while anthropogenic land-uses types adversely affecting species richness. Thus, a generic paradigm to reconcile land management and biodiversity conservation is highly important.","Gebo, Berhanu; Takele, Serekebirhan; Shibru, Simon",bioRxiv,577,33

Based on the frameworks of the Health Belief Model and the extended Theory of Planned Behaviour, this study examines the effect of COVID-19 risk perception on behavioural intention towards untact tourism. The online survey was administered to South Korean citizens in March and April 2020. A total of 877 questionnaires were used for data analysis. The results indicate that affective risk perception is a significant antecedent of attitude, while cognitive risk perception was found to positively influence subjective norms. Despite the significant influence of both cognitive and affective risk perceptions on behavioural intention, affective risk perception exerts a negative influence on behavioural intention, which is in opposition to the original hypothesis. Attitude was found to be a significant mediator between affective risk perception and behavioural intention whereas subjective norms mediated the relationship between cognitive perception and behavioural intention. Gender and marital status partially moderated the hypothesized relationships among the constructs. This study provides timely and insightful implications for tourism practitioners who will be expected to prepare the post-corona field for a new normal after the experience of restricted living during an unprecedented pandemic.","Bae, So Young; Chang, Po-Ju",Curr.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery in Denmark from a third-party payer perspective in the mid- (ten years) and long-term (lifetime). METHODS A state-transition Markov model was developed in which patients may experience surgery, post-surgery complications, diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular diseases or die. Transition probabilities, costs and utilities were informed by the literature. Three types of surgery were included: gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and adjustable gastric banding. The impact of different surgical methods on BMI level was informed by the Danish Obesity Surgery Registry (Dansk Fedmekirurgiregister). RESULTS In the ten-year base-case analysis, bariatric surgery led to a cost increment of 19,332 DKK and generated an additional 1.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). In the course of a lifetime, surgery leads to savings of 36,403 DKK, an additional 0.7 life years and 2.9 QALYs. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at ten years with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 17,818 DKK per QALY and was dominant over conservative management in the course of a lifetime. Up to three years of delay in the provision of surgery resulted in a reduction of life years, a lower QALY gain and a minor decrease in healthcare costs. CONCLUSIONS In Denmark, bariatric surgery is cost-effective at ten years and may produce a significant reduction in healthcare costs over the course of a lifetime in persons with severe obesity.

Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) has been used in the clinical treatment of vascular diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects and possible involved mechanisms on ALI. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to establish a sepsis model in rats. TMP at various dosages were administrated to rats using a intragastric method. Animal survival rate was calculated. The lung functions were evaluated by lung weight/dry weight ratio (W/D), PaO2, dynamic compliance (DC), and airway resistance index (ARI). Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were isolated from lungs harvested from rats with sepsis. TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis. Protein expression and phosphorylation levels were assessed by western blotting. RESULTS TMP administration increased the survival rate of septic rats. TMP also decreased W/D and DC, but increased PaO2 and ARI in septic rats. Moreover, PMVECs apoptosis was inhibited in septic rats that received TMP treatment. The expression levels of GRP78, ATF4, caspase-12, active caspase-3, as well as the phosphorylation levels of PERK and eIF2α were suppressed in PMVECs isolated from TMP-treated septic rats.

METHODS We included consecutive patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation admitted to our hospital for AIS or TIA (index event) who received secondary prophylaxis with DOAC or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Follow-up was at least 3 months. In the primary analysis, we compared rates of ICH and recurrent ischemic events (AIS or TIA) between patients with early (≤7 days since event; DOACearly) and those with late (>7 days, DOAClate) start of DOAC. RESULTS Two hundred four patients were included (median age 79 years, 89% AIS) and total follow-up time was 78.25 patient-years. One hundred fifty-five patients received DOAC with a median delay of 5 days after the index event (interquartile range 3-11) and 49 received VKA. DOAC was started early in 100 patients (65%). We observed one ICH (1.3%/y) and 6 recurrent AIS (7.7%/y). The ICH occurred in a patient taking VKA. No significant difference in the rate of recurrent AIS between DOACearly (5.1%/y) and DOAClate (9.3%/y, p = 0.53) was observed. CONCLUSIONS Even if DOACs are often started early after an index event, the risk of ICH appears to be low. Among all patients receiving anticoagulation, the rate of recurrent events was 6 times higher than the rate of ICH.","Seiffge, David J; Traenka, Christopher; Polymeris, Alexandros; Hert, Lisa; Peters, Nils; Lyrer, Philippe; Engelter, Stefan T; Bonati, Leo H; De Marchis, Gian Marco",Neurology,577,16

This paper reports on immunohistochemical techniques developed for the detection of IL-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in fixed and paraffin-embedded pig tissues (spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, liver and kidney). Different fixatives (buffered formalin, acetic formalin, paraformadehyde-lysine-periodate and Bouin solution), and antigen unmasking techniques (permeabilisation with Tween 20, pronase enzymatic digestion and microwave-citrate buffer) were used. We describe different protocols for detection of monokines using polyclonal antibodies against the studied monokines. No signal was obtained with monoclonal antibodies against pig-TNF-alpha and human IL-1alpha. Bouin solution was shown to be the best fixative for immunohistochemical detection of IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, using permeabilisation with Tween 20 as an unmasking antigen method. Acetic formalin was shown to be the best fixative for IL-1beta detection, not needing antigen retrieval techniques.

A Northern blot analysis of the viral RNAs present in PRC II-transformed cells showed that the PRC II genome was expressed as a single 4.0 kilobase mRNA species. In vitro translation of polyadenylic acid-containing 70S virion RNA yielded two highly related proteins of 110,000 and 105,000 daltons (P110 and P105), which were synthesized from messenger activity that sedimented as expected for the 4.0 kilobase PRC II genome (at 25 to 27S). P110 and P105 were identified as in vitro translation products of the PRC II genome by immunoprecipitation and tryptic peptide mapping and were the only PRC II-specific polypeptides detected by in vitro synthesis. In addition, we found that immune complexes prepared from PRC II 70S virion RNA in vitro translation products contained a tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity. A comparison of the in vitro- and in vivo-synthesized proteins revealed that PRC II-transformed cells also contained 110,000- and 105,000-dalton proteins, which were indistinguishable from in vitro-synthesized P110 and P105 by electrophoretic mobility and tryptic peptide analysis. Both P110 and P105 were present in producer cells and in seven individual nonproducer clones. A pulse-chase analysis showed that P105 was the primary translation product of the PRC II genome and that P110 was derived from P105 by post-translational modification. Under conditions of long-term labeling with [35S]methionine, P110 and P105 were present in a molar ratio of approximately 1:1. These results indicated that the transformation-specific product of the PRC II genome, previously referred to as a single component (P105), actually consists of two polypeptides related by post-translational modification.","Adkins, B; Hunter, T; Beemon, K",Journal of virology,577,16

Although molecular identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the gold standard method, its low sensitivity and long turnaround time are among major concerns. In this retrospective single-center study, we reviewed the results of the lymphocyte and neutrophil counts of 1450 Iranian patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recruited at Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Of 1450 patients, 439 cases (30.3%) were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative; further emphasizing that getting negative molecular testing is not as reliable as a positive result. While the lymphocyte count in cases with less than 50 years old was 1.8×103/µL (1.2-2.5), it was 1.47×103/µL (0.84-2.16) in the older group (p<0.001). Also, men experienced lower lymphocytes as compared to women (1.53×103/µL vs 1.76×103/µL; p=0.002). Of particular interest, the lymphocyte count in the PCR-negative cases was 1.77×103/µL (0.98-2.45) which was significantly higher than its count in their positive counterparts (1.53×103/µL; p=0.004). Unlike lymphocytes, sex and PCR did not significantly affect the number of neutrophils. The odds ratio for neutrophilia in patients aged older than 50, either with a negative or a positive PCR, was 2.46 and 2.23, suggesting old age as the most significant associated factor. The number of lymphocytes along with increased neutrophil count may probably serve as simple, rapid, and economical biomarkers, and are seemingly appropriate items that should be taken into account in the identification of patients with COVID-19, especially those aged more than 50.","Bashash, Davood; Abolghasemi, Hassan; Naseri, Parisa; Cheraghali, Abdol Majid; Soltanpoor, Mohammad Javad; Imani Fooladi, Abbas Ali","Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",577,1

Individuals aged 60 years or older and medical staff were prioritized in COVID-19 immunization, and currently individuals aged 16 years or older are eligible to receive the vaccine. To achieve levels of community immunity (herd immunity) immunization of 60-70% of the population is required. As of mid-February 2021, about 42% of the population in Israel received the first vaccine dose, and the coverage exceeded 70% in individuals aged 50 years or older. Despite this success, the rates of COVID-19 immunization are lower in the ultraorthodox and Arab populations compared to the general Jewish population. We reviewed factors that might affect acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. Factors that might influence the individual's willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 include concerns about the safety of the vaccine, recommendations by employers and treating physicians. Moreover, differences were found in the willingness to be vaccinated according to socio-demographic characteristics, such as employment, age and gender groups, and even political affiliation. Minority populations are vulnerable to misinformation about vaccines. The Arab and the ultraorthodox populations are the main minority groups in Israel, and characterized by lifestyle, and low socio-economic status, which increased, among other factors, the incidence of COVID-19 in these populations. To improve vaccine uptake in the ultraorthodox and Arab populations, there is an urgent need for better tailored solutions to the unique needs of these minority populations, which comprise main risk groups for misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, a better understanding of the reasons for low uptake of COVID-19 vaccine in these populations is warranted. These activities should be undertaken in parallel to continuous efforts towards reducing socio-economic disparities between sub-population groups.","Ber, Imanuel; Lerman, Yehuda; Muhsen, Khitam",Harefuah,577,26

Single-use flexible bronchoscopes (SUFBs) eliminate this source. Additionally, RFBs pose a risk of nosocomial infection transmission between patients with the identification of human proteins, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and pathogenic organisms on fully reprocessed bronchoscopes despite full adherence to the guidelines. Bronchoscopy units have been hugely impacted by the pandemic with restructuring of pre- and post-operative areas, altered patient protocols and the reassessment of air exchange and cleaning procedures. SUFBs can be incorporated into these protocols as a means of improving occupational safety.

205224,205224,205224,Medical Mistrust and Enduring Racism in South Africa,17.077133,2.421536,2021,"BACKGROUND: Schools, depending on their access to and quality of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and the implementation of healthy behaviours, can be critical for the control and spread of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Schools provide opportunities for pupils to learn about the importance of hygiene and WASH-related practice, and build healthy habits and skills, with beneficial medium- and long-term consequences particularly in low- and middle-income countries: reducing pupils' absenteeism due to diseases, promoting physical, mental and social health, and improving learning outcomes. WASH services alone are often not sufficient and need to be combined with educational programmes. As pupils disseminate their acquired health-promoting knowledge to their (extended) families, improved WASH provisions and education in schools have beneficial effects also on the community. International organisations frequently roll out interventions in schools to improve WASH services and, in some cases, train pupils and teachers on safe WASH behaviours. How such interventions relate to local school education on WASH, health promotion and disease prevention knowledge, whether and how such knowledge and school books are integrated into WASH education interventions in schools, are knowledge gaps we fill. METHODS: We analyzed how Kenyan primary school science text book content supports WASH and health education by a book review including books used from class 1 through class 8, covering the age range from 6 to 13 years. We then conducted a rapid literature review of combined WASH interventions that included a behaviour change or educational component, and a rapid review of international policy guidance documents to contextualise the results and understand the relevance of books and school education for WASH interventions implemented by international organisations. We conducted a content analysis based on five identified thematic categories, including drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, environmental hygiene & health promotion and disease risks, and mapped over time the knowledge about WASH and disease prevention. RESULTS: The books comprehensively address drinking water issues, including sources, quality, treatment, safe storage and water conservation; risks and transmission pathways of various waterborne (Cholera, Typhoid fever), water-based (Bilharzia), vector-related (Malaria) and other communicable diseases (Tuberculosis); and the importance of environmental hygiene and health promotion. The content is broadly in line with internationally recommended WASH topics and learning objectives. Gaps remain on personal hygiene and handwashing, including menstrual hygiene, sanitation education, and related health risks and disease exposures. The depth of content varies greatly over time and across the different classes. Such locally available education materials already used in schools were considered by none of the WASH education interventions in the considered intervention studies. CONCLUSIONS: The thematic gaps/under-representations in books that we identified, namely sanitation, hygiene and menstrual hygiene education, are all high on the international WASH agenda, and need to be filled especially now, in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Disconnects exist between school book knowledge and WASH education interventions, between policy and implementation, and between theory and practice, revealing missed opportunities for effective and sustainable behaviour change, and underlining the need for better integration. Considering existing local educational materials and knowledge may facilitate the buy-in and involvement of teachers and school managers in strengthening education and implementing improvements. We suggest opportunities for future research, behaviour change interventions and decision-making to improve WASH in schools.","Anthonj, Carmen; Githinji, Sophie; Höser, Christoph; Stein, Alfred; Blanford, Justine; Grossi, Valentina",Int J Hyg Environ Health,577,1

Elevation and air quality are believed to be significant factors in the development of the pandemic, but the influence of additional environmental factors remains unclear. METHODS: We explored the relationship between the cumulative number of infections and mortality cases with climate (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, water vapor pressure, wind), environmental data (elevation, normalized difference vegetation index or NDVI, particulate matter at 2.5 µm or PM2.5 and NO2 concentration), and population density in Peru. We use confirmed cases of infection from 1,287 districts and mortality in 479 districts, we used Spearman's correlations to assess the bivariate correlation between environmental and climatic factors with cumulative infection cases, cumulative mortality and case-fatality rate. We explored district cases within the ecozones of coast, sierra, high montane forest and lowland rainforest. RESULTS: Multiple linear regression models indicate elevation, mean solar radiation, air quality, population density and green vegetation cover, as a socioeconomic proxy, are influential factors in the distribution of infection and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Peru. Case-fatality rate was weakly associated with elevation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results also strongly suggest that exposure to poor air quality is a significant factor in the mortality of individuals below the age of 30. We conclude that environmental and climatic factors do play a significant role in the transmission and case fatality rates in Peru, however further study is required to see if these relationships are maintained over time.","Samillan, Victor J; Flores-León, Diana; Rojas, Eduardo; Zutta, Brian R",J. basic clin. physiol. pharmacol,577,32

However, the effect of reclaimed water on the virtual water trade has not been evaluated in previous studies. For the sake of sustainable water management, this study explored the benefits of reclaimed water use for balancing the water resource allocation at the interprovincial level. Multiregional input-output analysis and ecological network analysis were used to investigate the spatial and structural characteristics of the virtual reclaimed water network (VRWN) among 31 provinces in China and the potential effect of reclaimed water use. The results show that the net export flows of virtual reclaimed water have different spatial patterns from those of freshwater, some provinces that import virtual freshwater are exporters of virtual reclaimed water. Although the exploitative relationship is the dominant ecological relationship in the VRWN (72%), it is confirmed that reclaimed water use contributes to balancing the virtual water trade of China with a more competitive relationship (21%) than in the virtual freshwater network (4%). The virtual freshwater consumption change rate in developed provinces decreases by more than 10% through reclaimed water use. Due to the high food exports and low application of wastewater reclamation in less developed provinces, the effect of reclaimed water use in those provinces is not as obvious as that in developed provinces. This paper offers a new perspective for understanding the current VRWN and guidance for the optimization of the virtual water trade structure.","Qi, Hang; Zeng, Siyu; Shi, Lei; Dong, Xin",J Environ Manage,577,16

Furthermore, the associations between sex hormones and systemic inflammation markers, viral shedding and length of patients' hospitalization were studied. DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study, including 48 SARS-CoV-2 male patients, admitted to an Italian reference Hospital. The cases were composed by 24 patients with PaO2/FiO2 < 250 mmHg and needed ventilatory support (severe COVID-19). The controls were selected in a 1:1 ratio, matching by ages, among patients who may receive a low-flow oxygen supplementation (mild COVID-19). For each group, sex hormones at hospitalization were evaluated. RESULTS: Severe COVID-19 patients had a significantly lower Testosterone levels than mild COVID-19 patients. The median total testosterone (TT) was 1.4 ng/mL in cases and 3.5 ng/mL in controls (p = 0.005); the median bioavailable testosterone was 0.49 and 1.21 (p = 0.008); the median calculated Free Testosterone (cFT) was 0.029 ng/mL and 0.058 ng/mL (p = 0.015), respectively. Either low TT, low cFT and low BioT were correlated to the hyperinflammatory syndrome (p = 0.018, p = 0.048 and p = 0.020) and associated to a longer hospitalization (p = 0.052, p = 0.041 and p = 0.023), respectively. No association was found between hormones and duration of viral shedding nor mortality rate.

The limited capacity of low- and lower-middle income countries (LMICs) to respond to the pandemic and its impact on the health of populations - particularly the most vulnerable - presents a marked challenge. In this context, countries face the enormous task of rethinking the way essential services will be delivered. A critical and essential part of solving these challenges will be using information and communication technology and digital health to enhance direct communication with the public; scale proven and innovative service delivery models; and empower the frontlines.

215400,215400,215400,The impact of covid-19 on supply chains of all-inclusive hotels,16.753769,2.297662,2021,"BACKGROUND: Canada has been slow to implement virtual care relative to other countries. However, in recent years, the availability of on-demand, ""walk-in"" virtual clinics has increased, with the COVID-19 pandemic contributing to the increased demand and provision of virtual care nationwide. Although virtual care facilitates access to physicians while maintaining physical distancing, there are concerns regarding the continuity and quality of care as well as equitable access. There is a paucity of research documenting the availability of virtual care in Canada, thus hampering the efforts to evaluate the impacts of its relatively rapid emergence on the broader health care system and on individual health. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a national environmental scan to determine the availability and scope of virtual walk-in clinics, cataloging the services they offer and whether they are operating through public or private payment. METHODS: We developed a power term and implemented a structured Google search to identify relevant clinics. From each clinic meeting our inclusion criteria, we abstracted data on the payment model, region of operation, services offered, and continuity of care. We compared clinics operating under different payment models using Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: We identified 18 virtual walk-in clinics. Of the 18 clinics, 10 (56%) provided some services under provincial public insurance, although 44% (8/18) operated on a fully private payment model while an additional 39% (7/18) charged patients out of pocket for some services. The most common supplemental services offered included dermatology (15/18, 83%), mental health services (14/18, 78%), and sexual health (11/18, 61%). Continuity, information sharing, or communication with the consumers' existing primary care providers were mentioned by 22% (4/18) of the clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual walk-in clinics have proliferated; however, concerns about equitable access, continuity of care, and diversion of physician workforce within these models highlight the importance of supporting virtual care options within the context of longitudinal primary care. More research is needed to support quality virtual care and understand its effects on patient and provider experiences and the overall health system utilization and costs.","Matthewman, Spencer; Spencer, Sarah; Lavergne, M Ruth; McCracken, Rita K; Hedden, Lindsay",J Med Internet Res,577,15

However, turnover has never been reported on the Nursing Home Compare website, likely because of the lack of adequate data. On July 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began collecting auditable payroll-based daily staffing data for US nursing homes. We used 492 million nurse shifts from these data to calculate a novel turnover metric representing the percentage of hours of nursing staff care that turned over annually at each of 15,645 facilities. Mean and median annual turnover rates for total nursing staff were roughly 128 percent and 94 percent, respectively. Turnover rates were correlated with facility location, for-profit status, chain ownership, Medicaid patient census, and star ratings. Disseminating facilities' nursing staff turnover rates on Nursing Home Compare could provide important quality information for policy makers, payers, and consumers, and it may incentivize efforts to reduce turnover.","Gandhi, Ashvin; Yu, Huizi; Grabowski, David C",Health Aff (Millwood),577,11

METHODS: This study is a prospective, nationwide study in patients with solid cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection included between 10 March to 15 June 2020. Patient's baseline characteristics were collected. The study's primary outcome was overall survival within 30 days of verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes were hospital admission, admission to an ICU, and need for supplemental oxygen. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients with a cancer diagnosis and verified SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. After one month of follow up, hospitalization was required for 54% (n = 61) and 21% of the patients had died and 14 of the 23 deceased cancer patients were &#8805;70 years. Most patients were classified with mild COVID-19 symptoms (66%, n = 74); however, 48% (n = 23) of the &#8805;70-year-olds patients were classified with severe or critical COVID-19 symptoms. Among the total study population, 61% (n = 68) had comorbidities and comorbidity were more frequently observed among the deceased (91%, n = 21) and older cancer patients (&#8805;70 years, 81%, n = 39). CONCLUSIONS: Acknowledging the low sample size in this study, our work shows that age and comorbidities, but not recent cytotoxic therapy, are associated with adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection for patients with solid cancer.

Lung ultrasound has been proposed to diagnose and monitor it, despite the fact that little is known about the ultrasound appearance due to the novelty of the illness. The aim of this manuscript is to characterise the lung ultrasonographic appearance of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, with particular emphasis on its relationship with the time course of the illness and clinical parameters. Methods: Adult patients from the intensive care unit of two academic hospitals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Images were analysed using internationally recognised techniques which included assessment of the pleura, number of B-lines, pathology in the PLAPS (posterolateral alveolar and/or pleural syndrome) point, bedside lung ultrasound in emergency profiles, and the lung ultrasound score. The primary outcomes were frequencies, percentages and differences in lung ultrasound findings overall and between short (&#8804;14â days) and long (>14â days) durations of symptoms and their correlation with clinical parameters. Results: In this pilot observational study, 61 patients were included with 76 examinations available for analysis. 26% of patients had no anterior lung abnormalities, while the most prevalent pathological ultrasound findings were thickening of the pleura (42%), &#8805;3 B-lines per view (38%) and presence of PLAPS (74%). Patients with ""long"" duration of symptoms presented more frequently with a thickened and irregular pleura (32 (21%) versus 11 (9%)), C-profile (18 (47%) versus 8 (25%)) and pleural effusion (14 (19%) versus 3 (5%)), compared to patients with short duration of symptoms. Lung ultrasound findings did not correlate with arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction ratio, fluid balance or dynamic compliance. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 results in significant, but not specific, ultrasound changes, with decreased lung sliding, thickening of the pleura and a B-profile being the most commonly observed. With time, a thickened and irregular pleura, C-profile and pleural effusion become more common findings. When screening patients, a comprehensive ultrasound protocol might be necessary.","Haaksma, Mark E; Heldeweg, Micah L A; Lopez Matta, Jorge E; Smit, Jasper M; van Trigt, Jessica D; Nooitgedacht, Jip S; Elzo Kraemer, Carlos V; van de Wiel, Mark; Girbes, Armand R J; Heunks, Leo; van Westerloo, David J; Tuinman, Pieter R",ERJ open res,577,29

Research into targeted therapies and vaccines has been initiated on an unprecedented scale and speed but will take months and even years to come to fruition. Meanwhile, the efficacy of emerging therapeutics for use in treating COVID-19 is feverishly being investigated to identify the best available treatment options for dealing with the current wave of disease. This review provides frontline clinicians with a pragmatic summary of the current state of the rapidly evolving evidence supporting emerging candidate therapeutics for COVID-19. Two main categories of pharmaceutical therapeutics are showing promise-those with antiviral activity directly addressing infection and those that counteract the inflammatory cytokine storm induced by severe disease. Preliminary results suggest that other approaches such as convalescent plasma therapy and lung radiation therapy may have some efficacy. The current clinical evidence for potential treatments is preliminary - often small retrospective series or early results from randomized trials - and the science is evolving rapidly. Long-term results from large, well-designed randomized trials will provide definitive evidence of therapeutic effectiveness and are likely months away. The trial landscape for promising therapies is described.","Willis, Van C; Arriaga, Yull; Weeraratne, Dilhan; Reyes, Fredy; Jackson, Gretchen P",,577,26

A simplified, single-day regimen of two injections at separate gluteal and/or deltoid injection sites, together with a single 20-mg dose of oral aripiprazole on the 1st day, was assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A previously developed population-pharmacokinetic (popPK) model for characterizing aripiprazole PK following oral administration and gluteal intramuscular depot injection was expanded to include deltoid injection. Simulations were conducted to assess PK profiles following various (including two-injection) start regimens. Postmarketing data on patients who received higher-than-recommended AOM doses were used to assess overall safety/tolerability. RESULTS: The two-injection start regimen with a single concurrent oral dose displayed a comparable PK profile to the single-injection start regimen with concurrent 14-day oral administration in simulations. The safety assessment indicated the two-injection start regimen was unlikely to be associated with safety concerns beyond those expected with a single-injection start regimen. CONCLUSION: These data support use of the two-injection start regimen in clinical practice to reduce reliance on daily oral administration and optimize the therapeutic benefits of AOM 400 in patients with schizophrenia.","Wang, Yanlin; Wang, Xiaofeng; Harlin, Matt; Larsen, Frank; Panni, Moeen; Yildirim, Murat; Madera, Jessica; Arias, Liz; Forbes, Andy; Mustafa, Nihal; Ruiz-White, Inez; Raoufinia, Arash",Curr Med Res Opin,577,20

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the maternal-fetal medicine fellowship program directors' approaches to exclusive virtual interviews and to obtain program director feedback on the virtual interview experience to guide future interview cycles. STUDY DESIGN: A novel cross-sectional online survey was distributed through the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine to program directors after the completion of the interview season, but before the results of the National Resident Matching Program on October 14, 2020. Survey data were collected anonymously and managed using secure Research Electronic Data Capture electronic data capture tools. RESULTS: Overall 71 of 89 program directors (80%) responded. All respondents completed their 2020 interviews 100% virtually. Nearly half of program directors (33 of 68, 49%) interviewed more candidates in 2020 than in 2019. Of those who interviewed more candidates in 2020, the mean number of additional candidates per fellowship position was 5.8 (standard deviation, ±3.8). Almost all program directors reported no (35 of 71, 49%) or minimal (34 of 71, 48%) negative impact of technical difficulties on their virtual interview processes. Most programs structured their interview to a half day (4 hours) or less for the candidates. Many programs were able to adapt their supplemental interview materials and events for the candidates into a virtual format, including a virtual social event hosted by 31 of 71 programs (44%). The virtual social event was most commonly casual and led by current fellows. Ultimately, all program directors reported that the virtual interview experience was as expected or better than expected. However, most program directors felt less able to provide candidates with a comprehensive and accurate representation of their program on a virtual platform compared with their previous in-person experiences (46 of 71 [65%] reported minimally, moderately, or significantly less than in-person). In addition, most program directors felt their ability to get to know candidates and assess their ""fit"" with the program was less than previous in-person years (44 of 71 [62%] reported minimally, moderately, or significantly less than in-person). In a hypothetical future year without any public health concerns, there were 23 of 71 respondents (32%) who prefer exclusive in-person interviews, 24 of 71 (34%) who prefer exclusive virtual interviews, and 24 of 71 (34%) who prefer a hybrid of virtual and in-person interviews. CONCLUSION: The virtual interview experience was better than expected for most program directors. However, most program directors felt less able to present their programs and assess the candidates on a virtual platform compared with previous in-person experiences. Despite this, most program directors are interested in at least a component of virtual interviewing in future years. Future efforts are needed to refine the virtual interview process to optimize the experience for program directors and candidates.","Rhoades, Janine S; Ramsey, Patrick S; Metz, Torri D; Lewkowitz, Adam K",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,577,10

These receptors are widely expressed in the intestine, and COVID-19 may cause gastrointestinal symptoms via these receptors during the course of the disease. Helicobacter pylori is known to increase the expression of ACE-2 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of H pylori on the presentation and clinical course of COVID-19 infections. METHODS: This study was carried out from June 1 to July 20, 2020. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infections by PCR tests were included in the study. Antigen screening tests were performed on stool samples to determine the presence of H pylori. All patients were evaluated for manifestations of COVID-19 infection, severity of the course, hospitalized days due to the virus and outcome of the disease process. RESULTS: Of 108 COVID-19 positive patients evaluated, 31 with a mean age of 49.54â±â17.94 years were H pylori-positive [(8 females (25.8%)] and 77 with a mean age of 47.85â±â20.51 years; [31 females (%40.3)] were H pylori-negative. Abdominal pain (19.4% vs 2.6%) and diarrhea (32.3% vs 9.1%) were significantly higher in patients with H pylori than those without (pâ=â0.007 and pâ=â0.006, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between H pylori positivity and the number of hospitalized days, the severity of the course of COVID-19 infection, or the outcome of the disease (pâ>â0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that the findings of abdominal pain and diarrhea strongly correlated with the presence of H pylori in COVID-19 patients.","Balamtekin, Necati; Artuk, Cumhur; Arslan, Melike; Gülsen, Mustafa",J. pediatr. gastroenterol. nutr,577,33

A systematic review was performed to identify and synthesize the best available evidence on the association between vitamin D level and risk of COVID-19, adverse outcomes and possible benefits of supplementation in aged 60 years or over. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed© and Scopus© for all publications from inception published before 15 March 2021.

Publication year, study design and setting, characteristics of the study population were extracted. This study is registered with PROSPERO, under the number CRD42020223993. RESULTS: In total, 707 studies were identified, of which 11 observational studies were included in the final review. Four studies compared vitamin D-supplemented COVID-19 patients to non-supplemented patients, and seven compared patients with vitamin D deficiency to patients without deficiency. In all four studies, patients with vitamin D supplementation had better rates of primary clinical outcomes (death, the severity of the disease, oxygen therapy requirement...). In studies comparing patients with vitamin D deficiency and patients without vitamin D deficiency, those without vitamin D deficiency had better primary clinical outcomes (death rate, the severity of the disease, oxygen therapy requirement, invasive mechanical ventilation need...). CONCLUSION: This systematic review seems to support an association between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of COVID-19 in aged people. In addition, vitamin D deficiency appears to expose these subjects to a greater risk of adverse outcomes. Because of its simplicity of administration, and the rarity of side effects, including vitamin D in preventive strategies for certain viral diseases, it appears to be an attractive option.","Drame, M.; Cofais, C.; Hentzien, M.; Proye, E.; Coulibaly, P.

This study was an investigation of the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Saudi Arabia during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Serology results and epidemiological data were analyzed for 837 adult blood donors, with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in Saudi Arabia from 20th to 25th May 2020. Seroprevalence was determined using electrochemical immunoassay to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.4% (12/837). Non-citizens had higher seroprevalence compared with citizens (OR 13.6, p = 0.001). Secondary education was significantly associated with higher seroprevalence compared with higher education (OR 6.8, p = 0.005). The data showed that the highest seroprevalence was in Makkah (8.1%). Uisng Makkah seroprevalence as the reference, the seroprevalence in other areas was: Madinah 4.1% (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12-1.94), Jeddah 2.3% (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.31-2.25), and Qassim 2.9 % (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.04-2.89) and these were not statistically different from seroprevalence in the Makkah region. CONCLUSIONS: At the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia, the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors was low, but was higher among non-citizens. These findings may indicate that non-citizens and less educated individuals may be less attentive to preventive measures.

METHODS: The data retrospectively analyzed for suspected and confirmed pediatric COVID-19 patients between March 20 and May 31, 2020. RESULTS: There were 404 children, of them, 176 (43.6%) patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 which were less symptomatic on admission (67.6% to 95.6%). Cough (44.9%), fever (38.1%), sore throat (18.5%), and smell-taste loss (12.7%) were the most common symptoms. Confirmed cases had 92.6% identified history of contact with COVID-19. Close contact with COVID-19 positive family members and coughs increased the RT-PCR positivity 23.8 and 5.0 times, respectively; while positivity decreased by 0.4 times if fever was over 38°C. Asymptomatic and mild cases were categorized as 'group 1' (n=153), moderate, severe and critical cases as 'group 2' (n=23) in terms of disease severity. Group 2 cases had higher C-reactive protein (40.9% to 15.9%) and procalcitonin (22.7% to 4.9%) levels and had more frequent lymphopenia (45.5% to 13.1%). Out of 23 cases, 19 had abnormal chest x-ray findings; of them, 15 patients underwent chest CTs, and all had abnormal findings. However, 26.0% of them needed respiratory support, and no patient required invasive ventilation. CONCLUSION: Children with COVID-19 have milder clinical course and SARS-CoV-2 rarely causes severe disease in children. Contact history with COVID-19 and sore throat are the most important predictors for RT-PCR positivity. Consequently, the role of asymptomatic children in the contamination chain must be fully established and considered for the control of pandemic.","Arslan, Gazi; Aktürk, Hüseyin; Duman, Murat",Pediatr. int,577,22

This review will analyze the rapidly increasing knowledge of COVID-19-induced lung pathophysiology. Although controversial, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19 (CARDS) seems to present as two distinct phenotypes: type L and type H. The ""L"" refers to low elastance, ventilation/perfusion ratio, lung weight, and recruitability, and the ""H"" refers to high pulmonary elastance, shunt, edema, and recruitability. However, the LUNG-SAFE (Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure) and ESICM (European Society of Intensive Care Medicine) Trials Groups have shown that ~13% of the mechanically ventilated non-COVID-19 ARDS patients have the type-L phenotype. Other studies have shown that CARDS and ARDS respiratory mechanics overlap and that standard ventilation strategies apply to these patients. The mechanisms causing alterations in pulmonary perfusion could be caused by some combination of 1) renin-angiotensin system dysregulation, 2) thrombosis caused by loss of endothelial barrier, 3) endothelial dysfunction causing loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction perfusion control, and 4) hyperperfusion of collapsed lung tissue that has been directly measured and supported by a computational model. A flowchart has been constructed highlighting the need for personalized and adaptive ventilation strategies, such as the time-controlled adaptive ventilation method, to set and adjust the airway pressure release ventilation mode, which recently was shown to be effective at improving oxygenation and reducing inspiratory fraction of oxygen, vasopressors, and sedation in patients with COVID-19.","Habashi, N.

Doctors, like other professionals, are at risk inherent in the nature of the work and the environment in which it is carried out. The anesthesiologist is no exception to the rule and is exposed to an unhealthy environment when caring for patients and dedicating themselves to them, they are often exposed to the action of harmful agents. The pandemic imposed by COVID-19 infection takes the anesthesiologist's routine, already aggravated by several occupational factors, to a professional risk that was previously unimaginable.

This study investigated the variations in chemical compositions, source contributions, and regional transport of fine particles (PM2.5) during January 23-February 22 of 2020, compared with the same period in 2019. The average mass concentration of PM2.5 decreased from 72.9 µg m-3 (2019) to 45.9 µg m-3 (2020), by 27.0 µg m-3. It was predominantly contributed by the emission reduction (92.0%), retrieved from a random forest tree approach. The main chemical species of PM2.5 all decreased with the reductions ranging from 0.85 µg m-3 (chloride) to 9.86 µg m-3 (nitrate) (p < 0.01). Positive matrix factorization model indicated that the mass contributions of seven PM2.5 sources all decreased. However, their contribution percentages varied from -11.0% (industrial processes) to 8.70% (secondary inorganic aerosol). Source contributions of PM2.5 transported from potential geographical regions showed reductions with mean values ranging from 0.22 to 4.36 µg m-3. However, increased contributions of firework burning, secondary inorganic aerosol, road dust, and vehicle emissions from transboundary transport were observed. This study highlighted the complex and nonlinear response of chemical compositions and sources of PM2.5 to air pollution control measures, suggesting the importance of regional-joint control.","Zheng, Huang; Kong, Shaofei; Chen, Nan; Yan, Yingying; Liu, Dantong; Zhu, Bo; Xu, Ke; Cao, Wenxiang; Ding, Qingqing; Lan, Bo; Zhang, Zhouxiang; Zheng, Mingming; Fan, Zewei; Cheng, Yi; Zheng, Shurui; Yao, Liquan; Bai, Yongqing; Zhao, Tianliang; Qi, Shihua",Sci Total Environ,577,2

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of ABS tools on the consistency and reproducibility of the quantified brain volumetry from different scanners. METHODS: We included fifteen healthy volunteers who were scanned with 3D isotropic brain T1-weighted sequence on three different 3.0 Tesla MRI scanners (GE, Siemens and Philips). For each individual, the time span between image acquisitions on different scanners was limited to 1 h. All the T1-weighted images were processed with FreeSurfer v6.0, FSL v5.0 and AccuBrain® with default settings to obtain volumetry of brain tissues (e.g. gray matter) and substructures (e.g. basal ganglia structures) if available. Coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated to test inter-scanner variability in brain volumetry of various structures as quantified by these ABS tools. RESULTS: The mean inter-scanner CV values per brain structure among three MRI scanners ranged from 6.946 to 12.29% (mean, 9.577%) for FreeSurfer, 7.245 to 20.98% (mean, 12.60%) for FSL and 1.348 to 8.800% (mean value, 3.546%) for AccuBrain®. In addition, AccuBrain® and FreeSurfer achieved the lowest mean values of region-specific CV between GE and Siemens scanners (from 0.818 to 5.958% for AccuBrain®, and from 0.903 to 7.977% for FreeSurfer), while FSL-FIRST had the lowest mean values of region-specific CV between GE and Philips scanners (from 2.603 to 16.310%). AccuBrain® also had the lowest mean values of region-specific CV between Siemens and Philips scanners (from 1.138 to 6.615%). CONCLUSION: There is a large discrepancy in the inter-scanner reproducibility of brain volumetry when using different processing software. Image acquisition protocols and selection of ABS tool for brain volumetry quantification have impact on the robustness of results in multi-site studies.","Liu, Sirui; Hou, Bo; Zhang, Yiwei; Lin, Tianye; Fan, Xiaoyuan; You, Hui; Feng, Feng",BMC Neurosci,577,4

As a preventive measure, a department of obstetrics and gynecology in Israel constructed a separate, designated complex for its COVID-19-exposed patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic infection control measures on obstetric care in the obstetrical emergency department and delivery unit. METHODS: The authors collected data retrospectively from February 2020 to March 2020 and compared it to data of a parallel period in 2019. RESULTS: From 1 February 2020 to 28 March 2020, 3897 women were referred to the emergency department (ED), compared to 4067 the previous year. Mean duration of treatment until decision and referral indications did not differ between 2020 and 2019 (207 vs. 220 minutes, P = 0.26; urgent referrals 58.8% vs. 59.2%, P = 0.83). A per-week comparison showed a significant reduction in ED referrals only in the last week of the period (337 [2020] vs. 515 [2019], P < 0.001). The proportion of women admitted to the delivery unit in active labor was significantly higher in the last three weeks (39.1% vs. 28.2%, P = 0.005). During February and March 2020, 1666 women delivered, compared to 1654 during February and March 2019. The proportion of types and modes of delivery did not differ. In a per-week comparison, the number of deliveries did not differ (mean 208 vs. 206, P = 0.88).

This caused many aesthetic practices around the country to close temporarily and led to a unique time period to evaluate the impact neurotoxin has in the setting of an ongoing pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the administration of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX Cosmetic, Allergan plc, Coolock, Ireland), in regular users, synergistically amplifies the elevation in mood/happiness, self-satisfaction with appearance and overall satisfaction, in the context of the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: A randomized single-blind cross-over study was designed to evaluate the impact of neurotoxin treatment in the upper third of the face on mood, self-satisfaction with appearance, and overall satisfaction. The placebo group crossed over to treatment after 1 month. Surveys evaluating patient happiness, self-satisfaction with appearance and overall efficacy were completed among both groups, and again to the placebo group again following crossover to treatment. RESULTS: Forty-five subjects were enrolled with 30 in the treatment and 15 in the control/cross-over group. The placebo group demonstrated no change in happiness or self-satisfaction in appearance until cross-over to the treatment group. Both groups, once receiving, onabotulinumtoxinA reported increased happiness, self-satisfaction with appearance and overall treatment satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment to the upper face in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic was found to increase patient happiness, self-satisfaction with appearance, and overall treatment satisfaction.","Cristel, Robert T; Gandhi, Nimit D; Issa, Tariq Z; Kola, Eljona; Demesh, Daniel; Dayan, Steven H",Aesthet. surg. j,577,26

The status of the infection in the female genital system is still unknown. The study aimed to evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the vaginal fluid of women with COVID-19 infection in reproductive period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Women who were between the ages of 18-50 years and clinically confirmed to have COVID-19 infection at our hospital between 20 April-31 May 2020 were included in the study. Women who were in their menstrual cycle during the study and who had a known cervical intraepithelial lesion and/or cancer, sexually transmitted disease and history and/or symptoms of vaginitis were excluded from the study. In patients in whom no pathology was detected during the examination, a sample was taken from the vaginal fluid for PCR by using Dacron tip swab.

In the following weeks, emergency departments in the UK reported a reduction in attendances. We aimed to explore the incidence of emergency calls across North East England, as well as the number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) deaths. METHODS: Data were collected for all patients who contacted North East Ambulance Service between 4 March 2019-2 June 2019 and 2 March 2020-31 May 2020 suffering stroke, ST elevation myocardial infarction, allergy, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, falls, intoxication, seizure, sepsis, acute coronary syndrome and OHCA. RESULTS: There were a reduction in incidence of calls, excluding OHCA, resulting in ambulance activation during the pandemic compared with same period in 2019, 16 743 versus 19 639, respectively (-14.74%). The decline in calls was partially reversed by the end of May 2020. Incidence of OHCA at the time of the national lockdown had increased by 13.79% with a peak increase of 73.56% in the second week in April 2020. OHCA deaths peaked in the first 2 weeks in April 2020, 95.65% and 90.07%, respectively, but by the end May 2020, incidence of OHCA and OHCA deaths had returned to prelockdown levels. CONCLUSION: Incidence of emergency calls were reduced during the pandemic compared with 2019. There was a rise in incidence of OHCA and OHCA deaths during the same period; however, these changes appear transient. Further research is required to understand patient behaviour towards seeking help during the pandemic and the long-term consequences of not doing so.","Charlton, Karl; Limmer, Matthew; Moore, Hayley",Emerg Med J,577,16

To evaluate these effects, blood was collected regularly from 28 university-owned horses (10 Non-PPID, 9 PPID control [PC], and 9 PPID treatment [PT]) over approximately 15 mo. Pergolide treatment was initiated after Day 0 collections. Analyses included ACTH, insulin, total cortisol, free cortisol, complete blood counts, plasma myeloperoxidase, and cytokine/receptor gene expression in basal whole blood and in vitro stimulations (PMA/ionomycin, heat-inactivated Rhodococcus equi, and heat-inactivated Escherichia coli) of whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The results were analyzed using a linear mixed model (SAS 9.4) with significance set at P < 0.05. Significant group (P = 0.0014) and group-by-time (P = 0.0004) effects were observed in resting ACTH such that PT horses differed from Non-PPID horses only at Day 0. PT horses had significantly lower changes in ACTH responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation tests than PC horses at non-fall time points only, mid-late February 2018 (P = 0.016) and early April 2018 (P = 0.0172). When PT and PC horses did not differ, they were combined before comparison to Non-PPID horses. No significant group or group-by-time effects were seen in resting insulin, total cortisol, or free cortisol; however, significant time effects were observed in these measures. PPID horses had lower absolute lymphocyte (P = 0.028) and red blood cell (P = 0.0203) counts than Non-PPID horses. In unstimulated whole blood, PPID horses had increased IL-8 expression compared with Non-PPID horses (P = 0.0102). In addition, PPID horses had decreased interferon Î³ production from PBMCs after stimulation with R. equi (P = 0.0063) and E. coli (P = 0.0057) and showed increased transforming growth factor ß expression after E. coli stimulation (P = 0.0399). The main limitations of this study were a limited sample size and an inability to truly randomize the PPID horses into treatment groups. Resting ACTH is likely the best choice for determining successful responses to pergolide. Neither PPID nor pergolide appears to influence insulin, total cortisol, and free cortisol. As measured, systemic immune function was altered in PPID horses, and it is likely that these horses are indeed at increased risk of opportunistic infection. Despite reducing ACTH, pergolide treatment did not appear to influence immune function.","Miller, A B; Loynachan, A T; Bush, H M; Hart, K A; Barker, V D; Campana-Emard, A G; Grubbs, S T; Adams, A A",Domest Anim Endocrinol,577,16

In some plants it also serves as a precursor of phytosiderophores, which are used for extracellular iron scavenging. Previous studies have also established the presence of NA in filamentous fungi and some mosses, whereas an analogue of NA was inferred in an archaeon. More recently, opine-type metallophores with homology to NA were uncovered in bacteria, especially in human pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Yersinia pestis, synthesizing respectively staphylopine, pseudopaline and yersinopine. Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the discovery, biosynthesis, function and regulation of these metallophores. We also discuss the genomic environment of the cntL gene, which is homologous to the plant NA synthase (NAS) gene, and plays a central role in the synthesis of NA-like metallophores. This reveals a large diversity of biosynthetic, export and import pathways. Using sequence similarity networks, we uncovered that these metallophores are widespread in numerous bacteria thriving in very different environments, such as those living at the host-pathogen interface, but also in the soil. We additionally established a phylogeny of the NAS/cntL gene and, as a result, we propose that this gene is an ancient gene and NA, or its derivatives, is an ancient metallophore that played a prominent role in metal acquisition or metal resistance. Indeed, our phylogenetic analysis suggests an evolutionary model where the possibility to synthesize this metallophore was present early in the appearance of life, although it was later lost by most living microorganisms, unless facing metal starvation such as at the host-pathogen interface or in some soils. According to our model, NA then re-emerged as a central metabolite for metal homeostasis in fungi, mosses and all known higher plants.","Laffont, Clémentine; Arnoux, Pascal",Metallomics,577,16

Many subcortical structures are known to play a crucial role in higher-order cognitive processing. However, comprehensive anatomic characterization of these structures is currently lacking in the congenital heart disease population. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the morphometry and volume of the globus pallidus, striatum, and thalamus between youth born with congenital heart disease and healthy peers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited youth between 16 and 24 years of age born with congenital heart disease who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery before 2 years of age (n = 48) and healthy controls of the same age (n = 48). All participants underwent a brain MR imaging to acquire high-resolution 3D T1-weighted images. RESULTS: Smaller surface area and inward bilateral displacement across the lateral surfaces of the globus pallidus were concentrated anteriorly in the congenital heart disease group compared with controls (q < 0.15). On the lateral surfaces of bilateral thalami, we found regions of both larger and smaller surface areas, as well as inward and outward displacement in the congenital heart disease group compared with controls (q < 0.15). We did not find any morphometric differences between groups for the striatum.

People's response toward social distancing in the emerging pandemic is uncertain. In this study, we evaluated the influence of information (formal and informal) sources on situational awareness of the public for adopting health-protective behaviors such as social distancing. For this purpose, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted. The hypothesis proposed suggests that adoption of social distancing practices is an outcome of situational awareness which is achieved by the information sources. Results suggest that information sources, formal (P = .001) and informal (P = 0.007) were found to be significantly related to perceived understanding. Findings also indicate that social distancing is significantly influenced by situational awareness, P = .000. It can, therefore, be concluded that an increase in situational awareness in times of public health crisis using formal information sources can significantly increase the adoption of protective health behavior and in turn contain the spread of infectious diseases.","Qazi, Atika; Qazi, Javaria; Naseer, Khulla; Zeeshan, Muhammad; Hardaker, Glenn; Maitama, Jaafar Zubairu; Haruna, Khalid",J Med Virol,577,15

Methods: The chemical constituents and action targets of Isatidis Radix, Forsythiae Fructus, Gypsum Fibrosum, Anemarrhenae Rhizoma, Phragmitis Rhizoma, Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata, Pogostemon cablin, Acoritataninowii Rhizoma and Curcumae Radix in Kangbingdu Granules were searched by TCMSP. The gene corresponding to the target was searched by UniProt database, and Cytoscape 3.6.1 was used to build a medicinal material-compound-target (gene) network. DAVID was used to perform gene ontology (GO) function enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis to predict its mechanism. Molecular docking of the top 15 components was carried out in the medicinal material-compound-target network with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase, and molecular docking with bicuculline, luteolin, quercetin and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) was performed. Results: The medicinal material-compound-target (gene) network contained eight medicinal materials, 75 compounds and 255 targets. GO function enrichment analysis revealed 161 GO items (P &lt; 0.05), including 65 biological process (BP) items, 36 cell composition (CC) items, and 60 molecular function (MF) items. KEGG pathway enrichment screened 131 signaling pathways (P &lt; 0.05). The results of molecular docking showed that the core active compounds such as bicuculline, luteolin, and quercetin in the Kangbingdu Granules had similar affinities with those recommended by COVID-19. Conclusion: The active compounds in Kangbingdu Granules can interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) via targets PTGS2, HSP90AB1, and PTGS1 to regulate multiple signaling pathways, thereby exerting therapeutic effects on COVID-19.","Yao, Yun-Xiu; He, Zhen-Xiang; Liu, Xiao-Feng; He, Yong-Zhi; Lei, Yang; Zhang, Shu-Tao; Zhao, Ling-Li; Liu, Tao",Chin.

Anxiety was studied with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item in hospital workforces and with the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) in online survey participants. Depression symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in hospital employees and the HADS in the online survey sample. Symptoms were classified as absent/minimal, borderline abnormal or indicating clinical caseness. Staff reaction to COVID-19 was tapped with a 9-item-questionnaire and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R).

We show that mask mandates are associated with a statistically significant decrease in new cases (-3.55 per 100K), deaths (-0.13 per 100K), and the proportion of hospital admissions (-2.38 percentage points) up to 40 days after the introduction of mask mandates both at the state and county level. These effects are large, corresponding to 14% of the highest recorded number of cases, 13% of deaths, and 7% of admission proportion. We also find that mask mandates are linked to a 23.4 percentage point increase in mask adherence in four diverse states. Given the recent lifting of mandates, we estimate that the ending of mask mandates in these states is associated with a decrease of -3.19 percentage points in mask adherence and 12 per 100K (13% of the highest recorded number) of daily new cases with no significant effect on hospitalizations and deaths. Lastly, using a large novel survey dataset of 847 thousand responses in 69 countries, we introduce the novel results that community mask adherence and community attitudes towards masks are associated with a reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our results have policy implications for reinforcing the need to maintain and encourage mask-wearing by the public, especially in light of some states starting to remove their mask mandates.","Adjodah, Dhaval; Dinakar, Karthik; Chinazzi, Matteo; Fraiberger, Samuel P; Pentland, Alex; Bates, Samantha; Staller, Kyle; Vespignani, Alessandro; Bhatt, Deepak L",PLoS One,577,16

Methods: A total of 266 healthcare workers working in a medical college in Nepal were studied using a questionnaire consisting of three sections: demographics, experiences and perception of COVID-19, and COVID-19 vaccine safety. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 26. The total perception score was calculated by noting respondent's agreement with a set of eleven statements using a Likert-type scale. Non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis) were used for analysis (p&lt;0.05). Results: Altogether, 13.9% of respondents had been diagnosed COVID-19 positive prior to the survey. Many considered themselves to be at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Only over one third (38.3%) were willing to be vaccinated. The most common reason for refusal/hesitancy was concern about vaccine safety. The median (interquartile range) total perception score was 36 (4) (maximum possible score=55). The score was significantly higher among those who had been diagnosed COVID positive, those who perceived the pandemic as being moderate or severe and among those willing to be vaccinated. Conclusion: Addressing doubts related to vaccine safety and providing more data on the safety of vaccine may be helpful in overcoming hesitancy.","Paudel, S.; Palaian, S.; Shankar, P.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the impact on contamination characteristics before and after the second partial lockdown in France to adapt public health restrictions to further prevent pandemic surges. METHODS: Between December 15 and 24, 2020, after a national media campaign, users of the sourcecovid.fr web application were asked questions about their own or a close relative's COVID-19 contamination after August 15, 2020, in France. The data of the contamination's circumstances were assessed and compared before and after the second partial lockdown, which occurred on October 25, 2020, during the second wave of the pandemic and was ongoing on December 24, 2020. RESULTS: As of December 24, 2020, 441,000 connections on the web application were observed. A total of 2218 questionnaires were assessable for analysis. About 61.8% (n=1309) of the participants were sure of their contamination origin, and 38.2% (n=809) thought they knew it. The median age of users was 43.0 (IQR 32-56) years, and 50.7% (n=1073) were male. The median incubation time of the assessed cohort was 4.0 (IQR 3-5) days. Private areas (family's or friend's house) were the main source of contamination (1048/2090, 50.2%), followed by work colleagues (579/2090, 27.7%). The main time of day for the contamination was the evening (339/961, 35.3%) before the lockdown and was reduced to 18.2% (86/473) after the lockdown (P<.001). The person who transmitted the virus to the user before and after the lockdown was significantly different (P<.001): a friend (382/1317, 29% vs 109/773, 14.1%), a close relative (304/1317, 23.1% vs 253/773, 32.7%), or a work colleague (315/1317, 23.9% vs 264/773, 34.2%). The main location where the virus was transmitted to the users before and after the lockdown was significantly different too (P<.001): home (278/1305, 21.3% vs 194/760, 25.5%), work (293/1305, 22.5% vs 225/760, 29.6%), collective places (430/1305, 33% vs 114/760, 15%), and care centers (58/1305, 4.4% vs 74/760, 9.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Modalities of transmissions significantly changed before and after the second lockdown in France. The main sources of contamination remained the private areas and with work colleagues.

Our paper addresses a lack of in-depth qualitative research exploring their experiences and perceptions of how life has changed at this time. METHODS: We used qualitative interviews (N = 49) to explore experiences of the pandemic for people with pre-existing mental health conditions. In a participatory, coproduced approach, researchers with lived experiences of mental health conditions conducted interviews and analysed data as part of a multi-disciplinary research team. RESULTS: Existing mental health difficulties were exacerbated for many people. People experienced specific psychological impacts of the pandemic, struggles with social connectedness, and inadequate access to mental health services, while some found new ways to cope and connect to the community. New remote ways to access mental health care, including digital solutions, provided continuity of care for some but presented substantial barriers for others. People from black and ethnic minority (BAME) communities experienced heightened anxiety, stigma and racism associated with the pandemic, further impacting their mental health. CONCLUSION: There is a need for evidence-based solutions to achieve accessible and effective mental health care in response to the pandemic, especially remote approaches to care. Further research should explore the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on people with pre-existing mental health conditions.

Students, especially medical sciences students, suffer from more stress as a result of exposure to COVID-induced stressors. It is, therefore, essential to measure mental health and its relationship with social support in medical sciences students during the COVID pandemic. The present study was conducted to determine the mental health status of students and its correlation with social support. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using random sampling on 280 students of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in Iran in 2020. Socio-demographic profile scale, Mental Health Test (GHQ-28), and the scale of Perceived Social Support (PRQ-85) were used to collect data. Participants completed the questionnaires online. RESULTS: Considering the potential confounding variables, a general linear model (GLM) was utilized to determine the relationship between mental health and perceived social support. Mean (± standard deviation) of total mental health score 26.5 (12.5) was in the acceptable range of 0-63., and 56% of students suffered from a mental disorder. Mean (± standard deviation) of social support score 128.2 (21.0) ranged from 25 to175. According to Pearson's correlation coefficient, there was a significant inverse correlation between social support score and total mental health score and all its subscales [p < 0.001; r = - 0.294 to - 0.536]. According to the GLM, mental health score decreased significantly with social support score [p = 0.0001; - 0.32 to - 0.20; CI 95%; B = 0.26]. CONCLUSIONS: Given the inverse relationship between social support and mental health, it is suggested to increase the level of social support for students at all times, especially during the stressful COVID-19 pandemic to improve their mental health.","Ghafari, Reza; Mirghafourvand, Mojgan; Rouhi, Mahsa; Osouli Tabrizi, Shirin",BMC Psychol,577,29

This paper discusses the possibility of differences in number of infections and spread between different countries based on the spread of droplets.","Rohit, Anusha; Rajasekaran, Shankar; Karunasagar, Indrani; Karunasagar, Iddya",Med Hypotheses,577,29

This study describes the clinical presentation of a large ambulatory COVID-19 paediatric cohort and evaluates the role of children in household transmission prior to and following school reopening. METHODS: A retrospective database cohort study was conducted in a large Health Maintenance Organization in Israel. Data of all paediatric, laboratory-confirmed Coronavirus cases between 28/2/2020 and 20/6/2020 were extracted. All cases were analysed for household contacts and primary cases within each family cluster. RESULTS: A total of 1,032 cases under 18 years old (median age 12 years) were included. Of these cases, 432 (41.9%) were asymptomatic; 122 (11.8%) cases acquired the infection at school, and 45 of them were part of two school clusters; 846 children had at least one positive household contact, in 498 family clusters, and among them, 293 primary cases were identified. Only 27 (9.2%) primary cases were under 18 years of age and six (2%) were below 10. The proportion of primary cases did not change after the re-opening of educational facilities. CONCLUSION: Children, particularly under 10 years of age, are less likely to be the vector for SARS-CoV-2 infection within household settings. Opening educational facilities did not change transmission dynamics.","Shapiro Ben David, Shirley; Rahamim-Cohen, Daniella; Tasher, Diana; Geva, Adi; Azuri, Joseph; Ash, Nachman",Acta paediatr. scand,577,24

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 77 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to our intermediate care unit in Pisa between March 5 and March 30, 2020, with follow-up until hospital discharge or death. Logistic regression was used identify variables potentially associated with adverse outcomes and those P<0.10 were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. Cumulative probability for lack of adverse outcomes in patients with or without low baseline diaphragm muscle mass was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator. RESULTS: The main findings of this study are that: 1) patients who developed adverse outcomes had thinner diaphragm than those who did not (2.0 vs. 2.2 mm, P=0.001); and 2) DT and lymphocyte count were independent significant predictors of adverse outcomes, with end-expiratory DT being the strongest (ß=-708; OR=0.492; P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Diaphragmatic ultrasound may be a valid tool to evaluate the risk of respiratory failure. Evaluating the need of mechanical ventilation treatment should be based not only on PaO2/FiO2, but on a more comprehensive assessment including DT because if the lungs become less compliant a thinner diaphragm, albeit free of intrinsic abnormality, may become exhausted, thus contributing to severe respiratory failure.","Corradi, Francesco; Isirdi, Alessandro; Malacarne, Paolo; Santori, Gregorio; Barbieri, Greta; Romei, Chiara; Bove, Tiziana; Vetrugno, Luigi; Falcone, Marco; Bertini, Pietro; Guarracino, Fabio; Landoni, Giovanni; Forfori, Francesco",Minerva Anestesiol,577,21

However, this has likely impacted access to care for patients experiencing other conditions. We aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on access to care for patients with urgent/emergent urological conditions throughout Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 33 urological units in the AGILE consortium, asking clinicians to report on the number of urgent/emergent urological patients seen and/or undergoing surgery over a 3-week period during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak and a reference week prior to the outbreak. ANOVA and linear regression models were used to quantify these changes. RESULTS: Data from 27 urological centres in Italy showed a decrease from 956 patients/week seen just prior to the outbreak to 291 patients/week seen by the end of the study period. There was a difference in the number of patients with urgent/emergent urological disease seen within/during the different weeks (all p values < 0.05). A significant decrease in the number of patients presenting with haematuria, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, scrotal pain, renal colic, or trauma and urgent/emergent cases that required surgery was reported (all p values < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In Italy, during the COVID-19 outbreak there has been a decrease in patients seeking help for urgent/emergent urological conditions. Restructuring of hospitals and clinics is mandatory to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the healthcare system should continue to provide adequate levels of care also to patients with other conditions.","Porreca, Angelo; Colicchia, Michele; D039,; Agostino, Daniele; Amenta, Michele; Corsaro, Alfio; Zaramella, Stefano; Zegna, Luisa; Gallo, Fabrizio; Schenone, Maurizio; Bozzini, Giorgio; Calori, Alberto; Pastore, Antonio L; Al Salhi, Yazan; Sciorio, Carmine; Spirito, Lorenzo; Varca, Virginia; Marenghi, Carlo; Greco, Francesco; Altieri, Vincenzo M; Verze, Paolo; Barba, Ciro; Antonelli, Alessandro; Cerruto, Maria A; Falabella, Roberto; Di Bello, Silvana; Leonardo, Costantino; Tufano, Antonio; Volpe, Alessandro; Umari, Paolo; Parma, Paolo; Nidini, Mattia; Pini, Giovannalberto; Borghesi, Marco; Terrone, Carlo; Cacciamani, Giovanni E; Sighinolfi, Maria C; Busetto, Gian Maria; Wennberg, Alexandra M; Finocchiaro, Marinella; Falsaperla, Mario; Oderda, Marco; Ceruti, Carlo; Rocco, Bernardo; Schiavina, Riccardo; Bianchi, Lorenzo; Mari, Andrea; Di Maida, Fabrizio; Dalpiaz, Orietta; Celia, Antonio; Pirozzi, Marco",Urol Int,577,17

Candidate studies up to 24 May 2020 were identified from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, medRxiv and bioRxiv. Treatment outcomes included mortality, risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and the requirement for mechanical ventilation (MV). Seven retrospective studies involving 592 adult patients with severe COVID-19, including 240 in the tocilizumab group and 352 in the control group, were enrolled. All-cause mortality of severe COVID-19 patients among the tocilizumab group was 16.3% (39/240), which was lower than that in the control group (24.1%; 85/352). However, the difference did not reach statistical significance [risk ratio (RR) = 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-1.22; I2 = 68%]. Additionally, risk of ICU admission was similar between the tocilizumab and control groups (35.1% vs. 15.8%; RR = 1.51, 95% CI 0.33-6.78; I2 = 86%). The requirement for MV was similar between the tocilizumab and control groups (32.4% vs. 28.6%; RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.14-4.94; I2 = 91%). However, these non-significant differences between the tocilizumab and control groups may have been the result of baseline characteristics of the tocilizumab group, which were more severe than those of the control group. Based on low-quality evidence, there is no conclusive evidence that tocilizumab would provide any additional benefit to patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, further recommendation of tocilizumab for COVID-19 cases should be halted until high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials is available.","Lan, Shao-Huan; Lai, Chih-Cheng; Huang, Hui-Ting; Chang, Shen-Peng; Lu, Li-Chin; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Int J Antimicrob Agents,577,23

To date, however, there has been little research to characterise the vast scope and scale of these novel, ad hoc and widely varied digital tools. This paper helps fill this gap by providing a descriptive summary of the digital response to COVID-19. The research finds that the digital response can be broken into four main categories: 1) tracking the spread of the virus (contact tracing);2) controlling social behaviour during the outbreak (social behaviour monitoring);3) information gathering and dissemination about the virus (one-way and two-way public communications);and 4) diagnosis and treatment (remote diagnostics and treatment). This paper describes the four response categories and provides examples of the digital technologies being developed and implemented for these purposes. This descriptive understanding provides a contextual foundation for subsequent research to analyse the opportunities and challenges associated with the development, implementation and uptake of digital interventions, alongside the development of analytical frameworks and guidance.","Phillips, J.; Babcock, R.

Traditionally, simple statistical models have been used to assess patient death risk, many times with sub-optimal performance. On the other hand deep learning holds promise to positively impact clinical practice by leveraging medical data to assist diagnosis and prediction, including mortality prediction. However, as the question of whether powerful Deep Learning models attend correlations backed by sound medical knowledge when generating predictions remains open, additional interpretability tools are needed to foster trust and encourage the use of AI by clinicians. In this work we show a Deep Learning model trained on MIMIC-III to predict mortality using raw nursing notes, together with visual explanations for word importance.

For graduating trainees, there remains concern that financial stability of health systems will affect the availability of new positions and hiring practices. This survey aims to evaluate the pandemic's impact from pediatric gastroenterology fellows' perspectives. METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed by e-mail from June 11 to July 1, 2020 to all North American pediatric gastroenterology and advanced training fellows. The survey was tailored for the fellows' year of training including questions on education, clinical experience, research, and job outlook. RESULTS: Of the 434 pediatric gastroenterology fellows, 145 completed the survey. Of all respondents, negative impact was reported in 52% on clinical training, 46% research projects, and 41% procedural confidence. A majority (93%) of third-year respondents had a job contract signed at the time of the survey; however, 18% of those contracts were subsequently altered with five respondents having job contracts rescinded due to hiring freezes. Fifty-four percent of first- and second-year fellow respondents reported concern regarding finding a job with the majority being second-year fellows (78%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the medical system and healthcare professionals. This survey identified significant impact on job acquisition for graduating pediatric gastroenterology fellows as well as other critical components of training, which are likely applicable to other pediatric trainees. The survey results raise questions about potential strategies to improve medical education and job search success for graduating trainees.","Irastorza, Laura E; Hopson, Puanani; Ta, Allison; Kemme, Sarah; Mallon, Daniel; Lee, Christine K",J. pediatr. gastroenterol. nutr,577,10

The main mechanisms of virus internalization and interaction with the host are down-regulation or upregulation of the ACE2 receptor, the surface glycoprotein competition mechanism for the binding of porphyrin to iron in heme formation as well as interference with the immune system. The interference on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, heme formation, and the immune response is responsible for infection diffusion, endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, oxidative damage and releasing of inflammatory mediators. The main pathological findings are bilateral interstitial pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Because ACE receptor is also present in the endothelium of other districts as well as in different cell types, and as porphyrins are transporters in the blood and other biological liquids of iron forming heme, which is important in the assembly of the hemoglobin, myoglobin and the cytochromes, multiorgan damage occurs both primitive and secondary to lung damage. More relevantly, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, and disseminated intravasal coagulation (DIC) are described as complications in patients with poor outcome.

To test the hypothesis that the spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 may inhibit the perforin expression, we determined the kinetics of immune responses of CD8+ T cells to low dose (LD) or high dose (HD) of S1 stimulation through an in vitro dendritic cell (DC)-T cell model over seven days of incubation. The cytotoxic activity and intracellular perforin expression of CD8+ T cells induced by HD-S1-presenting DCs were aberrantly lower than those induced by LD-S1-presenting DCs from day three of incubation. Discrepantly, the levels of lymphoproliferation and cytokine (interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α) production induced by HD-S1-presenting DCs were significantly higher than those induced by LD-S1-presenting DCs from day four. The dose-related responses between doses of S1 and intracellular perforin expression showed a significant linear correlation with a negative slope. In conclusion, the S1 subunit may suppress the perforin expression in CD8+ T cells to decrease the cytotoxic capacity to kill spike-presenting cells in a dose-dependent manner;the persistence of antigen presentation may result in an overproduction of interferon-γ and subsequent proinflammatory cytokines. That may help explain the insufficient cytotoxicity against high quantities of viruses or highly replicated strains of SARS-CoV-2 in severe cases of COVID-19.","Huang, Chun-Fu Hsieh Szu-Min Pan Sung-Ching Huang Yu-Shang Chang Shan-Chwen",Microorganisms,577,17

The purpose of this study was to provide a summary of the clinico-epidemiological data and imaging data of the KICC-19. METHODS: The KSTR members at 17 COVID-19 referral centers retrospectively collected imaging data and clinical information of consecutive patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-proven COVID-19 in respiratory specimens from February 2020 through May 2020 who underwent diagnostic chest computed tomography (CT) or radiograph in each participating hospital. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 239 men and 283 women (mean age, 52.3 years; age range, 11-97 years). Of the 522 subjects, 201 (38.5%) had an underlying disease. The most common symptoms were fever (n = 292) and cough (n = 245). The 151 patients (28.9%) had lymphocytopenia, 86 had (16.5%) thrombocytopenia, and 227 patients (43.5%) had an elevated CRP at admission. The 121 (23.4%) needed nasal oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation (n = 38; 7.3%), and 49 patients (9.4%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. Although most patients had cured, 21 patients (4.0%) died. The 465 (89.1%) subjects underwent a low to standard-dose chest CT scan at least once during hospitalization, resulting in a total of 658 CT scans. The 497 subjects (95.2%) underwent chest radiography at least once during hospitalization, which resulted in a total of 1,475 chest radiographs. CONCLUSION: The KICC-19 was successfully established and comprised of 658 CT scans and 1,475 chest radiographs of 522 hospitalized Korean COVID-19 patients.

However, it is difficult to guarantee accuracy and avoid obstacles in puncture process. Therefore, developing a viable path planning method is particularly important. In this research, the bending deformation law of flexible needles during puncture was studied and the puncture path was planned to provide a feasible method for clinical application of flexible needles. METHODS: According to the researchs that have been conducted, the path of the flexible needle in the tissue could be considered as a circular arc stitching. This research studied the calculation method of arc radius and obtained its actual value by the puncture experiments. Based on the arc model, the spatial transformation method of three-dimensional path planning was studied. In addition, a simplified particle swarm optimization (PSO) was applied into the process of path planning by changing the central angle of arc and the rotation angle of the needle body. RESULTS: The results of Experiment 1 showed that the path radius of the flexible needle pierced into gelatin prosthesis was influenced by four parameters, which were needle diameter, tip angle, puncture speed and the weight ratio of gelatin powder. As the needle diameter and tip angle increased, the radius of needle path tended to increase, but when the puncture speed and gelatin mass ratio increased, the radius of needle path decreased. The results of Experiment 2 showed that the distances of needle tip apart from target point were 3.2 mm (barrier-free experiments) and 1.8 mm (obstacle experiments). CONCLUSIONS: This research links the intelligent algorithm with the flexible needle puncture tissue process, which has high value in future clinical application. By setting the correct boundary conditions and parameters, the flexible needle can be planned to reach the target point accurately.","Cai, Chenxu; Sun, Chunsheng; Han, Ying; Zhang, Qinhe",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,577,16

Participants (N=337) were university students who completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale and five selected subscales of the WHO COVID-19 Behavioural Insights Tool. The mean loneliness scores were significantly higher than previous studies in other contexts as well as studies conducted in the time of COVID-19. Correlational analysis found that greater perceived risk of infection, limited perceived knowledge of COVID-19 and lower appraisals of resilience were associated with increased loneliness. In a regression analysis, when all COVID-19 variables were considered simultaneously, only resilience, self-rated knowledge, and risk perception emerged as significant correlates of loneliness. These findings suggest that loneliness is a significant public health concern in South Africa in the time of COVID-19. It also suggests that self-efficacy and resilience can potentially be reinforced by public health campaigns that focus on enhancing COVID-19-related knowledge and preparedness.","Padmanabhanunni, A; Pretorius, T B",Psychiatry Res,577,26

The aim of the study is to explore social and spatial inequalities in uptake and case-detection of rapid lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests (LFTs) offered to people without symptoms of COVID-19. Methods Linked pseudonymised records for asymptomatic residents in Liverpool who received a LFT for COVID-19 between 6th November 2020 to 31st January 2021 were accessed using the Combined Intelligence for Population Health Action resource. Bayesian Hierarchical Poisson Besag, York, and Mollié models were used to estimate ecological associations for uptake and positivity of testing. Findings 214 525 residents (43%) received a LFT identifying 5192 individuals as positive cases of COVID-19 (1.3% of tests were positive). Uptake was highest in November when there was military assistance. High uptake was observed again in the week preceding Christmas and was sustained into a national lockdown. Overall uptake were lower among males (e.g. 40% uptake over the whole period), Black Asian and other Minority Ethnic groups (e.g. 27% uptake for ‘Mixed’ ethnicity) and in the most deprived areas (e.g. 32% uptake in most deprived areas). These population groups were also more likely to have received positive tests for COVID-19. Models demonstrated that uptake and repeat testing were lower in areas of higher deprivation, areas located further from test sites and areas containing populations less confident in the using Internet technologies. Positive tests were spatially clustered in deprived areas. Interpretation Large-scale voluntary asymptomatic community testing saw social, ethnic, digital and spatial inequalities in uptake. COVID-19 testing and support to isolate need to be more accessible to the vulnerable communities most impacted by the pandemic, including non-digital means of access.

Mindfulness training, which helps individuals attend to the present moment with a nonjudgmental attitude, improves sleep and reduces stress during regular times. Mindfulness training may also be relevant to the mitigation of harmful health consequences during acute crises. However, certain restrictions may necessitate the web-based delivery of mindfulness training (ie, rather than in-person group training settings). OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine the effects of mindfulness interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of web-based interventions. METHODS: Data from an ongoing study were used for this retrospective equivalence analysis. Recruited participants were enrollees from mindfulness courses at a local charity organization that promoted mental wellness. This study had no exclusion criteria. We created three groups; two groups received their training during the COVID-19 pandemic (in-person training group: n=36; videoconferencing group: n=38), and a second control group included participants who were trained before the pandemic (n=86). Our primary outcomes were self-reported stress and sleep quality. Baseline levels and changes in these variables due to mindfulness training were compared among the groups via an analysis of covariance test and two one-tailed t tests. RESULTS: Baseline perceived stress (P=.50) and sleep quality (P=.22) did not differ significantly among the three groups. Mindfulness training significantly reduced stress in all three groups (P<.001), and this effect was statistically significant when comparing videoconferencing to in-person training (P=.002). Sleep quality improved significantly in the prepandemic training group (P<.001). However, sleep quality did not improve in the groups that received training during the pandemic. Participants reported that they required shorter times to initiate sleep following prepandemic mindfulness training (P<.001), but this was not true for those who received training during the pandemic. Course attendance was high and equivalent across the videoconferencing and comparison groups (P=.02), and participants in the videoconferencing group engaged in marginally more daily practice than the in-person training group. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based mindfulness training via videoconferencing may be a useful intervention for reducing stress during times when traditional, in-person training is not feasible. However, it may not be useful for improving sleep quality.","Lim, Julian; Leow, Zaven; Ong, Jason; Pang, Ly-Shan; Lim, Eric",JMIR Ment Health,577,1

However, patients who continued ACEi/ARBs in the hospital had a markedly lower ICU admission rate (12% vs 26%; Pâ =â .001; odds ratio [OR]â =â 0.347; 95% confidence interval [CI], .187-.643) and mortality rate (6% vs 28%; Pâ =â .001; ORâ =â 0.215; 95% CI, .101-.455) compared to patients who discontinued ACEi/ARB. The odds ratio for mortality remained significantly lower after accounting for development of hypotension or AKI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that continued ACEi/ARB use in hypertensive COVID-19 patients yields better clinical outcomes.","Lam, Katherine W; Chow, Kenneth W; Vo, Jonathan; Hou, Wei; Li, Haifang; Richman, Paul S; Mallipattu, Sandeep K; Skopicki, Hal A; Singer, Adam J; Duong, Tim Q",J Infect Dis,577,32

It also brings to light multiple ongoing, underlying social crises. The COVID-19 crisis is actively revealing crises of energy sovereignty in at least four ways. First, there are many whose access to basic health services is compromised because of the lack of energy services necessary to provide these services. Second, some people are more vulnerable to COVID-19 because of exposure to environmental pollution associated with energy production. Third, energy services are vital to human wellbeing, yet access to energy services is largely organized as a consumer good. The loss of stable income precipitated by COVID-19 may therefore mean that many lose reliable access to essential energy services. Fourth, the COVID-19 crisis has created a window of opportunity for corporate interests to engage in aggressive pursuit of energy agendas that perpetuate carbon intensive and corporate controlled energy systems, which illuminates the ongoing procedural injustices of energy decision making. These four related crises demonstrate why energy sovereignty is essential for a just energy future. Energy sovereignty is defined as the right for communities, rather than corporate interests, to control access to and decision making regarding the sources, scales, and forms of ownership characterizing access to energy services. Energy sovereignty is a critical component in the design of a post-COVID-19 energy system that is capable of being resilient to future shocks without exacerbating injustices that are killing the most vulnerable among us.","Brosemer, Kathleen; Schelly, Chelsea; Gagnon, Valoree; Arola, Kristin L.; Pearce, Joshua M.; Bessette, Douglas; Schmitt Olabisi, Laura",Energy Res.

METHODS: This retrospective case-control study involves subjects (7-98 years) presenting at the designated national outbreak screening center and tertiary care hospital in Singapore for SARS-CoV-2 testing from 26 January to 16 February 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaike's information criterion in a stepwise fashion to build logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristic curves, adjusting for overconfidence using leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The study population included 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years, and 407 (51.7%) were female. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (models 1, 2, and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.91, 0.88, and 0.88, respectively. In comparison, model 4 had an AUC of 0.65. CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly ascertainable clinical and laboratory data could identify individuals at high risk of COVID-19 and enable prioritization of PCR testing and containment efforts.

This could possibly be achieved by injecting live SARS-CoV-2 virus intradermal (ID), subcutaneous, intra-muscular (IM) or intra-peritoneal (IP), or by targeting the virus to the digestive tract. The effectiveness and innocuity of using those various routes could be tested very rapidly in animal models, such as Macaques, Hamsters, Ferrets or Cats. The hope is that these experiments will reveal a route of inoculation that can reliably lead to bona-fide infections, resulting in strong immune responses, with both cellular and serological components, but with much less viral replication in the lungs. This would not only hopefully reduce the incidence of pulmonary complications in the infected subjects, but would also probably reduce the amount of virus released by them via aerosols, and thus reduce the vector of contagiosity that is hardest to control, and that probably leads most effectively to viral replication in the lungs. If those experiments in animal models reveal that one or several routes can be used effectively to reduce pulmonary pathology, a clinical trial could be conducted in human volunteers with very low risk profiles. The ID route should probably be considered as a priority, since it could double-up as a skin test to reveal the immune status of the recipients towards the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The course of action proposed here may possibly provide a way of taking a step ahead of the virus, and if it works as hoped, could help to end the need for confinement within a matter of months, if not weeks. © 2020 Joly E.","Joly, E.",,577,16

We take advantage of the increasing mobile phone penetration rate in rural areas to evaluate the feasibility of using cell phones to monitor the provision of key health and nutrition interventions linked to the first 1,000 days of life, a critical period of growth and development. We examine response rates to calendarized text messages (SMS) and phone calls sent to 1,542 households over a period of four months. These households have children under two years old and pregnant women and are located across randomly selected communities in Quiche, Guatemala. We find that the overall (valid) response rate to phone calls is over 5 times higher than to text messages (75.8% versus 14.4%). We also test whether simple SMS reminders improve the timely reception of health services but do not find any effects in this regard. Language, education, and age appear to be major barriers to respond to text messages as opposed to phone calls, and the rate of response is not correlated with a household's geographic location (accessibility). Moreover, response veracity is high, with an 84-91% match between household responses and administrative records. The costs per monitored intervention are around 1.12 US dollars using text messages and 85 cents making phone calls, with the costs per effective answer showing a starker contrast, at 7.76 and 1.12 US dollars, respectively. Our findings indicate that mobile phone calls can be an effective, low-cost tool to collect reliable information remotely and in real time. In the current context, where in-person contact with households is not possible due to the COVID-19 crisis, phone calls can be a valuable instrument for collecting information, monitoring development interventions, or implementing brief surveys.","Ceballos, Francisco; Hernandez, Manuel Alejandro; Olivet, Francisco; Paz, Cynthia",PLoS One,577,22

Our objective was to identify prevalence of hyperglycaemia in COVID-19 patients with and without prior diabetes and quantify its association with COVID-19 disease course. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This observational cohort study included all consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to John H Stroger Jr. Hospital, Chicago, IL from March 15, 2020 to May 3, 2020 and followed till May 15, 2020. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and the studied predictor was hyperglycaemia [any blood glucose &#8805;7.78 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) during hospitalization]. RESULTS: Of the 403 COVID-19 patients studied, 51 (12.7%) died; 335 (83.1%) were discharged while 17 (4%) were still in hospital. Hyperglycaemia occurred in 228 (56.6%) patients; 83 of these hyperglycaemic patients (36.4%) had no prior history of diabetes. Compared to the reference group no-diabetes/no-hyperglycaemia patients the no-diabetes/hyperglycaemia patients showed higher mortality [1.8% versus 20.5%, adjusted odds ratio 21.94 (95% confidence interval 4.04-119.0), P < 0.001]; improved prediction of death (P = 0.01) and faster progression to death (P < 0.01). Hyperglycaemia within the first 24 and 48 h was also significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio 2.15 and 3.31, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycaemia without prior diabetes was common (20.6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients) and was associated with an increased risk of and faster progression to death. Development of hyperglycaemia in COVID-19 patients who do not have diabetes is an early indicator of progressive disease.","Mamtani, M; Athavale, A M; Abraham, M; Vernik, J; Amarah, A R; Ruiz, J P; Joshi, A J; Itteera, M; Zhukovski, S D; Madaiah, R P; White, B C; Hart, P; Kulkarni, H",Diabetes Metab,577,16

The risk of exposure to respiratory secretions and/or feces is hardly avoidable during the endoscopic procedure; also, the aerosol and droplets take up to an hour disperse, so they remain a risk to staff and other patients after they leave the room; therefore, strict infectious precautions should be taken by all health care workers to limit the virus spread. Main body: We present an endoscopic trial of duodenal stent insertion in non-operable gastric carcinoma that is proven 2 days later to be a COVID-19-positive case. Fortunately, no one of the health care workers that came in contact with the case becomes infected owing to the proper infection control measures. Conclusion: We recommended that the endoscopy examination and procedures should be strictly limited to urgent cases to minimize the risk of virus infection among health care workers.","Elkholy, Shaimaa; Wifi, Mohamed-Naguib; Maurice, Karim K; Youssif, Kerolos; Mashhour, Karim; Mashhour, Shady N; Nabil, Ahmed; Abdellatif, Abeer Awad",Egypt J Intern Med,577,16

STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 4 state policies, 2 COVID-related state executive orders, and clinic-level survey data on medication abortion provision from fourteen abortion facilities in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia from December 2019 to December 2020. We calculated the percent of medication abortions provided at these facilities during the study period by state, to assess changes in medication abortion use during the pandemic. RESULTS: We ascertained that COVID-19-executive orders in Ohio and West Virginia that limited procedural abortion in Spring 2020 coincided with an increase in the overall number and proportion of medication abortions in this region, peaking at 1613 medication abortions (70%) in April 2020. Ohio and West Virginia, which had executive orders limiting procedural abortion, saw relatively greater increases in April compared to Kentucky. Despite temporary lifting of the mifepristone REMS, prepandemic regulations banning telemedicine abortion in Kentucky and West Virginia and requiring in-person clinic visits for medication abortion distribution in Ohio limited clinics' ability to adapt to offer medication abortion by mail. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate how restrictive medication and telemedicine abortion policies in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia created additional obstacles for patients seeking medication abortion during the pandemic. Permanently lifting federal regulations on in-clinic distribution of mifepristone would only advantage abortion seekers in states without restrictive telehealth and medication abortion policies. State policies that limit access to comprehensive abortion services should be central in larger efforts toward dismantling barriers that impinge upon reproductive autonomy. IMPLICATION STATEMENT: We find that abolishing the REMS on mifepristone would not be enough to expand access to patients in abortion-restrictive states with telemedicine and medication abortion laws.

As remote communications will outlast the pandemic, it is crucial to protect users' security and respect their privacy in this unprecedented setting, and that requires a thorough understanding of their behaviors, attitudes, and concerns toward various aspects of remote communications. To this end, we conducted an online study with 220 worldwide Prolific participants. We found that privacy and security are among the most frequently mentioned factors impacting participants' attitude and comfort level with conferencing tools and meeting locations. Open-ended responses revealed that most participants lacked autonomy when choosing conferencing tools or using microphone/webcam in their remote meetings, which in several cases contradicted their personal privacy and security preferences. Based on our findings, we distill several recommendations on how employers, educators, and tool developers can inform and empower users to make privacy-protective decisions when engaging in remote communications.","Emami-Naeini, Pardis; Francisco, Tiona; Kohno, Tadayoshi; Roesner, Franziska",,577,21

An empirical study conducted with the use of corresponding psychodiagnostic techniques (Extended Life orientation test;SACS) found that people who are optimistic about restrictions and atypical life situations are prone to use assertive actions and enter into social contacts. Whereas people who are pessimistic about the future have a less pronounced tendency to seek social support. The study confirmed that proactive coping in atypical life situations (including forced isolation) is associated with the relevant individual psychological characteristics, which are important for motivating social activities. Such personality expressions can contribute to the implementation of proactive coping and they are key factors in the pre-actional phase of goal-setting because proactive people focus not on the obstacles, but on solving problems. It is also suggested that proactive instructions can be a resource that enhances an individual's desire for a higher standard of living.","Yevdokimova, O.; Okhrimenko, I.",Brain-Broad Research in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience,577,24

This study aimed to understand changes in treatment providers' care during COVID-19, provider experiences with the adaptations, and perceptions of which changes should be sustained long-term. METHODS: We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 20 New Jersey MOUD providers, purposively sampled to reflect diversity in provider setting, specialty, and other characteristics. Using a rapid analysis approach, we summarized content within interview domains and analyzed domains across participants for recurring concepts and themes. RESULTS: MOUD treatment practice changes taking place during the COVID-19 pandemic included a rapid shift from in-person care to telehealth, reduction in frequency of toxicology testing and psychosocial/counseling services, and modifications to prescription durations and take-home methadone supplies. Modifications to practice were positively received and reinforced a sense of autonomy for providers as well as enhancing the ability to provide patient-centered care. All respondents expressed support for making temporary regulatory flexibilities permanent, but differed in their implementation of the flexibilities and the extent to which they planned to modify their own practices long-term. CONCLUSION: Findings support sustaining temporary regulatory and payment changes to MOUD practice, which may have improved treatment access and allowed for more flexible, individually tailored patient care. Few negative, unintended consequences were reported by providers, but more research is needed to evaluate the patient experience with changes to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Treitler, Peter C; Bowden, Cadence F; Lloyd, James; Enich, Michael; Nyaku, Amesika N; Crystal, Stephen",J Subst Abuse Treat,577,1

Clinical trials were planned and are in progress to investigate whether drugs used for influenza, HIV and other viruses, and also anthelmintics (ivermectin, nitazoxanide, niclosamide), and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) showing antiviral activity in in vitro assays, are effective and safe for Covid-19. So far there is no convincing evidence that these antiviral and antiparasitic drugs are of any benefit for Covid-19. Notwithsanding the absence of evidence of clinical efficacy, these drugs are widely used outside of clinical trials (off label) for prophylaxis and treatment of this viral infection. The rationale behind the prescription of macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin) for Covid-19 is obscure as well. The widespread prescription and use of drugs of unproven efficacy and safety for Covid-19 is at odds with the rational use of medicines, a cornerstone principle of pharmacotherapy advanced by WHO in 1985. This irrational use of drugs is cause for concern because some of them are associated with serious heart disorders and deaths.","Paumgartten, Francisco José Roma; Oliveira, Ana Cecilia Amado Xavier de",Ciênc.

Sua economia é baseada no turismo, que tem apresentado rápido crescimento nas últimas décadas. Este ecossistema único é reconhecido como Patrimônio Mundial pela Unesco e é um sítio Ramsar. Toda sua extensão terrestre e grande parte da área marinha ao seu redor é protegida por duas unidades de conservação federais, sob tutela do Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade. Existem pelo menos 15 espécies de plantas e animais nativos oficialmente ameaçadas de extinção, algumas destas sendo endêmicas do arquipélago. Dentre as 22 espécies de animais e plantas invasoras conhecidas em Fernando de Noronha, o teiú (Salvator merianae) representa um grande risco à fauna nativa por ser um predador oportunista de grande porte. O potencial impacto do teiú é reconhecido e seu manejo é previsto pelas unidades de conservação do arquipélago. O teiú se encontra presente em altas densidades na ilha principal e foram registrados indícios de sua presença ao menos na Ilha Rata. A densidade de teiús encontrada em Fernando de Noronha foi de 13,83± 3,9 animais por hectare em uma área não habitada de vegetação preservada e de 3,98± 1,1 animais por hectare numa área pouco habitada. O número de animais calculado para a ilha principal varia entre 6.906 a 12.270 indivíduos adultos. A área de vida foi de 10,54 (7,26-15,33) ha para ambos os sexos. A probabilidade de captura foi de 0,24±0,06 animais/armadilha/dia na área, com 3,98 animais/ha, sendo influenciada pelo tamanho dos indivíduos. O teiú também representa um potencial risco à saúde pública do arquipélago, por serem portadores da bactéria Salmonella enterica, isoladas em 56,9% dos animais capturados e em 70,5% dos pontos amostrados. Ao menos 15 sorotipos foram determinados por métodos moleculares para esta população. Para propor formas de manejar esta espécie em Fernando de Noronha, foram criados modelos de viabilidade populacional com diferentes cenários de manejo por 10 anos. Nos cenários sem manejo, a população de teiús não se extingue ao longo de 30 anos. O aumento das probabilidades de extinção é proporcional ao aumento da intensidade de manejo, tanto nos cenários que consideram a população de toda a ilha principal (A) quanto nos cenários que consideram parte desta população numa área de 214 ha (B). A remoção anual de 20% dos indivíduos adultos é suficiente para gerar cenários de extinção da população. Com a remoção de 50% dos indivíduos adultos anualmente, a probabilidade de extinção é de 54% e a média do tempo para a extinção está entre 5,2 e 5,4 anos de manejo, demonstrando que o controle desta espécie é possível em Fernando de Noronha, se os métodos de captura e esforço forem adequados. O manejo em uma pequena área (C) de 2,14 ha poderia ser feito em apenas 13 dias utilizando-se 10 armadilhas. Na área B (que inclui a área C), o manejo de maior intensidade poderia ser realizado em 44 dias por ano, durante quatro anos, 16 utilizando 258 armadilhas. Recomendações incluem o aumento gradativo da área manejada, o uso de manejo adaptativo, o envolvimento da sociedade e o sinergismo com outros esforços de manejo de espécies invasoras na área ambiental e de saúde pública.

The rivers of the Great Basin (USA) have been particularly imperiled by nonnative species introductions and represent a valuable location to study the dietary trends of native and nonnative fishes in isolated, endorheic systems. We collected fish from 23 sites, spanning three Great Basin watersheds (Carson, Humboldt, and Bear Rivers) and two elevation categories (upland and lowland). Only a single species (speckled dace Rhinichthys osculus) occurred in both elevation zones. Diet item analyses of over 500 fish stomachs indicated significant dietary overlaps between native and nonnative fishes and detailed dietary selectivity for all species. This finding, along with the low species diversity observed in the region, suggests low dietary niche diversity, which could have the potential to amplify the competitive impacts of nonnatives on native species. In upland sites, nonnative trouts were the dominant invaders, while in lowland sites warm-water nonnatives were prevalent. The management implications we recommend based on our results urge for continued monitoring of water temperature and species occurrences to predict if dietary overlaps observed in this study are likely to change in the future.

However, the tone and content of communication varies across and within countries and led to conflicting results in terms of collective sensemaking. To understand how government leaders' messages shape emotional and cognitive responses of citizens, we designed a 2x2 vignette experiment in which we manipulate the framing (pessimistic vs. optimistic) and content of the message (specific vs. general) delivered by a political leader. Results from 436 participants showed that while the tone of leader's messages has significant implications for the levels of anxiety and evaluation of the government's truthfulness and its overall response to the crisis, the content of the leader's message matters less. Furthermore, these effects were particularly experienced by women and left-leaning participants. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the leader's communication strategies on influencing the public's emotional reactions, as well as the perceptions of government effectiveness in dealing with the crisis.","Sobral, Filipe; Carvalho, Juliana; amp,; 321,; agowska, Urszula; Furtado, Liliane Magalhães Girardin Pimentel; Grobman, Miriam",Rev. adm. pública (Online),577,15

The current COVID-19 pandemic escalates these phenomena, thus, urging the need to further explore and validate feasible therapeutic options. Unlike the protracted nature of clinical studies, animal models could offer swift evidence. Prominent candidates for treatment are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to the mother, that putatively accommodate maternal functioning, and, thereby, also protect the child. However, SSRIs might have deleterious effects. It is important to assess whether SSRIs and other pharmacotherapies can moderate the transference of anxiety by soothing maternal anxiety and to examine the extent of offspring's exposure to the drugs via lactation. To our knowledge, the possibility that antenatal stress exacerbates lactation-driven exposure to SSRIs has not been tested yet. Thirty ICR-outbred female mice were exposed to stress during gestation and subsequently administered with either the SSRI, escitalopram, or the novel herbal candidate, shan-zha, during lactation. Upon weaning, both dams' and pups' anxiety-like behavior and serum escitalopram levels were assessed. The major findings of the current study show that both agents moderated the antenatal stress-induced transgenerational transference of anxiety by ameliorating dams' anxiety. Interestingly though, pups' exposure to escitalopram via lactation was exacerbated by antenatal stress. The latter finding provides a significant insight into the mechanism of lactation-driven exposure to xenobiotics and calls for a further consideration vis-à-vis the administration of other drugs during breastfeeding.","Burstein, Or; Simon, Noam; Simchon-Tenenbaum, Yaarit; Rehavi, Moshe; Franko, Motty; Shamir, Alon; Doron, Ravid",Transl Psychiatry,577,20

PubMed was systematically searched up to 020620. Studies were included if they had examined the relationship between COVID-19 and OSA. Studies were included that were in English and had the full text available. The findings from this study suggest that many of the risk factors and co-morbidities associated for OSA which include obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus are associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. There are plausible mechanisms by which OSA may independently increase one's risk of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 and data from the newly published CORONADO study suggests that OSA treated patients may be at increased risk of death from COVID-19. It is clear that the pandemic has had a major effect on the treatment management and diagnosis of OSA and moving forward it may be necessary to explore new diagnosis and treatment pathways for these individuals.","Miller, Michelle A; Cappuccio, Francesco P",Sleep Med Rev,577,1

Researchers have carried out a lot of work on contact tracing. However, almost all of the existing works assume that their clients and authorities have large storage space and powerful computation capability and clients can implement contact tracing on their own mobile devices such as mobile phones, tablet computers, and wearable computers. With the widespread outbreaks of the epidemics, these approaches are of less robustness to a larger scale of datasets when it comes to resource-constrained clients. To address this limitation, we propose a publicly verifiable contact tracing algorithm in cloud computing (PvCT), which utilizes cloud services to provide storage and computation capability in contact tracing. To guarantee the integrity and accuracy of contact tracing results, PvCT applies a novel set accumulator-based authentication data structure whose computation is outsourced, and the client can check whether returned results are valid. Furthermore, we provide rigorous security proof of our algorithm based on the q-Strong Bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption. Detailed experimental evaluation is also conducted on three real-world datasets. The results show that our algorithm is feasible within milliseconds of client CPU time and can significantly reduce the storage overhead from the size of datasets to a constant 128 bytes.","Zhu, Yixiao Ma Wenjie Cui Jiangtao Xia Xiaofang Peng Yanguo Ning Jianting",Security and Communication Networks,577,15

This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the epidemiology, induced impact, viral kinetics and clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in the Asia-Pacific Region, focusing on regions previously exposed to outbreaks of coronavirus. COVID-19 progressed differently by regions, with some (such as China and Taiwan) featured by one to two epidemic waves and some (such as Hong Kong and South Korea) featured by multiple waves. There has been no consensus on the estimates of important epidemiological time intervals or proportions, such that using them for making inferences should be done with caution. Viral loads of patients with COVID-19 peak in the first week of illness around days 2 to 4 and hence there is very high transmission potential causing community outbreaks. Various strategies such as government-guided and suppress-and-lift strategies, trigger-based/suppression approaches and alert systems have been employed to guide the adoption and easing of control measures. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is a hallmark of COVID-19. Identification and isolation of symptomatic patients alone is not effective in controlling the ongoing outbreaks. However, early, prompt and coordinated enactment predisposed regions to successful disease containment. Mass COVID-19 vaccinations are likely to be the light at the end of the tunnel. There is a need to review what we have learnt in this pandemic and examine how to transfer and improve existing knowledge for ongoing and future epidemics.","Kwok, Kin On; Huang, Ying; Tsoi, Margaret Ting Fong; Tang, Arthur; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Wei, Wan In; Hui, David Shu Cheong",Respirology,577,11

DESIGN: Baseline prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG was assessed in a prospective cohort study from a large pediatric healthcare facility. Prior SARS-CoV-2 testing history, potential risk factors and anxiety level about COVID-19 were determined. Prevalence difference between emergency department (ED)-based and non-ED-pHCWs was modeled controlling for those covariates. Chi-square test-for-trend was used to examine prevalence by month of enrollment. RESULTS: Most of 642 pHCWs enrolled were 31-40years, female and had no comorbidities. Half had children in their home, 49% had traveled, 42% reported an illness since January, 31% had a known COVID-19 exposure, and 8% had SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. High COVID-19 pandemic anxiety was reported by 71%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was 4.1%; 8.4% among ED versus 2.0% among non-ED pHCWs (p < 0.001).

To increase the likelihood of pursuing a career in Psychiatry or CAMHS by 50% over their 3 week placement.BackgroundThere is evidence in the literature of the widely variable medical student experiences when it comes to Psychiatry placements. Medical students from Kings’ College London (KCL) have a 3 week placement in Lambeth Community CAMHS services. Despite this being a good opportunity for learning and development, the feedback from students reports that they often feel lost and were unable to fulfil the potential of the placement. The main challenges reported were identifying beneficial educational experiences and gaining clinically relevant exposure. This exposure includes getting involved beyond observation and following a patient longitudinally. These challenges will likely have a knock-on effect on their attitude towards Psychiatry and overall enjoyment of CAMHS placements when there is already a struggle to recruit trainee Psychiatrists.MethodA structured and immersive educational placement was designed through consultation with previous students, the multidisciplinary team and the university program directors. This included:• A new induction• Having a role in initial assessments of young people• Formalised medical and psychology teaching• Communication sessions• Case discussions in a ‘grand round’ format providing opportunity for end of placement assessmentFeedback was gathered using the Qualtrics analytical software, which was easily accessible through student's mobile devices.Pre placement questionnaires were used to assess the student's initial level of knowledge, expectations from the placement and motivation or interest in a career in CAMHS. Post placement questionnaires were used to assess any change in the above baseline scores. Brief, online feedback was collected after every clinical activity and was used to assess the interest and utility of each attended session during the placement. The questionnaire feedback was analysed and using these data, adjustments were made to improve the program for the next students in a “Plan-Do Study-Act” quality improvement methodology format. We analysed whether improving placement experience and learning affected students’ interest in careers in Psychiatry.ResultThe Quality Improvement Project is currently on-going and results are pending. So far, there is an improvement in student attendance and engagement following the introduction of induction, structure and active involvement in case management.ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in community services having significantly reduced face to face contact, therefore our proposed changes for future cycles include various virtual elements. Ensuring medical students have access to online platforms such as Microsoft teams is vital in ensuring an effective medical student placement can be established Although the change to more remote working has been challenging , it is vital that medical students gain appropriate clinical experience during their Psychiatry placement to support further developments in Psychiatric recruitment.","Anandakumar, Brindha Nunn Lois Daly Fanchea Dale Ashleigh",BJPsych Open,577,3

Despite wide uses of various popular two-sample MR methods based on genome-wide association study summary level data, however, those methods could suffer from potential power loss or/and biased inference when the chosen genetic variants are in linkage disequilibrium (LD), and have relatively large direct effects on the outcome whose distribution might be heavy-tailed which is commonly referred to as the idiosyncratic pleiotropy. To resolve those two issues, we propose a novel Robust Bayesian Mendelian Randomization (RBMR) model that uses the more robust multivariate generalized $t$-distribution to model such direct effects in a probabilistic model framework which can also incorporate the LD structure explicitly. The generalized $t$-distribution can be represented as a Gaussian scaled mixture so that our model parameters can be estimated by the EM-type algorithms. We compute the standard errors by calibrating the evidence lower bound (ELBO) using the likelihood ratio test. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our RBMR has robust performance compared to other competing methods. We also apply our RBMR method to two benchmark data sets and find that RBMR has smaller bias and standard errors. Using our proposed RBMR method, we found that coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Informal social gatherings are a potentially important mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but studying their role in transmission is challenged by data and methodological limitations; birthdays offer an opportunity to empirically quantify the potential role of small social gatherings in COVID-19 spread. Objective: To assess the association between social gatherings and SARS-CoV-2 transmission by studying whether COVID-19 rates increase after birthdays in a household. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used nationwide data from January 1 to November 8, 2020, from 2.9 million US households with private insurance to compare COVID-19 infections between households with and without a birthday in the preceding 2 weeks, stratified according to county-level COVID-19 prevalence in that week and adjusting for household size and both week- and county-specific differences. The study also compared how birthday-associated infection rates differed by type of birthday (eg, child vs adult birthday, or a milestone birthday such as a 50th birthday), county-level precipitation on the Saturday of each week (which could move gatherings indoors), political leanings in the county, and state shelter-in-place policies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Household-level COVID-19 infection. Results: Among the 2.9 million households in the study, in the top decile of counties in COVID-19 prevalence, households with a birthday in the 2 weeks prior had 8.6 more diagnoses per 10â¯000 individuals (95% CI, 6.6-10.7 per 10â¯000 individuals) compared with households without a birthday in the 2 weeks prior, a relative increase of 31% above the county-level prevalence of 27.8 cases per 10â¯000 individuals, vs 0.9 more diagnoses per 10â¯000 individuals (95% CI, 0.6-1.3 per 10â¯000 individuals) in the fifth decile (P < .001 for interaction). Households in the tenth decile of COVID-19 prevalence had an increase in COVID-19 diagnoses of 15.8 per 10â¯000 persons (95% CI, 11.7-19.9 per 10â¯000 persons) after a child birthday, compared with an increase of 5.8 per 10â¯000 persons (95% CI, 3.7-7.9 per 10â¯000 persons) among households with an adult birthday (P < .001 in a test of interactions). No differences were found by milestone birthdays, county political leaning, precipitation, or shelter-in-place policies. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study suggests that birthdays, which likely correspond with social gatherings and celebrations, were associated with increased rates of diagnosed COVID-19 infection within households in counties with high COVID-19 prevalence.","Whaley, Christopher M; Cantor, Jonathan; Pera, Megan; Jena, Anupam B",JAMA Intern Med,577,16

The recent pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), caused by a viral infection with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has created a disastrous situation all over the world. As no drugs are available to treat this life-threatening disease and the mortality rate due to COVID-19 is high, there is an utmost need to attempt to treat the infection using drug repurposing. Some countries are against the use of these drugs because of adverse effects associated with drug repurposing and lack of statistically significant clinical data, but they have been found to be effective in some countries to treat COVID-19 patients (off-label/investigational). This article emphasises possible drug candidates in the treatment of COVID-19. Most of these drugs were found to be effective in in vitro studies. There is a need to re-assess in vitro data and to carry out randomised clinical trials.

The assessment and management of these patients constitute a key element to stop dissemination. AIM: To describe the assessment and treatment of asymptomatic infection in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: We searched five databases and search engines for preprints/preproofs, up to August 22, 2020. We included cohort, cross-sectional, and case series studies, reporting the assessment and management of asymptomatic individuals. We extracted data on total discharges with negative PCR, length of hospitalization, treatment, and number of patients who remained asymptomatic. A random-effects model with inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: 41 studies (nine cross-sectional studies, five retrospective studies and 27 reports/case series; 647 asymptomatic individuals), were included, of which 47% were male (233/501). The age of patients was between 1month and 73 years. In patients who became symptomatic, length of hospitalization mean was 13.6 days (SD 6.4). Studies used lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine plus ritonavir/lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin, ribavirin plus interferon and interferon alfa. The proportion of individuals who remained asymptomatic was 91% (463/588 patients; 95%CI: 78.3%-98.7%); and asymptomatic individuals discharged with negative PCR was 86% (102/124 individuals; 95%CI: 58.4%-100%). CONCLUSIONS: There is no standard treatment for asymptomatic COVID-19 individuals. There are no studies of adequate design to make this decision. It has been shown that most asymptomatic individuals who were followed have recovered, but this cannot be attributed to standard treatment.","Barboza, Joshuan J; Chambergo-Michilot, Diego; Velasquez-Sotomayor, Mariana; Silva-Rengifo, Christian; Diaz-Arocutipa, Carlos; Caballero-Alvarado, Jose; Garcia-Solorzano, Franko O; Alarcon-Ruiz, Christoper A; Albitres-Flores, Leonardo; Malaga, German; Schlagenhauf, Patricia; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Travel Med Infect Dis,577,16

Conventionally, public health is viewed as an evidence-based profession that is above politics. Yet national responses to COVID-19 in India reveal the embeddedness of health and illnesses in the larger politics of the state. Although it is still early to assess the full spectrum of damage caused by lack of central-level planning, this article argues against COVID-19 being viewed as a 'great leveller'. Rather, it suggests that we inhabit somatic societies that regularly employ the vocabulary of pathology/disease to determine social health. Moreover, the Indian experience illustrates how, even during a pandemic, 'social distancing' is not an apolitical notion. It becomes a measure for the state to co-opt scientific interventions of risk mitigation and relay them to people as a metaphor for exclusion: thereby exacerbating deeper structural inequities around which access to health and well-being of the population is organised.","Rahman, Sabina Yasmin",Health Sociol Rev,577,20

The focus is largely on assays used to test >1000s of compounds reliably and robustly. However, some assays used for 10s to 100s of compounds are included where the utility outweighs the low capacity. Literature searches for high throughput screening, models and in vitro assays were undertaken.Expert opinion: Drug discovery and development in tuberculosis is extremely challenging due to the requirement for predicting drug efficacy in a disease with complex pathology in which bacteria exist in heterogeneous states in inaccesible locations.

Methods: We used COVID-19 data from the Danish State Serum Institute on national, regional and municipality level. Cumulative number of tests, incidence, hospitalizations and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants were analysed for the five Danish regions and for all of Denmark. The cumulative number of tested and incidence of COVID-19 per 100,000 was compared for the two municipalities, Lolland and Gentofte. A sensitivity analysis of the COVID-19 indicators on a regional level was performed using number of tested as the denominator. Results: The Capital Region ranked highest on all analysed COVID-19 indicators with 10,849 tested, 365 cases, 63 hospitalized and 18 deaths per 100,000 by 2 June 2020. The three regions in western Denmark all had low levels, while Region Zealand ranked second highest. Despite general low health status in Lolland municipality, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was consistently below that of Gentofte. Sensitivity analysis showed that the Capital Region had the highest number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 tested, but Region Zealand had a higher number of hospitalized and similar number of deaths per 100,000 tested as the Capital Region over time.

This review provides a reasoned discussion of the possible use of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) or their products as a treatment in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The main benefits and concerns of using this cellular therapy, guided by preclinical and clinical data obtained from similar pathologies will be reviewed. MSC represent a highly immunomodulatory cell population and their use may be safe according to clinical studies developed in other pathologies. Notably, four clinical trials and four case reports that have already been performed in COVID-19 patients obtained promising results. The clinical application of MSC in COVID-19 is very preliminary and further investigational studies are required to determine the efficacy of the MSC therapy. Nevertheless, these preliminary studies were important to understand the therapeutic potential of MSC in COVID-19. Based on these encouraging results, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the compassionate use of MSC, but only in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and a poor prognosis. In fact, patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 can present infection and tissue damage in different organs, such as lung, heart, liver, kidney, gut and brain, affecting their function. MSC may have pleiotropic activities in COVID-19, with the capacity to fight inflammation and repair lesions in several organs.","Barros, Inês; Silva, António; de Almeida, Luís Pereira; Miranda, Catarina Oliveira",Cytokine growth factor rev,577,7

However, the number of confirmed cases depends on the testing policy, and it is important to understand how the number of positive cases obtained using different testing policies reveals the unknown ground truth. We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is the presence of another 'flu'-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19, that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be tested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using census data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data to model long-distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location-Based Testing policy (LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with very few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases. Interestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT, gives performance that is comparable with CT. In another direction, we compare the efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe that CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and significantly better than RST.","Gopalan, Aditya; Tyagi, Himanshu",J Indian Inst Sci,577,26

METHODS: As of May 2020, analysis was conducted on all subjects who could confirm their history of claims related to COVID-19 in the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database in Korea. Using this dataset, we compared the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 infection according to the use of DPP-4i and RAS blockade. Additionally, we validated the results using the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea dataset. RESULTS: Totally, data of 67,850 subjects were accessible in the HIRA dataset. Of these, 5,080 were confirmed COVID-19. Among these, 832 subjects with DM were selected for analysis in this study. Among the subjects, 263 (31.6%) and 327 (39.3%) were DPP4i and RAS blockade users, respectively. Thirty-four subjects (4.09%) received intensive care or died. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.362 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.135 to 0.971), and that for RAS blockade users was 0.599 (95% CI, 0.251 to 1.431). These findings were consistent with the analysis based on the NHIS data using 704 final subjects. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.303 (95% CI, 0.135 to 0.682), and that for RAS blockade users was 0.811 (95% CI, 0.391 to 1.682).

First reported in December 2019 in the Wuhan province of China, this new RNA virus has several folds higher transmission among humans than its other family member (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). The SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the region mediating the binding of the virus to host cells via Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a critical step of viral. Here in this study, we have utilized in silico approach for the virtual screening of antiviral library extracted from the Asinex database against the Receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Further, the molecules were ranked based on their binding affinity against RBD, and the top 15 molecules were selected. The affinity of these selected molecules to interrupt the ACE2-Spike interaction was also studied. It was found that the chosen molecules were demonstrating excellent binding affinity against spike protein, and these molecules were also very effectively interrupting the ACE2-RBD interaction. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies were utilized to investigate the top 3 selected molecules' stability in the ACE2-RBD complexes. This is the first study where molecules' inhibitory potential against the Receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and their inhibitory potential against the ACE2-Spike has been studied.

PURPOSE: The implementation of a pharmacist-managed transition of care program for kidney transplant recipients with posttransplant hyperglycemia (PTHG) is described. METHODS: In September 2015, a collaborative practice agreement between pharmacists and transplant providers at an academic medical center for management of PTHG was developed. The goal of the pharmacist-run service was to reduce hospitalizations by providing care to patients in the acute phase of hyperglycemia while they transitioned back to their primary care provider or endocrinologist. For continuous quality improvement, preimplementation data were collected from August 2014 to August 2015 and compared to postimplementation data collected from August 2017 to August 2018. The primary endpoint was hospitalizations due to hyperglycemia within 90 days post transplantation. Secondary endpoints included emergency department (ED) visits due to hypoglycemia and the number of interventions performed, number of encounters completed, and number of ED visits or admissions for hypoglycemia. A Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical data, and a Student t test was used to compare continuous data. A P value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: Forty-three patients in the preimplementation group were compared to 35 patients in the postimplementation group. There was a significant reduction in hospitalizations due to hyperglycemia in the postimplementation versus the preimplementation group (9 vs 1, P < 0.05); there was a reduction in ED visits due to hyperglycemia (5 vs 0, P = 0.06). There were no ED visits or hospitalizations due to hypoglycemia in either group. Clinical transplant pharmacists performed an average of 8.3 (SD, 4.4) encounters per patient per 90 days. CONCLUSION: A collaborative practice agreement was created and successfully implemented. A pharmacist-managed PTHG program could be incorporated into the standard care of kidney transplant recipients to help minimize rehospitalizations due to hyperglycemia.","Do, Vincent; Haakinson, Danielle; Belfort De Aguiar, Renata; Cohen, Elizabeth",Am. j. health system pharm,577,33

Although adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are thus far the most commonly used tool for ocular gene delivery, sustained expression of CRISPR/Cas components may cause immune reactions and an increased risk of off-target editing. In this review, we summarize the ocular administration routes and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of viral and non-viral vectors for delivery of CRISPR/Cas components to the eye.

In addition, all patients were required to contemporaneously complete the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) COVID-19 risk screening questionnaire published April 28, 2020 as outlined in the ASGE guidance document for reopening GI endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of our study is to report the outcomes of 1000 patients who successfully completed the clinical aspects of the ASGE COVID-19 risk screening questionnaire and whose RT-PCR tests were valid for interpretation. METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from patient medical records for demographics, symptom responses to the preprocedure ASGE COVID-19 risk screening questionnaire, and RT-PCR test results of patients scheduled to undergo an elective outpatient endoscopy at Rockford Gastroenterology Associates from May 22 through June 28, 2020. Descriptive statistics and standard calculation methods to determine both positive and negative predictive values were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Eight of 1000 patients included in the study tested positive for COVID-19. Three of 8 patients reported 1 or more symptoms on the ASGE COVID-19 risk screening questionnaire. One hundred nineteen additional patients reported symptoms on the ASGE COVID-19 risk screening questionnaire but tested negative for COVID-19. The positive and negative predictive values of the ASGE COVID-19 risk screening questionnaire were 2.46% and 99.43%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of COVID-19 infection in a community-based ambulatory surgery center is supported by a positive RT-PCR test rate of .80%. Absence of symptoms on the ASGE COVID-19 risk screening questionnaire was highly predictive of a negative RT-PCR test (99.43% negative predictive value), whereas the positive predictive value was low (2.46%) in symptomatic patients. A positive RT-PCR test was invaluable in preventing 5 asymptomatic patients from undergoing endoscopy. Similarly, 119 symptomatic patients underwent endoscopic evaluation who would have otherwise been excluded without RT-PCR testing. Symptom-based screening alone should not be the primary preprocedural assessment tool in selecting patients for undergoing endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bowyer, Brad; Thukral, Chandrashekhar; Patel, Sunil; Dovalovsky, Katrina; Bowyer, Sarah Grace; Ford, Joanne; Fox, Taci; Ringler, Euella",Gastrointest. endosc,577,20

Although GP costs are mainly covered by public services or social insurances in Europe, they are still self-employed physicians everywhere, differently from their colleagues in hospitals who are traditionally employees. TM is a very general term open to various interpretations and definitions. TM can now be practiced by means of modern audio-visual devices and is an alternative to the traditional face-to-face consultation in general practice. Although the adoption of TM seems to be compelling in our era, its practical dissemination in PC has been quite slow so far, and many different concerns have been raised on it. On the whole, TM widespread adoption in PC seems to be more a matter of labor organization and health care funding than of technology and ethics. Larger-scale organizations comprising a wide range of health professionals have become a pressing priority for a modern PC, because working together is crucial to provide high-quality care to patients, and co-location should boost teamwork and facilitate the management of information technology.

Accordingly, it has been hypothesized to have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal BCG childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate, thus allowing us to estimate the BCG's effect without the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. METHODS: Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after 1975, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 1·0005 (CI95: [0·8130-1·1881]) and 1·2046 (CI95: [0·7532-1·6560]), allowing us to reject fairly modest effects of universal BCG vaccination. We can reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by 19% and the number of hospitalizations by 25%.

This study aimed to investigate whether the causative agent of COVID-19 is found in semen. The databases of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched using a combination of related keywords. All studies with original data, involving detection of SARS-CoV-2 in semen of male patients with COVID-19 or in those who have recovered from it, were included in the study. Six articles, including 136 samples, entered the systematic review. Most of the studies were performed in the recovery phase of COVID-19. In four articles, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in semen, while in the other two articles semen testing showed the presence of the virus in some samples. Testicular discomfort, testicular cell damage, and spermogram disruption were also reported in some studies. We conclude that the study question cannot be answered with this number of studies. Since most of the samples were mild to moderate forms of COVID-19, it is not yet clear what the presence of the virus in semen will be in severe cases. The long-term effects are also vague. More original articles with better design and in different phases of the disease are needed to draw robust conclusions.","Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Karimi, Leila; Makvandi, Somayeh; Jamialahmadi, Tannaz; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,577,1

Using the ideas presented in this paper, one shall be able to obtain this valuable information that could address the problem of false-positive and false-negative to a certain extent. All of this within the purview of Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) specification, while preserving complete user privacy. There are four ways of propagating context between any two users. Two such methods allow private location logging, without revealing the location history within an app. The other two are encryption-based methods. The first encryption method is a variant of Apple's FindMy protocol, that allows nearby Apple devices to capture the GPS location of a lost Apple device. The second encryption is a minor modification of the existing GAEN protocol so that global context is available to a healthy phone only when it is exposed - this is a better option comparatively. It will still be the role of Public Health smartphone app to decide, on how to use the location-time context, to build a full-fledged contact tracing and public health solution.

Our analyses show indication of a nonignorable amount of selection bias for measures of personality traits among online survey respondents. This provides some evidence that participating in an online survey and complying with measures that can minimize the risk of being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus are confounded.

Neurologic symptoms have been reported as part of the clinical spectrum of the disease. We aimed to determine whether neurologic manifestations are common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and to describe their main characteristics. METHODS: We systematically reviewed all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital in a Spanish population during March 2020. Demographic characteristics, systemic and neurologic clinical manifestations, and complementary tests were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 841 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (mean age 66.4 years, 56.2% men), 57.4% developed some form of neurologic symptom. Nonspecific symptoms such as myalgias (17.2%), headache (14.1%), and dizziness (6.1%) were present mostly in the early stages of infection. Anosmia (4.9%) and dysgeusia (6.2%) tended to occur early (60% as the first clinical manifestation) and were more frequent in less severe cases. Disorders of consciousness occurred commonly (19.6%), mostly in older patients and in severe and advanced COVID-19 stages. Myopathy (3.1%), dysautonomia (2.5%), cerebrovascular diseases (1.7%), seizures (0.7%), movement disorders (0.7%), encephalitis (n = 1), Guillain-Barré syndrome (n = 1), and optic neuritis (n = 1) were also reported, but less frequent. Neurologic complications were the main cause of death in 4.1% of all deceased study participants. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic manifestations are common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In our series, more than half of patients presented some form of neurologic symptom. Clinicians need to maintain close neurologic surveillance for prompt recognition of these complications.

Also, the use of appropriate antivirals in order to alleviate the symptoms, to control the severity of the illness and to prevent the transmission, could be a good option that we study in this work. In this paper, we propose a computational random network model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Spain. Once the model has been calibrated and validated, we use it to simulate several scenarios where effective antivirals are available. The results show how the early use of antivirals may significantly reduce the incidence of COVID-19 and may avoid a new collapse of the health system.","Benlloch, José-María; Cortés, Juan-Carlos; Martínez-Rodríguez, David; Julián, Raul-S; Villanueva, Rafael-J",Chaos Solitons Fractals,577,2

In humans, the seriousness of infection caused by a coronavirus in the respiratory tract can vary from mild to lethal. A serious illness can be developed in old people and those with underlying medical problems like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease. For the diagnosis of the coronavirus disease, due to the growing number of cases, a limited number of test kits for COVID-19 are available in the hospitals. Hence, it is important to implement an automated system as an immediate alternative diagnostic option to pause the spread of COVID-19 in the population. OBJECTIVE: This paper proposes a deep learning model for classification of coronavirus infected patient detection using chest X-ray radiographs. METHODS: A fully connected convolutional neural network model is developed to classify healthy and diseased X-ray radiographs. The proposed neural network model consists of seven convolutional layers with rectified linear unit, softmax (last layer) activation functions and max pooling layers which were trained using the publicly available COVID-19 dataset. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: For validation of the proposed model, the publicly available chest X-ray radiograph dataset consisting COVID-19 and normal patient's images were used. Considering the performance of the results that are evaluated based on various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, MSE, RMSE & accuracy, it is seen that the accuracy of the proposed CNN model is 98.07%.","Rao, P Srinivasa; Bheemavarapu, Pradeep; Kalyampudi, P S Latha; Rao, T V Madhusudhana",,577,6

The dilemma of migrant live-in elderly carers in times of COVID-19,16.92157,2.396694,2020,"Background: Aging population and life expectancy are increasing globally, to cope with this trend, successful aging (SA) attracted the attention of gerontology research to determine its prevalence, risk factors, and its correlates. However, the published research about SA and older adult's health are sparse in Palestine. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and correlates of SA, normal aging, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among Palestinian older adults in Hebron governorates. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during March 2018-May 2018 among a total of 185 participants selected by stratified random sampling from five different areas in Hebron governance. SA was defined based on the multidimentional model; absence of chronic diseases, normal functional status with complete independency, maintains normal cognitive and psychological function and social engagement. Sociodemographic data, nutrition, and health status were also collected and analyzed. Results: The prevalence of SA among older Palestinians (22.2%), usual aging (58.9%), and the MCI (18.9%), with no significant difference in the prevalence between men and women P <0.05. The most prevalent subdomain is independent living skill (77.8%) and the lowest is the absence of chronic diseases (30.8%). SA was associated with younger older age (60-70 years), still working, and well-nourished participants. Conclusion: The results of this study revealed, successful aging is associated with younger age, still working and good nutritional status. Further research with appropriate methodology different parts of Palestine is required.","Badrasawi, Manal; Samuh, Monjed; Khallaf, Mohammed; Abuqamar, Mazen",Indian J Public Health,577,5

While bias due to confounding, selection bias, and misclassification can be mitigated through careful study design, unmeasured confounding is likely to remain in these observational studies. Phase III trials of COVID-19 vaccines have shown that protection from vaccination does not occur immediately, meaning that COVID-19 risk should be similar in recently vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, in the absence of confounding or other bias. Several studies have used the estimated effectiveness among recently vaccinated individuals as a negative control exposure to detect bias in vaccine effectiveness estimates. In this paper we introduce a theoretical framework to describe the interpretation of such a bias-indicator in test-negative studies, and outline assumptions that would allow the use of recently vaccinated individuals to correct bias due to unmeasured confounding.","Hitchings, Matt D.T.; Lewnard, Joseph A.; Dean, Natalie E.; Ko, Albert I.; Ranzani, Otavio T.; Andrews, Jason R.; Cummings, Derek A.T.",,577,1

Patients with co-morbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus (DM) seem to be more prone to severe symptoms and appear to have a higher mortality rate. In this review, we elucidate suggested mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility of patients with diabetes to infection with SARS-CoV-2 with a more severe COVID-19 disease. The worsened prognosis of COVID-19 patients with DM can be attributed to a facilitated viral uptake assisted by the host's receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It can also be associated with a higher basal level of pro-inflammatory cytokines present in patients with diabetes, which enables a hyperinflammatory ""cytokine storm"" in response to the virus. This review also suggests a link between elevated levels of IL-6 and AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway and their role in exacerbating diabetes-induced complications and insulin resistance. If further studied, these findings could help identify novel therapeutic intervention strategies for patients with diabetes comorbid with COVID-19.","Azar, William S; Njeim, Rachel; Fares, Angie H; Azar, Nadim S; Azar, Sami T; El Sayed, Mazen; Eid, Assaad A",Rev Endocr Metab Disord,577,9

Emerging evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 elicits a dysregulated immune response and a delayed interferon (IFN) expression in patients, which contribute largely to the viral pathogenesis and development of COVID-19. However, underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we report the activation and repression of the innate immune response by SARS-CoV-2. We show that SARS-CoV-2 RNA activates the RIG-I-MAVS-dependent IFN signaling pathway. We further uncover that ORF9b immediately accumulates and antagonizes the antiviral type I IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection on primary human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. ORF9b targets the nuclear factor &#954;B (NF-&#954;B) essential modulator NEMO and interrupts its K63-linked polyubiquitination upon viral stimulation, thereby inhibiting the canonical I&#954;B kinase alpha (IKK&#945;)/ß/Î³-NF-&#954;B signaling and subsequent IFN production. Our findings thus unveil the innate immunosuppression by ORF9b and provide insights into the host-virus interplay during the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wu, Jing; Shi, Yuheng; Pan, Xiaoyan; Wu, Shuang; Hou, Ruixia; Zhang, Yong; Zhong, Tiansheng; Tang, Hao; Du, Wei; Wang, Luying; Wo, Jing; Mu, Jingfang; Qiu, Yang; Yang, Ke; Zhang, Lei-Ke; Ye, Bang-Ce; Qi, Nan",Cell Rep,577,20

METHODS: This study was a post-hoc analysis of an open-label randomized trial to evaluate the virologic response of two ART regimens. The participants were ART-naïve women living with HIV initiating ART regimens between 20 and 36 weeks of pregnancy recruited at 19 clinical sites in six countries. Participants were randomized to receive raltegravir 400 mg BID or efavirenz 600 mg QD in addition to lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg BID. VVL and PVL tests were performed at every study visit. The primary outcomes measures were HIV-1 PVL and VVL at maternal study week 4 and rates of perinatal HIV transmission. RESULTS: A total of 408 were enrolled, of whom 323 had VVL samples 4 weeks after enrollment and were included in this analysis. Among women with undetectable/non-quantifiable PVL during ART, the overall rate of quantifiable VVL at Week 4 was 2.54% (7/275). Of the 275 with non-quantifiable PVL, 99.1% (115/116) and 96.2% (153/159) had non-quantifiable VVL in the EFV and RAL arms, respectively.

Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional research screened the general public using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 to detect anxiety levels. The questionnaire was distributed online during May 2020, while lockdowns were enforced. A total of 3017 respondents from all five main regions of Saudi Arabia completed the survey. The prevalence of anxiety was measured. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were executed to determine associated factors with anxiety during peak lockdown. Results: About 19.6% of the respondents possessed a moderate to severe level of anxiety during the pandemic. Western, Northern, and Eastern regions of Saudi Arabia were found to be the most anxious. Female participants had 5.3% higher levels of anxiety compared to male counterparts. The youngest age group (18 to 19 years), most of them were students, reported the highest frequency of anxiety (28.7%). Divorced and single participants had a higher level of anxiety compared to married ones. After adjusted with other variables, living with a family member with risk of the COVID-19 was the best predictor assessing anxiety amid peak lockdown (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.4–2.2). Conclusion: Notable anxiety prevailed during the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia.

We endow a classical firm network model with simple dynamical rules that reduce supply/demand imbalances and excess profits. We show that the time needed to reach equilibrium diverges as the system approaches an instability point beyond which the Hawkins-Simons condition is violated and competitive equilibrium is no longer realisable. We argue that such slow dynamics is a source of excess volatility, through accumulation and amplification of exogenous shocks. Factoring in essential physical constraints, such as causality or inventory management, we propose a dynamically consistent model that displays a rich variety of phenomena. Competitive equilibrium can only be reached after some time and within some region of parameter space, outside of which one observes periodic and chaotic phases, reminiscent of real business cycles. This suggests an alternative explanation of the excess volatility that is of purely endogenous nature. Other regimes include deflationary equilibria and intermittent crises characterised by bursts of inflation. Our model can be calibrated using highly disaggregated data on individual firms and prices, and may provide a powerful tool to describe out-of-equilibrium economies.","Dessertaine, Th'eo; Moran, Jos'e; Benzaquen, Michael; Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe",,577,1

The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known. AIM: To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing in a sample of the UK public. METHODS: This paper presents preplanned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey. OUTCOMES: Sexual activity was measured using the following question: ""On average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?"" Demographic and clinical data were collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: 868 individuals were included in this study. There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years. During self-isolation/social distancing, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption. STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS: This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing. Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings. Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic. CONCLUSION: Interventions to promote health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation/social distancing and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity.

An in-depth analysis about both population and molecular epidemiology of this pathogen is needed. METHODS: MERS cases reported globally as of June 2020 were collected mainly from World Health Organization official reports, supplemented by other reliable sources. Determinants for case fatality and spatial diffusion of MERS were assessed with Logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses were performed to examine the evolution and migration history of MERS-CoV. RESULTS: A total of 2562 confirmed MERS cases with 150 case clusters were reported with a case fatality rate of 32.7% (95% CI: 30.9â34.6%). Saudi Arabia accounted for 83.6% of the cases. Age of &#8805; 65 years old, underlying conditions and &#8805; 5 days delay in diagnosis were independent risk factors for death. However, a history of animal contact was associated with a higher risk (adjusted OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.10-7.98) among female cases < 65 years but with a lower risk (adjusted OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.18-0.51) among male cases &#8805; 65 years old. Diffusion of the disease was fastest from its origin in Saudi Arabia to the east, and was primarily driven by the transportation network. The most recent sub-clade C5.1 (since 2013) was associated with non-synonymous mutations and a higher mortality rate. Phylogeographic analyses pointed to Riyadh of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates as the hubs for both local and international spread of MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV remains primarily locally transmitted in the Middle East, with opportunistic exportation to other continents and a potential of causing transmission clusters of human cases. Animal contact is associated with a higher risk of death, but the association differs by age and sex. Transportation network is the leading driver for the spatial diffusion of the disease. These findings how this pathogen spread are helpful for targeting public health surveillance and interventions to control endemics and to prevent a potential pandemic.","Zhang, An-Ran; Shi, Wen-Qiang; Liu, Kun; Li, Xin-Lou; Liu, Ming-Jin; Zhang, Wen-Hui; Zhao, Guo-Ping; Chen, Jin-Jin; Zhang, Xiao-Ai; Miao, Dong; Ma, Wei; Liu, Wei; Yang, Yang; Fang, Li-Qun",Infect Dis Poverty,577,16

First, drug shape-based screening (among FDA approved drugs) with a known template of MTase inhibitor, sinefungin was done and best compounds with high similarity scores were selected. In addition to the selected compounds, 4 nucleoside analogs of anti-viral (Raltgravir, Maraviroc and Favipiravir) and anti-inflammatory (Prednisolone) drugs were selected for further investigations. Then, binding energies and interaction modes were found by molecular docking approaches and compouds with lower energy were selected for further investigation. After that, Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried to test the potential selected compounds in a realistic environment. The results showed that Raltegravir and Maraviroc among other compounds can bind strongly to the active site of the protein compared to sinefungin, and can be potential candidates to inhibit NSP-16. Also, the MD simulation results suggested that the Maraviroc and Raltegravir are more effective drug candidates than Sinefungin for inhibiting the enzyme.

We aimed to assess the effect of sulodexide when used within 3 days of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical onset. We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled outpatient trial. To be included, patients must have been at high risk for severe clinical progression. Participants received sulodexide (oral 1,000 LRU/d) or placebo for 21 days. The primary endpoint was the need for hospital care. Also assessed were patients' need for supplemental oxygen as well as D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and mortality. A total of 243 patients were included in the per-protocol analysis from June 5 to August 30, 2020. Of these, 124 received sulodexide and 119 received a placebo. Only 17.7% of the patients in the sulodexide group required hospitalization, compared with 29.4% in the placebo group (p = 0.03). This benefit persisted in the intention-to-treat analysis (15% in sulodexide group vs. 24% with placebo [p = 0.04]). With sulodexide, fewer patients required supplemental oxygen (30 vs. 42% [p = 0.05]). After 2 weeks, fewer patients had D-dimer levels >500 ng/dL (22 vs. 47% [p < 0.01]), and patients also had lower mean CRP levels (12.5 vs. 17.8 mg/dL [p < 0.01]). There were no between-group differences in thromboembolic events, major bleeding, or mortality. Treatment of COVID-19 patients with sulodexide, when provided within 3 days of clinical onset, improved their clinical outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in hospitals. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of CLABSIs and CAUTIs in 78 US 12 months before COVID-19 and 6 months during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the 2 study periods, there were 795,022 central-line days and 817,267 urinary catheter days. Compared to the period before the COVID-19 pandemic, CLABSI rates increased by 51.0% during the pandemic period from 0.56 to 0.85 per 1,000 line days (P < .001) and by 62.9% from 1.00 to 1.64 per 10,000 patient days (P < .001). Hospitals with monthly COVID-19 patients representing >10% of admissions had a National Health Safety Network (NHSN) device standardized infection ratio for CLABSI that was 2.38 times higher than hospitals with <5% prevalence during the pandemic period (P = .004). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus CLABSIs increased by 130% from 0.07 to 0.17 events per 1,000 line days (P < .001), and Candida spp by 56.9% from 0.14 to 0.21 per 1,000 line days (P = .01). In contrast, no significant changes were identified for CAUTI (0.86 vs 0.77 per 1,000 catheter days; P = .19). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial increases in CLABSIs but not CAUTIs. Our findings underscore the importance of hardwiring processes for optimal line care and regular feedback on performance to maintain a safe environment.","Fakih, Mohamad G; Bufalino, Angelo; Sturm, Lisa; Huang, Ren-Huai; Ottenbacher, Allison; Saake, Karl; Winegar, Angela; Fogel, Richard; Cacchione, Joseph",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,577,22

SARS-CoV2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China in December 2019. The COVID19 pandemic has now gripped the entire world with more than 70 million cases and over 1.5 million deaths so far. There no treatment option for COVID19 is in term of a drug or vaccine is currently available. Therefore drug repurposing may only provide a quick method for utilizing existing drugs for a therapeutic option. The virus genome contains several non-structural proteins (NSP) which serve as target for designing of antiviral agents. NSP9 of SARS-CoV2 encodes for a replicase enzyme which is essential for the virus replication in the host cell. In search of potent inhibitors, we have screened FDA approved drugs against NSP9 using in silico methods. Five drugs fluspirilene, troglitazone, alvesco, dihydroergotoxine and avodart were found to have highest affinities with the replicase. The molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) studies demonstrated strong drugs binding and stable NSP9-drugs complexes formation. The findings are also strongly supported by root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, radius of gyration, and hydrogen bond analysis of the complexes. Principal component analysis showed the stable conformation of NSP9 upon drug binding. It could be inferred that these five drugs individually or in combinations may be used as potential inhibitors of NSP9 of SARS-CoV-2 after exploring their in vivo antiviral potential.

The neuroplasticity mechanisms supporting this effect are, however, still unknown. Using data from a three-arm single-blind randomized controlled trial including acute stroke patients (N=38) and a 3-month follow-up, we set out to compare the neuroplasticity effects of daily listening to self-selected vocal music, instrumental music, and audiobooks on both brain activity and structural connectivity of the language network. Using deterministic tractography we show that the 3-month intervention induced an enhancement of the microstructural properties of the left frontal aslant tract (FAT) for the vocal music group as compared to the audiobook group. Importantly, this increase in the strength of the structural connectivity of the left FAT correlated with improved language skills. Analyses of stimulus-specific activation changes showed that the vocal music group exhibited increased activations in the frontal termination points of the left FAT during vocal music listening as compared to the audiobook group from acute to 3-month post-stroke stage. The increased activity correlated with the structural neuroplasticity changes in the left FAT. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of vocal music listening on post-stroke language recovery are underpinned by structural neuroplasticity changes within the language network and extend our understanding of music-based interventions in stroke rehabilitation.Significance statementPost-stroke language deficits have a devastating effect on patients and their families. Current treatments yield highly variable outcomes and the evidence for their long-term effects is limited. Patients often receive insufficient treatment that are predominantly given outside the optimal time window for brain plasticity. Post-stroke vocal music listening improves language outcome which is underpinned by neuroplasticity changes within the language network. Vocal music listening provides a complementary rehabilitation strategy which could be safely implemented in the early stages of stroke rehabilitation and seems to specifically target language symptoms and recovering language network.","Sihvonen, Aleksi J; Ripollés, Pablo; Leo, Vera; Saunavaara, Jani; Parkkola, Riitta; Rodríguez-Fornells, Antoni; Soinila, Seppo; Särkämö, Teppo",ENeuro,577,17

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence supports the use of physical activity and other nonpharmacologic therapies, either alone or with pharmacological therapies, for pain management. Nonopioid analgesics, including acetaminophen, topical analgesics, gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and TCA may be considered based on pain cause and type, with careful dose considerations in kidney disease. NSAIDs may be used in CKD and ESKD for short durations with careful monitoring. Opioid use should be minimized and reserved for patients who have failed other therapies. Opioids have been associated with increased adverse events in this population, and thus should be used cautiously after risk/benefit discussion with the patient. Opioids that are safer to use in kidney disease include oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine. Buprenorphine appears to be a promising and safer option due to its partial agonism at the mu opioid receptor. SUMMARY: Pain is poorly managed in patients with kidney disease. Nonpharmacological and nonopioid analgesics should be first-line approaches for pain management. Opioid use should be minimized with careful monitoring and dose adjustment.","Roy, Payel J; Weltman, Melanie; Dember, Laura M; Liebschutz, Jane; Jhamb, Manisha",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,577,20

The volume of SAM did not differ between time intervals, but SAM were more likely to be older (odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 - 1.04), White (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.09 -2.99), uninsured (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.35 - 3.46), arrive by EMS (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.31- 2.40), and have a higher NIHSS (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.003 - 1.034). SAM secondary to migraine, intoxication, medication toxicity, or psychiatric disease were less likely to occur in April 2020 (OR 0.37, CI 0.15- 0.96) and in patients from rural regions (OR 0.42, CI 0.19 - 0.95). They were more likely to occur in older patients (OR 1.06, CI 1.05-1.07) and men (OR 2.31, CI 1.62 - 3.31). SAM secondary to seizure were more likely to occur in April 2020 (OR 2.46, CI 1.06- 0.96) and Whites (OR 2.22, CI 1.16 -4.26). SAM from medical ornon-cerebrovascular or epileptic neurologic disease were unchanged. Conclusions: Significant changes in the frequency of SAM subtypes occurred in close proximity tostay-at-home orders. Our findings suggest that a proportion of Blacks and Hispanics were notaccessing healthcare for stroke like symptoms during the stay-at-home orders. Thus, patienteducation on how to access healthcare in vulnerable populations should be included withimplementation of stay at home orders.","Dickens, R.; Senetar, A.; Olasoji, E.; Branstetter, H.; Vijayaraghavan, N.; Huynh, T.

Restrictions from state governments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have resulted in a rapidly changing and evolving learning environment for todays' fellows. Innovative solutions must be sought to guarantee that proper education is maintained and to ensure the well-being of our trainees. METHODS: We assembled a panel of pain program directors who serve as officers/board members of the Association of Pain Program Directors to provide guidance and formulate recommendations to pain fellowship directors nationally. This guidance is based on reviewing current changes to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and American Board of Anesthesiology policies and best available evidence and expert opinion on the use of remote educational activities, research endeavors, and trainee wellness. CONCLUSIONS: The country is in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. The impact on pain management fellowships has been severe and will likely last for months, resulting in extraordinary challenges to the administration of pain fellowship programs and the education of our fellows. Understanding revisions to ACGME policies, using technology to promote remote learning opportunities, and providing trainees with opportunities to alleviate their anxiety and encourage mental health are beneficial strategies to implement. Together, we can implement innovative solutions to help overcome these challenges.","Kohan, Lynn; Moeschler, Susan; Spektor, Boris; Przkora, Rene; Sobey, Christopher; Brancolini, Scott; Wahezi, Sayed; Anitescu, Magdalena",Pain Med,577,24

The effective therapeutics are in urgent need. Here, we developed a high-content screening for the antiviral candidates using fluorescence-based SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein detection in Vero E6 cells coupled with plaque reduction assay. Among 122 Thai natural products, we found that Boesenbergia rotunda extract and its phytochemical compound, panduratin A, exhibited the potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Treatment with B. rotunda extract and panduratin A after viral infection drastically suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero E6 cells with IC50 of 3.62 µg/mL (CC50 = 28.06 µg/mL) and 0.81 µ&#924; (CC50 = 14.71 µM), respectively. Also, the treatment of panduratin A at the pre-entry phase inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection with IC50 of 5.30 µM (CC50 = 43.47 µM). Our study demonstrated, for the first time, that panduratin A exerts the inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection at both pre-entry and post-infection phases. Apart from Vero E6 cells, treatment with this compound was able to suppress viral infectivity in human airway epithelial cells. This result confirmed the potential of panduratin A as the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent in the major target cells in human. Since B. rotunda is a culinary herb generally grown in China and Southeast Asia, its extract and the purified panduratin A may serve as the promising candidates for therapeutic purposes with economic advantage during COVID-19 situation.","Kanjanasirirat, Phongthon; Suksatu, Ampa; Manopwisedjaroen, Suwimon; Munyoo, Bamroong; Tuchinda, Patoomratana; Jearawuttanakul, Kedchin; Seemakhan, Sawinee; Charoensutthivarakul, Sitthivut; Wongtrakoongate, Patompon; Rangkasenee, Noppawan; Pitiporn, Supaporn; Waranuch, Neti; Chabang, Napason; Khemawoot, Phisit; Sa-Ngiamsuntorn, Khanit; Pewkliang, Yongyut; Thongsri, Piyanoot; Chutipongtanate, Somchai; Hongeng, Suradej; Borwornpinyo, Suparerk; Thitithanyanont, Arunee",Sci Rep,577,6

The COVID-19 pandemic has appeared to disproportionately affect communities affected by deprivation and discrimination, who also appear to be at greater risk of severe disease. Our aim was to investigate the evolution of the socioeconomic groups affected by COVID-19 over the course of the first wave of the pandemic by examining patients presenting to an acute NHS trust. Study design: and methods: A retrospective study using the postcodes of patients presenting to the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust who tested PCR-positive for COVID-19 were used to determine average house price and index of multiple deprivation. These were used as markers of affluence to examine the trend in the socioeconomic status of affected patients from February to May 2020. Results: 384 cases were included. The postcodes of those individuals who were initially infected had higher average house prices and index of multiple deprivation, both of which followed downward trends as the outbreak progressed. Conclusion: Our data shows that the outbreak spread from higher to lower affluence groups through the course of the pandemic. We hypothesise that this was due to wealthier individuals initially transmitting the virus from abroad. Therefore, an earlier and more effective quarantine could have reduced spread to members of the community at greater risk of infection and harm. We suggest that hospitals systematically record the socioeconomic status of affected individuals in order to monitor trends, identify those who may be at risk of severe disease, and to push for more equitable public health policy.","Sturrock, B R H; Chevassut, E I; Shahvisi, A; Chevassut, T J T",Public Health Pract (Oxf),577,29

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: The purpose of the project described here was to use the work outputs identified in part 1 of a 2-part research initiative to build and validate an acute care clinical pharmacist productivity model. METHODS: Following the identification of work outputs in part 1 of the project, relative weighting was assigned to all outputs based on the time intensity and complexity of each task. The number of pharmacists verifying an inpatient medication order each day was selected to represent the labor input. A multivariable linear regression was performed to determine the final work outputs for inclusion in the model. Productivity and productivity index values were calculated for each day from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019. RESULTS: Of the 27 work outputs identified via consensus by the clinical pharmacist working team, 17 work outputs were ultimately included in the productivity model. The average productivity during the period July 2018 through June 2019 was derived from the model and will serve as the baseline productivity for acute care clinical pharmacists. CONCLUSION: Validated consensus methodology can be useful for engaging clinical pharmacist in decision-making and developing a clinical productivity model. When thoughtfully designed, the model can replace obsolete measures of productivity that do not account for the responsibilities of clinical pharmacists.","Simmons, Adrienne; Vest, Tyler A; Cicci, Jonathan; Clarke, Megan; Morbitzer, Kathryn A; Valgus, John M; Falato, Chris; Colmenares, Evan W; Vest, Mary-Haston L; Waldron, Kayla M",Am. j. health system pharm,577,1

One particularly challenging class of integrated functional elements from the perspective of NMR are conductive structures. Metallic electrodes could be used for electrochemical sample interaction for example, yet they can cause severe NMR spectral and SNR degradation. These issues are more entangled at the micro-scale since the distorted volume occupies a higher ratio of the sample volume. In this study, a combination of simulation and experimental validation was used to identify an electrode geometry that, in terms of NMR spectral parameters, performs as well as for the case when no electrodes are present. By placing the metal tracks in the side-walls of a microfluidic channel, we found that NMR RF excitation performance was actually enhanced, without compromising B0 homogeneity. Monitoring in situ deposition of chitosan in the microfluidic platform is presented as a proof-of-concept demonstration of NMR characterisation of an electrochemical process.","Davoodi, Hossein; Nordin, Nurdiana; Bordonali, Lorenzo; Korvink, Jan G; MacKinnon, Neil; Badilita, Vlad",,577,20

In such a scenario, electronic health records (EHRs) should provide a timely response to healthcare needs and to data uses that go beyond direct medical care and are known as secondary uses, which include biomedical research. However, it is usual for each data analysis initiative to define its own information model in line with its requirements. These specifications share clinical concepts, but differ in format and recording criteria, something that creates data entry redundancy in multiple electronic data capture systems (EDCs) with the consequent investment of effort and time by the organization. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to design and implement a flexible methodology based on detailed clinical models (DCM), which would enable EHRs generated in a tertiary hospital to be effectively reused without loss of meaning and within a short time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The proposed methodology comprises four stages: (1) specification of an initial set of relevant variables for COVID-19; (2) modeling and formalization of clinical concepts using ISO 13606 standard and SNOMED CT and LOINC terminologies; (3) definition of transformation rules to generate secondary use models from standardized EHRs and development of them using R language; and (4) implementation and validation of the methodology through the generation of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC-WHO) COVID-19 case report form. This process has been implemented into a 1300-bed tertiary Hospital for a cohort of 4489 patients hospitalized from 25 February 2020 to 10 September 2020. RESULTS: An initial and expandable set of relevant concepts for COVID-19 was identified, modeled and formalized using ISO-13606 standard and SNOMED CT and LOINC terminologies. Similarly, an algorithm was designed and implemented with R and then applied to process EHRs in accordance with standardized concepts, transforming them into secondary use models. Lastly, these resources were applied to obtain a data extract conforming to the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report form, without requiring manual data collection. The methodology allowed obtaining the observation domain of this model with a coverage of over 85% of patients in the majority of concepts. CONCLUSION: This study has furnished a solution to the difficulty of rapidly and efficiently obtaining EHR-derived data for secondary use in COVID-19, capable of adapting to changes in data specifications and applicable to other organizations and other health conditions. The conclusion to be drawn from this initial validation is that this DCM-based methodology allows the effective reuse of EHRs generated in a tertiary Hospital during COVID-19 pandemic, with no additional effort or time for the organization and with a greater data scope than that yielded by conventional manual data collection process in ad-hoc EDCs.","Pedrera-Jiménez, Miguel; García-Barrio, Noelia; Cruz-Rojo, Jaime; Terriza-Torres, Ana Isabel; López-Jiménez, Elena Ana; Calvo-Boyero, Fernando; Jiménez-Cerezo, María Jesús; Blanco-Martínez, Alvar Javier; Roig-Domínguez, Gustavo; Cruz-Bermúdez, Juan Luis; Bernal-Sobrino, José Luis; Serrano-Balazote, Pablo; Muñoz-Carrero, Adolfo",J Biomed Inform,577,21

The presence of lipid-laden macrophages on bronchiolar lavage is a specific but not sensitive histological finding of EVALI, which is often a diagnosis of exclusion. In 2020, the first cases of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV2 virus, were seen in the U.S. Both COVID-19 and EVALI can affect previously healthy individuals, manifesting with severe hypoxemia and systemic inflammation, posing diagnostic challenges in distinguishing the two syndromes. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is a well-described complication of COVID-19 yet is only rarely associated with EVALI, with only one published case report of EVALI complicated by pneumothorax. Here, we report a case of a 34-year-old man presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure complicated by pneumothorax, initially thought to be from COVID-19 pneumonia, found ultimately to have EVALI associated diffuse alveolar damage. Case: In April 2020, a 34-year-old man presented with one week of myalgia, shortness of breath, and a reduced exercise tolerance. Social history was notable for extensive vaping. His exam was notable for hypoxemia requiring nonrebreather. Testing showed elevated inflammatory markers and diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiography. Nasopharyngeal PCR was negative for SARS-CoV2. CT chest revealed dense consolidation with ground grass opacities and air bronchograms. Rheumatologic and infectious workup was unremarkable. Despite six negative SARS-CoV2 tests, he was treated for COVID-19 with empiric steroids and antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia. On hospital day 3, he developed a right-sided pneumothorax requiring chest tube. On hospital day 12, he developed a left-sided pneumothorax and a second chest tube was placed. A presumptive diagnosis of pneumonitis and diffuse alveolar damage secondary to EVALI was made. Given non-healing bilateral pneumothoraces, on hospital day 32, he underwent chemical pleurodesis with doxycycline which was complicated by ARDS. He was intubated, suffered a PEA arrest from refractory hypoxemia, and emergently cannulated to VV ECMO. A head CT demonstrated diffuse cerebral edema suggestive of anoxic brain injury. After extensive goals of care discussions, care was withdrawn and the patient passed away. Discussion: EVALI, similar to COVID-19, is syndrome of severe acute hypoxemia and systemic inflammation. Both conditions have similar radiographic findings with ground glass opacities indicative of alveolar damage, histological findings of tracheobronchitis and diffuse alveolar damage, and can lead to secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces.","Golob, S.; Winston, L.; Manson, D.

DESIGN: Independent calculations using the CovidSim code, which implements Imperial College London's individual based model, with data available in March 2020 applied to the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) epidemic. SETTING: Simulations considering the spread of covid-19 in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. POPULATION: About 70 million simulated people matched as closely as possible to actual UK demographics, geography, and social behaviours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Replication of summary data on the covid-19 epidemic reported to the UK government Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), and a detailed study of unpublished results, especially the effect of school closures. RESULTS: The CovidSim model would have produced a good forecast of the subsequent data if initialised with a reproduction number of about 3.5 for covid-19. The model predicted that school closures and isolation of younger people would increase the total number of deaths, albeit postponed to a second and subsequent waves. The findings of this study suggest that prompt interventions were shown to be highly effective at reducing peak demand for intensive care unit (ICU) beds but also prolong the epidemic, in some cases resulting in more deaths long term. This happens because covid-19 related mortality is highly skewed towards older age groups. In the absence of an effective vaccination programme, none of the proposed mitigation strategies in the UK would reduce the predicted total number of deaths below 200 000. CONCLUSIONS: It was predicted in March 2020 that in response to covid-19 a broad lockdown, as opposed to a focus on shielding the most vulnerable members of society, would reduce immediate demand for ICU beds at the cost of more deaths long term. The optimal strategy for saving lives in a covid-19 epidemic is different from that anticipated for an influenza epidemic with a different mortality age profile.","Rice, Ken; Wynne, Ben; Martin, Victoria; Ackland, Graeme J",BMJ,577,26

In this regard, we aimed to measure the potential associations of the current use of PPIs with the infection rates of COVID-19 among patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. DESIGN: Data were derived from a Korean nationwide cohort study with propensity score matching. We included 132 316 patients older than 18 years who tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 January and 15 May 2020. Endpoints were SARS-CoV-2 positivity (primary) and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (secondary: admission to intensive care unit, administration of invasive ventilation or death). RESULTS: In the entire cohort, there were 111 911 non-users, 14 163 current PPI users and 6242 past PPI users. After propensity score matching, the SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate was not associated with the current or past use of PPIs. Among patients with confirmed COVID-19, the current use of PPIs conferred a 79% greater risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19, while the relationship with the past use of PPIs remained insignificant. Current PPI use starting within the previous 30 days was associated with a 90% increased risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Patients taking PPIs are at increased risk for severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 but not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Since it may not be possible to provide information to all patients through telemedicine, additional methods are needed to reach all patients. This study aimed to determine the reliability and quality of YouTube videos that provide information on urological disorders during the COVID-19 period. Another aim was to assess the most shared and most viewed videos on urological disorders on YouTube and their usability as an additional resource in telemedicine during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: From 17 February 2020, to 31 July 2020, the following keywords were used to search videos on YouTube: “covid urology”, “covid andrology”, “covid fertility”, “covid male infertility”, “covid prostate”, “covid bladder”, “covid kidney”, “covid renal”, “covid testis”, “covid cancer”, “covid coitus”, “covid sex”, “covid sperm” and “covid erectile”;“coronavirus” was also used instead of “covid”. In total, 232 videos were evaluated by two urologists according to video characteristics. The number of total views, views per day, likes, dislikes, comments, video length, date of video upload and duration on YouTube was recorded. Finally, a total of 136 relevant English videos were included in the study. A 5-point modified DISCERN tool was used to assess reliability, whereas a 5-point Global Quality score (GQS) was used to evaluate quality. Cohen’s kappa score was used to determine inter-rater agreement, while the intraclass correlation coefficient was used to evaluate inter-observer reliability. Results: All videos had a high DISCERN score [4, interquartile range (IQR) (3-5)] and GQS [5, IQR (4-5)] in general. Moreover, 20 (14.7%) videos containing information about “sexual life” and “effects of COVID-19 on sperm” were described as debated. Videos uploaded by “universities/ professional organisations/non-profit physician/physician groups” had higher scores (p&lt;0.001). However, their rates of “number of views per day” (p=0.036) and “likes” (p&lt;0.001) were lower. The majority of videos related to urology (63.9%) included conversations about andrological disorders. The median number of total views and number of views per day were also highest for videos related to andrology. Conclusion: Although andrological disorders are classified as a non-essential issue and andrological consultations are postponed during the COVID-19 period, the results show that the rate of YouTube videos related to andrology is even higher than uro-oncological diseases during this period. Therefore, it is important to share accurate and reliable information in this field. Our analysis shows that informative, easy-to-understand YouTube videos uploaded by “universities/professional organisations/non-profit physicians/physician groups” can be used as an additional method to telemedicine, especially for andrological disorders that do not require follow-up.","Selvi, amp; Iacute,; smail, Baydilli Numan",Journal of Urological Surgery,577,16

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared it a pandemic, with Europe becoming its new epicentre. Italy has so far been the most severely hit European country and demand for critical care in the northern region currently exceeds its supply. This raises significant ethical concerns, among which is the allocation of scarce resources. Professionals are considering the prioritisation of patients most likely to survive over those with remote chances, and this news has triggered an intense debate about the right of every individual to access healthcare. The proposed analysis suggests that the national emergency framework in which prioritisation criteria are currently enforced should not lead us to perceive scarce resources allocation as something new. From an ethical perspective, the novelty of the current emergency is not grounded in the devastating effects of scarce resources allocation, which is rife in recent and present clinical practice. Rather, it has to do with the extraordinarily high number of people who find themselves personally affected by the implications of scarce resources allocation and who suddenly realise that the principle of 'equals should be treated equally' may no longer be applicable. Along with the need to allocate appropriate additional financial resources to support the healthcare system, and thus to mitigate the scarcity of resources, the analysis insists on the relevance of a medical ethics perspective that does not place the burden of care and choice solely on physicians.","Mannelli, Chiara",J Med Ethics,577,1

In the United States, planned out-of-hospital births are associated with significantly increased risks of neonatal morbidity and death. In addition, there are obstetric emergencies during out-of-hospital births that can lead to adverse outcomes, partly because of the delay in transporting the woman to the hospital. In other countries with well-integrated obstetric services and well-trained midwives, the differences in outcomes of planned hospital birth and planned home birth are smaller. Women are empowered to make informed decisions when the obstetrician makes ethically justified recommendations, which is known as directive counseling. Recommendations are ethically justified when the outcomes of one form of management is clinically superior to another. The outcomes of morbidity and mortality and of infection control and prevention of planned hospital birth are clinically superior to those of out-of-hospital birth. The obstetrician therefore should recommend planned hospital birth and recommend against planned out-of-hospital birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels for all patients and even more so for pregnant patients and their families. The response in this difficult time should be to mitigate this stress and empower women to make informed decisions by routinely providing counseling that is evidence-based and directive.","Grünebaum, Amos; McCullough, Laurence B; Bornstein, Eran; Klein, Risa; Dudenhausen, Joachim W; Chervenak, Frank A",J Perinat Med,577,16

We assessed whether a percutaneous device that reduces the diameter of the coronary sinus improved outcomes across multiple endpoints in a phase II trial. METHODS: We conducted a novel analysis performed as a post hoc efficacy analysis of the COSIRA (Coronary Sinus Reducer for Treatment of Refractory Angina) trial, which enrolled patients with Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class 3-4 refractory angina. We used four domains: symptoms (CCS Angina Scale), functionality (total exercise duration), ischaemia (imaging) and health-related quality of life. For all domains, we specified a meaningful threshold for change. The primary endpoint was defined as a probability of &#8805;80% that the reducer exceeded the meaningful threshold on two or more domains (group-level analysis) or that the average efficacy score in the reducer group exceeded the sham control group by at least two points (patient-level analysis). RESULTS: We randomised 104 participants to either a device that narrows to coronary sinus (n=52) or a sham implantation (n=52). The reducer group met the prespecified criteria for concordance at the group level and demonstrated improvement in symptoms (0.59 CCS grade, 95% credible interval (CrI)=0.22 to 0.95), total exercise duration (+27.9%, 95% CrI=2.8% to 59.8%) and quality of life (stability +11.2 points, 95% CrI=3.3 to 19.1; perception +11.0, 95% CrI=3.3 to 18.7). CONCLUSIONS: The reducer concordantly improved symptoms, functionality and quality of life compared with a sham intervention in patients with angina unsuitable for coronary revascularisation. Concordant analysis such as this one can help interpret early phase trials and guide the decision to pursue a clinical programme into a larger confirmatory trial.

The object of this study is to examine the influence of socio-demographic and health-related factors on the avoidance of healthcare utilization during the global outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020. Data were collected through an online survey four weeks after the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) confirmed the first case in South Korea; 1000 subjects were included in the analysis. The logit model for regression was used to analyze the associations between sociodemographic and health-related factors regarding the avoidance of healthcare utilization. Among the participants, 73.2% avoided healthcare utilization, and there was no significant difference in the prevalence of healthcare avoidance between groups with (72.0%) and without (74.9%) an underlying disease. Sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, income level, and residential area) were related to healthcare avoidance. Among the investigated influencing factors, residential areas highly affected by COVID-19 (i.e., Daegu/Gyeoungbuk region) had the most significant effect on healthcare avoidance. This study found a high prevalence of healthcare avoidance among the general population who under-utilized healthcare resources during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the results reveal that not all societal groups share the burden of healthcare avoidance equally, with it disproportionately affecting those with certain sociodemographic characteristics. This study can inform healthcare under-utilization patterns during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and provide information to public health emergency management for implementing strategies necessary to improve the preparedness of the healthcare system.","Lee, Minjung; You, Myoungsoon",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),577,1

A literature review was performed using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and WHO databases to identify relevant English-language articles published up to May 20, 2020. Fifteen articles reported 120 liver transplant recipients who were infected with COVID-19. Only 10 papers with 22 patients reported full encounter characteristics. Four papers reported 23, 17, 13, and 6 patients, respectively, but with minimal data. One paper reported the authors' own 39 patients' characteristics and demographics.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) possesses a nonstructural protein (nsp14), with amino-terminal domain coding for proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication. The ability of CoVs during genome replication and transcription to proofread and exclude mismatched nucleotides has long hindered the development of anti-CoV drugs. The resistance of SARS-CoV-2 to antivirals, especially nucleoside analogs (NAs), shows the need to identify new CoV inhibition targets. Therefore, this review highlights the importance of nsp14-ExoN as a target for inhibition. Also, nucleoside analogs could be used in combination with existing anti-CoV therapeutics to target the proofreading mechanism.","Tahir, Mohammed",J Med Virol,577,29

The pathogenesis of vaccine-related thrombocytopenia is not completely clear and is probably caused by molecular mimicry. Till date, there have been few reported cases of thrombocytopenia in the pharmacovigilance databases after patients received the Pfizer and Moderna coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) vaccines.

Governmental and social efforts have had great impact on various sectors of society and their consequences have exceeded the sphere of health. This essay discusses the scope of specific measures in the sense of the appropriation of risk control measures and proposes the epidemiological method as an alternative that goes beyond the quantification of risks and the attribution of responsibilities. To conclude, the emphasis is placed on the need to promote information about socialization processes to better understand the consequences of individual acts favoring alternatives other than pandemic control based on the use of coercive measures.","Moreno-Montoya, José",Biomedica,577,11

Responsibilities includes provision of advice to 6 hospitals (including 4 emergency departments) and 4 child and adolescent inpatient units. A record of all phone calls and call-outs, including Mental Health Act and Section 136 (S136) assessments are maintained and this study compares pre- and post-COVID-19 data to see if there are any differences in number of presentations, on-site assessments (including Mental Health Act and S136 assessments over 2019 and 2020.ResultNumbers of CAMHS presentations were lower in 2020 (mean 74 patients per month) compared with 2019 (60 patients per month). This was consistent across all months except October and December. The largest difference was seen in March: 109 patients presented in March 2019, compared with 55 in March 2020. This is also reflected in the number of assessments conducted on site. However, there do not appear to be differences in the numbers of Mental Health Act or S136 assessments undertaken over 2020, compared with 2019.ConclusionCAMHS out-of-hours presentations dropped off significantly at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, and in particular, with the first lockdown (March to July 2020). Specialist Registrars provided advice via telephone less frequently in 2020 compared with 2019, and were required to do fewer on-site assessments of children and young people presenting with mental health difficulties.There were no significant differences in Mental Health Act or S136 assessments between the two years, however, these numbers are too small to make any meaningful conclusions.It is likely that children and adolescents were less likely to present to emergency departments for assessment of their mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than this reflecting a true reduction in mental health difficulties.Recommendations:It is helpful to continue to monitor CAMHS out-of-hour presentations.Trusts may want to consider alternative settings for providing emergency CAMHS assessments, for example, mental health hubs.Limitations:This provision of data is subject to recall bias.","Evans, Sacha",BJPsych Open,577,16

A new demand for emergency use authorisation and rapid deployment of these vaccines before scrutinising phase III trial data is raging in different quarters. Can advancement of the deployment of these vaccines by even a few weeks give us rich public health dividends? Would it be ethical to deploy these novel vaccines based only on the safety and immunogenicity data generated by the phase-I and II clinical trials?

To date, there is no effective treatment. Clinical management is largely symptomatic, with organ support in intensive care for critically ill patients. The first phase I trial to test the efficacy of a vaccine has recently begun, but in the meantime there is an urgent need to decrease the morbidity and mortality of severe cases. It is known that patients with cancer are more susceptible to infection than individuals without cancer because of their systemic immunosuppressive state caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments. Therefore, these patients might be at increased risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 could in some case induce excessive and aberrant non-effective host immune responses that are associated with potentially fatal severe lung injury and patients can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Cytokine release syndrome and viral ARDS result from uncontrolled severe acute inflammation. Acute lung injury results from inflammatory monocyte and macrophage activation in the pulmonary luminal epithelium which lead to a release of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-&#945;. These cytokines play a crucial role in immune-related pneumonitis, and could represent a promising target when the infiltration is T cell predominant or there are indirect signs of high IL-6-related inflammation, such as elevated C-reactive protein. A monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab has been administered in a number of cases in China and Italy. Positive clinical and radiological outcomes have been reported. These early findings have led to an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial in China and Italy. While data from those trials are eagerly awaited, patients' management will continue to rely for the vast majority on local guidelines.

However, clinical criteria specifically to define COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome (cHIS) have not been established. We aimed to develop and validate diagnostic criteria for cHIS in a cohort of inpatients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched for clinical research articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and Aug 20, 2020, on features and diagnostic criteria for secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, macrophage activation-like syndrome of sepsis, cytokine release syndrome, and COVID-19. We compared published clinical data for COVID-19 with clinical features of other hyperinflammatory or cytokine storm syndromes. Based on a framework of conserved clinical characteristics, we developed a six-criterion additive scale for cHIS: fever, macrophage activation (hyperferritinaemia), haematological dysfunction (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio), hepatic injury (lactate dehydrogenase or asparate aminotransferase), coagulopathy (D-dimer), and cytokinaemia (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, or triglycerides). We then validated the association of the cHIS scale with in-hospital mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in consecutive patients in the Intermountain Prospective Observational COVID-19 (IPOC) registry who were admitted to hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. We used a multistate model to estimate the temporal implications of cHIS. Findings: We included 299 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between March 13 and May 5, 2020, in analyses. Unadjusted discrimination of the maximum daily cHIS score was 0·81 (95% CI 0·74-0·88) for in-hospital mortality and 0·92 (0·88-0·96) for mechanical ventilation; these results remained significant in multivariable analysis (odds ratio 1·6 [95% CI 1·2-2·1], p=0·0020, for mortality and 4·3 [3·0-6·0], p<0·0001, for mechanical ventilation). 161 (54%) of 299 patients met two or more cHIS criteria during their hospital admission; these patients had higher risk of mortality than patients with a score of less than 2 (24 [15%] of 138 vs one [1%] of 161) and for mechanical ventilation (73 [45%] vs three [2%]). In the multistate model, using daily cHIS score as a time-dependent variable, the cHIS hazard ratio for worsening from low to moderate oxygen requirement was 1·4 (95% CI 1·2-1·6), from moderate oxygen to high-flow oxygen 2·2 (1·1-4·4), and to mechanical ventilation 4·0 (1·9-8·2). Interpretation: We proposed and validated criteria for hyperinflammation in COVID-19. This hyperinflammatory state, cHIS, is commonly associated with progression to mechanical ventilation and death.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the performed tailored GIRONA (Gastro Intestinal cancer patients Receiving Occupational support Near and After diagnosis) intervention and to describe the experiences of those receiving the work-related support and of those providing it. METHODS: An online questionnaire was used to survey the feasibility of the intervention of the support recipients (patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer) and the support providers (healthcare professionals including: oncology nurses and oncological occupational physicians). Five themes were covered: acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality and integration of Bowen's feasibility model. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients, 14 oncology nurses and 4 oncological occupational physicians, shared their experiences about the tailored work-related support intervention. This intervention was generally perceived as positive and feasible by the participants. Some patients received work-related support despite not experiencing severe problems; others mentioned that they received no such support even though they did need it. Despite positive experiences, there are some barriers to tackle, such as length of consultation, timing of the initiation of work-related support and embedding the oncological occupational physician within the clinical setting.

We assess the prevalence of mental health problems and examine their association with social media exposure. A cross-sectional study among Chinese citizens aged&#8805;18 years old was conducted during Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2020. Online survey was used to do rapid assessment. Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China.

Instead, the pandemic continues to persistently and negatively affect the labour market patterns of parents with young children, regardless of the parent’s gender. This finding should guide policy-makers when planning for the province’s economic recovery. Using data from Alberta up to and including the December 2020 release of the Labour Force Survey, we do not find evidence that the “she-cession” continued into Alberta’s second round of health restriction measures. Instead, we find that school transitions to virtual learning, daycare closures, and parents opting for online learning resulted in profound and persistent effects on workers with young children compared to workers without children. Recovery plans focusing solely on gender may be therefore insufficient for addressing the effects that different groups have experienced during the pandemic. Policy-makers should target policies towards both mothers and fathers with young children. Moreover, new policies should be aimed at supporting parents so that they do not face additional stress over how they will pay their bills and feed their families if they lose their jobs or must reduce their hours to stay home to care for their children. The Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) should remain in place until all threats of school and child-care facility closures are past. Alberta has received approximately $144 million in direct CRCB subsidies, but the weekly amount of $500 per recipient is less than minimum wage in a full-time job, meaning parents still may be unable to pay bills and meet their families’ needs. The province should top up the CRCB for lower- or single-income parents. Employment Insurance benefits should be made available to parents who quit their jobs to take care of their children as a direct result of public health measures. As well, those parents with young children who receive welfare payments should not be required to search for jobs while public health measures remain in place. The Alberta government needs to work together with the federal government to provide adequate support to daycare centres and schools to cover the added pandemic-related costs. Alberta received $87 million in federal funding to help with those costs and has itself contributed $17.8 million to extra health and safety measures in daycare centres. This is money well spent, for when parents feel their children are in a safe place, they will not keep them at home and jeopardize or lose their own employment. However, the end of the pandemic will not mean an abrupt end to its effects on the labour market. Even though this paper finds no differences in the situations of employed men and women, the latter may experience more labour market friction in the long run, due to missed opportunities for on-the-job training and work experience. One benefit that can come out of the labour market disruptions caused by the pandemic is a renewed focus on addressing pre-pandemic inequities between men and women with children. From this perspective, Alberta should celebrate and embrace the recent federal commitment to a Canada-wide early learning and child care plan.","Tedds, Lindsay Baker John Koebel Kourtney",The School of Public Policy Publications (SPPP),577,16

The optimal antibiotic treatment duration for cIAIs is uncertain, especially in cases where source control is not achieved. We hypothesised that in patients with cIAIs, regardless of source control intervention, there would be a lower relapse rate with long-course antibiotics (28 days) compared with short course (&#8804; 10 days). We piloted a trial comparing &#8804; 10-day with 28-day antibiotic treatment for cIAI. METHODS: A randomised controlled unblinded feasibility trial was conducted. Eligible participants were adult patients with a cIAI that were diagnosed &#8804; 6 days prior to screening. Randomisation was to long-course (28 days) or short-course (&#8804;10 days) antibiotic therapy. Choice of antibiotics was determined by the clinical team. Participants were followed up for 90 days. Primary outcomes were willingness of participants to be randomised and feasibility of trial procedures. RESULTS: In total, 172 patients were screened, 84/172 (48.8%) were eligible, and 31/84 (36.9%) were randomised. Patients were assigned to either the short-course arm (18/31, 58.0%) or the long-course arm (13/31, 41.9%). One patient in the short-course arm withdrew after randomisation. In the short-course arm, 4/17 (23.5%) were treated for a cIAI relapse vs 0/13 (0.0%) relapses in the long-course arm. Protocol violations included deviations from protocol-assigned antibiotic duration and interruptions to antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study identified opportunities to increase recruitment in a full trial. This study demonstrates completion of a randomised controlled trial to further evaluate if the optimum antibiotic duration for cIAIs is feasible.

In Hungary, the first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on 4th March, 2020, and on 15th March, the first fatality related to the infection was announced. At the moment of the latter event, there was no central, standardized guideline, which could explain the necessary precautions, and provide an unequivocal description on how to handle the dead body. The procedure of transportation, storage, occurent autopsy or final disposition of the deceased raise a lot of questions, especially on how to carry out these tasks. Legislation related to infectious diseases and decedent management in general do not provide enough information on how to perform duties in a COVID-19 fatality case. The chief medical officer suspended the execution of autopsies, except in cases of unnatural death, since 19th March, however, the transportation and storage of fatalities can still be a problem. The Department of Pathology of the Healthcare Professional College of the Ministry of Human capacities published a procedure on recommended post-mortem duties on 21st March, but the suggested protocols only represent a narrow spectrum of international recommendations. Therefore supplementation may be necessary. Sadly, post-mortem protocols, in spite of their importance, are also underrepresented in the international literature. A further problem, wich makes adoptability difficult, is that available foreign guidelines and algorithms are optimized for different legislation, and organisations, resources not available in our country.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is considered to be a salvage strategy for severe ARDS. However, the effect of ECMO therapy on severe ARDS remains inconclusive. We aimed to evaluate the effects of ECMO for adults with severe ARDS. METHODS: We searched six databases (EMBASE, Medline, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Wanfang databases and CNKI) from inception to May 2020 to screen relevant high-quality observational studies and randomised controlled trials. We used the random effects model for outcome calculation. Trial sequential analysis (TSA), heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis and publication bias were explored. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. RESULTS: Seven studies (two RCTs and five observational studies) with a total of 867 patients were included. Compared with MV therapy alone, ECMO therapy significantly reduced the mortality at 90 days (based on RCT studies, Risk Ratio [RR] 0.74, 95% confidence Interval (CI) 0.59-0.93, P = .01, I2 = 0%, moderate quality; based on observational studies, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.81, P < .001, I2 = 0%, low quality) and at 30 and 60 days.

METHODS: Thirty-five older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus were assigned to 2 groups according to their frailty status: exercise training group (prefrail or frail; n = 21; 74.7 [4.5] y; 33.3% male) and control group (robust; n = 14; 73.1 [3.9] y; 42.9% male). The exercise training group followed a multicomponent training program focusing on muscle power: supervised (5 wk) and unsupervised (6 wk). The primary outcomes, including PA and sitting time, perceived disability, and HRQoL, were assessed at the baseline and after 11 weeks. RESULTS: At the end of confinement, there were significant decreases in PA in both groups (P < .05). Thus, sitting time increased more in the control group than in the exercise training group (P < .05). The HRQoL measures remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle power training before and during mandatory COVID-19 self-isolation in type 2 diabetes mellitus older adults (1) attenuates the COVID-19 domiciliary confinement-related increase in sitting time and (2) slightly decreases the self-reported levels of disability and maintains HRQoL.","Brazo-Sayavera, Javier; López-Torres, Olga; Martos-Bermúdez, Álvaro; Rodriguez-Garcia, Lorena; González-Gross, Marcela; Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia",J Phys Act Health,577,3

The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered anonymously via social media (WeChat). It was completed by 10 545 adults in all of mainland China's 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among study variables. Diabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family members. Among people with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with diabetes tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal infection (40.0% among respondents reporting diabetes and 8.0% without diabetes). Only 54-55% of these respondents claimed to consistently practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60% of those with diabetes experienced food or medication shortages during the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without diabetes. Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages reported a 63% higher COVID-19 infection rate. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of self-reported personal and family member COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.","Shi, Zumin; Yan, Alice; Zimmet, Paul; Sun, Xiaoming; Cristina do Vale Moreira, Nayla; Cheskin, Lawrence J; Wang, Liming; Qu, Weidong; Yan, Hong; Hussain, Akhtar; Wang, Youfa",Horm Metab Res,577,20

Pre-existing endothelial dysfunction, especially if it is accompanied by a viral infection of the endothelial cells may present an important mechanism behind the immunothrombotic/thromboembolic complications of the COVID-19 illness. Here we emphasize that pharmacotherapy with statins could partly counteract such pathophysiological scenarios. Accordingly, using familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) as a pertinent example of a lifelong endothelial dysfunction, we aim to make the clinicians and consulting neurologists aware of statins as a possible adjuvant therapy in the context of an increased risk of ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19. Based on recent clinical evidence, there is a need to encourage clinicians and consulting neurologists to continue or initiate effective statin treatment to prevent an ischemic stroke, particularly when they encounter a hypercholesterolemic COVID-19 patient with FH.","Vuorio, A.; Kaste, M.; Kovanen, P.

We also analyze and correlate the collected data with past statistics. A crowdsourcing mobile application known as Disease Outbreak Tracker (DOT) was implemented and made public. A real-time disease surveillance system using the Early Aberration Reporting System algorithm (EARS) for analysis of the collected data was also implemented. The collected data were correlated to historical data for 2017. Data were successfully collected and plotted on a daily basis. The results show that a few cases of Flu and Scabies were reported in some districts. The EARS methods C1, C2 and C3 also depicted spikes above the set threshold on some days. The study covers data collected over a period of one month. Once symptoms data were collected using DOT, probabilistic methods were used to find the disease or diseases that the user was suffering from. The data were further processed to find the extent of the disease outbreak district-wise, per disease. These data were represented graphically for a rapid understanding of the situation in each district.

Each of the laboratory parameters has potential value for risk stratification and prediction of COVID-19 outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the difference between these parameters in severe and nonsevere disease and to provide the optimal cutoff value for predicting severe disease. METHOD: We performed a systematic literature search through electronic databases. The variables of interest were serum procalcitonin, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in each group of severity outcomes from COVID-19. RESULTS: There were a total of 4848 patients from 23 studies. Our meta-analysis suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 infections have higher procalcitonin, (mean difference 0.07; 95% CI 0.05-0.10; p < 0.00001), CRP (mean difference 36.88; 95% CI 29.10-44.65; p < 0.00001), D-Dimer (mean difference 0.43; 95% CI 0.31-0.56; p < 0.00001), and LDH (mean difference 102.79; 95% CI 79.10-126.49; p < 0.00001) but lower levels of albumin (mean difference -4.58; 95% CI -5.76 to -3.39; p < 0.00001) than those with nonsevere COVID-19 infections. The cutoff values for the parameters were 0.065 ng/mL for procalcitonin, 38.85 g/L for albumin, 33.55 mg/L for CRP, 0.635 µ/L for D-dimer, and 263.5 U/L for LDH, each with high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests elevated procalcitonin, CRP, D-dimer, and LDH and decreased albumin can be used for predicting severe outcomes in COVID-19.","Hariyanto, Timotius Ivan; Japar, Karunia Valeriani; Kwenandar, Felix; Damay, Vika; Siregar, Jeremia Immanuel; Lugito, Nata Pratama Hardjo; Tjiang, Margaret Merlyn; Kurniawan, Andree",Am J Emerg Med,577,33

Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is the most severe and potentially fatal form. Anticoagulants used in prophylactic or therapeutic doses are discussed to potentially exert beneficial effects in patients with sepsis and/or SIC; however, due to the lack of evidence recent guidelines are limited to recommendations for drug prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE), while treatment of SIC has not been addressed. METHODS: In order to determine the status quo of VTE prophylaxis as well as treatment of SIC in German intensive care units (ICU), we conducted a Germany-wide online survey among heads of ICUs from October 2019 to May 2020. In April 2020, the survey was supplemented by an additional block of questions on VTE prophylaxis and SIC treatment in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. RESULTS: A total of 67 senior doctors took part in the survey. The majority (nâ¯= 50; 74.6%) of the responses were from ICU under the direction of an anesthesiologist and/or a department of anesthesiology. Most of the participants worked either at a university hospital (nâ¯= 31; 47.8%) or an academic teaching hospital (nâ¯= 27; 40.3%). The survey results show a pronounced heterogeneity in clinical practice with respect to the prophylaxis of VTE as well as SIC treatment. In an exemplary case of pneumogenic sepsis, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) were by far the most frequently mentioned group of medications (nâ¯= 51; 76.1% of the responding ITS). In the majority of cases (nâ¯= 43; 64.2%), anti-FXa activity is not monitored with the use of LMWH in prophylaxis doses. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) was listed as a strategy for VTE prophylaxis in 37.3% of the responses (nâ¯= 25). In an exemplary case of abdominal sepsis 54.5% of the participants (nâ¯= 36; multiple answers possible) stated the use of UFH or LMWH and UFH with dosage controlled by PTT is used on two participating ICUs. The anti-FXa activity under prophylactic anticoagulation with LMWH is monitored in 7 participating clinics (10.6%) in abdominal sepsis. Systematic screening for sepsis-associated coagulation disorders does not take place in most hospitals and patterns in the use of anticoagulants show significant variability between ICUs. In the case of COVID-19 patients, it is particularly noticeable that in three quarters of the participating ICUs the practice of drug-based VTE prophylaxis and SIC treatment does not differ from that of non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of answers collected in the survey suggests that a systematic approach to this topic via clinical trials is urgently needed to underline individualized patient care with the necessary evidence.","Schmoch, Thomas; Brenner, Thorsten; Becker-Pennrich, Andrea; Hinske, Ludwig Christian; Weigand, Markus A; Briegel, Josef; Möhnle, Patrick",Anaesthesist,577,22

We summarize the reported pathologic findings on biopsy and autopsy in patients with severe/fatal COVID-19 and documented the presence and/or effect of SARS-CoV-2 in all organs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, MedRxiv, Lilacs and Epistemonikos databases from January to August 2020 for all case reports and case series that reported histopathologic findings of COVID-19 infection at autopsy or tissue biopsy was performed. 603 COVID-19 cases from 75 of 451 screened studies met inclusion criteria. The most common pathologic findings were lungs: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) (92%) and superimposed acute bronchopneumonia (27%); liver: hepatitis (21%), heart: myocarditis (11.4%). Vasculitis was common only in skin biopsies (25%). Microthrombi were described in the placenta (57.9%), lung (38%), kidney (20%), Central Nervous System (CNS) (18%), and gastrointestinal (GI) tract (2%). Injury of endothelial cells was common in the lung (18%) and heart (4%). Hemodynamic changes such as necrosis due to hypoxia/hypoperfusion, edema and congestion were common in kidney (53%), liver (48%), CNS (31%) and GI tract (18%). SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were demonstrated within organ-specific cells in the trachea, lung, liver, large intestine, kidney, CNS either by electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, or immunohistochemistry. Additional tissues were positive by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests only. The included studies were from numerous countries, some were not peer reviewed, and some studies were performed by subspecialists, resulting in variable and inconsistent reporting or over statement of the reported findings. CONCLUSIONS: The main pathologic findings of severe/fatal COVID-19 infection are DAD, changes related to coagulopathy and/or hemodynamic compromise. In addition, according to the observed organ damage myocarditis may be associated with sequelae.","Peiris, Sasha; Mesa, Hector; Aysola, Agnes; Manivel, Juan; Toledo, Joao; Borges-Sa, Marcio; Aldighieri, Sylvain; Reveiz, Ludovic",PLoS One,577,16

The aim of this study was to validate this scoring system for estimating the risk of disease worsening in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This study included the patients who were treated between April 1 st and March 13 th , 2020. The patients were classified into mild, moderate, and severe groups according to the extent of respiratory failure. MuLBSTA score was applied to estimate the risk of disease worsening in each severity group and we validated the utility of the scoring system. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were analyzed. Among the 46 patients with mild disease, 17 showed disease progression to moderate or severe disease after admission. The model showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of only 34.5% with a cut-off value of 5 points. Among the 55 patients with mild or moderate disease, 6 deteriorated to severe disease, and the model showed a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 71.4% with a cut-off value of 11 points.

A 10-month-old boy was admitted to the emergency department due to a 3-day fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the nasopharyngeal swab specimen of the patient. Regarding initial clinical and laboratory findings, the patient was diagnosed to have MIS-C and bacterial co-infection. Clindamycin and ceftriaxone treatments were initiated for bacterial co-infection. Despite treatment, his fever persisted and acute phase reactants compatible with MIS-C were elevated and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered. After IVIG treatment, his fever persisted and the patient developed local inflammatory signs including erythema, tenderness, fluctuation developed.

Currently, there are no effective prophylactic or therapeutic options to deal with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) or any other human coronavirus (HCoV) infections. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a classic adaptive immunotherapy which has been in use for more a century to prevent and treat infections including SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and H1N1 pandemic. Moreover, the World Health Organization regarded CP transfusion as the most promising therapy to treat MERS-CoV. This review was undertaken to demonstrate the potential of CP in the treatment of the pandemic COVID-19 disease. A total of eight studies conducted on CP therapy in patients with COVID-19 were reviewed wherein 25,028 patients above 18 years of age were involved. The vast majority of patients reported favorable outcomes when treated with CP with &lt;1% serious adverse events. Despite its promising beneficial effects in patients severely ill with COVID-19, CP therapy requires further evaluation in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) as a lack of satisfactory efficacy data from this area certainly enhances the hesitancy with regard to employing this treatment. In the present circumstances of unsatisfactory pharmacological therapy and the urgent need for a successful curative remedy, considering the use of CP therapy is reasonable provided RCTs confirm its safety, efficacy, and tolerability.","Khulood, Daulat; Adil, Mir Shoebulla; Sultana, Ruqiya; Nimra,",Ther.

Children aged 7 to 12 with uncontrolled asthma and their families were recruited from an outpatient pulmonary department of a university hospital in Thailand. Thirty-seven child-parent pairs were randomly assigned to three sessions for a period of two months of the family-based asthma self-management program, while 37 child-parent pairs were assigned to the control group. Data were collected at baseline and after implementation at two months by using the Childhood Asthma Control Questionnaire and the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the measurement of pulmonary function was performed using peak flow meters. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was employed to analyze the mean difference between the experimental and control groups. The results indicated significant increased asthma control status, pulmonary function, and quality of life in the children from baseline to after implementation in the experimental group that participated in the family-based asthma self-management program. Significant improvement in these three asthma health outcomes was also seen in the experimental group when compared to the control group. It was seen that the family-based asthma self-management program is useful for promoting the self-management of school-age children, enabling the control of symptoms, and enhancing health outcomes regarding asthma.","Sangnimitchaikul, Wipada; Srisatidnarakul, Boonjai; Ladores, Sigrid",Compr Child Adolesc Nurs,577,21

This, together with data that suggest that a large cohort of coronavirus disease 2019 patients have better outcomes if we can avoid intubating them, creates a need for a safe method of NIV or high-flow oxygen delivery during transport. Commonly used and successful in-hospital regimens for these patients are high-flow nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure. In some studies, helmet NIV has been shown to be a viable, if not superior, alternative to these therapies for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

A large percentage of the patients are asymptomatic and hospitals around the world are struggling to restart routine services. We report the results of a universal testing protocol of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 in a large orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. Methods: A retrospective study of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 at a tertiary care orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. All patients underwent nasopharyngeal swab test before surgery. A questionnaire was used to assess the patient before the RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test. Data regarding imaging, investigations and follow up was recorded. Results: In the month of July 2020, 168 patients underwent routine nasopharyngeal RT-PCR swab test for COVID-19 prior to planned orthopaedic surgical procedure (Both trauma and elective cases). 16 of the RT-PCR tests were positive. However vascular cases and absolute emergencies were done without a RT-PCR test with PPE and all universal precautions. 11 patients underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test. All 16 cases who were positive were asymptomatic. The asymptomatic positive rate was 9.52%. Of the 11 patients who underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test, only one patient had a positive test post-operatively. Conclusions: Routine nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing revealed a high rate of asymptomatic cases. If the RT-PCR test is positive, it is best to defer the case till the test returns negative. All precautions must be taken while performing emergency surgeries. Our algorithm in managing patients has proven to be effective and can be replicated with ease to continue operating and taking care of orthopaedic patients during this pandemic.","Kumar, K.

We examined 409 individuals enrolled in the COVID-19 Registry to Assess Frequency, Management, and Outcomes of Arterial and Venous Thromboembolic Complications (CORONA-VTE) who had ABO blood group data available. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association of ABO blood group types with three primary outcomes: major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major arterial and venous thrombosis and all-cause mortality. 201, 121, 61 and 26 individuals had blood group O, A, B and AB, respectively. In multivariable analysis, blood group A was associated with a 2.5-fold higher odds of MACE than blood group O (OR 2.47[1.18-5.18]). There was an effect suggesting a 2-fold higher odds of major thrombotic events in blood group A vs. O that did not reach statistical significance (OR 2.15 [0.89-5.20]). No association between blood group type and all-cause mortality was found. Compared with the other blood group types, blood group A was associated with an increased odds of MACE(ORA/non-A 2.18[1.11-4.29]), while blood group O was associated with lower odds of MACE(ORO/non-O 0.50[0.26-0.97]). In conclusion, blood group A was associated with an increased odds of MACE, whereas blood group O was associated with a reduction in the odds of MACE in patients with COVID-19. These findings may inform risk stratification of COVID-19 patients for cardiovascular complications. Additional studies are needed to validate our findings.","Nauffal, Victor; Achanta, Aditya; Goldhaber, Samuel Z; Piazza, Gregory",J. thromb. thrombolysis,577,16

Remotely delivered acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) may be a suitable and accessible psychological intervention to support young people who have survived brain tumours. This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of remotely delivered ACT to improve quality of life among these young survivors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a two-arm, parallel group, randomised controlled trial comparing ACT with waitlist control at 12-week follow-up as the primary endpoint. Seventy-two participants will be recruited, who are aged 11-24 and have completed brain tumour treatment. Participants will be randomised to receive 12 weeks of ACT either immediately or after a 12-week wait. The DNA-v model of ACT will be employed, which is a developmentally appropriate model for young people. Feasibility will be assessed using the proportion of those showing interest who consent to the trial and complete the intervention. Acceptability will be assessed using participant evaluations of the intervention, alongside qualitative interviews and treatment diaries analysed thematically. A range of clinical outcome measures will also assess physical and mental health, everyday functioning, quality of life and service usage at 12-week follow-up. The durability of treatment effects will be assessed by further follow-up assessments at 24 weeks, 36 weeks and 48 weeks.

An observed correlation between lowered &#960;* energy level of the pyridinium ring and increased EPR activity indicates that thermally induced electron-transfer processes could be involved, where the variable-temperature EPR spectrum indicates a singlet ground state and a thermally activated triplet state for the ylide. The fact that the high-resolution mass spectrum confirms the presence of oligomers of a less sterically hindered pyridinium ylide further points to a radical mechanism.","Liao, Fan; Huang, Wenhuan; Chen, Biao; Ding, Zijing; Li, Xingxing; Su, Hao; Wang, Tao; Wang, Yucai; Miao, Hui; Zhang, Xiaolong; Luo, Yi; Yang, Jinlong; Zhang, Guoqing",,577,16

Understanding the patient-specific and cancer-specific features that impact the severity of COVID-19 may inform optimal cancer care during this pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined consecutive patients with lung cancer and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n = 102) at a single center from 12 March 2020 to 6 May 2020. Thresholds of severity were defined a priori as hospitalization, intensive care unit/intubation/do not intubate ([ICU/intubation/DNI] a composite metric of severe disease), or death. Recovery was defined as >14 days from COVID-19 test and >3 days since symptom resolution. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were inferred from MSK-IMPACT (n = 46) and compared with controls with lung cancer and no known non-COVID-19 (n = 5166). RESULTS: COVID-19 was severe in patients with lung cancer (62% hospitalized, 25% died). Although severe, COVID-19 accounted for a minority of overall lung cancer deaths during the pandemic (11% overall). Determinants of COVID-19 severity were largely patient-specific features, including smoking status and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [odds ratio for severe COVID-19 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.07-9.44 comparing the median (23.5 pack-years) to never-smoker and 3.87, 95% confidence interval 1.35-9.68, respectively]. Cancer-specific features, including prior thoracic surgery/radiation and recent systemic therapies did not impact severity. Human leukocyte antigen supertypes were generally similar in mild or severe cases of COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-19 controls. Most patients recovered from COVID-19, including 25% patients initially requiring intubation. Among hospitalized patients, hydroxychloroquine did not improve COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with high burden of severity in patients with lung cancer. Patient-specific features, rather than cancer-specific features or treatments, are the greatest determinants of severity.","Luo, J; Rizvi, H; Preeshagul, I R; Egger, J V; Hoyos, D; Bandlamudi, C; McCarthy, C G; Falcon, C J; Schoenfeld, A J; Arbour, K C; Chaft, J E; Daly, R M; Drilon, A; Eng, J; Iqbal, A; Lai, W V; Li, B T; Lito, P; Namakydoust, A; Ng, K; Offin, M; Paik, P K; Riely, G J; Rudin, C M; Yu, H A; Zauderer, M G; Donoghue, M T A; Luksza, M; Greenbaum, B D; Kris, M G; Hellmann, M D",Ann Oncol,577,24

It is currently one of the most recommended treatments for small- and medium-sized stones (<20 mm) in most guidelines internationally. The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak could lead to a further increase in ESWL use as it avoids a general anesthetic and its potential complications in patients with COVID-19 infection. Most publications exhibit ESWL stone-free rates (SFRs) of 70%-80%; however, this is often not the case in many centers, with multiple factors affecting the efficacy of the intervention. Various stone and patient factors have been shown to influence the ESWL success. Stone position, density and size, skin-to-stone distance, and body-mass index contribute to SFRs. Modifications in the lithotripter design and revisions in the technique have also improved the SFRs over the years, with slower shock rates, power-ramping protocols, combined real-time ultrasound, and fluoroscopy imaging technology, all enhancing the efficacy. The adjuvant use of pharmacological agents, such as alpha-blockers, potassium citrate, and the emerging microbubble technology, has also been investigated and shown promising results. Arguably, the most significant determinant of the success of ESWL in a particular unit is how the lithotripsy service is set up and monitored. Careful patient selection, dedicated personnel, and post-treatment imaging review are essential for the optimization of ESWL. Through an analysis of the published studies, this review aimed to explore the measures that contribute to an effectual lithotripsy service in depth.","Petrides, Neophytos; Ismail, Safiyah; Anjum, Faqar; Sriprasad, Seshadri",Turk J Urol,577,24

The initial measures to mitigate these effects were focused on health interventions and remedies; rightly so. These had included public health measures including the lockdown, the test-and-contact-tracing and the social or physical distancing measures among others. Measures were also taken by different countries and states to mitigate the economic fallout and these had included palliatives for the people. Countries had borrowed and adjusted their fiscal policies and priorities to cater for the COVID-19 effects. Then, the question arises: what have we done with education in Africa? Education is arguably the most important way to address how COVID-19 would affect our future and the life of the generation whose education has been significantly impacted by COVID-19.

Regarding the important role of nutrition on the immunity, the present review article aimed to outline nutritional support of DM during the outbreak of COVID-19 with a mechanistic insight. Methods: Searches were performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases from 2000 until December 2020 using the following keywords. All relevant clinical and experimental studies published in English were included. Results: Evidences revealed that hyperglycemia is a significant predictor of some viral infections including COVID-19 which can exacerbate the complications of DM. According to the literature review, adequate intake of dietary protein, fiber, essential fatty acids and some micronutrients especially vitamins D, C, B12, folate, zinc and selenium has beneficial effects on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in diabetic patients through modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses or direct effects on virus enzymes or the rate of cell entrance. Conclusions: It is well understood that malnutrition may increase susceptibility to viral infections and disease progression. Therefore, considering nutritional status of diabetic patients and reasonable supplementation of the above mentioned nutrients can ameliorate the symptoms of COVID-19 in DM. However, further well-designed clinical trials are needed to determine their therapeutic dose.","Mahluji, Sepideh; Jalili, Mahsa; Ostadrahimi, Alireza; Hallajzadeh, Jamal; Ebrahimzadeh-Attari, Vahideh; Saghafi-Asl, Maryam",J Diabetes Metab Disord,577,25

Their findings suggest that unconscious biases can affect clinical decisions when providers experience increased cognitive stress. The implications are significant for emergency providers as resources are especially strained during the COVID-19 pandemic and as the adverse effects of unconscious bias on health disparities and patient outcomes have become clearly apparent. Implicit bias training (IBT) is recommended for emergency providers and has significant implications for medical and nurse educators in executing and evaluating IBT outcomes.","Brockett-Walker, Camille; Lall, Michelle; Evans, Dian Dowling; Heron, Sheryl",Adv Emerg Nurs J,577,12

As an illustrative case study, the author identifies two key social factors that are likely to face the degrees of risk faced by midwives in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, if and when COVID-19 takes hold in Indonesia. Healthcare workers in both high and low resource-settings globally are likely to face particular risks and vulnerabilities that are shaped by localized social and health systems factors.

The direct and indirection relationship (through attitude toward volunteering) was tested. Additionally, the moderating role of class standing between student volunteers' motivations, attitudes and repeat volunteer intention was assessed.Design/methodology/approachResearchers applied a quantitative methodology to data collected after the festival volunteering experience. The research team collected 205 useable surveys from university student volunteers at the Food Network and Cooking Channel South Beach Wine and Food Festival (SOBEWFF®). Structural equation modeling was used to test the relationships among volunteer motivations, attitude toward volunteering and intention to continue volunteering. Lastly, a multiple-group analysis was applied to test the moderating role of class standing.FindingsThe results showed the motivating factors purposive, personal enrichment and family traditions were significant in predicting attitude toward volunteering. These motivations did not significantly affect intention to continue volunteering;thus researchers found only an indirect relationship (through attitude toward volunteering) between volunteering motivations and intention to continue volunteering. Additionally, a positive attitude toward volunteering resulted in an intention to continue volunteering. Lastly, testing the moderating role of class standing revealed significant results on three pathways, indicating that students are motivated to volunteer differently based upon class standing (freshman through junior vs. senior, graduate).Research limitations/implicationsThe data were collected prior to COVID-19, and the ways in which COVID-19 has impacted the events industry and the scape of future events are yet to be determined.Practical implicationsFestival organizers and managers should appeal to different motivations of potential student volunteers depending on their class standing. For example, results of the moderator “class standing” indicated that the relationship between personal enrichment motivation and attitude toward volunteering was strongest and significant among freshmen, sophomores and juniors, but insignificant among seniors and graduate students. Thus, freshmen through juniors are more highly motivated to obtain practical experiences, and this motivation results in a positive attitude toward volunteering.Originality/valueThis study tests the moderating role of class standing to help predict intention to continue volunteering at a special event. The research is further unique by extending an understanding of the validity and reliability of the special events volunteer motivations scale.","Beckman, Eric Pan Tianyu Kitterlin Miranda Cain Lisa",International Journal of Event and Festival Management,577,20

Participants said to use more digital technologies to maintain contacts and adapt to the government measurements. Most participants missed the lack of social contacts, while some participants had no problems with the reduced social contacts. The emotional well-being of most participants did not change. Some participants felt unpleasant or mentioned that the mood of other people had changed. Participants were not motivated to expand their social network because of existing strong networks.

This paper highlights how the evidence base for nutrition, health, food systems, social protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions has evolved since the 2013 Lancet Series on maternal and child nutrition and identifies the priority actions needed to regain and accelerate progress within the next decade. Policies and interventions targeting the first 1000 days of life, including some newly identified since 2013, require renewed commitment, implementation research, and increased funding from both domestic and global actors. A new body of evidence from national and state-level success stories in stunting reduction reinforces the crucial importance of multisectoral actions to address the underlying determinants of undernutrition and identifies key features of enabling political environments. To support these actions, well-resourced nutrition data and information systems are essential. The paper concludes with a call to action for the 2021 Nutrition for Growth Summit to unite global and national nutrition stakeholders around common priorities to tackle a large, unfinished undernutrition agenda-now amplified by the COVID-19 crisis.","Heidkamp, Rebecca A; Piwoz, Ellen; Gillespie, Stuart; Keats, Emily C; D039,; Alimonte, Mary R; Menon, Purnima; Das, Jai K; Flory, Augustin; Clift, Jack W; Ruel, Marie T; Vosti, Stephen; Akuoku, Jonathan Kweku; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Lancet,577,16

Longitudinal studies are necessary to examine trajectories of change in mental health over time and identify sociodemographic groups at risk for persistent distress. PURPOSE: To examine the trajectories of mental distress between March 10 and August 4, 2020, a key period during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants included 6,901 adults from the nationally representative Understanding America Study, surveyed at baseline between March 10 and 31, 2020, with nine follow-up assessments between April 1 and August 4, 2020. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to examine the association between date and self-reported mental distress (measured with the four-item Patient Health Questionnaire) among U.S. adults overall and among sociodemographic subgroups defined by sex, age, race/ethnicity, household structure, federal poverty line, and census region. RESULTS: Compared to March 11, the odds of mental distress among U.S. adults overall were 1.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.65-2.07) times higher on April 1 and 1.92 (95% CI = 1.62-2.28) times higher on May 1; by August 1, the odds of mental distress had returned to levels comparable to March 11 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.66-0.96). Females experienced a sharper increase in mental distress between March and May compared to males (females: OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.85-2.82; males: OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.15-2.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the trajectory of mental health symptoms during an unprecedented pandemic, including the identification of populations at risk for sustained mental distress.","Riehm, Kira E; Holingue, Calliope; Smail, Emily J; Kapteyn, Arie; Bennett, Daniel; Thrul, Johannes; Kreuter, Frauke; McGinty, Emma E; Kalb, Luther G; Veldhuis, Cindy B; Johnson, Renee M; Fallin, M Daniele; Stuart, Elizabeth A",Ann Behav Med,577,26

One of the gaps in our current knowledge relates to the long-term mental and physical impact of the infection on affected individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the Netherlands at the end of February 2020, resulting in over 900,000 people testing positive for the virus, over 24,000 hospitalizations, and over 13,000 deaths by the end of January 2021. Although many patients recover from the acute phase of the disease, experience with other virus outbreaks has raised concerns regarding possible late sequelae of the infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an online tool to assess the long-term burden of COVID-19 in patients. METHODS: In this paper, we describe the process of development, assessment, programming, implementation, and use of this new tool: the assessment of burden of COVID-19 (ABCoV) tool. This new tool is based on the well-validated assessment of burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tool. RESULTS: As of January 2021, the new ABCoV tool has been used in an online patient platform by more than 2100 self-registered patients and another 400 patients in a hospital setting, resulting in over 2500 patients. These patients have submitted the ABCoV questionnaire 3926 times. Among the self-registered patients who agreed to have their data analyzed (n=1898), the number of females was high (n=1153, 60.7%), many were medically diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=892, 47.0%), and many were relatively young with only 7.4% (n=141) being older than 60 years. Of all patients that actually used the tool (n=1517), almost one-quarter (n=356, 23.5%) used the tool twice, and only a small group (n=76, 5.0%) used the tool 6 times. CONCLUSIONS: This new ABCoV tool has been broadly and repeatedly used, and may provide insight into the perceived burden of disease, provide direction for personalized aftercare for people post COVID-19, and help us to be prepared for possible future recurrences.","van Noort, Esther M J; Claessens, Danny; Moor, Catharina C; Berg, Carlijn A L Van Den; Kasteleyn, Marise J; 039, In; t Veen, Johannes C C M; Van Schayck, Onno C P; Chavannes, Niels H",JMIR Form Res,577,18

The etiological agent was quickly identified as a betacoronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2), which has since caused a pandemic. Several methods allowing for the specific detection of viral nucleic acids have been established, but these only allow detection of the virus during a short period of time, generally during acute infection. Serological assays are urgently needed to conduct serosurveys, to understand the antibody responses mounted in response to the virus, and to identify individuals who are potentially immune to re-infection. Here we describe a detailed protocol for expression of antigens derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that can serve as a substrate for immunological assays, as well as a two-stage serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

However, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created additional barriers to donate due to governmental prevention measures and increased personal health risks. In this report, we examined how the pandemic affected new donor registrations in the Netherlands, especially among groups with higher risk profiles for severe COVID-19. Additionally, we explored the role of media for blood donation and new donor registrations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed new donor registrations and attention for blood donation in newspapers and on social media from January until May 2020, in comparison to the same period in 2017 to 2019. RESULTS: After the introduction of nationwide prevention measures, several peaks in new donor registrations occurred, which coincided with peaks in media attention. Interestingly, people with a higher risk profile for COVID-19 (e.g., due to age or region of residence) were overrepresented among new registrants. DISCUSSION: In sum, the first peak of the current pandemic has led to increased new blood donor registrations, despite the associated increased health risks.

The study focused on the 12 preparatory-year students in contemporary dance. Despite numerous constraints-primarily small workspaces, unstable Internet connections, and the difficulty of correcting technical dance moves at a distance-all students and teachers were able to maintain pedagogical follow-up through a series of constructed activities. Students appreciated the social aspect (the relationship with their teachers and fellow students) and day-structuring component of the scheduling. The online activities helped to avoid student isolation, and motivation seemed unaffected.

Whilst several parameters influencing infection transmission are expected to be consistent across populations, the serial interval can vary across and within populations over time. Therefore, local estimates are preferable for use in epidemiological models developed at a regional level. We used data collected as part of the national contact tracing process in Ireland to estimate the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Irish population, and to estimate the proportion of transmission events that occurred prior to the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: After data cleaning, the final dataset consisted of 471 infected close contacts from 471 primary cases. The median serial interval was 4 days, mean serial interval was 4.0 (95% confidence intervals 3.7, 4.3) days, whilst the 25th and 75th percentiles were 2 and 6 days respectively. We found that intervals were lower when the primary or secondary case were in the older age cohort (greater than 64 years). Simulating from an incubation period distribution from international literature, we estimated that 67% of transmission events had greater than 50% probability of occurring prior to the onset of symptoms in the infector. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst our analysis was based on a large sample size, data were collected for the primary purpose of interrupting transmission chains. Similar to other studies estimating the serial interval, our analysis is restricted to transmission pairs where the infector is known with some degree of certainty. Such pairs may represent more intense contacts with infected individuals than might occur in the overall population. It is therefore possible that our analysis is biased towards shorter serial intervals than the overall population.","McAloon, Conor G; Wall, Patrick; Griffin, John; Casey, Miriam; Barber, Ann; Codd, Mary; Gormley, Eamonn; Butler, Francis; McV Messam, Locksley L; Walsh, Cathal; Teljeur, Conor; Smyth, Breda; Nolan, Philip; Green, Martin J; O039,; Grady, Luke; Culhane, Kieran; Buckley, Claire; Carroll, Ciara; Doyle, Sarah; Martin, Jennifer; More, Simon J",BMC Public Health,577,16

However, the powerful spectral representation in the field of image processing is rarely considered in these models. METHODS: In this work, we propose to introduce frequency representation into convolution neural networks (CNNs) and design a novel model, tKFC-Net, to combine powerful feature representation in both frequency and spatial domains. Through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operation, frequency representation is employed on pooling, upsampling, and convolution without any adjustments to the network architecture. Furthermore, we replace original convolution with twin-Kernel Fourier Convolution (t-KFC), a new designed convolution layer, to specify the convolution kernels for particular functions and extract features from different frequency components. RESULTS: We experimentally show that our method has an edge over other models in the task of medical image segmentation. Evaluated on four datasets-skin lesion segmentation (ISIC 2018), retinal blood vessel segmentation (DRIVE), lung segmentation (COVID-19-CT-Seg), and brain tumor segmentation (BraTS 2019), the proposed model achieves outstanding results: the metric F1-Score is 0.878 for ISIC 2018, 0.8185 for DRIVE, 0.9830 for COVID-19-CT-Seg, and 0.8457 for BraTS 2019. CONCLUSION: The introduction of spectral representation retains spectral features which result in more accurate segmentation. The proposed method is orthogonal to other topology improvement methods and very convenient to be combined.","Tang, Xianlun; Peng, Jiangping; Zhong, Bing; Li, Jie; Yan, Zhenfu",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,577,1

Assessment of health risks associated with the regular use of face foundation by females is dynamic due to the emerging products. The most common international 14 brands of face foundation powders were collected and the concentrations of different elements (Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, V and Zn) in each sample were determined. A combined approach merging the conventional and computational tools was used for investigating the risk of exposure to toxic elements. Monte Carlo simulations were applied to calculate risks associated with twenty elements. We attempted different probability distribution functions for concentrations because the actual distribution functions are not known, and the only data available are the mean value and standard deviation of concentrations obtained from experiment. Our results indicate that the total non-carcinogenic health risk through exposure to different elements (Hazardous Index, HI) does not strongly depend on the choice of the probability distribution function for the concentrations. We also show that taking into account probability distributions of other variables and parameters such as body weight, exposed skin area, skin adhesion, etc. does not significantly change the main result rather just slightly broadening the final Hazardous Index distribution function. We found that calculated HI is well below unity for all considered samples, i.e., the dermal exposure to toxic elements in the considered facial powders is negligible and the considered face foundation powders are quite safe to use.","Shomar, Basem; Rashkeev, Sergey N",Environ Res,577,0

We aimed to assess the association between collateral status and EVT outcomes and to investigate whether collateral status modified the effect of successful reperfusion on EVT outcomes. METHODS: We used data from the ongoing, prospective, multicenter Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke (ETIS) Registry. Collaterals were graded according to the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology (ASITN/SIR) guidelines. Patients were divided into two groups based on angiographic collateral status: poor (grade 0-2) versus good (grade 3-4) collaterals. RESULTS: Among 2020 patients included in the study, 959 (47%) had good collaterals. Good collaterals were associated with favorable outcome (90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2) (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.88). Probability of good outcome decreased with increased time from onset to reperfusion in both good and poor collateral groups. Successful reperfusion was associated with higher odds of favorable outcome in good collaterals (OR 6.01, 95% CI 3.27 to 11.04) and poor collaterals (OR 5.65, 95% CI 3.32 to 9.63) with no significant interaction. Similarly, successful reperfusion was associated with higher odds of excellent outcome (90-day mRS 0-1) and lower odds of mortality in both groups with no significant interaction. The benefit of successful reperfusion decreased with time from onset in both groups, but the curve was steeper in the poor collateral group. CONCLUSIONS: Collateral status predicted functional outcome after EVT. However, collateral status on the pretreatment angiogram did not decrease the clinical benefit of successful reperfusion.","Anadani, Mohammad; Finitsis, Stephanos; Clarençon, Frédéric; Richard, Sébastien; Marnat, Gaultier; Bourcier, Romain; Sibon, Igor; Dargazanli, Cyril; Arquizan, Caroline; Blanc, Raphael; Lapergue, Bertrand; Consoli, Arturo; Eugene, Francois; Vannier, Stephane; Spelle, Laurent; Denier, Christian; Boulanger, Marion; Gauberti, Maxime; Liebeskind, David S; de Havenon, Adam; Saleme, Suzana; Macian, Francisco; Rosso, Charlotte; Naggara, Olivier; Turc, Guillaume; Ozkul-Wermester, Ozlem; Papagiannaki, Chrisanthi; Viguier, Alain; Cognard, Christophe; Le Bras, Anthony; Evain, Sarah; Wolff, Valerie; Pop, Raoul; Timsit, Serge; Gentric, Jean-Christophe; Bourdain, Frédéric; Veunac, Louis; Maier, Benjamin; Gory, Benjamin",J. neurointerv. surg.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of BW training on patients with stroke. METHODS: A keyword search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for articles published until November, 2019. Two investigators screened the articles and extract data from each included study. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the effect of BW on stroke. In addition, the quality of evidence was evaluated by GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation; version:3.6) approach. RESULTS: A total of ten studies were included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the review. All included studies described some positive influences of BW on stroke relative to the control group (forward walking or conventional treatment).

The TREC-COVID Challenge was created to evaluate information retrieval (IR) methods and systems for this quickly expanding corpus. Using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), several dozen research teams participated in over 5 rounds of the TREC-COVID Challenge. While previous work has compared IR techniques used on other test collections, there are no studies that have analyzed the methods used by participants in the TREC-COVID Challenge. We manually reviewed team run reports from Rounds 2 and 5, extracted features from the documented methodologies, and used a univariate and multivariate regression-based analysis to identify features associated with higher retrieval performance. We observed that fine-tuning datasets with relevance judgments, MS-MARCO, and CORD-19 document vectors was associated with improved performance in Round 2 but not in Round 5. Though the relatively decreased heterogeneity of runs in Round 5 may explain the lack of significance in that round, fine-tuning has been found to improve search performance in previous challenge evaluations by improving a system's ability to map relevant queries and phrases to documents. Furthermore, term expansion was associated with improvement in system performance, and the use of the narrative field in the TREC-COVID topics was associated with decreased system performance in both rounds. These findings emphasize the need for clear queries in search. While our study has some limitations in its generalizability and scope of techniques analyzed, we identified some IR techniques that may be useful in building search systems for COVID-19 using the TREC-COVID test collections.","Chen, Jimmy S; Hersh, William R",J Biomed Inform,577,16

Immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in hemodialyzed patients was not addressed by the phase 3 clinical trials leading to their emergency approval. Design, setting, participants, and measurementsWe performed a prospective, longitudinal, cohort analysis of 156 hemodialyzed patients and 143 age-matched controls scheduled for BTN162b2 vaccine. Excluded from analysis were five patients previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, three sero-positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 N, two dropouts and two deaths. ELISA was used to quantify anti-full-length Spike IgG, IgM and IgA levels in sera collected at day of the first vaccine dose (t0); 3 weeks later (day of the second dose, t1); and 3 weeks after the second inoculation (t2). ResultsSeroconversion after the first vaccine dose (t1) was remarkably low in patients, with positivity for anti-spike IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies of 29.4%, 12% and 41%, respectively. The second vaccine dose raised seroconversion to 90.9% and 83.9% for IgG and IgA, respectively, while IgM positivity remained unchanged. At t1 the anti-Spike IgG level was significantly lower in patients with ages below 70 years when compared to age-matched controls, showing a profile similar to aged individuals (above 70 years). Immunosuppression was associated with lower antibody responses along the vaccine schedule (p=0.005 at t1; p=0.008 at t2). Noteworthy, previous unresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccination (75/129, 58% of patients negative for anti-HBs antibodies) did not correlate with humoral unresponsiveness to BTN162b2. Other clinical and laboratory parameters had marginal correlations with response to vaccination. ConclusionsThe large majority of hemodialyzed patients showed IgG seroconversion upon BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination but a sizable proportion of patients presented poor responses. These results support further investigation into the relationship between vaccination, serologic response and host protection.","Weigert, André; Bergman, Marie-Louise; Gonçalves, Ligia; Godinho, Iolanda; Duarte, Nádia; Abrantes, Rita; Borges, Patrícia; Brennand, Ana; Malheiro, Vanessa; Matoso, Paula; Akpogheneta, Onome; Kosack, Lindsay; Cruz, Pedro; Nogueira, Estela; Pereira, Magda; Ferreira, Ana; Marques, Marco; Nunes, Telmo; Viana, João; Demengeot, Jocelyne; Penha-Gonçalves, Carlos",,577,20

Hence, the Saudi Oncology Pharmacy Assembly has issued recommendations to reduce the frequency of cancer patients' visits to oncology centers during the pandemic while maintaining the access to cancer therapy and minimize the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative methodological approach was conducted in April 2020 using a virtual panel discussion for collection of recommendations. RESULTS: A total of 12 expert oncology pharmacy practitioners shared their knowledge and experiences in managing oncology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants recognized many fundamental recommendations that were already applied in many cancer centers since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. On that basis, the panelists developed eight practice-related recommendations for action, with a main focus on cancer treatment modification. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, delivering cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic carries significant challenges. This paper addressed suggestions to properly manage cancer patients during difficult times. Implementing changes in practice mandates a national collaborative effort from different sectors to guarantee the quality and continuity of care. The SOPA expert panel developed these recommendations, to ultimately contribute in maintaining access to cancer therapy while minimizing the risk of COVID-19 exposure.","Alshamrani, Majed; AlHarbi, Atika; Alkhudair, Nora; AlNajjar, Fouad; Khan, Mansoor; Obaid, Abdulaziz Ben; Khardaly, Amr; Bajnaid, Eshtyag; Samarkandi, Hadeel; AlAzmi, Aeshah; Alabdali, Salman; AlNahedh, Mohammed",J Oncol Pharm Pract,577,27

Medical educators needed to flexibly and quickly cater learning to the evolving landscape.A three-hour teaching session was devised to be delivered to 50 students online via Microsoft Teams&#8482; and facilitated by five general practice tutors in groups of 10, prior to students' GP placements. In pre-assigned pairs, students undertook two role-play scenarios for the main remote modalities of telephone and video-consultations. E-consultations were explored via discussion of simulated encounters. The authentic technology pertinent to each modality was used; this included a training version of NHS Scotland's Near Me IT platform for video-consultations, the students' own mobile phones for telephone consultations and simulated PDFs generated using the e-consultation facility. Teaching was evaluated via a student focus group pre and post placement.Student feedback was positive. The session prepared them for their placement and increased their confidence. They suggested this teaching be incorporated earlier in the medical school curriculum. They appreciated learning with the same IT platforms used on placement. Some students had no prior experience of remote consultations and subsequently were expected to undertake independent remote consultations almost immediately upon arrival.Careful design of challenging scenarios mirroring common GP presentations via remote modalities can increase student preparedness and confidence prior to GP placements during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cannon, Philip; Lumsden, Linzi; Wass, Valerie",Educ Prim Care,577,16

After the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020, the number of confirmed cases and deaths has continued to increase. This situation may be prolonged until an effective, tested, and safe treatment is available. COVID-19 can occur at any age. However, the maximum confirmed cases and deaths have occurred among the elderly. Particularly, the mental and physical health of the elderly aged above 60 and classified as high-risk groups is more vulnerable than other age groups, requiring more attention. Strong social restraint, social distancing, and quarantine measures to prevent the COVID-19 spread have raised concerns about their mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and identify the psychological concepts and protective factors that support and constitute these guidelines and strategies and prepare practical suggestions and guidelines to protect the mental health of the elderly during COVID-19. These discussions will facilitate a deeper understanding and expansion of these guidelines and strategies. Therefore, this study explores factors-including pandemic-induced stress, self-integration, self-efficacy, and resilience-in order to prepare practical and detailed suggestions and guidelines using studies that considered these factors, including coping with COVID-19-induced stress, social support, and physical activity.","Lee, Kunho; Jeong, Goo-Churl; Yim, JongEun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),577,23

The parameters of the model are estimated using an optimisation scheme and some known results from the theory of monotone systems such that the model output agrees with some collected data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To highlight the strengths of this framework, a few case studies are presented in which different populations are subjected to different containment strategies. They include cases in which the containment policies switch between scenarios with different levels of severity. Then a case study on herd immunity due to vaccination is presented. And then it is shown how we can use this framework to optimally distribute a limited number of vaccine units in a given population to maximise their impact and reduce the total number of infectious individuals.","Bokharaie, Vahid S",PLoS One,577,30

Humans possess high sensitivity even to a coarse face scheme, seeing faces in non-face images where real faces do not exist. The advantage of non-face images is that single components do not trigger face processing. Here by implementing a novel set of Face-n-Thing images, we examined (i) how face tuning alters with changing display orientation, and (ii) whether it is affected by observers' gender. Young females and males were presented with a set of Face-n-Thing images either with canonical upright orientation or inverted 180° in the image plane. Face impression was substantially impeded by display inversion. Furthermore, whereas with upright display orientation, no gender differences were found, with inversion, Face-n-Thing images elicited face impression in females significantly more often. The outcome sheds light on the origins of the face inversion effect in general. Moreover, the findings open a way for examination of face sensitivity and underwriting brain networks in neuropsychiatric conditions related to the current pandemic (such as depression and anxiety), most of which are gender/sex-specific.","Pavlova, Marina A; Romagnano, Valentina; Fallgatter, Andreas J; Sokolov, Alexander N",PLoS One,577,24

Current game character customization systems either require players to manually adjust considerable face attributes to obtain the desired face, or have limited freedom of facial shape and texture. In this paper, we propose an automatic character face creation method that predicts both facial shape and texture from a single portrait, and it can be integrated into most existing 3D games. Although 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) based methods can restore accurate 3D faces from single images, the topology of 3DMM mesh is different from the meshes used in most games. To acquire fidelity texture, existing methods require a large amount of face texture data for training, while building such datasets is time-consuming and laborious. Besides, such a dataset collected under laboratory conditions may not generalized well to in-the-wild situations. To tackle these problems, we propose 1) a low-cost facial texture acquisition method, 2) a shape transfer algorithm that can transform the shape of a 3DMM mesh to games, and 3) a new pipeline for training 3D game face reconstruction networks. The proposed method not only can produce detailed and vivid game characters similar to the input portrait, but can also eliminate the influence of lighting and occlusions. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods used in games.","Lin, Jiangke; Yuan, Yi; Zou, Zhengxia",,577,2

In general, the development of objective, fast, and accurate automatic methods for LUS data evaluation is still at an early stage. This is particularly true for COVID-19 diagnostic. In this article, we propose an automatic and unsupervised method for the detection and localization of the pleural line in LUS data based on the hidden Markov model and Viterbi Algorithm. The pleural line localization step is followed by a supervised classification procedure based on the support vector machine (SVM). The classifier evaluates the healthiness level of a patient and, if present, the severity of the pathology, i.e., the score value for each image of a given LUS acquisition. The experiments performed on a variety of LUS data acquired in Italian hospitals with both linear and convex probes highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method. The average overall accuracy in detecting the pleura is 84% and 94% for convex and linear probes, respectively. The accuracy of the SVM classification in correctly evaluating the severity of COVID-19 related pleural line alterations is about 88% and 94% for convex and linear probes, respectively. The results as well as the visualization of the detected pleural line and the predicted score chart, provide a significant support to medical staff for further evaluating the patient condition.","Carrer, Leonardo; Donini, Elena; Marinelli, Daniele; Zanetti, Massimo; Mento, Federico; Torri, Elena; Smargiassi, Andrea; Inchingolo, Riccardo; Soldati, Gino; Demi, Libertario; Bovolo, Francesca; Bruzzone, Lorenzo",IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control,577,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study comprised 75 individuals aged 18 to 65. The main group included 40 patients with a diagnosis of dental periimplantitis (ICD K 10.2). A comparison group (n=20) included patients after dental implantation without postoperative complications. The control group (n=25) consisted of individuals without dental pathology. Cathepsin K (CTSK) (Human) ELISA Kit (Cloud-Clone Corp., USA) was used to determine the concentration of cathepsin K by the enzyme immunoassay in the gingival or peri-implant fluid. RESULTS: The concentration of cathepsin K in the gingival fluid in the patients of the control group was 1.7±0.3 pmol/l, in the comparison group the concentration of the studied biomarker corresponded to 2.3±0.4 pmol/l. In the main group, the concentration of cathepsin K in the exudate of peri-implantation pockets increased 2.8 times (p<0.05) and corresponded to 4.9±0.5 pmol/l. The concentration of cathepsin K in the gingival fluid normally did not depend on age and gender, which increased the independence of the osteomarker for characterizing the osteoresorbent process in the peri-implantation area. After dental implantation, an excess of cathepsin K concentration above the level of 2.7 pmol/l with a diagnostic sensitivity of 82.5% and a specificity of 83.7% suggests a high risk of developing peri-implantitis. CONCLUSION: The concentration of cathepsin K may be seen as valuable marker for local inflammatory and destructive processes in the contents of the peri-implantation area.","Zorina, O A; Amkhadova, M A; Boriskina, O A; Aleskerov, E Sh; Polyakov, V M",Stomatologiia (Mosk),577,24

This covers the first and the second waves in Jordan. The data were obtained from both the Jordanian Ministry of health and the Jordan Metrological Department. In this work, the Spearman correlation test was used for data analysis, since the normality assumption was not fulfilled. It was found that the most effective weather parameters on the active cases of COVID-19 in the initial wave transmission was the average daily solar radiation (r = - 0.503; p = 0.000), while all other tests for other parameters failed. In the second wave of COVID-19 transmission, it was found that the most effective weather parameter on the active cases of COVID-19 was the maximum temperature (r = 0.394; p = 0.028). This was followed by wind speed (r = 0.477; p = 0.007), pressure (r = - 0.429; p = 0.016), and average daily solar radiation (r = - 0.757; p = 0.000). Furthermore, the independent variable importance of multilayer perceptron showed that wind speed has a direct relationship with active cases. Conversely, areas characterized by low values of pressure and daily solar radiation exposure have a high rate of infection. Finally, a global sensitivity analysis using Sobol analysis showed that daily solar radiation has a high rate of active cases that support the virus' survival in both wave transmissions.","Abdelhafez, Eman; Dabbour, Loai; Hamdan, Mohammad",,577,19

As for now, there are still no really effective therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Some evidences suggest that tocilizumab (TCZ) may avoid the progression of severe COVID-19. The aim of this retrospective case-control study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of TCZ in patients with COVID-19 ARDS undergoing noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV). METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and worsening acute respiratory failure (ARF) were admitted to the Pulmonology Unit of Azienda USL of Reggio Emilia-IRCCS. All patients were inflamed (elevated CRP and IL-6 levels) and received NIV at admission according to the presence of a pO2/FiO2 ratio &#8804; 200 mmHg. The possibility of being treated with TCZ depended on the drug availability. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality rate. A secondary composite outcome of worsening was represented by the patients who died in the pulmonology unit or were intubated. RESULTS: Out of 79 patients, 41 were treated with TCZ. Twenty-eight patients received intravenous (IV) TCZ and 13 patients received subcutaneous (SC) TCZ. In-hospital overall mortality rate was 38% (30/79 patients). The probabilities of dying and being intubated during the follow-up using Kaplan-Meier method were significantly lower in total patients treated with TCZ compared to those of patients not treated with TCZ (log-rank p value = 0.006 and 0.036, respectively). However, using Cox multivariate analyses adjusted for age and Charlson comorbidity index only the association with the reduced risk of being intubated or dying maintained the significance (HR 0.44, 95%CI 0.22-0.89, p = 0.022). Two patients treated with TCZ developed cavitating lung lesions during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that TCZ treatment may be effective in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory impairment receiving NIV. More data on safety are required. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these results.","Menzella, Francesco; Fontana, Matteo; Salvarani, Carlo; Massari, Marco; Ruggiero, Patrizia; Scelfo, Chiara; Barbieri, Chiara; Castagnetti, Claudia; Catellani, Chiara; Gibellini, Giorgia; Falco, Francesco; Ghidoni, Giulia; Livrieri, Francesco; Montanari, Gloria; Casalini, Eleonora; Piro, Roberto; Mancuso, Pamela; Ghidorsi, Luca; Facciolongo, Nicola",Crit Care,577,1

COVID-19 infection has been observed with a high mortality rate especially in patients undergoing maintenance haemodialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients over 18 years of age, who underwent a maintenance haemodialysis program at our unit, and being tested positive for COVID-19 by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs and/or were observed to have disease-related signs in their CTs were included in the study. RESULTS: In this study, 23 of 42 patients receiving haemodialysis support in our clinic were included. The median age was 67 years (min 35; max 91 years) and all of them had primary hypertension and other comorbidities. Their clinical evaluation showed that dry cough (47.8%) and shortness of breath (47.8%) were the most common symptoms. Fever was less pronounced (30.4%). The median time from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 1 day (min 0; max ) and time from hospitalization to death was 18 days (min:1; max 22). Transfer from the inpatient ward to ICU took a median of 7 days (min 1; max 13). Among the 23 patients, three died during the follow-up and 20 were discharged with full recovery. Baseline ferritin, procalcitonin levels and CRP/albumin rates higher and neutrophil/lymphocyte levels lower in patient who died. In these patients, despite being non-significant, there were more diabetic patients and D-dimer levels were higher than 1000 ugFEU/L. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection is associated with increased mortalit in chronic kidney diseases patients.

The purpose of this study was to report transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) findings in SARS-CoV-2 patients with correlating troponin and D-dimer levels. METHODS: We identified 66 SARS-CoV-2 patients (mean age 60 ± 15.7 years) admitted within a large, eight-hospital healthcare system over a 6-week period with a TTE performed. TTE readers were blinded to laboratory data with intra-observer and inter-observer analysis assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-six of 1780 SARS-CoV-2 patients were included and represented a high-risk population as 38 (57.6%) were ICU-admitted, 47 (71.2%) had elevated D-dimer, 41 (62.1%) had elevated troponin, and 25 (37.9%) died. Right ventricular (RV) dilation was present in 49 (74.2%) patients. The incidence and average D-dimer elevation was similar between moderate/severe vs. mild/no RV dilation (69.6% vs 67.6%, P = 1.0; 3736 ± 2986 vs 4141 ± 3351 ng/mL, P = .679). Increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness was present in 46 (69.7%) with similar incidence of elevated troponin and average troponin levels compared to normal wall thickness (66.7% vs 52.4%, P = .231; 0.88 ± 1.9 vs 1.36 ± 2.4 ng/mL, P = .772). LV dilation was rare (n = 6, 9.1%), as was newly reduced LV ejection fraction (n = 2, 3.0%). CONCLUSION: TTE in SARS-CoV-2 patients is scarce, technically difficult, and reserved for high-risk patients. RV dilation is common in SARS-CoV-2 but does not correlate with elevated D-dimer levels. Increased LV wall thickness is common, while newly reduced LV ejection fraction is rare, and neither correlates with troponin levels.","Schott, Jason P; Mertens, Amy N; Bloomingdale, Richard; O039,; Connell, Thomas F; Gallagher, Michael J; Dixon, Simon; Abbas, Amr E",Echocardiography,577,6

This relies on individuals' adoption of protective behaviors, their perceived risk, and the use and trust of information sources. During a health emergency, receiving timely and accurate information enables individuals to take appropriate actions to protect themselves, shaping their risk perception. Italy was the first western country plagued by COVID-19 and one of the most affected in the early phase. During this period, we surveyed 2,223 Italians before the national lockdown. A quarter of the sample perceived COVID-19 less threatening than flu and would not vaccinate, if a vaccine was available. Besides, most people perceived containment measures, based on social distancing or wearing masks, not useful. This perceived utility was related to COVID-19 threat perception and efficacy beliefs. All these measures were associated with the use of media and their truthfulness: participants declared to mainly use the Internet, while health organizations' websites were the most trusted. Although social networks were frequently used, they were rated lower for trustfulness. Our data differ from those obtained in other community samples, suggesting the relevance to explore changes across different countries and during the different phases of the pandemic. Understanding these phenomena, and how people access the media, may contribute to improve the efficacy of containment measures, tailoring specific policies and health communications.","Vai, Benedetta; Cazzetta, Silvia; Ghiglino, Davide; Parenti, Lorenzo; Saibene, Giacomo; Toti, Michelle; Verga, Chiara; Wykowska, Agnieszka; Benedetti, Francesco",Front Psychol,577,14

In particular, the review focuses on ongoing checkpoint inhibitor combination trials and promising studies combining tyrosine kinase inhibitors with checkpoint inhibitors. Recent Findings: The recently approved combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab based on the IMbrave150 trial has shown the most potential with the highest overall survival of any systemic agent in HCC to date, surpassing sorafenib. Despite COVID-19 delays, other promising trials that involve combining VEGF-directed therapy and checkpoint inhibition, cancer vaccines, phosphatidylserine, YIV-906, and oncolytic and immunotherapeutic vaccinia virus are actively recruiting patients. Summary: After almost a 10-year dormancy, the list of potential systemic treatment options for aHCC is growing rapidly. Given the promising data from the IMbrave150 trial, the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab is now the new first-line therapy. We discuss the change in landscape, the new second- and third-line systemic treatments in aHCC, and the ongoing clinical trials for newer agents including combination therapies.","Aitcheson, Gabriella; Pillai, Anjana; Dahman, Bassam; John, Binu V",Curr Hepatol Rep,577,29

In the absence of specific antiviral medicines to prevent or treat COVID-19, it is essential to detect the infected patients at an early stage and immediately isolate them from the healthy population. In view of the advantages of sensitivity and high spatial resolution, CT imaging has played an important role in screening and diagnosing of COVID-19 in China. The radiologic technologists performing CT scans for the infected patients become high-risk medical care personnel. It is critical for the radiology department to ensure the personal safety of radiologic technologists and avoid cross-infection. In this review article, we describe the systematic strategies to combat COVID-19 from the radiology department in Tongji hospital in Wuhan, P.R.

We use a model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission to estimate the health impact of different exit strategies. The strategy adopted in Italy kept the reproduction number Rt at values close to one until the end of September, with marginal regional differences. Based on the estimated postlockdown transmissibility, reopening of workplaces in selected industrial activities might have had a minor impact on the transmissibility. Reopening educational levels in May up to secondary schools might have influenced SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility only marginally; however, including high schools might have resulted in a marked increase of the disease burden. Earlier reopening would have resulted in disproportionately higher hospitalization incidence.

While the knowledge generated by many research activities has been directly incorporated into the current generation of pandemic plans, scientists and policymakers are yet to capitalise fully on the potential for near real-time analytics to formally contribute to epidemic decision-making. Theoretical studies demonstrate that it is now possible to make robust estimates of pandemic impact in the earliest stages of a pandemic using first few hundred household cohort (FFX) studies and algorithms designed specifically for analysing FFX data. Pandemic plans already recognise the importance of both situational awareness i.e., knowing pandemic impact and its key drivers, and the need for pandemic special studies and related analytic methods for estimating these drivers. An important next step is considering how information from these situational assessment activities can be integrated into the decision-making processes articulated in pandemic planning documents. Here we introduce a decision support tool that directly uses outputs from FFX algorithms to present recommendations on response options, including a quantification of uncertainty, to decision makers. We illustrate this approach using response information from within the Australian influenza pandemic plan.","Shearer, Freya M; Moss, Robert; Price, David J; Zarebski, Alexander E; Ballard, Peter G; McVernon, Jodie; Ross, Joshua V; McCaw, James M",Epidemics,577,1

In addition to facilitating fusion needed for viral entry, S can also drive cell-cell fusion, a pathogenic effect observed in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. While several studies have investigated S requirements involved in viral particle entry, examination of S stability and factors involved in S cell-cell fusion remain limited. A furin cleavage site at the border between the S1 and S2 subunits (S1/S2) has been identified, along with putative cathepsin L and transmembrane serine protease 2 cleavage sites within S2. We demonstrate that S must be processed at the S1/S2 border in order to mediate cell-cell fusion and that mutations at potential cleavage sites within the S2 subunit alter S processing at the S1/S2 border, thus preventing cell-cell fusion. We also identify residues within the internal fusion peptide and the cytoplasmic tail that modulate S-mediated cell-cell fusion. In addition, we examined S stability and protein cleavage kinetics in a variety of mammalian cell lines, including a bat cell line related to the likely reservoir species for SARS-CoV-2, and provide evidence that proteolytic processing alters the stability of the S trimer. This work therefore offers insight into S stability, proteolytic processing, and factors that mediate S cell-cell fusion, all of which help give a more comprehensive understanding of this high-profile therapeutic target.","Barrett, Chelsea T; Neal, Hadley E; Edmonds, Kearstin; Moncman, Carole L; Thompson, Rachel; Branttie, Jean M; Boggs, Kerri Beth; Wu, Cheng-Yu; Leung, Daisy W; Dutch, Rebecca E",J Biol Chem,577,16

SETTING: Women's healthcare units in the National Health Service. POPULATION: Junior doctors in obstetrics and gynaecology. METHODS: Participants were interviewed by members of the UK Audit and Research in Obstetrics and Gynaecology trainees' collaborative between 28 March and 7 April 2020. We used a quantitative analysis for closed-ended questions and a thematic framework analysis for open comments. RESULTS: We received responses from 148/155 units (95%), most of the participants were in years 3-7 of training (121/148, 82%). Most completed specific training drills for managing obstetric and gynaecological emergencies in women with COVID-19 (89/148, 60.1%) and two-person donning and doffing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (96/148, 64.9%).

Even with its importance, very limited biophysical studies are available on the N protein because of its high level of disorder, high propensity for aggregation, and high susceptibility for autoproteolysis. Here, we successfully prepare the N protein and a 1000-nucleotide fragment of viral RNA in large quantities and purity suitable for biophysical studies. A combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques demonstrates that the N protein is partially disordered and consists of an independently folded RNA-binding domain and a dimerization domain, flanked by disordered linkers. The protein assembles as a tight dimer with a dimerization constant of sub-micromolar but can also form transient interactions with other N proteins, facilitating larger oligomers. NMR studies on the â¼100-kDa dimeric protein identify a specific domain that binds 1-1000-nt RNA and show that the N-RNA complex remains highly disordered. Analytical ultracentrifugation, isothermal titration calorimetry, multiangle light scattering, and cross-linking experiments identify a heterogeneous mixture of complexes with a core corresponding to at least 70 dimers of N bound to 1-1000 RNA. In contrast, very weak binding is detected with a smaller construct corresponding to the RNA-binding domain using similar experiments. A model that explains the importance of the bivalent structure of N to its binding on multivalent sites of the viral RNA is presented.","Forsythe, Heather M; Rodriguez Galvan, Joaquin; Yu, Zhen; Pinckney, Seth; Reardon, Patrick; Cooley, Richard B; Zhu, Phillip; Rolland, Amber D; Prell, James S; Barbar, Elisar",Biophys J,577,1

Information on cardiac injury is scarce. We aimed to evaluate cardiovascular damage in patients with COVID-19 and determine the correlation of high-sensitivity cardiac-specific troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We included 872 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 from February to April 2020. We tested 651 patients for high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and 506 for NT-proBNP on admission. Cardiac injury was defined as hs-TnT > 14ng/L, the upper 99th percentile. Levels of NT-proBNP > 300 pg/mL were considered related to some extent of cardiac injury. The primary composite endpoint was 30-day mortality or mechanical ventilation (MV). RESULTS: Cardiac injury by hs-TnT was observed in 34.6% of our COVID-19 patients. Mortality or MV were higher in cardiac injury than noncardiac injury patients (39.1% vs 9.1%). Hs-TnT and NT-proBNP levels were independent predictors of death or MV (HR, 2.18; 95%CI, 1.23-3.83 and 1.87 (95%CI, 1.05-3.36), respectively) and of mortality alone (HR, 2.91; 95%CI, 1.211-7.04 and 5.47; 95%CI, 2.10-14.26, respectively). NT-ProBNP significantly improved the troponin model discrimination of mortality or MV (C-index 0.83 to 0.84), and of mortality alone (C-index 0.85 to 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury measured at admission was a common finding in patients with COVID-19. It reliably predicted the occurrence of mortality and need of MV, the most severe complications of the disease. NT-proBNP improved the prognostic accuracy of hs-TnT.","Calvo-Fernández, Alicia; Izquierdo, Andrea; Subirana, Isaac; Farré, Nuria; Vila, Joan; Durán, Xavier; García-Guimaraes, Marcos; Valdivielso, Sandra; Cabero, Paula; Soler, Cristina; García-Ribas, Cora; Rodríguez, Clara; Llagostera, Marc; Mojón, Diana; Vicente, Miren; Solé-González, Eduard; Sánchez-Carpintero, Andrea; Tevar, Cristina; Marrugat, Jaume; Vaquerizo, Beatriz",Rev. esp. cardiol.

Confinement at home during the COVID-19 crisis could have major implications on mental health and alcohol use behaviors among the whole population. The present study focuses on the role of individual characteristics, contextual factors, and mental health variables on alcohol consumption. A sample of 2871 adults (79% women) were recruited from the general population through an online self-report questionnaire. Sociodemographic data, lockdown conditions, occupational/physical activity, proximity of contamination, mental health (anxiety, depression, and intolerance of uncertainty), and alcohol consumption (frequency, quantity, and changes) have been assessed. Among participants, 49.1% of the population reported stable alcohol consumption, 24.5% reported a decreased in alcohol consumption since the beginning of the lockdown and 26.4% reported an increase in consumption. Our findings indicate that those individuals who increased their alcohol consumption during the lockdown are often older, working from home, more likely to have children, higher educated, and consume alcohol more frequently and in higher quantities. They also have a greater proximity to contamination and higher levels of anxiety and depression. Our results are discussed in terms of preventive implications.","Schmits, E; Glowacz, F",Int J Ment Health Addict,577,16

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study of children 1 month to 21 years admitted March 14 to May 2, 2020, to 9 New York City pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. RESULTS: Of 70 children admitted to PICUs, median age was 15 (IQR 9, 19) years; 61.4% male; 38.6% Hispanic; 32.9% black; and 74.3% with comorbidities. Fever (72.9%) and cough (71.4%) were the common presenting symptoms. Twelve patients (17%) met severe sepsis criteria; 14 (20%) required vasopressor support; 21 (30%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); 9 (12.9%) met acute kidney injury criteria; 1 (1.4%) required renal-replacement therapy, and 2 (2.8%) had cardiac arrest. For treatment, 27 (38.6%) patients received hydroxychloroquine; 13 (18.6%) remdesivir; 23 (32.9%) corticosteroids; 3 (4.3%) tocilizumab; and 1 (1.4%) anakinra; no patient was given immunoglobulin or convalescent plasma. Forty-nine (70%) patients required respiratory support: 14 (20.0%) noninvasive mechanical ventilation, 20 (28.6%) invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 7 (10%) prone position, 2 (2.8%) inhaled nitric oxide, and 1 (1.4%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Nine (45%) of the 20 patients requiring IMV were extubated by day 14 with median IMV duration of 218 (IQR 79, 310.4) hours. Presence of ARDS was significantly associated with duration of PICU and hospital stay, and lower probability of PICU and hospital discharge at hospital day 14 (P < .05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill children with COVID-19 predominantly are adolescents, have comorbidities, and require some form of respiratory support.

There is scarce information about the performance of those visits. AIM: to compare telephone visits during the COVID-19 lockdown period with previous in-person visits. DESIGN: retrospective descriptive study. METHODS: telephone visits from 15 March to 31 May 2020 were compared with in-person visits during the same period in 2019. MAIN MEASURES: the proportions of both groups were compared in term of failure to contact patient, requested diagnostic tests/referrals, discharges, admissions, and emergency visits within 30-60 days. A sample of patients, and all participating physicians completed surveys. Z-score test was used (statistical significance p < 0.05). RESULTS: 5602 telephone visits were conducted. In comparison to in-person visits, telephone visits showed higher rates of visit compliance (95.9% vs 85.2%, p < 0.001) and discharges (22.12% vs 11.82%; p < 0.001), and lower number of ancillary tests and referrals. During the 30-day and 60-day period following the telephone visit a reduction of 52% and 47% in the combined number of emergency department visits and hospital admissions was observed compared to in-person visits (p < 0.01). Of the 120 patients surveyed, 95% were satisfied/very satisfied with the telephone visits. Of the 26 physicians, 84.6% considered telephone visits were useful to prioritise patients. CONCLUSIONS: during health emergencies, previously scheduled outpatient in-person visits can be converted to telephone visits, reducing absenteeism, increasing the rate of discharges, and reducing ancillary tests and referrals without increasing the rate of hospital admissions or emergency department visits.s.","Martos Pérez, Francisco; Dolores Martín Escalante, María; Olalla Sierra, Julián; Luis Prada Pardal, José; Dolores García de Lucas, María; González Vega, Rocío; Jiménez Puente, Alberto; García-Alegría, Javier",QJM,577,16

In the image classification domain, generalization can be assessed through accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Explainability can be assessed by how well the model localizes the object of interest within an image. However, both generalization and explainability through localization are degraded in scenarios with significant overlap between classes. We propose a method based on binary expert networks that enhances the explainability of image classifications through better localization by mitigating the model uncertainty induced by class overlap. Our technique performs discriminative localization on images that contain features with significant class overlap, without explicitly training for localization. Our method is particularly promising in real-world class overlap scenarios, such as COVID-19 and pneumonia, where expertly labeled data for localization is not readily available. This can be useful for early, rapid, and trustworthy screening for COVID-19.","Verenich, Edward; Velasquez, Alvaro; Khan, Nazar; Hussain, Faraz",,577,26

Containment strategies and local cognition regarding pandemic might be helpful to control vehicular movement. This study aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of containment strategies and local cognition for controlling traffic volume during COVID-19 pandemic in Dhaka, Bangladesh. METHOD: Six containment strategies were considered to explore their influence on traffic condition, including declaration of general holiday, closure of educational institution, deployment of force, restriction on religious gathering, closure of commercial activities, and closure of garments factories. Newspaper coverage and public concern about COVID-19 were considered as local cognition in this research. The month of Ramadan as a potential event was also taken into account considering it might have an impact on the overall situation. Average daily journey speed (ADJS) was calculated from real-time traffic data of Google Map to understand the vehicular traffic scenario of Dhaka. A multiple linear regression method was developed to comprehend the findings. RESULTS: The results showed that among the containment strategies, declaration of general holiday and closure of educational institutions could increase the ADJS significantly, thereby referring to less traffic movement. Besides, local cognition could not significantly affect the traffic condition, although the month of Ramadan could increase the ADJS significantly. CONCLUSION: It is expected that these findings would provide new insights into decision-making and help to take appropriate strategies to tackle the future pandemic situation.","Zafri, Niaz Mahmud; Afroj, Sadia; Ali, Mohammad Ashraf; Hasan, Md Musleh Uddin; Rahman, Md Hamidur",PLoS One,577,11

With limited therapeutic options, the identification of safe and effective therapeutics is urgently needed. The repurposing of known clinical compounds holds the potential for rapid identification of drugs effective against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we utilized a library of FDA-approved and well-studied preclinical and clinical compounds to screen for antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in human pulmonary epithelial cells. We identified 13 compounds that exhibit potent antiviral activity across multiple orthogonal assays. Hits include known antivirals, compounds with anti-inflammatory activity, and compounds targeting host pathways such as kinases and proteases critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication. We identified seven compounds not previously reported to have activity against SARS-CoV-2, including B02, a human RAD51 inhibitor. We further demonstrated that B02 exhibits synergy with remdesivir, the only antiviral approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19, highlighting the potential for combination therapy. Taken together, our comparative compound screening strategy highlights the potential of drug repurposing screens to identify novel starting points for development of effective antiviral mono- or combination therapies to treat COVID-19.","Biering, Scott B; Van Dis, Erik; Wehri, Eddie; Yamashiro, Livia H; Nguyenla, Xammy; Dugast-Darzacq, Claire; Graham, Thomas G W; Stroumza, Julien R; Golovkine, Guillaume R; Roberts, Allison W; Fines, Daniel M; Spradlin, Jessica N; Ward, Carl C; Bajaj, Teena; Dovala, Dustin; Schulze-Gamen, Ursula; Bajaj, Ruchika; Fox, Douglas M; Ott, Melanie; Murthy, Niren; Nomura, Daniel K; Schaletzky, Julia; Stanley, Sarah A",ACS infect. dis,577,16

Here we report a new approach, called DREAM-in-CDM (Drug Repurposing Effort Applying Integrated Modeling-in vitro/vivo-Clinical Data Mining), to identify an FDA-approved drug suitable for use as an effective analgesic targeting mPGES-1. The DREAM-in-CDM approach consists of three steps: computational screening of FDA-approved drugs; in vitro and/or in vivo assays; and clinical data mining. By using the DREAM-in-CDM approach, lapatinib has been identified as a promising mPGES-1 inhibitor which may have significant anti-inflammatory effects to relieve various forms of pain and possibly treat various inflammation conditions involved in other inflammation-related diseases such as the lung inflammation caused by the newly identified COVID-19. We anticipate that the DREAM-in-CDM approach will be used to repurpose FDA-approved drugs for various new therapeutic indications associated with new targets.","Zhou, Shuo; Zhou, Ziyuan; Ding, Kai; Yuan, Yaxia; Loftin, Charles; Zheng, Fang; Zhan, Chang-Guo",Sci Rep,577,16

In this study, we describe a simple technique to quantify this pathology via sonography. METHODS: Thirty-six shoulders from 18 patients with ac joint instabilities were examined using modified Alexander views and a standardized sonographic examination. On the Alexander views, overlap of acromion and clavicle (OLAC), glenoid center to posterior clavicle distance (GCPC), and lateral extension (LE) were measured. Afterwards, the results were analyzed and compared with sonography. Posterior translation of the clavicle and the difference of translation between healthy and injured shoulder were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 39 ± 14 years (range 19-61 years). We included 4 (22%) Rockwood type 3, 1 (6%) Rockwood type 4, and 13 (72%) Rockwood type 5 lesions. Four (22%) patients were female and 14 (78%) male patients. Posterior clavicle translation of the injured shoulder correlated strongly between OLAC and sonography (r = -0.514, P = .029), and the difference of translation between healthy and injured shoulder correlated very strongly between LE and sonography (r = 0.737, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The sonographic measurement technique for horizontal instability presented in this work could help detect horizontal instabilities. While the observation of dynamic horizontal displacement is a strength of this technique, measurements are hindered in cases of high coracoclavicular distances. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-retrospective cohort study.","Bockmann, Benjamin; Venjakob, Arne Johannes; Thrasyvoulidis, Giorgos; Holschen, Malte; Schulte, Tobias Ludger; Nebelung, Wolfgang",J. ultrasound med,577,24

This virus is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. This infection later spread to the whole world. The goal of this article is to present the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19 treated in the Faculty Hospital Pilsen. METHODS: In this monocentric, retrospective study, clinical and biochemical data of 89 adult patients with COVID-19 was analyzed. These patients were in the care of the Faculty Hospital Pilsen between March 14 and April 7. RESULTS: In this cohort, made up of 89 patients, 63 were treated as outpatients and 26 were hospitalized. 10 patients required intensive care. The most common symptoms among patients were cough and fever. Dyspnea was present in 29 patients. A CT scan showed bilateral pneumonia in 23 of the admitted patients. Fever and bilateral pneumonia were significantly more common in patients &#8805; 60 years old (p=0.047, and p=0.001, respectively). Of lab results, the patients in intensive care had significantly higher values of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin 6, myoglobin and ferritin. CONCLUSION: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough. These two symptoms are simultaneously present in more than half the cases. Approximately 1/10th of patients requires intensive care. Higher values of lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin and ferritin on patient admission appear to be a strong predictive factor of the patient's status progressing into requiring ICU attention.","Sín, Robin; Kubiska, Miroslav; Cmorej, Patrik Christian; Váchalová, Jana",Neuro Endocrinol Lett,577,22

COVID-19 may result in multiorgan failure and death. Early detection of patients at risk may allow triage and more intense monitoring. The aim of this study was to develop a simple, objective admission score, based on laboratory tests, that identifies patients who are likely going to deteriorate. Methods. This is a retrospective cohort study of all COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary academic medical center in New York City during the COVID-19 crisis in spring 2020. The primary combined endpoint included intubation, stage 3 acute kidney injury (AKI), or death. Laboratory tests available on admission in at least 70% of patients (and age) were included for univariate analysis. Tests that were statistically or clinically significant were then included in a multivariate binary logistic regression model using stepwise exclusion. 70% of all patients were used to train the model, and 30% were used as an internal validation cohort. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a model for COVID-19 severity based on biomarkers. Results. Out of 2545 patients, 833 (32.7%) experienced the primary endpoint. 53 laboratory tests were analyzed, and of these, 47 tests (and age) were significantly different between patients with and without the endpoint. The final multivariate model included age, albumin, creatinine, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. The area under the ROC curve was 0.850 (CI [95%]: 0.813, 0.889), with a sensitivity of 0.800 and specificity of 0.761. The probability of experiencing the primary endpoint can be calculated as p = e − 2.4475 + 0.02492 age − 0.6503 albumin + 0.81926 creat + 0.00388 CRP + 0.00143 LDH / 1 + e − 2.4475 + 0.02492 age − 0.6503 albumin + 0.81926 creat + 0.00388 CRP + 0.00143 LDH . Conclusions. Our study demonstrated that poor outcome in COVID-19 patients can be predicted with good sensitivity and specificity using a few laboratory tests. This is useful for identifying patients at risk during admission.

Pandemics share features that increase fear. While some fear can stimulate preventive health behaviors, extreme fear can lead to adverse psychological and behavioral response. The media play a major role shaping these responses. When dealing with a PHEIC, the authorities' communication strategies are embedded in a multilevel governance and a highly hierarchal system, which adds another layer of complexity. Carrying out more 'real-world research' is crucial to generate evidence relating to the psychosocial and behavioral aspects involved during the COVID-19 pandemic and how it is shaped by authorities and media discourses. Interdisciplinary research and international collaborations could contribute to improve our understanding and management of risk information. Emerging from a socio-ecological perspective, future research must integrate multilevel analytical elements, to ensure triangulation of evidence and co-constructing robust recommendations. A mixed-method approach should be privileged to address these issues. At the micro-level, a population-based survey could be conducted in various jurisdictions to assess and compare psychosocial issues according to sociocultural groups. Then, a quantitative/qualitative discourse analysis of the media could be performed. Finally, a network analysis could allow assessing how official information flows and circulates across levels of governance. The COVID-19 represents an opportunity to evaluate the impacts of information/communication strategy and misinformation on various cultural and socioeconomic groups, providing important lessons that could be applied to future health emergencies and disasters.","Généreux, Mélissa; David, Marc D; O039,; Sullivan, Tracey; Carignan, Marie-Ève; Blouin-Genest, Gabriel; Champagne-Poirier, Olivier; Champagne, Éric; Burlone, Nathalie; Qadar, Zeeshan; Herbosa, Teodoro; Hung, Kevin; Ribeiro-Alves, Gleisse; Arruda, Horacio; Michel, Pascal; Law, Ron; Poirier, Alain; Murray, Virginia; Chan, Emily; Roy, Mathieu",Health promot. internation,577,1

However, testing isn't a simple yes/no answer as the target and host are complex, the virus is a moving target, there is a plethora of tests that identify different parts of the virus and have their own limits and range of detection, and when prevalence is low, false positives and negatives can be very high.Areas covered: This article covers all the major questions related to COVID-19 diagnostics, the why, when, where, who, what and how of testing, the different types of tests, interpretation of results and the ideal ASSURED-SQVM diagnostic.

In the wobbler mouse, a model for human motor neuron (MN) disease, reduction in the levels of Vps54 causes neurodegeneration. However, it is unclear how disruption of the GARP complex leads to MN dysfunction. To better understand the role of Vps54 in MNs, we have disrupted expression of the Vps54 ortholog in Drosophila and examined the impact on the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Surprisingly, we show that both null mutants and MN-specific knockdown of Vps54 leads to NMJ overgrowth. Reduction of Vps54 partially disrupts localization of the t-SNARE, Syntaxin-16, to the TGN but has no visible impact on endosomal pools. MN-specific knockdown of Vps54 in MNs combined with overexpression of the small GTPases Rab5, Rab7, or Rab11 suppresses the Vps54 NMJ phenotype. Conversely, knockdown of Vps54 combined with overexpression of dominant negative Rab7 causes NMJ and behavioral abnormalities including a decrease in postysynaptic Dlg and GluRIIB levels without any effect on GluRIIA. Taken together, these data suggest that Vps54 controls larval MN axon development and postsynaptic density composition through a mechanism that requires Rab7.","Patel, Prajal H; Wilkinson, Emily C; Starke, Emily L; McGimsey, Malea R; Blankenship, J Todd; Barbee, Scott A",,577,20

By infecting PK1 cells with these recombinant PDCoVs, we found that icDelNS6/nG elicited similar levels of type I IFN responses as icPDCoV, however icEnUmut stimulated robust type I IFN responses, demonstrating that the deltacoronavirus endoribonuclease, but not NS6, functions as an IFN antagonist in PK1 cells.

An online questionnaire, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), was submitted to Italian dental patients with items about their perceived risks when going to the dentist, concerns about continuing orthodontic treatment, and the onset of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Data were analyzed with a chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 1566 subjects completed the survey, including 486 who were under orthodontic treatment or who had a child in orthodontic treatment. A total of 866 participants (55.3%) thought the risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection was higher in a dental practice; this perception was associated with gender (women more than man), age (over 60 years old) and high levels of distress (P<0.001). However, 894 patients (57.1%) felt comfortable going back to the dentist. Most of the orthodontic patients (84%) would continue their treatment. After the lockdown, there was a slight increase in the frequency of TMD pain (356 versus 334). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the participants believed that the dental practice is a place at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, even if they continue to go to the dentist. Gender, age, and the level of distress were associated with the increase in the fear of going to the dentist due to COVID-19. Because of the pandemic, 16% of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment would not return to the dental practice to continue their orthodontic treatment after the lockdown. The prevalence of TMD pain in the population increased due to the pandemic.","Martina, Stefano; Amato, Alessandra; Faccioni, Paolo; Iandolo, Alfredo; Amato, Massimo; Rongo, Roberto",Prog Orthod,577,30

Deep neural networks have repeatedly been shown to be capable of constructing highly predictive models for disease detection directly from image data. However, their use in assisting clinicians has repeatedly hit a stumbling block due to their black-box nature. Some of this difficulty can be alleviated if predictions were accompanied by explanations expressed in clinically relevant terms. In this paper, deep neural networks are used to extract domain-specific features(morphological features like ground-glass opacity and disease indications like pneumonia) directly from the image data. Predictions about these features are then used to construct a symbolic model (a decision tree) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest X-rays, accompanied with two kinds of explanations: visual (saliency maps, derived from the neural stage), and textual (logical descriptions, derived from the symbolic stage). A radiologist rates the usefulness of the visual and textual explanations. Our results demonstrate that neural models can be employed usefully in identifying domain-specific features from low-level image data; that textual explanations in terms of clinically relevant features may be useful; and that visual explanations will need to be clinically meaningful to be useful.","Khincha, Rishab; Krishnan, Soundarya; Guru-Murthy, Krishnan; Dash, Tirtharaj; Vig, Lovekesh; Srinivasan, Ashwin",,577,26

Compared to adults, the most significant change in viral disease manifestation is encompassed by the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C is a new inflammatory syndrome which develops 2-4 weeks after COVID-19 exposure, with evidence suggesting it is a post-infectious immune reaction. We describe its epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis (which varies based on definition used) and treatment options based on published recommendations. A systematic literature search we conducted through MEDLINE yielded 518 abstracts and identified five studies that reported more than 100 cases of MIS-C and their mortality. Most cases developed multiorgan dysfunction, including cardiovascular, dermatologic, neurological, renal, and respiratory issues, and required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Many patients admitted to the ICU needed inotrope support and invasive mechanical ventilation, and the most severe cases required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Most clinicians treated MIS-C with intravenous immunoglobulin, systemic steroids, and biological therapies. Overall mortality was low (2-3%) in all studies. Further research is needed to: understand if early intervention can prevent its progression; optimize its treatment; and improve outcomes of this new syndrome for the patients who develop MIS-C.","Shioji, Naohiro; Aoyama, Kazuyoshi; Englesakis, Marina; Annich, Gail; Maynes, Jason T",J. anesth,577,1

In a pivotal study, a recently approved oral TRT only 26% of patients did not require any dose adjustment. Typically, patients start on a sub-therapeutic dose with gradual dose increases to attain efficacy resulting in additional visit(s) to clinic and pharmacy. Physician research data (N=402) suggested it typically takes 3-6 months of titrations to reach an efficacious dose for majority of patients, a significant barrier in effecting a switch without a period of “efficacy gap”. The requirement of additional visit(s) presents significant challenges for new and current patients desiring to start and to switch to a convenient TRT option, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Recent reports suggest increase of disease severity/mortality in men with low testosterone is possibly due to underlying co-morbidities commonly associated with male hypogonadism. There remains a need for an effective, safe, and easy to use and prescribe product that does not require dose titration. TLANDO is a “triglyceride-free” oral single strength TRT with single dose designed to lymphatically deliver effective and safe levels of testosterone regardless of meal fat content. Moreover, dose titration is prone to some inherent titration decision errors and requires understanding of often complex titration rules. The objective is to assess whether TLANDO, an oral TRT without requiring dose titration, safely restores effective testosterone (T) levels in hypogonadal men. An open-label, single-arm, multicenter study (NCT03242590) was performed with TLANDO in hypogonadal males (N=95). Subjects received orally 225 mg twice a day testosterone undecanoate (TU) for 24 days without dose adjustment. Efficacy was evaluated by % of subjects who achieved daily T Cavg within the eugonadal range. Using 450mg daily dose without dose adjustment, 80% of subjects (95% CI of 72% to 88%) achieved a T Cavg in the normal range and safely restored with mean T Cavg of 476±184 ng/dL post steady state. T restoration was comparable to other non-oral TRT products. TLANDO was well tolerated with no deaths, no drug-related severe AEs, and no hepatic AEs. In conclusion, effective T restoration using TLANDO, an easy to use and prescribe oral TRT option, was confirmed. Minimal AEs were reported with no hepatic AEs. Upon approval, TLANDO will be the first convenient TRT option without requiring dose adjustments;therefore, enabling selection of an efficacious dose from the start of therapy. TLANDO is well suited for new or existing TRT patients desiring a convenient oral option.","Papangkorn, Kongnara Vangara Kiran Bruno Benjamin J.; Kim, Kilyoung Chidambaram Nachiappan DelConte Anthony Patel Mahesh Carson Iii Culley C.; Goldstein, Irwin Kaminetsky Jed Miner Martin Khera Mohit Dobs Adrian Sandra",Journal of the Endocrine Society,577,26

This systematic review has two aims: to define the relationship between kinesiophobia and functional outcomes, pain and range of motion following TKR, and to evaluate published treatments for kinesiophobia following TKR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A primary search of electronic databases, grey literature, and trial registries was performed in March 2020. English-language studies recruiting adult primary TKR patients, using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) were included. Outcome measures were grouped into short (< 6 months), medium (6-12 months), and long term (> 12 months). Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort or case control studies, and the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool for randomised controlled trials. RESULTS: All thirteen included papers (82 identified) showed adequately low risk of methodological bias. TSK1 (activity avoidance) correlated with WOMAC functional score at 12 months in three studies (r = 0.20 p < 0.05, R = 0.317 p = 0.001, and correlation coefficient 0.197 p = 0.005). TSK score significantly correlated with mean active range of motion (ROM) at 2 weeks [65.98 (SD = 14.51) versus 47.35 (SD = 14.48) p = 0.000], 4 weeks [88.20 (SD = 15.11) versus 57.65 (SD = 14.80) p = 0.000], and 6 months [105.33 (SD = 12.34) versus 85.53 (SD = 14.77) p = 0.000] post-operation. Three post-operative interventions improved TSK score vs control following TKR: a home-based functional exercise programme [TSK - 14.30 (SD = 0.80) versus - 2.10 (SD = 0.80) p < 0.001], an outpatient cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme [TSK 27.76 (SD = 4.56) versus 36.54 (SD = 3.58)], and video-based psychological treatment [TSK 24 (SD = 5) versus 29 (SD = 5) p < 0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: Kinesiophobia negatively affects functional outcomes up until 1 year post-operatively, while active ROM is reduced up to 6 months post-procedure. Post-operative functional and psychological interventions can improve kinesiophobia following TKR.","Brown, Oliver S; Hu, L; Demetriou, C; Smith, T O; Hing, C B",Arch. orthop. trauma surg,577,1

The interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and these cell types remains unknown. We investigated infection and host responses of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and macrophages (MDMs) infected by SARS-CoV-2. MoDCs and MDMs were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and protein expression but did not support productive virus replication. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 launched an attenuated interferon response in both cell types and triggered significant proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression in MDMs but not moDCs. Investigations suggested that this attenuated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in moDCs was associated with viral antagonism of STAT1 phosphorylation.

Moreover, the earlier two pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and many others yet to be identified pose a universal menace. Here, in this piece of work, we have utilized an in silico structural biology and advanced immunoinformatic strategies to devise a multi-epitope subunit vaccine against ongoing COVID-19 infection. The engineered vaccine sequence is adjuvanted with ß-3 defensin and comprised of B-cell epitopes, HTL epitopes and CTL epitopes. This is very likely that the vaccine will be able to elicit the strong immune response. Further, specific binding of the engineered vaccine and immune cell receptor TLR3 was estimated by molecular interaction studies. Strong interaction in the binding groove as well as good docking scores affirmed the stringency of engineered vaccine. The interaction is stable with minimal deviation in root-mean square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation was confirmed by the molecular dynamics simulation experiment. The immune-simulation by C-ImmSim server, which mimics the natural immune environment, yielded more potent immune response data of B-cells, Th cells, Tc cells and IgG for vaccine.

For children with disabilities who receive special education services, access to in-person education and other resources at school is particularly important. The American Academy of Pediatrics advocates for students to attend school in person, without specifics for how children with disabilities can safely return to school. To appropriately plan and accommodate children with disabilities we must prioritize safety, allow for adherence to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and preserve essential school staff. The less cumbersome default of confining students with disabilities to home is not acceptable. We provide an outline describing why Individual Education Plans and 504 plans are important, how they are related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and recommendations for measures to help with safe return to school for children with disabilities.","Joline E, Brandenburg; Lainie K, Holman; Susan D, Apkon; Amy J, Houtrow; Robert, Rinaldi; Maurice G, Sholas",J Pediatr Rehabil Med,577,21

Since its advent, it has been steadily utilizing the emerging technologies to improve accuracy, and machine learning has been at the heart of that. Machine learning has been increasingly used in fingerprint-based indoor localization to replace or emulate the radio map that is used to predict locations given a location signature. The prediction quality of a machine learning model primarily depends on how well the model was trained, which relies on the amount and quality of data used to train it. Data augmentation has been used to improve quality of the trained models by synthetically producing more training data, and several approaches were used in the literature that tackles the problem of lack of training data from different angles. In this paper, we propose DataLoc+, a data augmentation technique for room-level indoor localization that combines different approaches in a simple algorithm. We evaluate the technique by comparing it to the typical direct snapshot approach using data collected from a field experiment conducted in a hospital. Our evaluation shows that the model trained using the proposed technique achieves higher accuracy. We also show that the technique adapts to larger problems using a limited dataset while maintaining high accuracy.","Hilal, Amr E; Arai, Ismail; El-Tawab, Samy",,577,9

Theseconsultations took place over real-time video, audio, or photography between the on-call ophthalmologist and the patient and/or patient's primary physician. A four-item questionnaire was offered to patients who completed a virtual consultation.Main Outcome Measures: Virtual consultation diagnoses and management outcomes; patient assessment of virtual inpatient and emergent ophthalmic care.Results: Of all 423 included encounters, 258 (61%) occurred during the 4 weeks before offering virtual consultations and 165 (39%) encounters occurred during the subsequent 4-week period, indicating a 36% decrease in ophthalmology consultations over this pandemic period. A total of 120 (28%) encounters were conducted remotely during the 8-week period. In-person emergency department (ED) encounters (as percent of total encounters) decreased from 60% to 36% (p < .01) between the first and eighth weeks of the study period. In the 4 weeks since their implementation, virtual inpatient ophthalmology consultations were utilized in 34 of 165 (21%) consultations. Of those, 20 (59%) were high acuity and 1 (3%) was escalated to the ED for in-person evaluation. Most common management decisions made included medication prescription in 46 (55%) patients and scheduling follow-up for 44 (30%) patients. In a survey administered to all 120 patients who were managed over phone or video, 56 (47%) responded. Respondents were in general agreement (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92) and expressed satisfaction with phone and virtual encounters. Specifically, 42 (49%) of 86 patients who had phone encounters noted a mean weighted satisfaction score of 4.6 out of 5 and 14 (41%) responders of 34 virtual consultation encounters noted a mean weighted satisfaction score of 4.9 out of 5. The difference between the average weighted satisfaction scores favored virtual consultation over telephone encounters (p < .01).Conclusions: Virtual inpatient ophthalmology consultations are feasible and have reported high patient satisfaction. Implementing video-based technologies to deliver high-acuity ophthalmic triage and management may help to promote patient and provider safety. In our experience, patients favored virtual consultation over telephone encounters.","Kalra, Gagan; Commiskey, Patrick W; Schempf, Tadhg; Williams, Andrew M; Bowers, Eve M R; Waxman, Evan L; Fu, Roxana",Semin Ophthalmol,577,9

The study is complemented by extensive adaptive sampling simulations that are used to rationalize the different ligands binding poses through the explicit reconstruction of the ligand-protein conformation spaces. Machine Learning predictions are also performed to predict selected compound properties. Computations were performed on GPU-accelerated supercomputers and high performance cloud infrastructures to exponentially reduce time-to-solution and were systematically coupled to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiments to drive synthesis and in vitro characterization of compounds.

The French Society of Rheumatology (SFR) selected the most critical ones to the daily practice of a rheumatologist and a group of 10 experts from SFR and Club Rheumatism and Inflammation (CRI) boards proposed responses based on the current knowledge of May 2020. METHODS: Following the availability of the first 18 questions and statements, 1400 individuals consulted the frequently asked questions between the March 31, 2020 and April 12, 2020. As a result, 16 additional questions were forwarded to the SFR, and answered by the board. An additional round of review by email and video conference was organized, which included updates of the previous statements. The scientific relevance of 5 of the questions led to their inclusion in this document. Each response received a final assessment on a scale of 0-10 with 0 meaning no agreement whatsoever and 10 being in complete agreement. The mean values of these votes for each question are presented as the levels of agreement (LoA) at the end of each response. This document was last updated on April 17, 2020. RESULTS: Based on current scientific literature already published, in most circumstances, there is no contraindication to the initiation or continuation of anti-inflammatory drugs as well as DMARDs. If signs suggestive of infection (coronavirus or other) occur, treatments should be discontinued and resumed, if necessary, after 2 weeks without any symptoms. Only, some signals suggest that people taking an immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroid therapy are at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19. Intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids are allowed when there is no reasonable therapeutic alternative, and providing that precautions to protect the patient and the practitioner from viral contamination are adopted, included appropriate information to the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available data on managing patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic are reassuring and support continuing or initiating symptomatic as well as specific treatments of these diseases, the main target of their management remaining their appropriate control, even during this pandemic.","Richez, Christophe; Flipo, René-Marc; Berenbaum, Francis; Cantagrel, Alain; Claudepierre, Pascal; Debiais, Françoise; Dieudé, Philippe; Goupille, Philippe; Roux, Christian; Schaeverbeke, Thierry; Wendling, Daniel; Pham, Thao; Thomas, Thierry",Joint bone spine,577,1

METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 cases and compared severe (ICU) and nonsevere (non-ICU) groups. RESULTS: We included 12 cohort studies including 2,445 patients with COVID-19. Compared with nonsevere (non-ICU) patients, severe (ICU) disease was associated with a smoking history (Pâ¯=â¯.003) and comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ORâ¯=â¯5.08, P < .001), diabetes (ORâ¯=â¯3.17, P < .001), hypertension (ORâ¯=â¯2.40, P < .001), coronary heart disease (ORâ¯=â¯2.66, P < .001), cerebrovascular diseases (ORâ¯=â¯2.68, Pâ¯=â¯.008), and malignancy (OR=2.21, Pâ¯=â¯.040).

Since a large volume of political discussion occurs on these platforms, identifying malicious activity and coordinated campaigns is essential to ensuring a robust democratic environment. Twitter has become a critical communication channel for politicians and other public figures, enabling them to maintain a direct relationship with supporters. However, the platform has been fertile ground for large-scale malicious activity. As the 2020 U.S. presidential election approaches, we have developed tools to monitor follower dynamics of some of the most prominent Twitter users, including U.S. presidential candidates. We investigate numerous, strange phenomena, such as dramatic spike and saw-tooth waveforms on follower-count charts; cohorts of user accounts which 'circulate', i.e., re-follow high profile accounts numerous times; and other 'resurrected' accounts, which have recently re-engaged on Twitter after years of non-activity. So through various analyses in these contexts, we reveal multiple, coordinated 'social' targeting campaigns aimed at affecting the outcomes of socially critical events through the use of networks of social automations (bots), often optimizing their social capital through 'compromised' accounts, which have--unbeknownst to the greater world--been hijacked.","Heidenreich, Hunter Scott; Mujib, Munif Ishad; Williams, Jake Ryland",,577,5

Quantifying population contact rates is important for understanding the impact of physical distancing policies and for modeling COVID-19, but contact patterns have changed substantially over time due to shifting policies and behaviors. There are surprisingly few empirical estimates of age-structured contact rates in the United States both before and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic that capture these changes. Here, we use data from six waves of the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey (BICS), which collected detailed contact data between March 22, 2020 and February 15, 2021 across six metropolitan designated market areas (DMA) in the United States. Contact rates were low across all six DMAs at the start of the pandemic. We find steady increases in the mean and median number of contacts across these localities over time, as well as a greater proportion of respondents reporting a high number of contacts. We also find that young adults between ages 18 and 34 reported more contacts on average compared to other age groups. The 65 and older age group consistently reported low levels of contact throughout the study period. To understand the impact of these changing contact patterns, we simulate COVID-19 dynamics in each DMA using an age-structured mechanistic model. We compare results from models that use BICS contact rate estimates versus commonly used alternative contact rate sources. We find that simulations parameterized with BICS estimates give insight into time-varying changes in relative incidence by age group that are not captured in the absence of these frequently updated estimates. We also find that simulation results based on BICS estimates closely match observed data on the age distribution of cases, and changes in these distributions over time. Together these findings highlight the role of different age groups in driving and sustaining SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the U.S. We also show the utility of repeated contact surveys in revealing heterogeneities in the epidemiology of COVID-19 across localities in the United States.","Chin, Taylor; Feehan, Dennis M.; Buckee, Caroline O.; Mahmud, Ayesha S.",,577,9

The AUC was 0.754 for the risk score based on this model and 0.717 in the validation subsample. Predictors of death among people from the general population were being male and/or older than 60 years, having been hospitalized in the month before admission for COVID-19, being admitted to a hospital for COVID-19, having cardiovascular disease, dementia, respiratory disease, liver disease, diabetes with organ damage, or cancer while being on anticoagulants was protective. The AUC was 0.941 for this model's risk score and 0.938 in the validation subsample. Our risk scores could help physicians identify high-risk groups and establish preventive measures and better follow-up for patients at high risk of dying.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04463706.","España, Pedro Pablo; Bilbao, Amaia; García-Gutiérrez, Susana; Lafuente, Iratxe; Anton-Ladislao, Ane; Villanueva, Ane; Uranga, Ane; Legarreta, Maria Jose; Aguirre, Urko; Quintana, Jose Maria",Intern. emerg. med,577,21

DESIGN: Secondary data analysis using county-level data for 3,142 US counties was conducted in 2020. Hierarchical linear regression and concentration curve analyses were performed. The combined association of COVID-19 cases and deaths was examined separately by the county population's socioeconomic characteristics. Data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (2014-2018), Area Health Resources File (AHRF) 2018-2019, Kaiser Health News 2020, and 2020 COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University were used in this study. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, U.S. counties with a higher proportion of the Black population and a higher proportion of adults with less than a high school diploma had disproportionately higher COVID-19 cases and deaths (ß > 0, p<0.05 for all relations). A higher proportion of the Hispanic population was associated with higher confirmed cases (ß = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.48-0.87). The majority observed disparities in COVID-19 deaths persisted even after controlling for all-cause deaths in 2019 and COVID-19 cases per 100,000 county population. This can potentially aggravate the existing health disparities among these population groups. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of disproportionately impacted population groups can pave the way towards narrowing the disparity gaps and guide policymakers and stakeholders in designing and implementing population group-specific interventions to mitigate the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khanijahani, Ahmad",Ethn Health,577,33

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 51 adult patients with laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and calculated IMPROVE and IMPROVEDD scores. All patients underwent venous color-Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs to assess the presence of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Patients with normal values of D-dimer did not receive heparin therapy (LMWH); patients with &#8805; 4 ULN values of D-dimer or with a diagnosis of DVT were treated with therapeutic LMWH dosage, while the remaining patients were treated with prophylactic LMWH dosages. RESULTS: We found strong relations between IMPROVE score and the need for IoC and with the in-hospital mortality rate and between the IMPROVEDD score and the need for IoC. We defined that an IMPROVE score greater than 4 points was significantly associated to in-hospital mortality rate (p = 0.05), while an IMPROVEDD score greater than 3 points was associated with the need for IoC (p = 0.04). Multivariate logistic analysis showed how IMPROVE score was significantly associated to in-hospital and 30-days mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVE score can be considered an independent predictor of in-hospital and 30-days mortality.","Greco, S; Zenunaj, G; Bonsi, B; Bella, A; Lopreiato, M; Luciani, F; Pedrini, D; Vestita, G; Dalla Nora, E; Passaro, A",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,577,26

In this study, we describe the clinical course of COVID-19 patients who received early course of corticosteroid treatment in patients with severe respiratory distress secondary to COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical course of 30 COVID-19 patients admitted to King Fahad Military Medical Complex in Dhahran from the period of late March 2020 till June 2020 was assessed and described. All the 30 patients received steroids. Data on demographics, medical history, laboratory findings, chest radiology, medication use, and clinical outcomes were extracted from patients' records. Data was entered and analyzed with SPSS software. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients admitted with COVID-19 were included. The mean age 52.53 years (SD=16.31) with a range from 22-98 years;73.3% were males. About two-thirds of the patients at least had comorbidities;most common were diabetes (46.7%) and hypertension (46.7%), and chronic heart disease (16.7%). About 57% patients had fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The median C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 87.5 mg/dL (IQR 45.0 - 165.65);46.7% had CRP levels &gt;120 mg/dL. The median white blood cell, lymphocytes, and platelet counts were 4.39, 1.05, and 212 K/L, respectively. All the patients received corticosteroids;17 (56.7%) patients were given IV methylprednisolone and 13 (43.3%) received dexamethasone tablets. Of the total patients, 13 (43.3%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS);17 (56.7%) required oxygen, 10 (33.3%) were admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 7 (23.3%) required mechanical ventilation. All the patients improved and were discharged home well. CONCLUSION: Early use of oral corticosteroids in patients with higher CRP levels may lead to better outcomes and may lower risk of transfer to ICU and use of mechanical ventilation.","Al-Bahrani, S.

It addresses the historically-situated concept of a good death and a bad death and suggests why dying alone, whether completely alone or without significant others physically present, may be considered a bad death. Methods: As evidence for collective fears about dying alone, we explored the treatment of these deaths in media using headline examples from the US New York Times and the English Guardian newspaper from the 19th century through Sept. 2020. Results: A search of the New York Times located 39 articles with either lonely dying or lonely death in the headline. The Guardian had 25 articles with use of the term, but unlike the New York Times, no obituaries were included. Although the deaths profiled were deemed unusual, deaths by suicide were only minimally classed as dying alone. The condition of dying alone is represented as a stigmatised death. Themes addressed: 1) dying alone is a nonnormative event; 2) this death matters; and 3) where people die alone, societies should honour the death and learn from it. Discussion and implications: Contemporary dying involves conditions for which we are unprepared as a society. We seldom address our civic obligations to each other. Few people have discussed their wishes about their preferences in dying and whether and how they want to be accompanied at their death, if possible. This is an invisible constraint of modern healthcare. Because of limited discussions and preparation, these deaths may lead to disenfranchised grief for the mourners. Cultural and societal responses to lonely dying are important in easing the emotional burden of dying alone, helping individuals prepare for this possibility and better integrating death with the life course. Recommendations include inclusion of accompaniment/nonaccompaniment at death as part of advance care planning and mitigation if this condition occurs. It is essential for individuals to find their own still point of acceptance within competing societal narratives of privileging the self in dying alone and the value of social connection.","Nelson-Becker, Holly; Victor, Christina",J.

Public knowledge and perceptions significance in tackling pandemics have been evidenced in the previous research. This study aimed to explore public perceptions about pharmacists' educational and prescribing role, and the medication delivery service provided during COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population of Jordan using a convenient sampling technique for ten days (15-25 May 2020). Data was collected from 578 participants who agreed to fill the questionnaire, which was distributed online. The questionnaire items were piloted using face validity and reliability. RESULT: Participants showed a positive perception about the impact of pharmacists and pharmacy services provided during COVID-19 outbreak. More than half of the participants (61.1%) believed that pharmacists could prescribe over the counter medications, and only 15.7% believed that pharmacists could prescribe both over the counter and prescribed medications. Linear regression was performed to assess the factors that affect the participants' perception of pharmacists' prescribing and educational role and delivering medication during COVID-19. Females have lower perception scores towards medication delivery services compared to males (P-value= 0.008). However, male participants, those aged less than 50 years, those with postgraduate degrees, and those from non-medical profession showed a significantly higher perception score towards the impact of pharmacists and pharmacy services provided during COVID-19 outbreak compared to others (P-value <0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the public positively endorsed the impact of the educational role of the pharmacist, medication delivery services, and extending pharmacist prescribing authority during COVID 19 pandemic. Also, findings from this study provide a platform to examine the perception of the public toward pandemic diseases and inform policy decision-makers to react by updating their regulation to allow extending pharmacy services and prescribing role during COVID-19 pandemic.","Alhamad, Hamza; Abu-Farha, Rana K; Albahar, Fares; Jaber, Deema",Int J Clin Pract,577,3

It is unknown whether the advantages of LUS implementation could be paired with deep learning (DL) techniques to match or exceed human-level, diagnostic specificity among similar appearing, pathological LUS images. DESIGN: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on LUS images with B lines of different aetiologies. CNN diagnostic performance, as validated using a 10% data holdback set, was compared with surveyed LUS-competent physicians. SETTING: Two tertiary Canadian hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 612 LUS videos (121 381 frames) of B lines from 243 distinct patients with either (1) COVID-19 (COVID), non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome (NCOVID) or (3) hydrostatic pulmonary edema (HPE). RESULTS: The trained CNN performance on the independent dataset showed an ability to discriminate between COVID (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 1.0), NCOVID (AUC 0.934) and HPE (AUC 1.0) pathologies. This was significantly better than physician ability (AUCs of 0.697, 0.704, 0.967 for the COVID, NCOVID and HPE classes, respectively), p<0.01. CONCLUSIONS: A DL model can distinguish similar appearing LUS pathology, including COVID-19, that cannot be distinguished by humans. The performance gap between humans and the model suggests that subvisible biomarkers within ultrasound images could exist and multicentre research is merited.","Arntfield, Robert; VanBerlo, Blake; Alaifan, Thamer; Phelps, Nathan; White, Matthew; Chaudhary, Rushil; Ho, Jordan; Wu, Derek",BMJ Open,577,1

This research suggests that in similar situations that depress travel demand (e.g., another pandemic), policymakers should formulate plans to reduce speeding which may prevent an upswing in severe injuries and fatalities.","Liao, Haifeng; Lowry, Michael",,577,29

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databanks were searched using the following MESH terms: zebrafish, cisplatin, ototoxicity. The identified publications were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and the 26 qualifying manuscripts were included in the full-text analysis. The experimental protocols, including cisplatin concentrations, the exposure duration and the outcome measurements used in zebrafish larvae studies, were evaluated and the reported knowledge was summarized. RESULTS: Twenty-six substances protecting from cisplatin-induced toxicity were identified with the use of zebrafish larvae. These substances include quinine, salvianolic acid B, berbamine 6, benzamil, quercetin, dexmedetomidine, dexamethsanone, quinoxaline, edaravone, apocynin, dimethyl sulfoxide, KR-22335, SRT1720, ORC-13661, 3-MA, D-methionine, mdivi-1, FUT-175, rapamycin, Z-LLF-CHO, ATX, NAC, CYM-5478, CHCP1, CHCP2 and leupeptin. The otoprotective effects of compounds were attributed to their anti-ROS, anti-apoptotic and cisplatin uptake-blocking properties. The broadest range of protection was achieved when the experimental flow used preconditioning with an otoprotective compound and later a co-incubation with cisplatin. Protection against a high concentration of cisplatin was observed only in protocols using short exposure times (4 and 6 h). CONCLUSIONS: The data extracted from the selected papers confirm that despite the differences between the human and the zebra fish hearing thresholds (as affected by cisplatin), the sensory cells of zebrafish and larval zebrafish are a valuable tool which could be used: (i) for the discovery of novel otoprotective substances and compounds; (ii) to screen their side effects and (iii) to extend the knowledge on the mechanisms of cisplatin-induced inner ear damage. For future studies, the development of a consensus experimental protocol is highly recommended.","Domarecka, Ewa; Skarzynska, Magda; Szczepek, Agnieszka J; Hatzopoulos, Stavros",Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,577,15

G-quadruplex structures in genomes have long been considered essential for regulating a number of biological processes in a plethora of organisms. We have analyzed and identified 25 four contiguous GG runs (G2NxG2NyG2NzG2) in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, suggesting putative G-quadruplex-forming sequences (PQSs). Detailed analysis of SARS-CoV-2 PQSs revealed their locations in the open reading frames of ORF1 ab, spike (S), ORF3a, membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes. Identical PQSs were also found in the other members of the Coronaviridae family. The top-ranked PQSs at positions 13385 and 24268 were confirmed to form RNA G-quadruplex structures in vitro by multiple spectroscopic assays. Furthermore, their direct interactions with viral helicase (nsp13) were determined by microscale thermophoresis. Molecular docking model suggests that nsp13 distorts the G-quadruplex structure by allowing the guanine bases to be flipped away from the guanine quartet planes. Targeting viral helicase and G-quadruplex structure represents an attractive approach for potentially inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Ji, Danyang; Juhas, Mario; Tsang, Chi Man; Kwok, Chun Kit; Li, Yongshu; Zhang, Yang",Brief. bioinform,577,20

The aerosols are transmitted through breathing and vocalization by infectious subjects. Some authors state that this represents the dominant route of spreading, while others dismiss the option. Here we present an adjustable algorithm to estimate the infection risk for different indoor environments, constrained by published data of human aerosol emissions, SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, infective dose and other parameters. We evaluate typical indoor settings such as an office, a classroom, choir practice, and a reception/party. Our results suggest that aerosols from highly infective subjects can effectively transmit COVID-19 in indoor environments. This ""highly infective"" category represents approximately 20% of the patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We find that ""super infective"" subjects, representing the top 5-10% of subjects with a positive test, plus an unknown fraction of less-but still highly infective, high aerosol-emitting subjects-may cause COVID-19 clusters (>10 infections). In general, active room ventilation and the ubiquitous wearing of face masks (i.e., by all subjects) may reduce the individual infection risk by a factor of five to ten, similar to high-volume, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtering. A particularly effective mitigation measure is the use of high-quality masks, which can drastically reduce the indoor infection risk through aerosols.","Lelieveld, Jos; Helleis, Frank; Borrmann, Stephan; Cheng, Yafang; Drewnick, Frank; Haug, Gerald; Klimach, Thomas; Sciare, Jean; Su, Hang; Pöschl, Ulrich",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),577,24

An innovation diffusion theory account of small retail businesses’ social media use,17.120691,2.0768604,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019 has had a huge impact on people's daily life. Many restaurant businesses have been greatly affected by it. Consumers' preferences for catering industry in China have changed, such as environmental hygiene, variety of dishes, and service methods. Therefore, the analysis of consumer preference differences and changes before and after the epidemic can not only provide emergency strategies for the catering industry but further improve the catering industry's ability to deal with public health emergencies. This paper takes five cities in China as representatives to explore the impact of COVID-19 on China's catering industry. Based on catering review data from August 2019 to April 2020, this paper first carries out Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic analysis and SNOWNLP (A Python library for processing Chinese text) sentiment analysis. Then this paper compares the results of topic classification and sentiment analysis before and after the epidemic. Furthermore, differences and changes of consumer preferences are obtained and preferences of consumers under COVID-19 are analyzed and forecasted. The results of LDA thematic analysis before the outbreak of COVID-19 show that consumers tend to punch in cyber celebrity restaurants and pay more attention to the taste of dishes, whereas after it consumers pay more attention to the changes of dishes, dining environment as well as epidemic prevention. The number of packages and takeout was also increasing. However, the waiting time is constantly considered by consumers before and after COVID-19. Firstly, to our surprise, final outcome of emotional analysis showed that consumers' emotional state was more positive after the epidemic than before. COVID-19 has changed the lifestyle of consumers, consumption concepts, and consumption habits. Therefore, businesses also need to take positive and flexible measures to actively get feedback from consumers to adjust dishes and business methods. Secondly, the psychological attitude of catering consumers is relatively positive during the epidemic period, which indicates that consumers have great confidence in the recovery and development of the catering industry. Businesses can comply with consumers' psychology and combine consumption vouchers with restaurant discounts to promote consumers' consumption. Finally, the environment and service play more and more important effect on consumers' emotional scores at present, which indicates that dining state and comfortable mealtime environment are becoming increasingly valuable. Therefore, businesses need to improve service standards.","Zhang, Chenyu; Jiang, Jiayue; Jin, Hong; Chen, Tinggui",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),577,6

We aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics in one of the cities and highlight the effect of current implemented lockdown and nonpharmaceutical interventions. METHODS: We retrieved data of reported cases in Huangshi and Wuhan from publicly available disease databases. Local epidemiological data on suspected or confirmed cases in Huangshi were collected through field investigation. Epidemic curves were constructed with data on reported and observed cases. RESULTS: The accumulated confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatality in Huangshi were reported to be 1015 and 3.74%, respectively, compared with 50006 and 5.08% in Wuhan until 27 March 2020. Right after 24 January, the epidemic curve based on observed cases in Huangshi became flattened. And 1 February 2020 was identified as the ""turning point"" as the epidemic in Huangshi faded soon afterward. COVID-19 epidemic was characterized by mild cases in Huangshi, accounting for 82.66% of total cases. Moreover, 50 asymptomatic infections were identified in adults and children. In addition, we found confirmed cases in 19 familial clusters and 21 healthcare workers, supporting interhuman transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reported the temporal dynamics and characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Huangshi city, China, across the unprecedented intervention. Such new epidemiological inference might provide further guidance on current lockdown measures in high-risk cities and, subsequently, help improve public health intervention strategies against the pandemic on the country and global levels.","Ji, Tuo; Chen, Hai-Lian; Xu, Jing; Wu, Ling-Ning; Li, Jie-Jia; Chen, Kai; Qin, Gang",Clin Infect Dis,577,9

We propose a spatiotemporal model that estimates the causal effect of changes in community mobility (intervention) on infection rates. Using an approximation to the SIR model and incorporating spatiotemporal dependence, the proposed model estimates a direct and indirect (spillover) effect of intervention. Under an interference and treatment ignorability assumption, this model is able to estimate causal intervention effects, and additionally allows for spatial interference between locations.

We report here structure, function and antigenicity of its full-length spike (S) trimer in comparison with those of other variants, including Gamma, Kappa, and previously characterized Alpha and Beta. Delta S can fuse membranes more efficiently at low levels of cellular receptor ACE2 and its pseudotyped viruses infect target cells substantially faster than all other variants tested, possibly accounting for its heightened transmissibility. Mutations of each variant rearrange the antigenic surface of the N-terminal domain of the S protein in a unique way, but only cause local changes in the receptor-binding domain, consistent with greater resistance particular to neutralizing antibodies. These results advance our molecular understanding of distinct properties of these viruses and may guide intervention strategies.","Lavine, Christy L.; Zhu, Haisun; Anand, Krishna; Tong, Pei; Gautam, Avneesh; Mayer, Megan L.; Walsh, Richard M.; Yang, Wei; Seaman, Michael S.; Lu, Jianming",,577,16

This study aimed to evaluate the unique experience of team members in our health system from clinical informatics who were redeployed to provide emergency telehealth care in a clinical role. Methods: Clinical informatics team members were redeployed during the first month of the pandemic onset in March 2020 to a clinic providing virtual screening for COVID-19. Participants completed an anonymous survey after 90 days. Results: During the study period, 76 clinical informatics team members provided telehealth and 85.3% of those eligible responded to the survey. Respondents felt prepared with clinical protocols and technical tools. The most common stressors were rapidly changing clinical protocols. Participants enjoyed the chance to work with patients and aiding during a pandemic. Conclusions: Clinical informatics team members redeployed to a virtual care screening hub endorsed positive experiences and the majority said that they would provide virtual care again.

Adherence to COVID-19 mitigating practices is presently high among the general public, and stringent lockdown measures supported by legal and policy intervention have facilitated this. In the coming months, however, as rules are being relaxed and individuals become less strict, and thus, the ambiguity in policy increases, the maintenance of recommended social distancing norms will rely on more informal social interactional processes. We argue that the moralization of these practices, twinned with relaxations of policy, may likely cause interactional tension between those individuals who do vs. those who do not uphold social distancing in the coming months: that is, derogation of those who adhere strictly to COVID-19 mitigating practices and group polarization between 'distancers' and 'non-distancers'. In this paper, we explore how and why these processes might come to pass, their impact on an overall societal response to COVID-19, and the need to factor such processes into decisions regarding how to lift restrictions.","Prosser, Annayah M B; Judge, Madeline; Bolderdijk, Jan Willem; Blackwood, Leda; Kurz, Tim",Br J Soc Psychol,577,20

At the host level, COVID-19, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), affects the respiratory system, with the clinical symptoms ranging from mild to severe or critical illness that often requires hospitalization and oxygen support. There is no specific therapy for COVID-19, as is the case for any common viral disease except drugs to reduce the viral load and alleviate the inflammatory symptoms. Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), also primarily affects the lungs and has clinical signs similar to pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Active TB is a leading killer among infectious diseases and adds to the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. In immunocompetent individuals, primary Mtb infection can also lead to a non-progressive, asymptomatic latency. However, latent Mtb infection (LTBI) can reactivate symptomatic TB disease upon host immune-suppressing conditions. Importantly, the diagnosis and treatment of TB are hampered and admixed with COVID-19 control measures. The US-Center for Disease Control (US-CDC) recommends using antiviral drugs, Remdesivir or corticosteroid (CST), such as dexamethasone either alone or in-combination with specific recommendations for COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization or oxygen support. However, CSTs can cause immunosuppression, besides their anti-inflammatory properties. The altered host immunity during COVID-19, combined with CST therapy, poses a significant risk for new secondary infections and/or reactivation of existing quiescent infections, such as LTBI. This review highlights CST therapy recommendations for COVID-19, various types and mechanisms of action of CSTs, the deadly combination of two respiratory infectious diseases COVID-19 and TB. It also discusses the importance of screening for LTBI to prevent TB reactivation during corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19.","Gopalaswamy, Radha; Subbian, Selvakumar",Int. j. mol. sci.

DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENT(S): Thirty-four adult Chinese males diagnosed with COVID-19 through confirmatory quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from pharyngeal swab samples. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Identification of SARS-CoV-2 on qRT-PCR of single ejaculated semen samples. Semen quality was not assessed. Expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human testis are explored through previously published single-cell transcriptome datasets. RESULT(S): Six patients (19%) demonstrated scrotal discomfort suggestive of viral orchitis around the time of COVID-19 confirmation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 was not detected in semen after a median of 31 days (interquartile range, 29-36 days) from COVID-19 diagnosis. Single-cell transcriptome analysis demonstrates sparse expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, with almost no overlapping gene expression. CONCLUSION(S): Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 was not detected in the semen of patients recovering from COVID-19 1 month after COVID-19 diagnosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-mediated viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 into target host cells is unlikely to occur within the human testicle based on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression.

We measured the proportion of seroconverted employees and evaluated risk factors for seroconversion during the first pandemic wave. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we recruited Geneva University Hospitals employees and sampled them 3 times, every 3 weeks from March 30 to June 12, 2020. We measured the proportion of seroconverted employees and determined prevalence ratios of risk factors for seroconversion using multivariate mixed-effects Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Overall, 3,421 participants (29% of all employees) were included, with 92% follow-up. The proportion of seroconverted employees increased from 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7%-5.1%) at baseline to 8.5% [(95% CI, 7.6%-9.5%) at the last visit. The proportions of seroconverted employees working in COVID-19 geriatrics and rehabilitation (G&R) wards (32.3%) and non-COVID-19 G&R wards (12.3%) were higher compared to office workers (4.9%) at the last visit. Only nursing assistants had a significantly higher risk of seroconversion compared to office workers (11.7% vs 4.9%; P = .006). Significant risk factors for seroconversion included the use of public transportation (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.25-2.03), known community exposure to severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (2.80; 95% CI, 2.22-3.54), working in a ward with a nosocomial COVID outbreak (2.93; 95% CI, 2.27-3.79), and working in a COVID-19 G&R ward (3.47; 95% CI, 2.45-4.91) or a non-COVID-19 G&R ward (1.96; 95% CI, 1.46-2.63). We observed an association between reported use of respirators and lower risk of seroconversion (0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.96). CONCLUSION: Additional preventive measures should be implemented to protect employees in G&R wards. Randomized trials on the protective effect of respirators are urgently needed.","Martischang, Romain; Iten, Anne; Arm, Isabelle; Abbas, Mohamed; Meyer, Benjamin; Yerly, Sabine; Eckerle, Isabella; Pralong, Jacques; Sauser, Julien; Suard, Jean-Claude; Kaiser, Laurent; Pittet, Didier; Harbarth, Stephan",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,577,16

Thus far, there have been some implementations of artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to develop epidemiology curve for a specific country. However, most applied AI methods generated models that are almost impossible to translate into a mathematical equation. In this paper, the AI method called genetic programming (GP) algorithm is utilized to develop a symbolic expression (mathematical equation) which can be used for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. with high accuracy. The GP algorithm is utilized on the publicly available dataset that contains the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered patients for each U.S. state to obtain the symbolic expression for the estimation of the number of the aforementioned patient groups. The dataset consists of the latitude and longitude of the central location for each state and the number of patients in each of the goal groups for each day in the period of 22nd January 2020-3rd December 2020. The obtained symbolic expressions for each state are summed up to obtain symbolic expressions for estimation of each of the patient groups (confirmed, deceased and recovered). These symbolic expressions are combined to obtain the symbolic expression for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. The obtained symbolic expressions for the estimation of the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered patients for each state achieved R2 score in the ranges 0.9406-0.9992, 0.9404-0.9998 and 0.9797-0.99955, respectively. These equations are summed up to formulate symbolic expressions for the estimation of the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered patients for the entire U.S. with achieved R2 score of 0.9992, 0.9997 and 0.9996, respectively. Using these symbolic expressions, the equation for the estimation of the epidemiology curve for the entire U.S. is formulated which achieved R2 score of 0.9933. Investigation showed that GP algorithm can produce symbolic expressions for the estimation of the number of confirmed, recovered and deceased patients as well as the epidemiology curve not only for the states but for the entire U.S. with very high accuracy.","Andelic, Nikola; Baressi Segota, Sandi; Lorencin, Ivan; Jurilj, Zdravko; Sustersic, Tijana; Blagojevic, Andela; Protic, Alen; Cabov, Tomislav; Filipovic, Nenad; Car, Zlatan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),577,16

The objective of this paper is to discover company- and competitor-specific intelligence from OCR using an unsupervised text analytics approach. First, the key aspects (or topics) discussed in the OCR are extracted using three topic models - probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and two variants of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA-VI and LDA-GS). Subsequently, we propose an ensemble-assisted topic model (EA-TM), which integrates the individual topic models, to classify each review sentence to the most representative aspect. Likewise, to determine the sentiment corresponding to a review sentence, an ensemble sentiment analyzer (E-SA), which combines the predictions of three opinion mining methods (AFINN, SentiStrength, and VADER), is developed. An aspect-based opinion summary (AOS), which provides a snapshot of passenger-perceived strengths and weaknesses of an airline, is established by consolidating the sentiments associated with each aspect. Furthermore, a bi-gram analysis of the labeled OCR is employed to perform root cause analysis within each identified aspect. A case study involving 99,147 airline reviews of a US-based target carrier and four of its competitors is used to validate the proposed approach. The results indicate that a cost- and time-effective performance summary of an airline and its competitors can be obtained from OCR. Finally, besides providing theoretical and managerial implications based on our results, we also provide implications for post-pandemic preparedness in the airline industry considering the unprecedented impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and predictions on similar pandemics in the future.","Srinivas, Sharan; Ramachandiran, Surya",,577,20

Currently, WHO guideline suggests using chest imaging in addition to clinicolaboratory evaluation to decide on triage between home-discharge versus hospitalization. We designed our study to validate this recommendation to guide clinicians. This study providing some suggestions to guide clinicians for better decision making in 2020. Methods: In this retrospective study, patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 (Nâ¯=â¯213) were divided in different clinical and management scenarios: home-discharge, ward hospitalization and ICU admission. We reviewed the patient's initial chest CT if available. We evaluated quantitative and qualitative characteristics of CT as well as relevant available clinicolaboratory data. Chi-square, One-Way ANOVA and Paired t-test were used for analysis. Results: The finding showed that most patients with mixed patterns, pleural effusion, 5 lobes involved, total score &#8805;10, SpO2% &#8804; 90, ESR (mm/h)â¯&#8805;â¯60 and WBC (103/µL)â¯&#8805;â¯8000 were hospitalized. Most patients with Ground-glass opacities only, &#8804;3 lobes involvement, peripheral distribution, SpO2% &#8805; 95, ESR (mm/h)â¯<â¯30 and WBC(103/µL)â¯<â¯6000 were home-discharged. Conclusions: This study suggests the use of initial chest CT (qualitative and quantitative evaluation) in addition to initial clinicolaboratory data could be a useful supplementary method for clinical management and it is an excellent decision making tool (home-discharge versus ICU/Ward admission) for clinicians.","Mozafari, Abolfazl; Miladinia, Mojtaba; Sabri, Ali; Movaseghi, Fatemeh; Baeis, Mehdi Gholamzadeh",,577,1

Once a highly contagious disease takes place in a location the movement patterns aid in predicting the potential spatial spreading of the disease, hence mobile data becomes a crucial tool to epidemic models. In this work, based on millions of anonymized mobile visits data in Brazil, we investigate the most probable spreading patterns of the COVID-19 within states of Brazil. The study is intended to help public administrators in action plans and resources allocation, whilst studying how mobile geolocation data may be employed as a measure of population mobility during an epidemic. This study focuses on the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro during the period of March 2020, when the disease first started to spread in these states. Metapopulation models for the disease spread were simulated in order to evaluate the risk of infection of each city within the states, by ranking them according to the time the disease will take to infect each city. We observed that, although the high-risk regions are those closer to the capital cities, where the outbreak has started, there are also cities in the countryside with great risk. The mathematical framework developed in this paper is quite general and may be applied to locations around the world to evaluate the risk of infection by diseases, in special the COVID-19, when geolocation data is available.","Peixoto, Pedro S; Marcondes, Diego; Peixoto, Cláudia; Oliva, Sérgio M",PLoS One,577,13

Increasing the concentration of hydrochloric acid during the modulated synthesis resulted in a considerable increase of pore volume, which enhanced the CQ loading in CQ@UiO-66 composites. Drug release tests for CQ@UiO-66 composites have confirmed prolonged CQ release in comparison with pure CQ. In vivo tests on a Danio reiro model organism have revealed that CQ released from CQ@UiO-66 25% showed lower toxicity and fewer cardiotoxic effects manifested by cardiac malformations and arrhythmia in comparison to analogous doses of CQ. Cytotoxicity tests proved that the CQ loaded on the defective UiO-66 cargo resulted in increased viability of cardiac cells (H9C2) as compared to incubation with pure CQ.

However, current diagnostic technologies of SARS-CoV-2 still suffer from some drawbacks because of the tradeoffs between sensitivity, usability and costs, making the test unaffordable to most users at home. To address these limitations, taking advantage of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and a portable glucose meter (PGM), we present a proof-of-concept demonstration of a target-responsive CRISPR-PGM system for translating SARS-CoV-2 detection into a glucose test. Using this system, a specific N gene, N protein, and pseudo-viruses of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected quantitatively with a PGM. Given the facile integration of various bioreceptors into the CRISPR-PGM system, the proposed method provides a starting point to provide patients with a single-device solution that can quantitatively monitor multiple COVID-19 biomarkers at home.","Liu, R.; Hu, Y.

Yet, for most clinically approved vaccines, binding antibody titers only serve as a surrogate of protection. Instead, the ability of vaccine induced antibodies to neutralize or mediate Fc-effector functions is mechanistically linked to protection. While evidence has begun to point to persisting antibody responses among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, cases of re-infection have begun to emerge, calling the protective nature of humoral immunity against this highly infectious pathogen into question. Using a community-based surveillance study, we aimed to define the relationship between titers and functional antibody activity to SARS-CoV-2 over time. Here we report significant heterogeneity, but limited decay, across antibody titers amongst 120 identified seroconverters, most of whom had asymptomatic infection. Notably, neutralization, Fc-function, and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses were only observed in subjects that elicited RBD-specific antibody titers above a threshold. The findings point to a switch-like relationship between observed antibody titer and function, where a distinct threshold of activity-defined by the level of antibodies-is required to elicit vigorous humoral and cellular response.

There are no reports of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in these patients. AIMS: To investigate prevalence of COVID-19 cases and seroprevalence among rheumatologic patients and the risk factors for infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in a rheumatologic population. An online questionnaire was sent on 31 April 2020. Blood samples from 20% sample of patients were drawn for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients were divided based on autoimmune (AI) diagnosis. Prevalence of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab and by serology (seroprevalence) was compared to national data. Risk factors for infection of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed. RESULTS: The study group included 1204 patients, 74.5% had an AI diagnosis. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.16% in the rheumatologic patient population and 0.22% in the AI group, which was not different from prevalence in Israel on 4 May 2020 (0.18%, P = 0.912 and P = 0.759 respectively). Serologic tests were performed in 242 patients, of which five were found positive pointing to a seroprevalence of 2.07%. Exposure to a known COVID-19 patient was the only significant risk factor for being positive by swab or by serology. AI diagnosis, immunosuppression, corticosteroid, hydroxychloroquine did not influence the risk. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COVID-19 in a population of rheumatologic patients was similar to that of the general population. Mild/asymptomatic cases may be prevalent according to serologic tests. The major risk factor for infection is exposure to a known case of COVID-19, and immunosuppression did not play a role in the risk of infection.","Eviatar, Tali; Elalouf, Ofir; Furer, Victoria; Goldstein-Lahat, Yael; Paran, Yael; Pel, Sara; Nevo, Sharon; Zisapel, Michael; Alcalay, Yifat; Elkayam, Ori",Intern Med J,577,16

Mistreatment in labor occurs more often in the hospital setting compared with home births (28.1% vs. 5.1%).15 Systemic racism and the stress it creates account for some of this difference.16,17 Birth centers supported by public funding such as Medicaid, which pays for more than 40% of all births, and a higher proportion of births for persons of color18 may achieve improved satisfaction with the birthing experience, lower rates of preterm births and cesarean deliveries, and lower costs for delivery.19 The safety of home or birth center birth can be improved by adequate birth attendant training, access to emergency obstetric care, and careful risk assessment throughout the prenatal and intrapartum periods. Substituting the term “community birth” for “out-of-hospital birth” removes the assumption that hospital birthing is normative and is preferred.24 Pregnant patients with a fetus in breech presentation near term, a multiple gestation, or a previous cesarean delivery should be counseled that home birth is not recommended because of the increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes.2,10,25 Many patients in rural areas lack access to trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC), despite AAFP and ACOG efforts to support maternal choice.26,27 Persons deemed ineligible for maternity care in their local hospital because of a history of cesarean delivery may choose the increased risk of a local home birth rather than transfer care outside of their community.26–28 Supporting the options of TOLAC in rural hospitals and planned vaginal breech delivery for those who meet criteria may decrease the likelihood of pregnant persons with these risk factors choosing home birth.","Leeman, Lawrence Goldstein Jessica Taylor",American Family Physician,577,16

The intranasal route offers an alternative for central nervous system delivery. Cubosomes have been reported as helpful vehicles for intranasal delivery of therapeutics to enable brain targeting. Objective: In this study, we aimed to develop the intranasal cubosomal thermogelling dispersion of saquinavir mesylate for central nervous system delivery. Methods: The Box-Behnken design was applied to study the effect of monoolein, Poloxamer 407, and polyvinyl alcohol as independent factors and the particle size, entrapment efficiency, gelation temperature, and stability index as responses. The optimized cubosomes were evaluated using transmission electron microscopy, ex vivo permeation, and in vivo pharmacokinetics. Results: The optimized formula consisting of monoolein (8.96%), Poloxamer 407 (17.45%), and polyvinyl alcohol (7.5%) was prepared and evaluated. Higher values for the steady-state flux, permeability coefficient, and enhancement factor were observed for the cubosomal thermogelling dispersion of saquinavir during ex vivo permeation in comparison with an aqueous suspension of saquinavir. From the pharmacokinetic profile, the relative bioavailability for the intranasal optimized formula was approximately 12-fold higher when compared with oral aqueous suspension and 2.5-fold greater when compared to the intranasal aqueous suspension of saquinavir. Conclusion: Overall, the saquinavir-loaded cubosomal thermogelling formulation is promising for central nervous system delivery by intranasal administration.","Hosny, Khaled M",Int J Nanomedicine,577,19

SETTING: SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a 58-year-old man from Wuhan, China who arrived in Melbourne on 19 January 2020 and was admitted to the Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne from the emergency department on 24 January 2020 with fever, cough, and progressive dyspnoea. MAJOR OUTCOMES: Clinical course and laboratory features of the first reported case of COVID-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) in Australia; isolation, whole genome sequencing, imaging, and rapid sharing of virus from the patient. RESULTS: A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum collected when the patient presented to hospital were each positive for SARS-CoV-2 (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Inoculation of Vero/hSLAM cells with material from the nasopharyngeal swab led to the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in culture. Electron microscopy of the supernatant confirmed the presence of virus particles with morphology characteristic of viruses of the family Coronaviridae. Whole genome sequencing of the viral isolate and phylogenetic analysis indicated the isolate exhibited greater than 99.99% sequence identity with other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Within 24 hours of isolation, the first Australian SARS-CoV-2 isolate was shared with local and overseas reference laboratories and major North American and European culture collections.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is characterized by pneumonia, respiratory distress, and hypercoagulation and can be fatal. An early sign of infection is loss of smell, taste, and chemesthesis-loss of chemical sensation. Other neurological effects of the disease have been described, but not explained. It is now apparent that many of these neurological effects (for instance joint pain and headache) can persist for at least months after infection, suggesting a sensory neuronal involvement in persistent disease. We show that human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 at the RNA and protein level. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus-associated factors and receptors are broadly expressed in human DRG at the lumbar and thoracic level as assessed by bulk RNA sequencing. ACE2 mRNA is expressed by a subset of nociceptors that express MRGPRD mRNA, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may gain access to the nervous system through entry into neurons that form free nerve endings at the outermost layers of skin and luminal organs. Therefore, DRG sensory neurons are a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the peripheral nervous system, and viral infection of human nociceptors may cause some of the persistent neurological effects seen in COVID-19.","Shiers, Stephanie; Ray, Pradipta R; Wangzhou, Andi; Sankaranarayanan, Ishwarya; Tatsui, Claudio Esteves; Rhines, Laurence D; Li, Yan; Uhelski, Megan L; Dougherty, Patrick M; Price, Theodore J",Pain,577,25

Following its introduction in Senegal, in 1957, ASF steadily progressed through West Africa, reaching Burkina Faso in 2003, and later Mali in 2016. Despite the heavy burden of disease on pig production, little information is available on the genetic diversity of Africa swine fever virus (ASFV) in Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal. Here, we used real-time PCR ASFV to detect the ASFV genome in samples collected between 1989 and 2016, in Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal, and conventional approaches for isolate characterization. The C-terminal end of the p72 protein gene, the full E183L gene and the central variable region (CVR) within the B602L gene in ASFV genome were sequenced and compared to publicly available sequences. ASFV genome was found in 27 samples, 19 from Burkina Faso, three from Mali and five from Senegal. The phylogenetic analyses showed that all viruses belong to genotype I, with the ASFVs from Burkina Faso and Mali grouping with genotype Ia and ASFV serogroup 4, and those from Senegal with genotype Ib and the ASFV serogroup 1. The analysis of the CVR tetrameric tandem repeat sequences (TRS) showed four TRS variants in Burkina Faso, two in Senegal and one in Mali. The three countries did not share any common TRS, and all CVRs of this study differed from previously reported CVRs in West Africa, except for Senegal. Three of the five isolates from Senegal fully matched with the CVR, p72 and p54 sequences from ASFV IC96 collected during the 1996 ASF outbreak in Ivory Coast. This study shows the spread of the same ASFV strains across countries, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring of ASFV isolates.

A Re-Analysis of the 1918 Flu Pandemic,16.851505,2.5618565,2020,"PURPOSE: To examine the psychological impact of fertility treatment suspensions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and to clarify psychosocial predictors of better or worse mental health. METHODS: 92 women from Canada and the United States (ages 20-45 years) whose fertility treatments had been cancelled were recruited via social media. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, perceived mental health impact, and change in quality of life related to treatment suspensions. Potential predictors of psychological outcomes were also examined, including several personality traits, aspects of social support, illness cognitions, and coping strategies. RESULTS: 52% of respondents endorsed clinical levels of depressive symptoms. On a 7-point scale, participants endorsed a significant decline in overall quality of life (M(SD) = -1.3(1.3), p < .0001) as well as a significant decline in mental health related to treatment suspensions on a scale from -5 to +5 (M(SD) = -2.1(2.1), p < .001). Several psychosocial variables were found to positively influence these outcomes: lower levels of defensive pessimism (r = -.25, p < .05), greater infertility acceptance (r = .51, p < .0001), better quality social support (r = .31, p < .01), more social support seeking (r = .35, p < .001) and less avoidance of infertility reminders (r = -.23, p = .029). CONCLUSION: Fertility treatment suspensions have had a considerable negative impact on women's mental health and quality of life. However, these findings point to several protective psychosocial factors that can be fostered in the future to help women cope.","Gordon, Jennifer L; Balsom, Ashley A",PLoS One,577,33

Conversion of non-clinical space into medical units designated for Covid-19 patients became necessary to accommodate this mandate. METHODS: Non-clinical space was converted into medical units at multiple campuses of a large academic hospital system over 1 week. The conversion required construction to deliver basic care including oxygen supplementation. Creation of provider workspaces, handwashing areas, and colour-coded infection control zones was prioritized. Selection criteria were created with a workflow to determine appropriate patients for transfer into converted space. Staffing of converted space shifted as hospitalizations surged. RESULTS: The unit was open for 18 days and accommodated 170 unique patients. Five patients (2.9%) required transfer to a higher level of care. There were no respiratory arrests, cardiac arrests, or deaths in the new unit. CONCLUSION: Converting non-clinical space to a medical unit was accomplished quickly with staffing, workflow for appropriate patients, few patients who returned to a higher level of care, and no respiratory or cardiac arrests or deaths on the unit.","Locke, Cameron J; Koo, Benjamin; Baron, Sarah W; Shapiro, Jared; Pacifico, Jessica",J Eval Clin Pract,577,1

The success of a national population-based genome program, like the Qatar Genome Program (QGP), depends on the willingness of citizens to donate samples and take up genomic testing services. This study explores public attitudes of the Qatari population toward genetic testing and toward participating in the QGP. A representative sample of 837 adult Qataris was surveyed in May 2016. Approximately 71% of respondents surveyed reported that they were willing to participate in the activities of the QGP. Willingness to participate was significantly associated with basic literacy in genetics, a family history of genetic diseases, and previous experience with genetic testing through premarital screening. Respondents cited the desire to know more about their health status as the principle motivation for participating, while lack of time and information were reported as the most important barriers. With QGP plans to ramp up the scale of its national operation toward more integration into clinical care settings, it is critical to understand public attitudes and their determinants. The results demonstrate public support but also identify the need for more education and individual counseling that not only provide information on the process, challenges, and benefits of genomic testing, but that also address concerns about information security.","Abdul Rahim, Hanan F; Ismail, Said I; Hassan, Amel; Fadl, Tasnim; Khaled, Salma M; Shockley, Bethany; Nasrallah, Catherine; Qutteina, Yara; Elmaghraby, Engi; Yasin, Heba; Darwish, Dima; Fakhro, Khalid A; Badji, Radja; Al-Muftah, Wadha; Afifi, Nahla; Althani, Asmaa",J. hum. genet,577,24

Tackling the pandemic in those countries is challenging due to the fragility of socioeconomic and health systems. Palestine is one of those countries that is facing compounding challenges, instability, fragility, living conditions, poverty, and mobility, all of which are caused by multifactorial etiology. The Pandemic shows triple tragedies; virus (COVID-19 Pandemic), ongoing Israeli occupation (Politics), and Intra-Palestinian divide (Policies). Yet, Palestine's response to the pandemic is outperforming many countries in the region. The early preventative lockdown measures in the West Bank found effective and not overwhelming the already over-stretched health system. While in the Gaza Strip, the response was slow. Prisoners, labours, besieged people, socioeconomic-disadvantaged classes, and refugees were put at additional high risk. Nonetheless, measures taken were unconsolidated in both regions largely due to the political factors. A little collaboration and inter-agency task forces in preparedness and response was observed, and the mechanisms and governance remain ambiguous. A consolidated and evidence-based nation-wide plan is required, whereby state and non-state actors have a clear and transparent exit strategy. A new thinking approach to promote the public health system and evidence-informed policies in Palestine is an urgent national priority.","AlKhaldi, Mohammed; Kaloti, Rasha; Shella, Duha; Al Basuoni, Aisha; Meghari, Hamza",Glob Public Health,577,24

Many academic libraries have been closed, and users have had to use e-books instead of printed books in libraries. As e-books are not yet commonly used in Japan, this paper examines the impact of the pandemic on the use of e-books in academic libraries in Japan. As a case study, the usage data for each e-book platform in Kyushu University in Japan were analyzed, and the overall trends in each period before and during the pandemic were revealed. The access counts of e-books from January to June 2019 and those for 2020 were examined. The number of total access counts in 2020 was higher than that in 2019 on all nine platforms. The platform that saw the highest access count growth rate was JSTOR, with an 846% increase. The usage of e-books in the Maruzen eBook Library, which holds many Japanese textbooks, was examined in detail. E-books on mathematics, medical science, and programming languages were in constant use both before and during the pandemic. E-books in law and economics started to be used during the pandemic. These results indicate that the pandemic has evoked new needs for e-books in certain fields. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Kodama, M.; Ishita, E.; Watanabe, Y.; Tomiura, Y.",Lect.

We previously proposed that the cationically modified chitosan, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC) is a potent inhibitor of HCoV-NL63. Next, we demonstrated the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the compound, as it inhibited all low pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1). Here, using in vitro and ex vivo model of human airway epithelium, we show that HTCC effectively blocks MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also confirmed the mechanism of action for these two viruses, showing that the polymer blocks the virus entry to the host cell by interaction with the S protein.IMPORTANCE The beginning of 2020 brought us information about the novel coronavirus emerging in China. Rapid research resulted in the characterization of the pathogen, which appeared to be a member of the SARS-like cluster, commonly seen in bats. Despite the global and local efforts, the virus escaped the health care measures and rapidly spread in China and later globally, officially causing a pandemic and global crisis in March 2020. At present, different scenarios are being written to contain the virus, but the development of novel anticoronavirals for all highly pathogenic coronaviruses remains the major challenge. Here, we describe the antiviral activity of previously developed by us HTCC compound, which may be used as a potential inhibitor of currently circulating highly pathogenic coronaviruses - SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.","Milewska, Aleksandra; Chi, Ying; Szczepanski, Artur; Barreto-Duran, Emilia; Dabrowska, Agnieszka; Botwina, Pawel; Obloza, Magdalena; Liu, Kevin; Liu, Dan; Guo, Xiling; Ge, Yiyue; Li, Jingxin; Cui, Lunbiao; Ochman, Marek; Urlik, Maciej; Rodziewicz-Motowidlo, Sylwia; Zhu, Fengcai; Szczubialka, Krzysztof; Nowakowska, Maria; Pyrc, Krzysztof",J. virol,577,14

The relationship between the progression of COVID-19 and Nutritional status is still unclear. We analyzed the clinical characteristics of 342 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and analyzed the relationship between the progression of COVID-19 and Nutritional status. METHODOLOGY: 342 COVID-19 were enrolled from ten different hospitals in China. The clinical characteristics were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The body mass index (BMI) of the mild patients (Group A) was higher than those in severe patients (Group B) and critical patients (Group C); The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of Group A was lower than those of the other two groups; Sex, age, and BMI, was strongly correlated with Clinical classification (CT); Among the laboratory test results, Neutrophil (NEU%), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), LDH, and blood glucose (BG) were positively correlated with CT; Lymphocyte ( LYM%), Platelet (PLT), Albumin (ALB), and Creatinine (Cr) were negatively correlated with CT. BMI, NEU%, LYM%, ALB, Cr, and PLT are all protective factors that affect CT. CONCLUSION: People with poor nutritional status (lower BMI and ALB) have a higher risk of developing severe disease after infection with SARS-CoV-2.

The scale of the challenge for health systems and public policy means that there is an ineluctable need to prioritize the needs of the many. It is impossible to treat all citizens equally, and a failure to carefully consider the consequences of actions could lead to massive preventable loss of life. In a pandemic there is a strong ethical need to consider how to do most good overall. Utilitarianism is an influential moral theory that states that the right action is the action that is expected to produce the greatest good. It offers clear operationalizable principles. In this paper we provide a summary of how utilitarianism could inform two challenging questions that have been important in the early phase of the pandemic: (a) Triage: which patients should receive access to a ventilator if there is overwhelming demand outstripping supply? (b) Lockdown: how should countries decide when to implement stringent social restrictions, balancing preventing deaths from COVID-19 with causing deaths and reductions in well-being from other causes? Our aim is not to argue that utilitarianism is the only relevant ethical theory, or in favour of a purely utilitarian approach. However, clearly considering which options will do the most good overall will help societies identify and consider the necessary cost of other values. Societies may choose either to embrace or not to embrace the utilitarian course, but with a clear understanding of the values involved and the price they are willing to pay.","Savulescu, Julian; Persson, Ingmar; Wilkinson, Dominic",Bioethics,577,13

The conventional methods of disease detection and diagnosis like swab test using RT-PCR are not sufficient enough during this critical condition as it has several limitations along with possibilities of being contaminated. Computer-based tools are now being used for the demonstration of the disease and healthcare management. The present chapter is to demonstrate the various applications of AI-based model that is useful against COVID-19, based on recently developed technologies and research publications. The AI-based algorithm is driven by machine learning technology along with an advanced bio-computational technique for fast and precise diagnosis and detection of coronavirus disease. It also has the ability of early prediction and warning for the spread of disease. Moreover, AI-based techniques are also an important setup for the development of an effective drug or vaccine. It provides worldwide access to various databases of all research and medical data related to COVID-19 and also helps in the management of the socioeconomic constraints.

We sought to determine the prevalence and temporal trends of acute (by PCR) and convalescent (by antibody [Ab]) SARS-CoV-2 infection during the earliest phase of the pandemic among patients in an urban ED in Baltimore City. METHODS: We tested remnant blood samples from 3255 unique ED patients, collected between March 16th and May 31st 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 Ab. PCR for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection from nasopharyngeal swabs was obtained on any patients based on clinical suspicion. Hospital records were abstracted and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed. RESULTS: Of 3255 ED patients, 8.2% (95%CI: 7.3%, 9.2%) individuals had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 155 PCR+, 78 Ab+, and 35 who were both PCR+ and Ab+. Prevalence of disease increased throughout the study period, ranging from 3.2% (95%CI: 1.8%, 5.2%) PCR+ and 0.6% (95%CI: 0.1%, 1.8%) Ab+ in March, to 6.2% (95%CI: 5.1%, 7.4%) PCR+ and 4.2% (95%CI: 3.3%, 5.3%) Ab+ in May. The highest SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was found in Hispanic individuals who made up 8.4% (95%CI: 7.4%, 9.4%) of individuals screened, but 35% (95%CI: 29%, 41%) of infections (PCR and/or Ab+). Demographic and clinical factors independently associated with acute infection included Hispanic ethnicity, loss of smell or taste, subjective fever, cough, muscle ache and fever. Factors independently associated with convalescent infection were Hispanic ethnicity and low oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of COVID-19 in Baltimore City increased dramatically over the 11-week study period and was disproportionately higher among Hispanic individuals. ED-based surveillance methods are important for identifying both acute and convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infections and provides important information regarding demographic and clinical correlates of disease in the local community.","Laeyendecker, Oliver; Hsieh, Yu-Hsiang; Rothman, Richard E; Dashler, Gaby; Kickler, Thomas; Fernandez, Reinaldo E; Clarke, William; Patel, Eshan U; Tobian, Aaron A R; Kelen, Gabor D; Quinn, Thomas C",Am J Emerg Med,577,16

METHODS: We analyzed service utilization data from the National Eating Disorder Information Centre (NEDIC). We compared the number of contacts and symptom frequency between the pandemic period and previous years. RESULTS: NEDIC was contacted 609 times during March 1-April 30, 2020 (72.1% individuals affected by disordered eating, 20.4% caregivers). The number of total contacts significantly increased from 2018 to 2019 and 2018 to 2020 (X2(3) = 50.34, p < .001). Among affected individuals (80.4% women), the number of contacts during the pandemic period was significantly higher (n = 439; X2(2) = 92.74, p < .001) compared to 2018 (n = 197) and 2019 (n = 312). There were higher rates of eating disorder symptoms, anxiety, and depression in 2020 compared to previous years. Thematic analysis of instant chats from the pandemic year revealed four emerging themes: 1) lack of access to treatment, 2) worsening of symptoms, 3) feeling out of control, and 4) need for support.

The nsp16 catalytic subunit of the 2'-O-MTase is unusual in its requirement for a stimulatory subunit (nsp10) to catalyze the ribose 2'-O-methylation of the viral RNA cap. Here we provide a computational basis for drug repositioning or de novo drug development based on three differential traits of the intermolecular interactions of the SARS-CoV-2-specific nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer, namely: (1) the S-adenosyl-l-methionine-binding pocket of nsp16, (2) the unique ""activating surface"" between nsp16 and nsp10, and (3) the RNA-binding groove of nsp16. We employed &#8776;9000 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved investigational and experimental drugs from the DrugBank repository for docking virtual screening. After molecular dynamics calculations of the stability of the binding modes of high-scoring nsp16/nsp10-drug complexes, we considered their pharmacological overlapping with functional modules of the virus-host interactome that is relevant to the viral lifecycle, and to the clinical features of COVID-19. Some of the predicted drugs (e.g., tegobuvir, sonidegib, siramesine, antrafenine, bemcentinib, itacitinib, or phthalocyanine) might be suitable for repurposing to pharmacologically reactivate innate immune restriction and antagonism of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs lacking 2'-O-methylation.","Encinar, José Antonio; Menendez, Javier A",Viruses,577,16

DESIGN: Rapid evidence map. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science, and COVID-19 specific databases offered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included studies in human populations susceptible to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, SARS-CoV-1/severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus/Middle East respiratory syndrome or influenza. Interventions of interest were travel-related control measures affecting travel across national or subnational borders. Outcomes of interest included infectious disease, screening, other health, economic and social outcomes. We considered all empirical studies that quantitatively evaluate impact available in Armenian, English, French, German, Italian and Russian based on the team's language capacities. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We extracted data from included studies in a standardised manner and mapped them to a priori and (one) post hoc defined categories. RESULTS: We included 122 studies assessing travel-related control measures. These studies were undertaken across the globe, most in the Western Pacific region (n=71). A large proportion of studies focused on COVID-19 (n=59), but a number of studies also examined SARS, MERS and influenza. We identified studies on border closures (n=3), entry/exit screening (n=31), travel-related quarantine (n=6), travel bans (n=8) and travel restrictions (n=25). Many addressed a bundle of travel-related control measures (n=49). Most studies assessed infectious disease (n=98) and/or screening-related (n=25) outcomes; we found only limited evidence on economic and social outcomes. Studies applied numerous methods, both inferential and descriptive in nature, ranging from simple observational methods to complex modelling techniques. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base on travel-related control measures. While this map is not sufficient to assess the effectiveness of different measures, it outlines aspects regarding interventions and outcomes, as well as study methodology and reporting that could inform future research and evidence synthesis.","Movsisyan, Ani; Burns, Jacob; Biallas, Renke; Coenen, Michaela; Geffert, Karin; Horstick, Olaf; Klerings, Irma; Pfadenhauer, Lisa Maria; von Philipsborn, Peter; Sell, Kerstin; Strahwald, Brigitte; Stratil, Jan M; Voss, Stephan; Rehfuess, Eva",BMJ Open,577,1

499158,499158,499158,"Social stability challenged by Covid-19: Pandemics, inequality and policy responses",17.07338,2.3504238,2020,"Background: Vaccination is an important tool in the fight against pandemics. However, the associated adverse events (AEs) may negatively impact the public perception of vaccines, therefore leading to decreased vaccination willingness. Interestingly, pharmacovigilance data of the three COVID-19 vaccines with a two-dose schedule approved in the EU (AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Moderna) already revealed country-specific differences in their safety profile early on (as of February 2021), at a time when the accumulated occurrence of specific AEs was not yet known. In the safety outcome assessment presented here, we aimed to establish whether these country-specific differences in pharmacovigilance data could be explained by differences in the frequency of AEs as reported in the respective approval studies of each vaccine. Methods: A systematic search was performed to identify all publications regarding the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of two-dose vaccines approved in the EU (AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Moderna), including regulatory reports and journal articles. All obtained safety data was manually entered into an SQL database. In order to enable the comparability among the data, the solicited AEs for all vaccines (i.e. those AEs actively sought after vaccination) were investigated. The data was standardized to promote comparability and overcome data heterogeneity and complexity. Findings: Twelve documents regarding the RCTs for the three COVID-19 vaccines with a two-dose schedule approved in the EU (AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Moderna) were included in the safety outcome analysis. The entire safety data compiled in the SQL database amounted to 66 different study arms. The data structure revealed 13 different age thresholds or ranges and three different data sets regarding doses (first dose vs. second dose vs. all doses). After standardization and identification of subgroups, the analyses demonstrated that the highest rates of AEs occur after the first dose with the AstraZeneca vaccine, whereas with Moderna and BioNTech most AEs occur after the second dose. Astonishingly, the absolute frequencies of each AE after the first AstraZeneca dose correspond to those of the second dose of the mRNA vaccines (BioNTech and Moderna). Reversely, the absolute frequencies of the same AEs after the second AstraZeneca dose correspond to those of the first dose with the mRNA vaccines. The most common AEs with any vaccine were fatigue, headache and myalgia. Moreover, middle-aged subjects (18 to 55 years) had more side effects than older individuals (> 55 years), an observation that persisted among vaccines. Interpretation: This is the first indirect comparison of these vaccines that uses all available RCT data. The absolute frequency of each AE is similar between the first AstraZeneca dose and the second dose of BioNTech or Moderna; their occurrence was thus independent of platform (vector or mRNA) or the vaccine itself. This assessment demonstrates that the varying frequencies of AEs reported in early pharmacovigilance data for the vaccines in distinct countries, at a time when the accumulated occurrence of specific AEs with certain vaccines was not yet known, cannot be explained by different frequencies being reported in the respective RCTs. Conclusion: The approach presented here could help to objectify future discussions on vaccine preferences. Therefore, it may serve as basis for future public awareness campaigns and may also allow the comparison of vaccine performance in different subgroups (e.g. virus variants, high-risk patients). This approach may also be applied to a broad range of other challenges across the R&D process and various disease categories.","Behrens, Claudia; Gasperazzo, Tatiana; Samii-Moghadam, Maria; Lampe, Johannes B.",,577,6

A paucity of data on PPE burn rate (PPE consumption over time) in pandemic situations exacerbated these issues as there was little historic research to indicate volumes of PPE required to care for surges in infective patients and thus plan procurement requirements. METHODS: To better understand PPE requirements for care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in our Australian quaternary referral hospital, the number of staff-to-patient interactions in a 24-h period for three patient groups (ward-based COVID suspect, ward-based COVID confirmed, intensive care COVID confirmed) was audited prospectively from 1st to 30th April 2020. RESULTS: The average number of staff-to-patient interactions in a 24-h period was: 13.1 ± 5.0 (mean ± SD) for stable ward-managed COVID-19 suspect patients; 11.9 ± 3.8 for stable ward-managed confirmed COVID-19 patients; and 30.0 ± 5.3 for stable, mechanically ventilated, ICU-managed COVID-19 patients. This data can be used in PPE demand simulation modelling for COVID-19 and potentially other respiratory illnesses. CONCLUSION: Data on the average number of staff-to-patient interactions needed for the care of COVID-19 patients is presented.

We reported 2 cases of shoulder weakness and amyotrophy related to spinal accessory nerve (SAN) palsy due to neuralgic amyotrophy occurring after COVID-19 infection. METHODS: For both patients, clinical history, clinical examination, electrodiagnostic (EDX), and imaging examinations invalidated other diagnoses but confirmed NA diagnosis. RESULTS: The NA involved only the SAN in both cases. EDX revealed a characteristic axonal lesion found in NA. SAN conduction study revealed normal latencies and low compound motor action potential amplitude for trapezius muscle when needle examination demonstrated a neurogenic pattern and denervation signs in the trapezius muscle. Both patient's MRI revealed denervation T2 hypersignal in impaired muscles, and hypersignal of the involved roots, trunks, or nerves without any mass, cyst, injury, fibrous band, or tearing signs along SAN course.

Poor sepsis prognosis is also associated with low zinc levels and the release of High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from activated and/or necrotic cells. HMGB1 added to whole blood at physiological pH did not bind leukocyte receptors, but lowering pH with lactic acid to mimic sepsis conditions allowed binding, implying the presence of natural inhibitor(s) preventing binding at normal pH. Testing micromolar concentrations of divalent cations showed that zinc supported the robust binding of sialylated glycoproteins with HMGB1. Further characterizing HMGB1 as a sialic acid-binding lectin, we found that optimal binding takes place at normal blood pH and is markedly reduced when pH is adjusted with lactic acid to levels found in sepsis. Glycan array studies confirmed the binding of HMGB1 to sialylated glycan sequences typically found on plasma glycoproteins, with binding again being dependent on zinc and normal blood pH. Thus, HMGB1-mediated hyperactivation of innate immunity in sepsis requires acidosis, and micromolar zinc concentrations are protective. We suggest that the potent inflammatory effects of HMGB1 are kept in check via sequestration by plasma sialoglycoproteins at physiological pH and triggered when pH and zinc levels fall in late stages of sepsis. Current clinical trials independently studying zinc supplementation, HMGB1 inhibition, or pH normalization may be more successful if these approaches are combined and perhaps supplemented by infusions of heavily sialylated molecules.","Siddiqui, Shoib S; Dhar, Chirag; Sundaramurthy, Venkatasubramaniam; Sasmal, Aniruddha; Yu, Hai; Bandala-Sanchez, Esther; Li, Miaomiao; Zhang, Xiaoxiao; Chen, Xi; Harrison, Leonard C; Xu, Ding; Varki, Ajit",Proc.

By February 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The analysis reveals that financial markets may underreact to the announcements by taking a finite time to re-adjust prices, thus moving against the efficient market hypothesis. We observe that this empirical regularity can be related to the speculative behavior of market participants, whose willingness to switch toward better performing investment strategies, as well as their degree of reactivity to price trend or mispricing, can induce long-lasting volatility cascades.","Spelta, Alessandro; Pecora, Nicolò; Flori, Andrea; Giudici, Paolo",Ann Oper Res,577,1

This prospective study aimed to investigate whether general psychopathology and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity increased during the pandemic as compared to prepandemic baseline data collected approximately 1 year earlier. Furthermore, we investigated whether an increase in symptomatology was linked to CTEs and mediated by a lack of perceived social support and fear of COVID-19. An online survey was administered to 85 individuals, including both participants with PTSD, major depression, or somatic symptom disorder (n = 63) and healthy volunteers (n = 22), during a period of the most severe social restrictions in Germany. The survey included the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Brief Symptom Inventory, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, ENRICHD Social Support Inventory, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale. In the whole sample, we found significant increases in general psychopathology and PTSD symptom severity, &#969;2 = .07-.08, during as compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic, with CTEs predicting increased PTSD symptom severity, ß = .245, p = .042.

METHODS: Retrospective data on PED visits at British Columbia Children's Hospital were collected between December 1, 2019, and August 31, 2020, and for 2 previous years. An interrupted time-series analysis was performed to estimate the difference in daily visits after stay-at-home orders on March 17, 2020, as well as before and after. Further analysis was performed to estimate the drop and recovery of admission and visits by age and acuity. RESULTS: After adjustment for year and seasonality, we documented a drop in the expected number of daily visits of 83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 78-89) after stay-at-home orders. Thereafter, daily visits increased by 12.9 (95% CI, 11.3-14.4) every month. Probability of admission adjusted for seasonality and acuity increased 6.9% (95% CI, 4.9%-9.0%) after stay-at-home orders and decreased in the odds of -0.7% (95% CI, -1% to -0.4%) monthly thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has had a dramatic and lasting impact on the number of PED visits, with contracted rates 6 months into the pandemic. Further increase in acuity-adjusted rate of admissions after stay at home orders suggests that individuals may be delaying arrival to the emergency department. Further assessment is needed to determine if patients are seeking care through other venues or not seeking care altogether.","Irvine, Michael A; Portales-Casamar, Elodie; Goldman, Ran D",Pediatr Emerg Care,577,4

Varying COVID-19 health burden and alcohol policies may have contributed to different consumption trends between states. The aim of this study is to assess trends in alcohol consumption and moderation by state of residence. METHODS: We examined trends in adult drinking days, during the first wave of the pandemic (March 10 to June 8) using longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study (N = 6,172 unique participants; N = 28,059 observations). Because state mandates were responsive to disease burden, we modeled the interaction of time by COVID-19 burden, defined as whether the state had the median (or higher) daily incidence of COVID-19 cases on the survey date, and state random effects. We controlled for individual sociodemographics, perceived personal/familial COVID-19 burden, mental health symptomology, and risk avoidance. RESULTS: Drinking days increased throughout the duration (incidence risk ratio [IRR] for drinking per increase in one calendar day = 1.003, 95% CI 1.001, 1.004); trends were heterogeneous by disease burden, with individuals living in states with lower COVID-19 burden increasing (IRR = 1.005, 95% CI 1.003, 1.007) faster than those living in states with higher COVID-19 burden (IRR = 1.000, 95% CI 0.998, 1.002). Trends were heterogeneous between states, but there was no evidence of systematic geographic clustering of state trends. CONCLUSIONS: Drinking days increased during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among residents of states with lower disease burden.","McKetta, Sarah; Morrison, Christopher N; Keyes, Katherine M",Alcohol Clin Exp Res,577,16

COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis 1. Minimize regulatory burden by all agencies so that critically ill COVID-19 patients will have access regardless of their financial circumstance.2. Institute appropriate safeguards to avoid negative consequences from unscrupulous actors.3. With proper informed consent from patients or proxy when necessary, and subject to accumulation of data in that cohort, allow the procedure to be initiated in critically ill patients who are not responding to conventional therapies.KEY WORDS: Coronavirus, COVID-19, cytokine storm, multiorgan failure, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.","Atluri, Sairam; Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Hirsch, Joshua A",Pain Physician,577,22

Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of the non-neovascular (dry) type of AMD. Late-stage clinical trials suggest that intravitreal injections of novel therapeutics may slow down the rate of GA progression by up to 30% in 1 year, thus allowing people with GA to preserve central vision for a longer period. While intravitreal injections have become an established treatment modality for neovascular (wet) AMD, it is unknown whether patients with (more gradually progressing) GA would accept regular injections that slow down, but do not stop or reverse, vision loss. Therefore, this mixed-methods pilot study will aim to explore whether regular intravitreal injections will be acceptable as treatment for patients with GA, and the factors that may affect treatment acceptability. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A mixed-methods survey has been designed in collaboration with a GA patient advisory group. The survey comprises of structured questionnaires, semi-structured interview questions regarding patients' perceptions of intravitreal injections and the burden of treatment, and a task eliciting preferences between different potential treatments. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, this study will be conducted remotely by telephone. Thirty individuals will be recruited from NHS Medical Retina clinics at Central Middlesex Hospital, London. Half of the participants will be naïve to intravitreal injections, while half will have previous experience of intravitreal injections for neovascular (wet) AMD. Qualitative data analysis will be conducted using the Framework Method of analysis to identify key themes from participants' accounts. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study received Health Research Authority approval on 23 March 2021 (IRAS Project ID: 287824). Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations to the medical retina community, as well as through dialogue with patients and macular disease charities.","Enoch, Jamie; Ghulakhszian, Arevik; Crabb, David P; Dinah, Christiana; Taylor, Deanna J",BMJ Open,577,15

Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin 6 receptor, may counteract the inflammatory cytokine release syndrome in patients with severe COVID-19 illness. Objective: To test whether tocilizumab decreases mortality in this population. Design, Setting, and Participants: The data for this study were derived from a multicenter cohort study of 4485 adults with COVID-19 admitted to participating intensive care units (ICUs) at 68 hospitals across the US from March 4 to May 10, 2020. Critically ill adults with COVID-19 were categorized according to whether they received or did not receive tocilizumab in the first 2 days of admission to the ICU. Data were collected retrospectively until June 12, 2020. A Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for confounding. Exposures: Treatment with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Time to death, compared via hazard ratios (HRs), and 30-day mortality, compared via risk differences. Results: Among the 3924 patients included in the analysis (2464 male [62.8%]; median age, 62 [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-71] years), 433 (11.0%) received tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Patients treated with tocilizumab were younger (median age, 58 [IQR, 48-65] vs 63 [IQR, 52-72] years) and had a higher prevalence of hypoxemia on ICU admission (205 of 433 [47.3%] vs 1322 of 3491 [37.9%] with mechanical ventilation and a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen of <200 mm Hg) than patients not treated with tocilizumab. After applying inverse probability weighting, baseline and severity-of-illness characteristics were well balanced between groups. A total of 1544 patients (39.3%) died, including 125 (28.9%) treated with tocilizumab and 1419 (40.6%) not treated with tocilizumab. In the primary analysis, during a median follow-up of 27 (IQR, 14-37) days, patients treated with tocilizumab had a lower risk of death compared with those not treated with tocilizumab (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.92). The estimated 30-day mortality was 27.5% (95% CI, 21.2%-33.8%) in the tocilizumab-treated patients and 37.1% (95% CI, 35.5%-38.7%) in the non-tocilizumab-treated patients (risk difference, 9.6%; 95% CI, 3.1%-16.0%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this cohort study, the risk of in-hospital mortality in this study was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission compared with patients whose treatment did not include early use of tocilizumab. However, the findings may be susceptible to unmeasured confounding, and further research from randomized clinical trials is needed.","Gupta, Shruti; Wang, Wei; Hayek, Salim S; Chan, Lili; Mathews, Kusum S; Melamed, Michal L; Brenner, Samantha K; Leonberg-Yoo, Amanda; Schenck, Edward J; Radbel, Jared; Reiser, Jochen; Bansal, Anip; Srivastava, Anand; Zhou, Yan; Finkel, Diana; Green, Adam; Mallappallil, Mary; Faugno, Anthony J; Zhang, Jingjing; Velez, Juan Carlos Q; Shaefi, Shahzad; Parikh, Chirag R; Charytan, David M; Athavale, Ambarish M; Friedman, Allon N; Redfern, Roberta E; Short, Samuel A P; Correa, Simon; Pokharel, Kapil K; Admon, Andrew J; Donnelly, John P; Gershengorn, Hayley B; Douin, David J; Semler, Matthew W; Hernán, Miguel A; Leaf, David E",JAMA Intern Med,577,11

It is expected that the world will need to battle the COVID-19 pandemic with precautious measures, until an effective vaccine is developed. This paper proposes a real-time COVID-19 detection and monitoring system. The proposed system would employ an Internet of Things (IoTs) framework to collect real-time symptom data from users to early identify suspected coronaviruses cases, to monitor the treatment response of those who have already recovered from the virus, and to understand the nature of the virus by collecting and analyzing relevant data. The framework consists of five main components: Symptom Data Collection and Uploading (using wearable sensors), Quarantine/Isolation Center, Data Analysis Center (that uses machine learning algorithms), Health Physicians, and Cloud Infrastructure. To quickly identify potential coronaviruses cases from this real-time symptom data, this work proposes eight machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Decision Table, Decision Stump, OneR, and ZeroR. An experiment was conducted to test these eight algorithms on a real COVID-19 symptom dataset, after selecting the relevant symptoms. The results show that five of these eight algorithms achieved an accuracy of more than 90 %. Based on these results we believe that real-time symptom data would allow these five algorithms to provide effective and accurate identification of potential cases of COVID-19, and the framework would then document the treatment response for each patient who has contracted the virus.","Otoom, Mwaffaq; Otoum, Nesreen; Alzubaidi, Mohammad A.; Etoom, Yousef; Banihani, Rudaina",Biomed.

Seventy-five patients with COVID-19 were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and they were classified into moderate, severe and critically severe types according to the disease severity. The basic information, blood routine, pneumonia-related blood indexes, immune-related indexes along with liver, kidney and myocardial indexes in patients with different types were analyzed. The analysis of immune-related indexes showed that the proportions of critically severe patients with abnormal interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4 were higher than those of severe and moderate patients. In addition, the proportion of patients with abnormal total cholesterol increased as the severity of disease increased, and the proportion in critically severe patients was significantly higher than that in moderate patients. The patients with a more severe COVID-19 are older and more likely to have a history of hypertension. With the progression of COVID-19, the abnormal proportion of total white blood cell, neutrophils, lymphocytes, IL-2, IL-4, and total cholesterol increased. The change of these indexes in patients with different COVID-19 types could provide reference for the disease severity identification and diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, the change in the total cholesterol level suggested that COVID-19 would induce some liver function damage in patients.","Zhao, Yi; Zhou, Jie; Pan, Liuhua; Zhang, Yujie; Wang, Honggang; Wu, Wei; He, Jingsong; Chen, Jun; Huang, He",J. med. virol,577,1

This study develops an optimized ensemble deep learning (OEDL) framework wherein these two machine learning techniques are jointly used to achieve synergistic improvements in model accuracy, stability, scalability, and reproducibility prompting a new wave of applications in the forecasting of dynamics. Unpredictability is considered as one of the key features of chaotic dynamics, so forecasting such dynamics of nonlinear systems is a relevant issue in the scientific community. It becomes more challenging when the prediction of extreme events is the focus issue for us. In this circumstance, the proposed OEDL model based on a best convex combination of feed-forward neural networks, reservoir computing, and long short-term memory can play a key role in advancing predictions of dynamics consisting of extreme events. The combined framework can generate the best out-of-sample performance than the individual deep learners and standard ensemble framework for both numerically simulated and real world data sets.

Multiple concomitant conditions or results caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are high risk factors for thrombosis. Recently, platelet activation and platelet-mediated immune inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection were also found to be the contributors to the thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. In addition to thrombus scoring system, D-dimer is an excellent indicator for monitoring thrombosis.

Most of the critically ill patients received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy. However, the experience of HFNC in this population is lacking. Methods: We retrospectively screened 318 confirmed patients with NCIP in two hospitals of Chongqing, China, from January 1st to March 4th, 2020. Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation. HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy. Results: Of the 17 HFNC patients, 7 (41%) experienced HFNC failure. The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6) in patients with PaO2/FiO2&gt; 200 mm Hg vs. 63% (7/11) in those with PaO2/FiO2≤ 200 mm Hg (p = 0.04). Compared with baseline data, the respiratory rate significantly decreased after 1–2 h of HFNC in successful group [median 26 (IQR: 25–29) vs. 23 (22–25), p = 0.03]. However, it did not in the unsuccessful group. After initiation of NIV as rescue therapy among the 7 patients with HFNC failure, PaO2/FiO2significantly improved after 1–2 h of NIV [median 172 (150–208) mmHg vs. 114 (IQR: 79–130) under HFNC, p = 0.04]. However, two out of seven (29%) patients with NIV as rescue therapy ultimately received intubation. Among the 27 patients with severe acute respiratory failure, four patients were eventually intubated (15%). Conclusions: Our study indicated that HFNC was the most common ventilation support for patients with NCIP.

Of 327 telehealth visits, only 5.8% converted to in-person during the 4-month period with the most cited reason being patient preference (68.4%). Of the 196 surgeries performed during the pandemic, 29.1% occurred during quarantine, 49.0% during the plateau, and 21.9% occurred in the second peak. No COVID negative patients developed symptoms at follow-up. 55.6% were performed on malignant tumors and 31.6% were benign with no difference in case volumes throughout the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Despite exceptional challenges, we have maintained a high-volume surgical neuro-oncology practice at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide the protocols implemented at our institution in order to maximize neuro-oncology care while mitigating risk of COVID-19 exposure to both patients and providers.","Luther, Evan; Burks, Joshua; Eichberg, Daniel G; Basil, Gregory; Berry, Katherine; Lu, Victor; Shah, Ashish; Kaur, Gurvinder; Ivan, Michael; Komotar, Ricardo",J Clin Neurosci,577,29

Rich argue that, despite decades of research suggesting South Korean public support for unification, changing conceptions of what constitutes the nation along with limited public interest may have shifted unification support. Einhorn and Rich find not only greater support for peaceful coexistence, but also disaggregate the role of ethnic pride and ethnic conceptualizations of the nation on both unification and peaceful coexistence sentiments. [...]frequency of thinking about North Korea has little influence on perceptions of either outcome.

Ozone therapy increases interest in new neuroprotective strategies that may represent therapeutic targets for minimizing the effects of oxidative stress. METHODS: The overview examines the latest literature in neurological pathologies treated with ozone therapy as well as our own experience with ozone therapy. The effectiveness of treatments is connected to the ability of ozone therapy to reactivate the antioxidant system to address oxidative stress for chronic neurodegenerative diseases, strokes, and other pathologies. Application options include large and small autohemotherapy, intramuscular application, intra-articular, intradiscal, paravertebral and epidural, non-invasive rectal, transdermal, mucosal, or ozonated oils and ointments. The combination of different types of ozone therapy stimulates the benefits of the effects of ozone. RESULTS: Clinical studies on O2-O3 therapy have been shown to be efficient in the treatment of neurological degenerative disorders, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, orthopedic, gastrointestinal and genitourinary pathologies, fibromyalgia, skin diseases/wound healing, diabetes/ulcers, infectious diseases, and lung diseases, including the pandemic disease caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. CONCLUSION: Ozone therapy is a relatively fast administration of ozone gas. When the correct dose is administered, no side effects occur. Further clinical and experimental studies will be needed to determine the optimal administration schedule and to evaluate the combination of ozone therapy with other therapies to increase the effectiveness of treatment.","Masan, J.; Sramka, M.; Rabarova, D.",Neuro Endocrinol Lett,577,32

The objective of our analysis is to determine the impact of age, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, comorbidities, and ethnicity on the duration of COVID-19 PCR positivity among hospitalized patients in a large group of hospital. Method: We studied 530 patients from a large hospital system and time to SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA PCR negativity at any-time during hospitalization or following discharge from the hospital was the primary endpoint. We included patients 18 years or older who tested positive for COVID-19 during an inpatient, outpatient, or emergency room visit between February 1, 2020, and April 14, 2020. Results: Overall, 315 (59.4%) of our patient population continued to have a positive SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA PCR 4 weeks after the initial positive test. We found that age>70 years, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, or coronary artery disease are associated with persistent PCR positivity for more than 4 weeks after initial diagnosis.

As of the 31st of May, 2020, there have been more than 6 million COVID-19 cases diagnosed worldwide and over 370,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. Thousands of SARS-CoV-2 strains have been sequenced to date, providing a valuable opportunity to investigate the evolution of the virus on a global scale. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of over 1,225 SARS-CoV-2 genomes spanning from late December 2019 to mid-March 2020. We identified a missense mutation, D614G, in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which has emerged as a predominant clade in Europe (954 of 1,449 (66%) sequences) and is spreading worldwide (1,237 of 2,795 (44%) sequences). Molecular dating analysis estimated the emergence of this clade around mid-to-late January (10-25 January) 2020. We also applied structural bioinformatics to assess the potential impact of D614G on the virulence and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In silico analyses on the spike protein structure suggests that the mutation is most likely neutral to protein function as it relates to its interaction with the human ACE2 receptor. The lack of clinical metadata available prevented our investigation of association between viral clade and disease severity phenotype.

Clinical application in particular benefits from increasing our understanding of imagination, as well as non-invasive means of influencing it. To investigate imagination, this study draws from the prior observation that music can influence the imagined content during non-directed mind-wandering, as well as the finding that relative orientation within time and space is retained in imagination. One hundred participants performed a directed imagination task that required watching a video of a figure travelling towards a barely visible landmark, and then closing their eyes and imagining a continuation of the journey. During each imagined journey, participants either listened to music or silence. After the imagined journeys, participants reported vividness, the imagined time passed and distance travelled, as well as the imagined content. Bayesian mixed effects models reveal strong evidence that vividness, sentiment, as well imagined time passed and distances travelled, are influenced by the music, and show that aspects of these effects can be modelled through features such as tempo. The results highlight music’s potential to support therapies such as Exposure Therapy and Imagery Rescripting, which deploy directed imagination as a clinical tool.","Herff, Steffen A.; Cecchetti, Gabriele; Taruffi, Liila; Déguernel, Ken",Sci Rep,577,9

We aimed to estimate the cumulative attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in hemodialysis patients in China using a serological test. METHOD: We enrolled all hemodialysis patients from 8 hemodialysis facilities in Honghu and Jingzhou of Huibei province and Guangzhou and Foshan of Guangdong province in China. We screened these patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection by both a RT–PCR test for viral RNA and a serological test for IgG and IgM antibodies. Data on demographics and clinical characteristics were collected via case report forms. We also enrolled the healthcare workers (HCWs) from the participating hospitals and compared the seropositive rate between hemodialysis patients and HCWs in the same region. RESULT: Among 1,542 hemodialysis patients, 5 (0.32%) and 51 (3.3%) were tested positive by the RT-PCR test and the serological test, respectively. The seropositive rate in Hubei (3.6%) was higher than that in Guangdong (2.8%), though the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.5). Most of the seropositive patients were asymptomatic. Older than 65 years, having manifestation of lung infection in imaging examines, and lower level of serum albumin were independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In comparison, the seropositive rate in 3,205 HCWs was 1.2% which was significantly lower than that observed in the hemodialysis patients (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The cumulative rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hemodialysis patients in China was high at 3.3%. Serological test detected 10 times more cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the RT-PCR test and should be the preferred tool for estimating the prevalence of COVID-19.","Xu, Xin; Nie, Sheng; Sun, Jian; Kong, Yaozhong; Liang, Min; Li, Dongfeng; Ma, Tean; Peng, Jiaqing; Gao, Shikui; Shao, Yong; Zha, Yan; Peng, Gangyi; Ren, Chanjun; Huang, Ailong; Hou, Fan Fan",Kidney Int Rep,577,16

Among them, Celiac disease (CeD) is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease causing a plethora of symptoms from diarrhea and malabsorption to lymphoma. Even though GRDs have been intensively studied, the environmental triggers promoting the diverse reactions to gluten proteins in susceptible individuals remain elusive. It has been proposed that pathogens could act as disease-causing environmental triggers of CeD by molecular mimicry mechanisms. Additionally, it could also be possible that unrecognized molecular, structural, and physical parallels between gluten and pathogens have a relevant role. Herein, we report sequence, structural and physical similarities of the two most relevant gluten peptides, the 33-mer and p31-43 gliadin peptides, with bacterial pathogens using bioinformatics going beyond the molecular mimicry hypothesis. First, a stringent BLASTp search using the two gliadin peptides identified high sequence similarity regions within pathogen-derived proteins, e.g., extracellular proteins from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Granulicatella sp. Second, molecular dynamics calculations of an updated α-2-gliadin model revealed close spatial localization and solvent-exposure of the 33-mer and p31-43 peptide, which was compared with the pathogen-related proteins by homology models and localization predictors. We found putative functions of the identified pathogen-derived sequence by identifying T-cell epitopes and SH3/WW-binding domains. Finally, shape and size parallels between the pathogens and the superstructures of gliadin peptides gave rise to novel hypotheses about activation of innate immunity and dysbiosis. Based on our structural findings and the similarities with the bacterial pathogens, evidence emerges that these pathologically relevant gluten-derived peptides could behave as non-replicating pathogens opening new research questions in the interface of innate immunity, microbiome, and food research.","Vazquez, Diego S.; Schilbert, Hanna M.; Dodero, Veronica I.",Int J Mol Sci,577,21

The drug is known to have low oral bioavailability (37%) which may be attributed to its relatively high molecular weight, low solubility, dissolution rate, and incomplete intestinal absorption. To overcome these drawbacks, liquid (L) and solid (S) self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDs) of AZM were developed and optimized. Eight different pseudo-ternary diagrams were constructed based on the drug solubility and the emulsification studies in various SEDDs excipients at different surfactant to co-surfactant (Smix) ratios. Droplet size (DS) < 150 nm, dispersity (Đ) ≤ 0.7, and transmittance (T)% > 85 in three diluents of distilled water (DW), 0.1 mM HCl, and simulated intestinal fluids (SIF) were considered as the selection criteria. The final formulations of L-SEDDs (L-F1((H))), and S-SEDDs (S-F1((H))) were able to meet the selection requirements. Both formulations were proven to be cytocompatible and able to open up the cellular epithelial tight junctions (TJ). The drug dissolution studies showed that after 5 min > 90% and 52.22% of the AZM was released from liquid and solid SEDDs formulations in DW, respectively, compared to 11.27% of the pure AZM, suggesting the developed SEDDs may enhance the oral delivery of the drug.

Adequately cleaning surfaces in patient rooms is an essential part of this fight to reduce the spread. Traditional audits, however, are insufficient. This study assesses surface cleaning practices using UV marker technology and the extent to which this technology can help improve cleaning audits and practices. METHODS: 144 audits (1,235 surfaces) were retrieved. UV marker cleaning audits conducted at a major teaching hospital in 2018 after implementing a new cleaning protocol. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with cleaning staff and supervisors. RESULTS: On average, 63% of surfaces were appropriately cleaned. Toilet handles (80%) and toilet seats underside (83%) scored highest while main room sink fixtures (54%), light switch (55%) and bedrails (56%) scored lowest. Training, staffing and time constraints may play a role in low cleaning rates. DISCUSSION: The high-touch patient surfaces in the bedroom remain neglected and a potential source of infections. UV marker audits provided an objective measure of cleaning practices that managers and staff were unaware of.

Particularly, the tRNA pool has been adapted to the host genes. If the virus intends to translate its own RNA, then it has to compete with the abundant host mRNAs for the tRNA molecules. Translation initiation is the rate-limiting step during protein synthesis. The tRNAs carrying the initiation Methionine (iMet) recognize the start codon termed initiation ATG (iATG). Other normal Met-carrying tRNAs recognize the internal ATGs. The tAI of virus genes is significantly lower than the tAI of human genes. This disadvantage in translation elongation of viral RNAs must be compensated by more efficient initiation rates. In the human genome, the abundance of iMet–tRNAs to Met–tRNAs is five times higher than the iATG to ATG ratio. However, when SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells, the iMet has an 8.5-time enrichment to iATG. We collected 58 virus species and found that the enrichment of iMet is higher in all viruses compared to human. Our study indicates that the genome sequences of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 have the advantage of competing for the iMet–tRNAs with host mRNAs. The capture of iMet–tRNAs allows the fast translation initiation and the reproduction of virus itself, which compensates the lower tAI of viral genes. This might explain why the virus could rapidly translate its own RNA and reproduce itself from the sea of host mRNAs. Meanwhile, our study reminds the researchers not to ignore the mutations related to ATGs.","Wang, Yan; Gai, Yanhong; Li, Yuefan; Li, Chunxiao; Li, Ziliang; Wang, Xuekun",Mol Genet Genomics,577,27

We aimed to determine the prevalence of subclinical myocardial dysfunction and its association with mortality using speckle tracking echocardiography (STE), specifically global longitudinal strain (GLS) and myocardial work efficiency (MWE). We also tested the hypothesis that reduced myocardial function was associated with increased systemic inflammation in COVID-19. Methods and Results: We conducted a retrospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients undergoing echocardiography (n = 136), of whom 83 and 75 had GLS (abnormal >−16%) and MWE (abnormal <95%) assessed, respectively. We performed adjusted logistic regression to examine associations of GLS and MWE with in-hospital mortality. Patients were mean 62 ± 14 years old (58% men). While 81% had normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), prevalence of myocardial dysfunction was high by STE; [39/83 (47%) had abnormal GLS; 59/75 (79%) had abnormal MWE]. Higher MWE was associated with lower in-hospital mortality in unadjusted [OR 0.92 (95% CI 0.85–0.99); p = 0.048] and adjusted models [aOR 0.87 (95% CI 0.78–0.97); p = 0.009]. In addition, increased systemic inflammation measured by interleukin-6 level was associated with reduced MWE. Conclusions: Subclinical myocardial dysfunction is common in COVID-19 patients with clinical echocardiograms, even in those with normal LVEF. Reduced MWE is associated with higher interleukin-6 levels and increased in-hospital mortality. Non-invasive STE represents a readily available method to rapidly evaluate myocardial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and can play an important role in risk stratification.","Minhas, Anum S.; Gilotra, Nisha A.; Goerlich, Erin; Metkus, Thomas; Garibaldi, Brian T.; Sharma, Garima; Bavaro, Nicole; Phillip, Susan; Michos, Erin D.; Hays, Allison G.",Front Cardiovasc Med,577,10

We have seen the proliferation of statements of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and commitments to fight racism and health inequities from academia, nonprofit organizations, governmental agencies, and private corporations. Actions must now arise from these promises. As public health and EHS scientists, we must examine the systems that produce and perpetuate inequities in exposure to environmental pollutants and associated health effects. OBJECTIVES: We outline five recommendations the EHS research community can implement to confront racism and move our science forward for eliminating racial inequities in environmental health. DISCUSSION: Race is best considered a political label that promotes inequality. Thus, we should be wary of equating race with biology. Further, EHS researchers should seriously consider racism as a plausible explanation of racial disparities in health and consider structural racism as a factor in environmental health risk/impact assessments, as well as multiple explanations for racial differences in environmental exposures and health outcomes. Last, the EHS research community should develop metrics to measure racism and a set of guidelines on the use and interpretation of race and ethnicity within the environmental sciences. Numerous guidelines exist in other disciplines that can serve as models. By taking action on each of these recommendations, we can make significant progress toward eliminating racial disparities. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8186","Payne-Sturges, Devon C.; Gee, Gilbert C.; Cory-Slechta, Deborah A.",Environ Health Perspect,577,16

The seasonable distribution of the disease suggested that meteorological factors may influence the incidence of mumps. The aim of this study was to explore the possible association between meteorological factors and the incidence of mumps, and to provide scientific evidence to relevant health authorities for the disease control and prevention. METHODS: We obtained the data of mumps cases and daily meteorological factors in Fujian Province in Eastern China over the period of 2005–2013. Using distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) approach, we assessed the relationship between the meteorological factors and mumps incidence. RESULTS: The effects of meteorological factors on the mumps incidence were all non-linear. Compared with the lowest risk values, the upper level of precipitation, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity could increase the risk of mumps, whereas the low level of wind velocity, temperature, diurnal temperature range and sunshine duration may also increase the risk. Moderate atmospheric pressure and low wind velocity had larger cumulative effects within 30 lag days and the relative risks were 10.02 (95%CI: 2.47–40.71) and 12.45 (95%CI: 1.40–110.78). For temperature, the cumulative effect within 30 lag days of minimum temperature was higher than that from maximum temperature in most populations. The cumulative effects of minimum temperature for males, children aged 10–14 and students were higher than those in other populations.

Massive application and generation of a protective local mucosal and humoral immunity with no adverse effects is the main goal for this strategy. Live virus vaccines can be improved by adding adjuvants to boost mucosal innate and adaptive responses. In a previous study we showed that diatomaceous earth (DE) can be used as adjuvant in inactivated vaccines. The aim of this study was to test DE as adjuvant in an Ark-DPI live infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccine after ocular or spray application. Titrating the virus alone or after addition of DE showed that DE had no detrimental effect on the vaccine virus. However, adding DE to the vaccine did not induce higher IgG titers in the serum and IgA titers in tears. It also did not affect the frequency of CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells and monocytes/macrophages in the blood and the spleen determined by flow cytometry. In addition, protection generated against IBV homologous challenges, measured by viral load in tears, respiratory signs and histopathology in tracheas, did not vary when DE was present in the vaccine formulation. Finally, we confirmed through our observations that Ark vaccines administered by hatchery spray cabinet elicit weaker immune responses and protection against an IBV homologous challenge compared to the same vaccine delivered via ocular route.","Nazmi, Ali; Hauck, Rüdiger; Corbeil, Lynette B.; Gallardo, Rodrigo A.",Poult Sci,577,1

It draws attention to the effects of the pandemic across five member countries of the Organisation Mondiale pour l’ Education Préscolaire (OMEP)—Australia, China, Japan, Korea and Thailand. The authors describe initial responses to control the spread of the pandemic in each national context and identify socio-political factors that enable broad understandings of national responses to COVID-19. In relation to the ECEC sector, responses are discussed in terms of cultural differences, economic issues, educational and professional concerns and educator wellbeing. While important government actions have rightly focused on virus suppression, it also remains important to maintain attention on the rights of children to ensure that the health crisis does not also become a child’s rights crisis and that sufficient attention is given to children’s safety and wellbeing.","Park, Eunhye; Logan, Helen; Zhang, Li; Kamigaichi, Nobuko; Kulapichitr, Udomluck",Int J Early Child,577,23

We hypothesized that IgM and IgA enriched immunoglobulin G may support the sepsis-related phase improving patient outcome. We conducted a retrospective case–control study on 47 consecutive patients admitted to our ICU. At the time of admission, patients received anticoagulants (heparin sodium) together with the standard supportive treatment. We decided to add IgM and IgA enriched immunoglobulin G to the standard therapy. Patients receiving IgM and IgA enriched immunoglobulin G were compared with patients with similar baseline characteristics and treatment, receiving only standard therapy. The mortality resulted significantly higher in patients treated with standard therapy only (56.5 vs. 37.5%, p < 0.01) and, at day 7, the probability of dying was 3 times higher in this group. Variable life adjustment display (VLAD) was 2.4 and −2.2 (in terms of lives saved in relation with those expected and derived from Simplified Acute Physiology Score II) in the treated and not treated group, respectively. The treatment based on IgM and IgA enriched immunoglobulin G infusion seems to give an advantage on survival in SARS-CoV-2 severe infection.","Corona, Alberto; Richini, Giuseppe; Simoncini, Sara; Zangrandi, Marta; Biasini, Monica; Russo, Giuseppe; Pasqua, Mauro; Santorsola, Clemente; Gregorini, Camilla; Giordano, Chiara",Antibiotics (Basel),577,17

The absence of P. medius genome sequence presents an important obstacle for further studies of virus–host interactions and better understanding of mechanisms of zoonotic viral emergence. Generation of the high-quality genome sequence is often linked to a considerable effort associated to elevated costs. Although secondary scaffolding methods have reduced sequencing expenses, they imply the development of new tools for the integration of different data sources to achieve more reliable sequencing results. We initially sequenced the P. medius genome using the combination of Illumina paired-end and Nanopore sequencing, with a depth of 57.4x and 6.1x, respectively. Then, we introduced the novel scaff2link software to integrate multiple sources of information for secondary scaffolding, allowing to remove the association with discordant information among two sources. Different quality metrics were next produced to validate the benefits from secondary scaffolding. The P. medius genome, assembled by this method, has a length of 1,985 Mb and consists of 33,613 contigs and 16,113 scaffolds with an NG50 of 19 Mb. At least 22.5% of the assembled sequences is covered by interspersed repeats already described in other species and 19,823 coding genes are annotated. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the clustering of P. medius genome with two other Pteropus bat species, P. alecto and P. vampyrus, for which genome sequences are currently available. SARS-CoV entry receptor ACE2 sequence of P. medius was 82.7% identical with ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus bats, thought to be the natural host of SARS-CoV. Altogether, our results confirm that a lower depth of sequencing is enough to obtain a valuable genome sequence, using secondary scaffolding approaches and demonstrate the benefits of the scaff2link application. The genome sequence is now available to the scientific community to (i) proceed with further genomic analysis of P. medius, (ii) to characterize the underlying mechanism allowing Nipah virus maintenance and perpetuation in its bat host, and (iii) to monitor their evolutionary pathways toward a better understanding of bats’ ability to control viral infections.","Fouret, Julien; Brunet, Frédéric G.; Binet, Martin; Aurine, Noémie; Enchéry, Francois; Croze, Séverine; Guinier, Marie; Goumaidi, Abdelghafar; Preininger, Doris; Volff, Jean-Nicolas; Bailly-Bechet, Marc; Lachuer, Joël; Horvat, Branka; Legras-Lachuer, Catherine",Front Microbiol,577,26

SARS-CoV-2 has many similarities with SARS-CoV. Both viruses rely on a protease called the main protease, or M(pro), for replication. Therefore, inhibiting M(pro) may be a successful strategy for treating COVID-19. Structures are available in the Protein Data Bank of the main proteases of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with and without inhibitor N3. Comparing these structures revealed residue interaction network changes associated with N3 inhibition. Comparing network clustering with and without inhibitor N3 identified the formation of a cluster of residues 17, 18, 30-33, 70, 95, 98, 103, 117, 122, and 177 as a network change in both viral proteases when bound to inhibitor N3.

Our results show that DNA-A and DNA-B are mutually interdependent for their replication and are associated with severely reduced colony growth and hypovirulence. DNA-C relies on DNA-A and DNA-B for replication and is necessary for the recovery of abnormal fungal phenotypes. DNA-C also enhances the accumulation of viral DNA in infected fungi and permits stable colonization and easy transmission via conidia. This is the first multipartite DNA virus isolated from a fungus.

This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the impact of COVID-19 living conditions on infant and parent sleep, as well as infant screen exposure, parent daytime sleepiness, and parent depression levels, using multi-method assessment. METHODS: Infant and parent data collected in 2020 were compared with a matched cohort collected in 2019. The total sample included 1518 US infants aged 1–18 months (M = 8.5, SD = 4.6; 54% boys). Auto-videosomnography metrics were obtained from the 14-day period prior to survey completion (number of analyzed nights: M = 12.11 SD = 2.66 in the 2019 cohort; and M = 11.91 SD = 2.41 in the 2020 cohort). Parents completed online questionnaires regarding their infant's sleep and screen exposure, as well as their own sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and depression levels. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, infants in 2020 slept ∼40 min more per night on average, as indicated by auto-videosomnography. Infants additionally had earlier sleep timing, and increased parent-reported sleep-onset latency and nocturnal wakefulness. Infant screen time rose by 18.3 min per day for older infants, but remained stable for younger infants. Parents reported lower daytime sleepiness and higher depression symptomology during 2020, whereas no change was apparent in their sleep quality ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Restricted living conditions during COVID-19 in the USA led to increased infant screen exposure and parental depression, but also to increased infant sleep duration and reduced parent sleepiness. Future research is needed to examine the mechanistic pathways through which COVID-19 impacted on infant and parent well-being.","Kahn, Michal; Barnett, Natalie; Glazer, Assaf; Gradisar, Michael",Sleep Med,577,26

METHODS: A technique was developed to visualize exhaled aerosols during simulated patients' use of oxygen masks in a health care setting and tested using the simple, the nonrebreathing, and the Venturi oxygen masks. A smoke tracer was introduced into one of the lungs of the model to enable it to mix with the incoming oxygen and then to be further inhaled/exhaled by the model according to a variety of realistic respiratory settings (14, 24, and 30 breaths per minute, with tidal volumes of 500, 330, 235 mL, respectively) and oxygen supply flow rates (between 6 and 15 liters per minute). Digital recordings of these exhaled airflow patterns allowed approximate distances to be estimated for the extent of the visible exhaled air plumes emitted from each oxygen mask type at these settings. RESULTS: It was found that the simple, the nonrebreathing, and the Venturi-type oxygen masks produced exhaled smoke plumes over minimum distances of 0.08 to 0.21 m, 0.23 to 0.36 m, and 0.26 to 0.40 m, respectively.

Acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis is caused by streptococcal or staphylococcal infection in 40% to 80% of cases. The most common causes of subacute or chronic lymphadenitis are cat scratch disease, mycobacterial infection, and toxoplasmosis.

In addition to being considered at higher risk for worse outcomes from COVID-19, people with cancer may also experience disruptions or delays in health services. This systematic review aimed to identify the delays and disruptions to cancer services globally. METHODS: This is a systematic review with a comprehensive search including specific and general databases. We considered any observational longitudinal and cross-sectional study design. The selection, data extraction, and methodological assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by specific tools. The delays and disruptions identified were categorized, and their frequency was presented. RESULTS: Among the 62 studies identified, none exhibited high methodological quality. The most frequent determinants for disruptions were provider- or system-related, mainly because of the reduction in service availability. The studies identified 38 different categories of delays and disruptions with impact on treatment, diagnosis, or general health service. Delays or disruptions most investigated included reduction in routine activity of cancer services and number of cancer surgeries; delay in radiotherapy; and delay, reschedule, or cancellation of outpatient visits. Interruptions and disruptions largely affected facilities (up to 77.5%), supply chain (up to 79%), and personnel availability (up to 60%). CONCLUSION: The remarkable frequency of delays and disruptions in health care mostly related to the reduction of the COVID-19 burden unintentionally posed a major risk on cancer care worldwide. Strategies can be proposed not only to mitigate the main delays and disruptions but also to standardize their measurement and reporting. As a high number of publications continuously are being published, it is critical to harmonize the upcoming reports and constantly update this review.","Riera, Rachel; Bagattini, Ângela Maria; Pacheco, Rafael Leite; Pachito, Daniela Vianna; Roitberg, Felipe; Ilbawi, Andre",JCO Glob Oncol,577,28

This study assessed the evolution of incidence of audiovestibular disorders during the pandemic COVID-19 period. METHOD: Three audiovestibular disorders namely, sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL), autonomic dysfunction, and Meniere’s disease (MD) were analyzed and compared from 2016 to 2020. RESULTS: The annual new cases at our clinic comprised overall 2107, 1997, 1984, 2068, and 1829 from 2016 to 2020, respectively, and the respectively annual cases of SSHL were 54, 46, 42, 45 and 38. Accordingly, annual incidences of SSHL in relation to overall cases of audiovestibular disorders were 2.6%, 2.3%, 2.1%, 2.2% and 2.1% from 2016 to 2020, respectively, exhibiting a non-significant difference (p > 0.05). In contrast, incidence of autonomic dysfunction in the year 2020 was 15.3%, which revealed significantly higher than 8.5–13.1% from 2016 to 2019 (p < 0.001). Restated, the incidence of autonomic dysfunction in 2020 displayed a significantly higher percentage than the other 4 years.

We reviewed the current standards and recommendations of ultrasound transducer cleaning, disinfection, and safe handling of ultrasound equipment. Based on the available data, we propose a set of practical recommendations applicable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and future epidemics. RECENT FINDINGS: Regional anesthesia is often preferred over general anesthesia for COVID-19 patients. Avoidance of general anesthesia reduces the need for aerosol generating procedures. Administration of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia and surgery under regional anesthesia in COVID-19 patients requires careful infectious precautions to prevent the viral spread through the use equipment. SUMMARY: Ultrasound machine, transducer and coupling gel can serve as a vector for transmission of pathogens. In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, standardized strategies are recommended to minimize the risk of spread of COVID-19 to both patients and the healthcare providers.","Murata, Hiroaki; Vanegas, Cristina; Ogami-Takamura, Keiko",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,577,20

Management of avulsion trauma is challenging and requires adherence to clinical protocols. The aim of this study was to investigate the management knowledge of avulsed teeth among Italian dentists and to promote the guidelines’ dissemination through the use of new social media. (2) Methods: The survey was carried out during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy (March–May 2020). The questionnaire was sent anonymously to a total of 600 dentists. The questionnaire consisted of two parts. Part A—demographic and professional data and Part B—management of traumatic avulsion. (3) Results: The response rate was 50.6% and the mean fraction of correct responses was 0.524. Issues related to the therapeutic management of avulsed teeth were shown to be not well understood by the respondents. Professionals with qualifications in dentistry and those who declared to know the guidelines responded better, while other demographic and professional factors were insignificant. (4) Conclusions: Italian dentists’ knowledge of the management of avulsion trauma should be improved. Educational programs and campaigns must be undertaken to improve their awareness and adherence to the Italian and international guidelines.","Mazur, Marta; Jedliński, Maciej; Janiszewska-Olszowska, Joanna; Ndokaj, Artnora; Ardan, Roman; Nardi, Gianna Maria; Marasca, Roberto; Ottolenghi, Livia; Polimeni, Antonella; Vozza, Iole",Int J Environ Res Public Health,577,29

These include: recognizing scientific expertise, medical education, and digitalization as important driving forces, providing us with key information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as integrating it into our curricula and promoting action-oriented research. However, the “premiere of the climate pandemic” will, in all likelihood, confront us with even greater challenges, difficulties, and threats.

Previously we demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of emetine against some RNA and DNA viruses. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro antiviral efficacy of emetine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and found it to be a low nanomolar (nM) inhibitor. Interestingly, emetine exhibited protective efficacy against lethal challenge with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; a chicken coronavirus) in the embryonated chicken egg infection model. Emetine treatment led to a decrease in viral RNA and protein synthesis without affecting other steps of viral life cycle such as attachment, entry and budding. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay, emetine was shown to disrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA with eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, a cellular cap-binding protein required for initiation of protein translation). Further, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies suggested that emetine may bind to the cap-binding pocket of eIF4E, in a similar conformation as m7-GTP binds. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to exploit ERK/MNK1/eIF4E signalling pathway for its effective replication in the target cells. Collectively our results suggest that further detailed evaluation of emetine as a potential treatment for COVID-19 may be warranted.","Kumar, Ram; Afsar, Mohammad; Khandelwal, Nitin; Chander, Yogesh; Riyesh, Thachamvally; Dedar, Ramesh Kumar; Gulati, Baldev R.; Pal, Yash; Barua, Sanjay; Tripathi, Bhupendra N.; Hussain, Tanweer; Kumar, Naveen",Antiviral Res,577,16

Para ello, la fisioterapia respiratoria se presenta como piedra angular dentro del modelo de abordaje interdisciplinar que requiere esta población. Dado que la implementación de esta opción terapéutica continúa siendo limitada en España, es imprescindible realizar una evaluación integral y exhaustiva de la persona que nos permita establecer criterios de selección a fin de optimizar el uso de los recursos humanos y materiales existentes. Para ello, se propone un algoritmo de decisión terapéutica basado en pruebas de evaluación validadas y objetivas de las posibles manifestaciones clínicas del paciente. La aplicación de este algoritmo, en cualquier nivel asistencial (atención especializada y atención primaria/comunitaria) junto con la atención centrada en la persona, el impulso del uso de los espacios comunitarios verdes y azules de las ciudades y un adecuado uso de las tecnologías de la comunicación y la información, nos permitirá optimizar el modelo de atención de fisioterapia respiratoria en el contexto actual, marcado por la COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed a great challenge for the healthcare system which has been later aggravated by the need of managing clinical manifestations and potential sequelae in COVID-19 survivors. In this context, respiratory Physiotherapy emerges as a cornerstone in the interdisciplinary management warranted in this population. Given that the implementation and resources available for the interdisciplinary therapeutic interventions in Spain is scarce, it is essential to perform a comprehensive, exhaustive and personalised assessment. This will allow us to establish more accurate selection criteria in order to optimise the use of existing human and material resources. To this end, we propose here a decision-making algorithm for clinical practice to assess the clinical manifestations in people recovered from COVID-19 based on well-established, validated tests and assessment tools. This algorithm can be used at any clinical practice environment (primary care/community or hospital-based), combined with a patient-centered model and the use of community and e-Health resources and its application to improve the Physiotherapy care of these patients in the COVID-19 era.","Arbillaga-Etxarri, Ane; Lista-Paz, Ana; Alcaraz-Serrano, Victoria; Escudero-Romero, Raúl; Herrero-Cortina, Beatriz; Corberó, Ana Balañá; Sebio-García, Raquel; Vilaró, Jordi; Gimeno-Santos, Elena",,577,1

Microglia are innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma whose turnover is reliant on local proliferation. Microglia express a diverse range of proteins, which allows them to continuously sense the environment and quickly react to changes. Under inflammatory conditions such as CNS viral infection, microglia promote innate and adaptive immune responses to protect the host. However, during viral infection, a dysregulated microglia-T-cell interplay may result in altered phagocytosis of neuronal synapses by microglia that causes neurocognitive impairment.

The Epidemiology Workbench provides access to an agent-based model in which demographic, geographic, and public health information a community together with a social distancing and testing strategy may be input, and a range of possible outcomes computed, to inform local authorities on coping strategies. The model is adaptable to other infectious diseases, and to other strains of coronavirus. The tool is illustrated by scenarios for the cities of Urbana and Champaign, Illinois, the home of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Conventional PF assessment tools have however limited feasibility for remote patient monitoring applications. To improve the safety of PF assessment, we previously developed and validated a quick and safe PF screening tool called Frailty Meter (FM). FM works by quantifying weakness, slowness, rigidity, and exhaustion during a 20-second repetitive elbow flexion/extension task using a wrist-worn sensor and generates a frailty index (FI) ranging from zero to one; higher values indicate progressively greater severity of frailty. However, the use of wrist-sensor limits its applications in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring. In this study, we developed a sensor-less FM based on deep learning-based image processing, which can be easily integrated into mobile health and enables remote assessment of physical frailty. The sensor-less FM extracts kinematic features of the forearm motion from the video of 20-second elbow flexion and extension recorded by a tablet camera, and then calculates frailty phenotypes and FI. To test the validity of sensor-less FM, 11 COPD patients admitted to a Telehealth pulmonary rehabilitation clinic and 10 healthy young volunteers (controls) were recruited. All participants completed the test indicating high feasibility. Strong correlations (0.72 < r < 0.99) were observed between the sensor-based FM and sensor-less FM to extract all frailty phenotypes and FI. After adjusting with age and body mass index(BMI), sensor-less FM enables distinguishing COPD group from controls (p<0.050) with the largest effect sizes observed for weakness (Cohen’s effect size d=2.24), frailty index (d=1.70), and slowness (d=1.70).

METHODS: We used a qualitative study design, conducting 20 interviews with displaced Syrians in opposition-controlled camps in Northwest Syria between April-May 2020 and ensuring over half our interviewees were women. We analysed data thematically. RESULTS: Participants described already difficult camp conditions that would be detrimental to an effective COVID-19 response, including household crowding, inadequate sewerage and waste management, insufficient and poor-quality water, and lack of cleaning supplies. Participants most frequently mentioned internet as their COVID-19 information source, followed by NGO awareness campaigns. Men had access to more accurate and comprehensive COVID-19 information than women did. Isolating (shielding) high-risk people within households did not appear feasible, but participants suggested ‘house-swapping’ approaches might work. While most participants had sufficient knowledge about COVID-19, they lacked practical tools to prevent transmission. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to explore perspectives and lived experiences of internally-displaced Syrians in the weeks prior to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northwest Syria. The challenging living conditions of internally-displaced people in Syria are further threatened by the spread of COVID-19.

Two large hospitals performed a respiratory Taqman array card (TAC), targeting 24 viruses, 8 bacteria, and 2 fungi simultaneously, on 435 samples from 397 symptomatic immunocompromised patients. Clinical details were collected retrospectively using a structured case report form. An overall positivity rate of 68% was found (51% mono- and 17% co-infections). Pathogen distribution was as follows: influenza A (20.7%), rhinoviruses (15.2%), coronaviruses (7.8%), Pneumocystis jirovecii (7.4%), RSV (7.1%), and CMV (6.0%) were the most frequently encountered, followed by HSV (5.5%), hMPV (4.4%), parainfluenza viruses (3.9%), influenza B (3.7%), and Aspergillus species (3.7%). Other pathogens were not detected or detected only in ≤ 1% of samples. Hospital and ICU admission rates were 84% and 11%, respectively. The presence of a pathogen was strongly associated with higher need for supplemental oxygen (p = 0.001), but it had no impact on ICU admission, mechanical ventilation requirement, antibacterial therapy, or mortality. In conclusion, our study described the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens in a large group of symptomatic immunocompromised patients and provides evidence of a relationship between pathogen detection and the need for supplemental oxygen. This association was still found after the exclusion of the results positive for influenza viruses, suggesting that non-influenza viruses contribute to severe respiratory illness in patients with compromised immunity.","Steensels, Deborah; Reynders, Marijke; Descheemaeker, Patrick; Curran, Martin D.; Hites, Maya; Etienne, Isabelle; Montesinos, Isabel",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,577,20

They also experienced suffering, loss, isolation, grief, and compromised culture. Confusion and distrust were also prevalent during the epidemic, with participants reporting confusion around Ebola transmission and distrust in the government and healthcare services. We also found that the struggle for food and grief stemming from the loss of loved ones continued more than a year after the epidemic ended. Despite Sierra Leone being declared Ebola-free, stigma and fear persisted and community members shared their continuing distrust of the government due to their actions during and after the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this qualitative study reveal that the Ebola epidemic was a traumatizing period for the Calaba Town community, and that confusion and distrust toward the government health care system have continued. Future studies should explore the extended impact of the epidemic on communities, including long-term psychological, social, and economic consequences of this outbreak.","Murray, Rianna T.; Drew, Laura Briggs; Memmott, Christina; Bangura, Ya-Maila; Maring, Elisabeth F.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,577,0

Infected pigs develop a strong and rapid humoral response but these initial antibodies do not confer protection and can even be harmful by mediating an antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. In contrast, development of neutralising antibodies (NAs) is delayed and generation of cell-mediated immune responses, such as PRRSV-specific interferon (IFN)-γ secreting cells, is initially erratic. In spite of this, induction of strong and rapid NAs and IFN-γ responses seem to be required for effective vaccination. PRRSV strongly modulates the host’s immune responses. The virus inhibits key cytokines, such as IFN-α, and may induce regulatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10. Development of NAs seems to be impaired by the existence of a decoy epitope close to the main neutralisation epitope in glycoprotein 5. This ability to modulate the host immune response probably varies among strains or isolates. The genetic diversity of the virus is very high and it has been shown that this diversity can have serious implications for the development of vaccines, since the immunity induced by one strain may be only partial against a different strain, even within the same genotype. With this panorama, the development of newer and universally efficacious PRRSV vaccines is challenging, but the present state of knowledge allows optimism if collaborative efforts are undertaken in the scientific community.","Mateu, E.; Diaz, I.",Vet J,577,9

However, the impact of digestive system diseases has not been issued. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) on hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). We extracted clinical data regarding 95 patients in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China, between 26 January and 21 February 2020. The Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) was used to assess the presence and severity of LPRD. An RSI greater than 13 is considered to be abnormal. A total of 95 patients with COVID‐19 were enrolled, with 61.1% (58/95), 32.6% (31/95), and 6.3% (6/95) being moderately ill, severely ill, and critically ill, respectively. In this study, 38.9% (37/95) of the patient had an RSI score over 13, which was indicative of LPRD. In univariable analysis, the age and RSI scores of severely or critically ill patients were statistically significantly higher than patients with moderate disease (P = .026 and P = .005, respectively). After controlling for age difference in a multivariable model, the RSI greater than 13, compared to RSI equal to 0, was associated with significantly higher risk of severe infection (P < .001; odds ratio [OR] = 11.411; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95‐42.09) and critical infection (P = .028; OR= 19.61; 95% CI, 1.38‐277.99). Among hospitalized patients with COVID‐19, RSI scores greater than 13, indicative of LPRD, correlated with poorer clinical outcomes. The prevalence of LPRD may be higher than the general population, which indicated that COVID‐19 can impair the upper esophageal sphincter and aggravate reflux.","Jiang, Guiyuan; Cai, Yanping; Yi, Xue; Li, Yanping; Lin, Yong; Li, Qing; Xu, Jingqing; Ke, Mingyao; Xue, Keying",J Med Virol,577,3

METHODS Ninety-six patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were enrolled in the study. The STOP-BANG questionnaire to investigate the risk of the OSA syndrome was filled in by the patients at admission. The enrolled patients were divided into 2 groups according to the respiratory disease: group 1 (72 patients), hospitalized patients undergoing conventional oxygen therapy; group 2 (24 patients), patients requiring enhanced respiratory support. STOP-BANG results of these 2 groups were compared to observe whether patients with high OSA risk more frequently presented a severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS 41.6% of the patients in group 2 had a STOP-BANG score between 5 and 8 (high risk of having apnea); in contrast, 20.8% of the patients in group 1 had a STOP-BANG score between 5 and 8, with a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .05). A complementary trend was observed regarding the proportion of patients in the range 0 to 2, which classifies patients at a low risk of OSA (48.6% vs 20.8% for groups 1 and 2, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS According to our data, the chances of having a severe case of COVID-19 should be considered in patients at high risk of OSA. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE/STUDY RATIONALE Emerging research suggests that OSA could represent a potentially important risk factor for the severe forms of COVID-19. The purpose of this observational retrospective study was to evaluate the potential association between OSA and the severity of COVID-19 disease.

We aimed to investigate the impact of telemedicine during the COVID‐19 pandemic on the management and outcome of the patients with TIA. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from a registry of consecutive TIA patients assessed at the Stroke Department, Imperial College Health Care Trust, London, during the national lockdown period (between March 23 2020 and 30 June 2020). As controls, we evaluated the clinical reports and stroke quality metrics of patients presenting to the TIA clinic in the same period of 2019. RESULTS: Between 23 March 2020 and 30 June 2020, 136 patients were assessed using the telemedicine TIA clinic, compared to 180 patients evaluated with face‐to‐face consultation in the same period in 2019. Patients’ characteristics were similar in both groups. At 3 months after the TIA, there were no significant differences in the proportion of patients admitted to the hospital for recurrent TIA/stroke or any other cardiovascular cause from the 2020 period compared to the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that during the pandemic, our telemedicine consultations of TIA patients were not associated with an increased 3‐month rate of recurrent TIA/stroke or cardiovascular hospital admissions. More robust studies looking at this model of care will be needed to assess its long‐term effects on patients and health care systems.","D’Anna, Lucio; Ellis, Natalya; Bentley, Paul; Brown, Zoe; Halse, Omid; Jamil, Sohaa; Jenkins, Harri; Malik, Abid; Kalladka, Dheeraj; Kwan, Joseph; Venter, Marius; Banerjee, Soma",Eur J Neurol,577,20

Fast, accurate, and simple blood‐based assays for quantification of anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies are urgently needed to identify infected individuals and keep track of the spread of disease. METHODS: The study included 33 plasma samples from 20 individuals with confirmed COVID‐19 by real‐time reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and 40 non‐COVID‐19 plasma samples. Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 immunoglobulin M (IgM)/immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected by a microfluidic quantitative immunomagnetic assay (IMA) (ViroTrack Sero COVID IgM + IgA/IgG Ab, Blusense Diagnostics) and compared to an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (EuroImmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika). RESULTS: Of the 33 plasma samples from the COVID‐19 patients, 28 were positive for IgA/IgM or IgG by IMA and 29 samples were positive by ELISA. Sensitivity for only one sample per patient was 68% for IgA + IgM and 75% IgG by IMA and 80% by ELISA. For samples collected 14 days after symptom onset, the sensitivity of both IMA and ELISA was around 91%. The specificity of the IMA reached 100% compared to 95% for ELISA IgA and 97.5% for ELISA IgG. CONCLUSION: IMA for COVID‐19 is a rapid simple‐to‐use point‐of‐care test with sensitivity and specificity similar to a commercial ELISA.","Moeller, Maria E.; Fock, Jeppe; Pah, Pearlyn; Veras, Antia De La C.; Bade, Melanie; Donolato, Marco; Israelsen, Simone B.; Eugen‐Olsen, Jesper; Benfield, Thomas; Engsig, Frederik N.",J Med Virol,577,30

We carry out the analysis for the whole of Germany and the federal state of Bavaria, where we have more detailed data. Both analyses show a major change between March 9th and 13th for the time series of infections: from a strong increase to a stagnation or a slight decrease. Another change was found between March 24th and March 31st, where the decline intensified. These two major changes can be related to different governmental measures. On March, 11th, Chancellor Merkel appealed for social distancing in a press conference with the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and a ban on major events with more than 1000 visitors (March 10th) was issued. The other change point at the end of March could be related to the shutdown in Germany.

However, concerns about data quality have hampered their widespread adoption in research and policy decisions. This article presents results from a data verification study undertaken to gain insights into the quality of HMIS data in Ethiopia. We also provide recommendations for working with HMIS data for research and policy translation. We linked the HMIS to the 2016 Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care Assessment, a national census of all health facilities that provided maternal and newborn health services in Ethiopia. We compared the number of visits for deliveries and caesarean sections (C-sections) reported in the HMIS in 2015 (January–December) to those found in source documents (paper-based labour and delivery and operating theatre registers) in 2425 facilities across Ethiopia. We found that two-thirds of facilities had ‘good’ HMIS reporting for deliveries (defined as reporting within 10% of source documents) and half had ‘very good’ reporting (within 5% of source documents). Results were similar for reporting on C-section deliveries. We found that good reporting was more common in urban areas (OR: 1.30, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.59), public facilities (OR: 2.95, 95% CI 1.38 to 6.29) and in hospitals compared with health centres (OR: 1.71, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.61). Facilities in the Somali and Afar regions had the lowest odds of good reporting compared with Addis Ababa and were more likely to over-report deliveries in the HMIS. Further work remains to address remaining discrepancies in the Ethiopian HMIS. Nonetheless, our findings corroborate previous data verification exercises in Ethiopia and support greater use and uptake of HMIS data for research and policy decisions (particularly, greater use of HMIS data elements (eg, absolute number of services provided each month) rather than coverage indicators). Increased use of these data, combined with feedback mechanisms, is necessary to maintain data quality.","Arsenault, Catherine; Yakob, Bereket; Kassa, Munir; Dinsa, Girmaye; Verguet, Stéphane",BMJ Glob Health,577,29

The study includes 12 sets of about 100 genomes each collected between January and September. We analyzed the mutations, mutation frequency and count trends over time, and genomes trends over time from January through September. We show that certain mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are not occurring randomly as it has been commonly believed. This finding is in agreement with other recently published research in this domain. Therefore, this validates other findings in this direction. This study includes approximately 1000 genomes and was able to identify over 35 different mutations most of which are common to almost all genomes groups. Some mutations' ratios (frequency percentage) fluctuate over time to adapt the virus to various environmental factors, climate, and populations. One of the interesting findings in this paper is that the coding region, at the nucleotide level for NSP13 protein is relatively conserved compared with other protein regions in the ORF1ab gene which makes this protein a good candidate for developing drug targets and treatment for the COVID-19 disease.

The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) performed in patients with a history of COVID-19, comparing subjects according to the presence of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed. Consecutive patients > 18 years with history of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction test and a CPET performed between 45 and 120 days after the viral episode were included. The association between variables related to CPET and post-COVID-19 syndrome was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 200 patients (mean age 48.8 ± 14.3 years, 51% men) were included. Patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome showed significantly lower main peak VO(2) (25.8 ± 8.1 mL/min/Kg vs. 28.8 ± 9.6 mL/min/Kg, p=0.017) as compared to asymptomatic subjects. Moreover, patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome developed symptoms more frequently during CPET (52.7% vs. 13.7%, p<0.001) and were less likely to reach the anaerobic threshold (50.9% vs. 72.7%, p=0.002) when compared to asymptomatic subjects. These findings were not modified when adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: Our data suggest that post-COVID-19 syndrome was associated with less peak VO(2), a lower probability of achieving the anaerobic threshold and a higher probability of presenting symptoms during the CPET. Future studies are needed to determine if these abnormalities during CPET would have prognostic value.","Barbagelata, L.; Masson, W.; Iglesias, D.; Lillo, E.; Migone, J.F.; Orazi, M.L.; Maritano Furcada, J.",Med Clin (Barc),577,21

Next generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR amplicons (NGS 16S amplicon analysis) is a powerful culture-independent open reference method that has recently been used to increase understanding of BRD-associated bacteria in the upper respiratory tract of BRD cattle. However, it has not yet been used to examine the microbiome of the bovine lower respiratory tract. The objective of this study was to use NGS 16S amplicon analysis to identify bacteria in post-mortem lung and lymph node tissue samples harvested from fatal BRD cases and clinically healthy animals. Cranial lobe and corresponding mediastinal lymph node post-mortem tissue samples were collected from calves diagnosed as BRD cases by veterinary laboratory pathologists and from clinically healthy calves. NGS 16S amplicon libraries, targeting the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Quantitative insights into microbial ecology (QIIME) was used to determine operational taxonomic units (OTUs) which corresponded to the 16S rRNA gene sequences. RESULTS: Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma, Pasteurellaceae, and Fusobacterium were the most abundant OTUs identified in the lungs and lymph nodes of the calves which died from BRD. Leptotrichiaceae, Fusobacterium, Mycoplasma, Trueperella and Bacteroides had greater relative abundances in post-mortem lung samples collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves, compared with clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma and Pasteurellaceae showed higher relative abundances in post-mortem lymph node samples collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves, compared with clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Two Leptotrichiaceae sequence contigs were subsequently assembled from bacterial DNA-enriched shotgun sequences. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiomes of the cranial lung lobe and mediastinal lymph node from calves which died from BRD and from clinically healthy H-F calves have been characterised. Contigs corresponding to the abundant Leptotrichiaceae OTU were sequenced and found not to be identical to any known bacterial genus. This suggests that we have identified a novel bacterial species associated with BRD.

At the same time, allowing host-State counterclaims for environmental damage is a potentially useful tool for rebalancing the asymmetric nature of IIAs. Yet, in the highly fragmented area of international investment law, the availability of host-State counterclaims is not always clear. This article analyses the procedural and legal bases available for host-State counterclaims for environmental damage, including newly developing human rights and transnational public policy approaches to such claims. The question that this article seeks to evaluate is to what extent host-State counterclaims are available to rebalance the asymmetric relationship between host-States and investors, specifically concerning environmental damage. To answer this question, the article takes a qualitative approach by examining case law, commentary, and the work of international organizations, and applying the results of the research to the specific context of host-State counterclaims for environmental damage. Future developments are also discussed in the context of ongoing multilateral investor-State dispute settlement reform efforts at the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. There currently exists a window of opportunity for States to seek cooperative, effective multilateral strategies for partially rebalancing the relationship between investment and the environment. The article posits that harmonization of State approaches towards counterclaims for environmental damage is desirable and States should take a permissive approach towards host-State counterclaims for environmental damage in their IIA treaty negotiation practice.","Gleason, Ted",Int Environ Agreem,577,1

Here, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Genedrive HCV ID assay for the qualitative detection of HCV RNA in decentralized settings in two low- and middle-income countries using fresh plasma specimens from 426 participants. The Abbott RealTime HCV assay was used as the gold standard. Genedrive HCV ID assay was conducted by different users. Users also completed questionnaires to assess the usability of Genedrive. At detection thresholds of 12 IU/mL or 30 IU/mL, 1000 IU/mL, and 2362 IU/mL, the sensitivity was 96.2% (95% CI: 92.7–98.4), 100% (98.2–100), and 100% (98.2–100), respectively; the specificity was 99.5% (95% CI: 97.4–100), 99.5% (97.5–100), and 98.7% (96.1–100), respectively. All genotypes detected using the gold-standard assay were also detected with Genedrive. Users found Genedrive easy to use. Genedrive is a simple and accurate test to confirm chronic HCV infection in decentralized, real-life, resource-limited settings. This novel diagnostic tool could contribute to closing the current gap in HCV diagnosis.","Lamoury, Francois M.

Using cell-free synthesized ORF7b, we experimentally show that ORF7b assembles into stable multimers. The ORF7b sequence shows a transmembrane segment, which multimerizes through a leucine zipper. We hypothesize that ORF7b has the potential to interfere with important cellular processes that involve leucine-zipper formation, and present two particularly striking examples. First, leucine zippers are central in heart rhythm regulation through multimerization of phospholamban in cardiomyocytes. Second, epithelial cell-cell adhesion relies on E-cadherins, which dimerize using a transmembrane leucine zipper. Most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including heart arrythmias, odor loss, impaired oxygen uptake and intestinal problems, up to multiorgan failure, can be rationalized by a possible interference of ORF7b with the functions of these proteins. We ask whether this is pure coincidence, or whether our observations point to disruption by ORF7b of vital processes in COVID-19.","Fogeron, Marie-Laure; Montserret, Roland; Zehnder, Johannes; Nguyen, Minh-Ha; Dujardin, Marie; Brigandat, Louis; Cole, Laura; Ninot-Pedrosa, Marti; Lecoq, Lauriane; Meier, Beat H; Böckmann, Anja",bioRxiv,577,1

As there is an increase of infections in the male population, concerns have emerged about the potential impact of COVID-19 on male reproductive organs and male fertility. Therefore, this study systematically investigates the current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 impact on male reproduction and pregnancy outcomes, discussing them in light of the evidence published on other coronaviruses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 24 original articles were included for the analysis, investigating the effects of the infection on semen parameters, male reproductive hormones, and pregnancy outcomes. Further, a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis was conducted based on the available evidence linking the virus with male reproduction and conception. RESULTS: Although there is limited data, viral mRNA has been identified in semen of infected men, with some evidence of altered seminal parameters. Low testosterone and dihydrotestosterone with raised luteinizing hormone has been reported as well as preterm delivery in pregnant women; however, data regarding vertical transmission remains contradictory and inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: The recent literature provides evidence that male gonads may be potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, recommending caution to pregnant women and couples planning natural pregnancy or assisted reproduction.","Khalili, Mohammad Ali; Leisegang, Kristian; Majzoub, Ahmad; Finelli, Renata; Panner Selvam, Manesh Kumar; Henkel, Ralf; Mojgan, Moshrefi; Agarwal, Ashok",World J Mens Health,577,20

Because influenza infections are initiated in and localized to the pulmonary tract, and newly formed viral particles egress from the apical side of the lung epithelium, we compared the effectiveness of hemagglutinin (HA) stalk-binding bNAbs administered through the airway (intranasal or via nebulization) versus the systemic route (intraperitoneal or intravenous). Airway deliveries of various bNAbs were 10- to 50-fold more effective than systemic deliveries of the same bNAbs in treating H1N1, H3N2, B/Victoria-, and B/Yamagata-lineage influenza viral infections in mouse models. The potency of airway-delivered anti-HA bNAbs was highly dependent on antiviral neutralization activity, with little dependence on the effector function of the antibody. In contrast, the effectiveness of systemically delivered anti-HA bNAbs was not dependent on antiviral neutralization, but critically dependent on antibody effector functions. Concurrent administration of a neutralizing/effector function-positive bNAb via the airway and systemic routes showed increased effectiveness. The small amount of airway-delivered bNAbs needed for effective influenza treatment creates the opportunity to combine potent bNAbs with different anti-influenza specificities to generate a cost-effective antiviral therapy that provides broad coverage against all circulating influenza strains infecting humans. A 3 mg/kg dose of the novel triple antibody combination CF-404 (i.e., 1 mg/kg of each component bNAb) delivered to the airway was shown to effectively prevent weight loss and death in mice challenged with ten 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) inoculums of either H1N1, H3N2, B/Victoria-lineage, or B/Yamagata-lineage influenza viruses. IMPORTANCE Influenza causes widespread illness in humans and can result in morbidity and death, especially in the very young and elderly populations. Because influenza vaccination can be poorly effective some years, and the immune systems of the most susceptible populations are often compromised, passive immunization treatments using broadly neutralizing antibodies is a promising therapeutic approach. However, large amounts of a single antibody are required for effectiveness when delivered through systemic administration (typically intravenous infusion), precluding the feasible dosing of antibody combinations via this route. The significance of our research is the demonstration that effective therapeutic treatments of multiple relevant influenza types (H1N1, H3N2, and B) can be achieved by airway administration of a single combination of relatively small amounts of three anti-influenza antibodies. This advance exploits the discovery that airway delivery is a more potent way of administering anti-influenza antibodies compared to systemic delivery, making this a feasible and cost-effective therapeutic approach.","Vigil, Adam; Frias-Staheli, Natalia; Carabeo, Teresa; Wittekind, Michael",J Virol,577,9

We analyzed the impact of patient characteristics including obesity on hospital mortality and specifically analyzed the effect of obesity by body mass index (BMI) class and by sex. Methods: This retrospective case series included adult patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 illness between March 12, 2020 and May 13, 2020, at a teaching hospital in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area. Data were manually extracted from electronic health records by the authors and included demographics, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and outcomes (hospital mortality or discharge). We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Results: Some 348 patients were included in this study, of whom 207 were discharged and 141 died in the hospital. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death with older age and excess weight. Interestingly obesity increased mortality in women [odds ratio (OR) 4.4, confidence interval (CI) (1.4-13.5) p=0.01] but not among men [OR 1.4, CI (0.5-3.6) p=0.5]. Among women, the effect of excess weight on mortality was seen in a “dose-effect” fashion, with increasingly higher odds of mortality from progressively worsening obesity (OR ranging between 2.7 and 6.9). Out of all the comorbidities, only obesity positively correlated with peak levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Conclusion: Advancing age is a risk factor for in-hospital death during COVID-19 illness. Obese women could be at a higher risk for mortality due to COVID-19 and should take extra precautions to prevent contamination by social distancing and other measures. Immunomodulators may be more effective in obese women affected by COVID-19. Further studies are needed to help elucidate this association.","Naaraayan, Ashutossh; Nimkar, Abhishek; Pant, Sushil; Hasan, Amrah; Durdevic, Momcilo; Elenius, Henrik; Nava Suarez, Corina; Jesmajian, Stephen",Cureus,577,6

While SARS-CoV-2–specific T cells have been identified in COVID-19 patients, their role in the protection of SARS-CoV-2–infected mice is not established. Here, using mice sensitized for infection with SARS-CoV-2 by transduction with an adenovirus expressing the human receptor (Ad5-hACE2), we identified SARS-CoV-2–specific T cell epitopes recognized by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Virus-specific T cells were polyfunctional and were able to lyse target cells in vivo. Further, type I interferon pathway was proved to be critical for generating optimal antiviral T cell responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. T cell vaccination alone partially protected SARS-CoV-2–infected mice from severe disease. In addition, the results demonstrated cross-reactive T cell responses between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but not MERS-CoV, in mice.

Accordingly, it has stressed health systems the world over leading to the cancellation of elective surgical cases and discussions regarding healthcare resource rationing. It is expected that rationing of surgical resources will continue even after the pandemic peak, and may recur with future pandemics, creating a need for a means of triaging emergent and elective spine surgery patients. Methods Using a modified Delphi technique, a cohort of 16 fellowship-trained spine surgeons from 10 academic medical centers constructed a scoring system for the triage and prioritization of emergent and elective spine surgeries. Three separate rounds of videoconferencing and written correspondence were used to reach a final scoring system. Sixteen test cases were used to optimize the scoring system so that it could categorize cases as requiring emergent, urgent, high-priority elective, or low-priority elective scheduling. Results The devised scoring system included 8 independent components: neurological status, underlying spine stability, presentation of a high-risk post-operative complication, patient medical comorbidities, expected hospital course, expected discharge disposition, facility resource limitations, and local disease burden. The resultant calculator was deployed as a freely-available web-based calculator (https://jhuspine3.shinyapps.io/SpineUrgencyCalculator/). Conclusion Here we present the first quantitative urgency scoring system for the triage and prioritizing of spine surgery cases in resource-limited settings. We believe that our scoring system, while not all-encompassing, has potential value as a guide for triaging spine surgical cases during the COVID pandemic and post-COVID period.","Sciubba, Daniel M.; Ehresman, Jeff; Pennington, Zach; Lubelski, Daniel; Feghali, James; Bydon, Ali; Chou, Dean; Elder, Benjamin D.; Elsamadicy, Aladine A.; Goodwin, C.

We show that—in contrast to the prediction of standard models—things can be worse than that: Free and perfectly safe but only partially effective vaccines can reduce everyone's welfare, and hence fail to satisfy—in a strong sense—the fundamental principle of “first, do no harm.” Our main departure from standard economic epidemiological models is that we allow agents to strategically choose their partners, which we show creates strategic complementarities in risky interactions.

Early intervention has been associated with better prognosis, with those seeking specialised intervention in the early stages of their illness more than twice as likely to achieve remission. Current screening measures typically require expert administration and are rarely validated across a spectrum of DSM-5 eating disorder presentations or for online use. In light of COVID-19 and increasing reliance on telehealth technologies in the intervention and delivery of mental health services, online assessments suitable for self-referral are likely to be the first step to seeking care. InsideOut Institute has developed a 6-item online screening tool for the purposes of identifying eating disorder risk and symptomatology, aimed specifically at increasing help-seeking behaviour in subsyndromal and early presentations. METHODS: This study investigates the reliability and validity of the InsideOut Institute Screener (IOI-S), using a cross-sectional survey research design. Participants aged 14 and over will complete an extensive baseline survey battery for evaluation. 50% of participants will be randomly selected for one follow-up re-test of the IOI-S only, 2 weeks post initial testing. The IOI-S will be analysed for statistical reliability on two parameters: internal consistency and test re-test reliability, and for statistical validity on four parameters: concurrent validity, sensitivity and specificity, convergent and discriminant validity. DISCUSSION: The rapid and ongoing shift to digital intervention has highlighted gaps and opportunities in our pathways to care. Adequate screening for eating disorders is a major gap. This study aims to validate an online screening tool for use in telehealth early intervention, designed for users seeking information for a suspected eating disorder. The screener meets those at risk ‘where they are’ (i.e. online) and may improve timely referrals to relevant services. This is of particular salience as face-to-face healthcare and traditional frontline interventions are disrupted, and we are challenged to re-design our practices to deliver diagnostic and treatment services in highly adaptive digital contexts.","Bryant, Emma; Miskovic-Wheatley, Jane; Touyz, Stephen; Crosby, Ross D.; Koreshe, Eyza; Cao, Li; Maguire, Sarah",J Eat Disord,577,16

Nevertheless, questions regarding its use remain poorly understood, such as the ideal dose to confer immunity against the disease, the need for a booster dose, the optimal immunisation schedule for immunocompetent, immunosuppressed, and pediatric populations, among other issues. This work aims to demonstrate that computational tools can be used to simulate different scenarios regarding YF vaccination and the immune response of individuals to this vaccine, thus assisting the response of some of these open questions. RESULTS: This work presents the computational results obtained by a mathematical model of the human immune response to vaccination against YF. Five scenarios were simulated: primovaccination in adults and children, booster dose in adult individuals, vaccination of individuals with autoimmune diseases under immunomodulatory therapy, and the immune response to different vaccine doses. Where data were available, the model was able to quantitatively replicate the levels of antibodies obtained experimentally. In addition, for those scenarios where data were not available, it was possible to qualitatively reproduce the immune response behaviours described in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Our simulations show that the minimum dose to confer immunity against YF is half of the reference dose. The results also suggest that immunological immaturity in children limits the induction and persistence of long-lived plasma cells are related to the antibody decay observed experimentally. Finally, the decay observed in the antibody level after ten years suggests that a booster dose is necessary to keep immunity against YF.","Bonin, Carla Rezende Barbosa; Fernandes, Guilherme Côrtes; de Menezes Martins, Reinaldo; Camacho, Luiz Antonio Bastos; Teixeira-Carvalho, Andréa; da Mota, Licia Maria Henrique; de Lima, Sheila Maria Barbosa; Campi-Azevedo, Ana Carolina; Martins-Filho, Olindo Assis; dos Santos, Rodrigo Weber; Lobosco, Marcelo",BMC Bioinformatics,577,20

We aimed to validate the feasibility of fully remote faculty-supervised surgical training sessions focused on coronary artery bypass grafting using a synthetic simulator and online video-chat software. Methods This observational study organized 24 sessions of 2-hour remote training. Each session involved three trainees, one faculty, and one host. A total of 70 trainees and 24 faculties were enrolled. The participants joined the remote sessions via online video-chat, and performed focused training in coronary artery anastomosis using a commercially available simulator. A survey was conducted to validate the feasibility of the remote sessions. Performance improvement of the trainees who repeatedly participated (n = 13) were analyzed comparing initial and final scores of various performance indicators. Results All trainees and faculties were satisfied with the efficacy of the remote session. Additionally, most trainees (79%) and faculties (95%) agreed that the remote training sessions were equivalent to conventional on-site training seminars.

However, whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can affect multiple organs is still unclear. In this study, postmortem percutaneous biopsies of multiple organs from deceased patients were performed to understand the histopathological changes caused by COVID-19. METHODS: Biopsy specimens of pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic and lymphoid tissues were obtained from three patients, who died due to COVID-19 pneumonia. H&E stain, Masson trichrome stain, immunohistochemistry stain and in-situ hybridisation were used. RESULTS: Pulmonary damages caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). In the early phase, the histological findings were mainly those of exudative features of DAD. The later phase was characterised by organisation of DAD combined with bacterial pneumonia. No serious damage was found in the bronchiolar epithelium and submucosal glands. The hepatic tissue revealed features of ischaemic necrosis, but findings suggestive of mild lobular hepatitis were also observed. The lymphoid tissue revealed features of non-specific acute lymphadenitis. The cardiac tissue revealed changes of underlying disease. SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were not detected in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and lymphocytes of lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 predominantly involves the pulmonary tissue, causes DAD and aggravates the cardiovascular disease. However, other extrapulmonary tissues did not reveal any virus-specific findings, but were affected by multiple factors.

CASE DETAILS: We report the case of a 60-year-old male, heart transplant recipient patient, admitted in our ICU for severe COVID-19. His immunosuppressors were discontinued. He presented an ARDS, a multiple organ failure and a refractory septic shock that eventually resulted in his death. DISCUSSION: Multiple studies reported a lower incidence of SARS-Cov-2 infection in HT recipients compared to the general population, probably due to their prior knowledge and use of protective and barrier measures; but when infected they tend to have poorer outcomes and higher fatality; on account of their pre-existing comorbidities and immunodeficiency. Therefore, the management of the immunosuppressive therapy raises a challenge, in the absence of trials. Physicians rely on experts’ recommendations, to maintain the immunosuppressors in case of mild COVID-19, lower to the bare minimum or even discontinue them in case of critical COVID-19 or systemic complications. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection is associated with poor outcomes and high mortality in HT recipients, and their immunosuppressive therapy management still raises questions and challenges in the absence of trial-validated data.","Melhaoui, Imane; Oujidi, Younes; El Heddad, Inass Arhoun; Bensaid, Amine; Bkiyar, Houssam; Bentata, Yassamine; Housni, Brahim",Ann Med Surg (Lond),577,16

Consequently, it has been extensively studied for its therapeutic potential in several diseases such as insomnia, cardiovascular, Alzheimer, and certain types of cancers. Recently, it has been used to adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 patients. It is well-known that melatonin is highly hydrophobic, resulting in lower solubility. However, the molecular structure and dynamic behavior of the formation of melatonin in an aqueous solution and at the water-air interface have not yet been clearly explained. This information is necessary for the melatonin formulation in drug delivery systems. The present work focuses on the molecular structure and dynamics of melatonin molecules in the aqueous solution and at the water-air interface based on using a molecular dynamics simulation study. The results showed that most melatonin molecules were aggregated in an aqueous solution while they were formed a self-assembled monolayer with the ordered structure at the water-air interface. The strong interaction of melatonin depends on their functional group which showed a similar trend for both systems and was sequenced as follows: carbonyl O > indole NH > amide NH > methoxy OA, respectively. However, the carbonyl O and the indole NH groups exhibit strong interactions with water molecules at the interface. Consequently, the two preferred orientations of the melatonin head group can be observed at the water-air interface (i.e., one is to turn the head group to the water surface with the tilted angle of ~40°-60° and the second one is to turn the head group away from the water surface with the tilted angle of ~130°). The longer lifetime of hydrogen bonds formed between melatonin themselves in the bulk water reveals that the stability of melatonin aggregation in an aqueous solution is more stable. Therefore, melatonin has less soluble in an aqueous solution.","Ritwiset, Aksornnarong; Khajonrit, Jessada; Krongsuk, Sriprajak; Maensiri, Santi",Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,577,9

We evaluated the extent of environmental contamination in the ICU and correlated this with patient and disease factors, including the impact of different ventilatory modalities. METHODS: In this observational study, surface environmental samples collected from ICU patient rooms and common areas were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Select samples from the common area were tested by cell culture. Clinical data were collected and correlated to the presence of environmental contamination. Results were compared to historical data from a previous study in general wards. RESULTS: In total, 200 samples from 20 patient rooms and 75 samples from common areas and the staff pantry were tested. The results showed that 14 rooms had at least 1 site contaminated, with an overall contamination rate of 14% (28 of 200 samples). Environmental contamination was not associated with day of illness, ventilatory mode, aerosol-generating procedures, or viral load. The frequency of environmental contamination was lower in the ICU than in general ward rooms. Eight samples from the common area were positive, though all were negative on cell culture. CONCLUSION: Environmental contamination in the ICU was lower than in the general wards. The use of mechanical ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen was not associated with greater surface contamination, supporting their use and safety from an infection control perspective. Transmission risk via environmental surfaces in the ICUs is likely to be low. Nonetheless, infection control practices should be strictly reinforced, and transmission risk via droplet or airborne spread remains.","Ong, Sean Wei Xiang; Lee, Pei Hua; Tan, Yian Kim; Ling, Li Min; Ho, Benjamin Choon Heng; Ng, Ching Ging; Wang, Dong Ling; Tan, Boon Huan; Leo, Yee-Sin; Ng, Oon-Tek; Wong, Michelle Su Yen; Marimuthu, Kalisvar",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,577,16

We aimed to analyse characteristics of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in Brazil, and to examine the impact of COVID-19 on health-care resources and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of all patients aged 20 years or older with quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital and registered in SIVEP-Gripe, a nationwide surveillance database in Brazil, between Feb 16 and Aug 15, 2020 (epidemiological weeks 8–33). We also examined the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic across three 4-week periods within this timeframe (epidemiological weeks 8–12, 19–22, and 27–30). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We compared the regional burden of hospital admissions stratified by age, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and respiratory support. We analysed data from the whole country and its five regions: North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South. FINDINGS: Between Feb 16 and Aug 15, 2020, 254 288 patients with RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to hospital and registered in SIVEP-Gripe. The mean age of patients was 60 (SD 17) years, 119 657 (47%) of 254 288 were aged younger than 60 years, 143 521 (56%) of 254 243 were male, and 14 979 (16%) of 90 829 had no comorbidities. Case numbers increased across the three 4-week periods studied: by epidemiological weeks 19–22, cases were concentrated in the North, Northeast, and Southeast; by weeks 27–30, cases had spread to the Central-West and South regions. 232 036 (91%) of 254 288 patients had a defined hospital outcome when the data were exported; in-hospital mortality was 38% (87 515 of 232 036 patients) overall, 59% (47 002 of 79 687) among patients admitted to the ICU, and 80% (36 046 of 45 205) among those who were mechanically ventilated. The overall burden of ICU admissions per ICU beds was more pronounced in the North, Southeast, and Northeast, than in the Central-West and South. In the Northeast, 1545 (16%) of 9960 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation outside the ICU compared with 431 (8%) of 5388 in the South. In-hospital mortality among patients younger than 60 years was 31% (4204 of 13 468) in the Northeast versus 15% (1694 of 11 196) in the South. INTERPRETATION: We observed a widespread distribution of COVID-19 across all regions in Brazil, resulting in a high overall disease burden. In-hospital mortality was high, even in patients younger than 60 years, and worsened by existing regional disparities within the health system. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to improve access to high-quality care for critically ill patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, particularly in LMICs.

Published studies have revealed that some patients with COVID-19 had abnormal liver function in laboratory tests. However, the results were inconsistent and the analysis of epidemiological data stratified by the severity of COVID-19 was not available in previous meta-analyses. Furthermore, these meta-analyses were suspected of overestimating the incidence of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 because some studies considered transaminase elevation as liver injury, which might partially result from cardiac and muscle injury. This systematic review aims to enrol published literatures related to COVID-19 without language restriction, analyse the data based on the severity of the COVID-19 and explore the impact of varied definitions of liver injury on the incidence of liver injury. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We have conducted a preliminary search on PubMed and Excerpta Medica Database on 13 April 2020, for the studies published after December 2019 on the prevalence of acute liver injury and hypertransaminemia in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers will independently screen studies, extract data and assess the risk of bias. We will estimate the pooled incidence of hypertransaminemia and acute liver injury in patients with COVID-19 by using the random-effects model. The I(²) test will be used to identify the extent of heterogeneity. Publication bias will be assessed by funnel plot and performing the Begg’s and Egger’s test if adequate studies are available. We will perform a risk of bias assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute’s critical appraisal checklist.

This acknowledgement is a consequence of improvement in diagnosis and better understanding of transmission. Available vaccines and antiviral drugs for prophylaxis and treatment have been developed accordingly. Viral respiratory pathogens are increasingly recognized as nosocomial pathogens as well. The purpose of this review is to describe the most frequent and relevant nosocomial viral respiratory infections, their mechanisms of transmission and the infection control measures to prevent their spread in the healthcare setting. RECENT FINDINGS: Although most mechanisms of transmission and control measures of nosocomial viral infections are already known, improved diagnostic tools allow better characterization of these infections and also lead to the discovery of new viruses such as the coronavirus, which is the cause of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or the human bocavirus. Also, the ability to understand better the impact, dissemination and prevention of these viruses, allows us to improve the measures to prevent these infections. SUMMARY: Healthcare viral respiratory infections increase patient morbidity. Each virus has a different mechanism of transmission; therefore, early detection and prompt implementation of infection control measures are very important in order to avoid their transmission in the hospital setting.","Bonvehí, Pablo E.; Temporiti, Elena R.",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,577,16

Concurrent infection, which may require administration of a potentially nephrotoxic agent, can worsen AKI and lead to poor outcomes. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacillus associated with nosocomial infections, especially in severely immunocompromised and debilitated patients. Trimethoprim/sulfa-methoxazole combination (TMP/SMX) is considered the treatment of choice but can itself lead to AKI, posing a significant challenge in the management of patients with concomitant COVID-19 and S. maltophilia pneumonia. CASE REPORT: A 64-year-old male with end-stage renal disease and post renal transplant presented with severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 and was intubated upon admission. His renal functions were normal at the time of admission. The patient subsequently developed superimposed bacterial pneumonia with S. maltophilia requiring administration of TMP/SMX. However, TMP/SMX led to the development of AKI, which continued to worsen despite appropriate management including hemodialysis. This coincided with and most likely resulted in the patient’s clinical deterioration and ultimate death. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of kidney disease involvement in patients with COVID-19 is still evolving and appears to be multifactorial. The condition can significantly worsen especially when nephrotoxic agents are given, probably due to a cumulative or synergistic effect. Great caution should be taken when administering nephrotoxic agents in the setting of COVID-19 as it can lead to adverse patient outcomes.","Mohamed, Mohamed A.; Kaur, Jasleen; Wani, Farah; Kichloo, Asim; Bhanot, Ravinder",Am J Case Rep,577,11

The current pandemic has completely altered the workflow of health services worldwide. However, even during this critical period, patients with other diseases, like cancer, need to be properly treated. A few reports have shown that mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 is higher in elderly patients and those with other active comorbidities, including cancer. Patients with lung cancer are at risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19, and as such, the risk/benefit ratio of local and systemic anticancer treatment has to be considered. For each patient, several factors, including age, comorbidities, and immunosuppression, as well as the number of hospital visits for treatment, can influence this risk. The number of cases is rising exponentially in Brazil, and it is important to consider the local characteristics when approaching the pandemic. In this regard, the Brazilian Thoracic Oncology Group has developed recommendations to guide decisions in lung cancer treatment during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Due to the scarcity of relevant data, discussions based on disease stage, evaluation of surgical treatment, radiotherapy techniques, systemic therapy, follow-up, and supportive care were carried out, and specific suggestions issued. All recommendations seek to reduce contagion risk by decreasing the number of medical visits and hospitalization, and in the case of immunosuppression, by adapting treatment schemes when possible.

To describe the characteristics of fake news about COVID-19 disseminated in Brazil from January to June 2020. METHOD. The fake news recorded until 30 June 2020 in two websites (Globo Corporation website G1 and Ministry of Health) were collected and categorized according to their content. From each piece of fake news, the following information was extracted: publication date, title, channel (e.g., WhatsApp), format (text, photo, video), and website in which it was recorded. Terms were selected from fake news titles for analysis in Google Trends to determine whether the number of searches using the selected terms had increased after the fake news appeared. The Brazilian regions with the highest percent increase in searches using the terms were also identified. RESULTS. In the two websites, 329 fake news about COVID-19 were retrieved. Most fake news were spread through WhatsApp and Facebook. The most frequent thematic categories were: politics (20.1%), epidemiology and statistics (e.g., proportion of cases and deaths) (19.5%), and prevention (16.1%).

Nonetheless, testing millions of people for a new virus brings about quite a few challenges. The development of effective tests for the new coronavirus has become a worldwide task that relies on recent discoveries and lessons learned from past outbreaks. In this work, we review the most recent publications on microfluidics devices for the detection of viruses. The topics of discussion include different detection approaches, methods of signalling and fabrication techniques. Besides the miniaturization of traditional benchtop detection assays, approaches such as electrochemical analyses, field-effect transistors and resistive pulse sensors are considered. For emergency fabrication of quick test kits, the local capabilities must be evaluated, and the joint work of universities, industries, and governments seems to be an unequivocal necessity.","Berkenbrock, José Alvim; Grecco-Machado, Rafaela; Achenbach, Sven",Proc Math Phys Eng Sci,577,6

This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients with COVID-19 at 7 designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The patients were followed up until June 30, 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with unsuccessful ECMO weaning. Propensity score matching was used to match patients who received veno-venous ECMO with those who received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)-only therapy. Of 88 patients receiving ECMO therapy, 27 and 61 patients were and were not successfully weaned from ECMO, respectively. Additionally, 15, 15, and 65 patients were further weaned from IMV, discharged from hospital, or died during hospitalization, respectively. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, a lymphocyte count ≤0.5×10(9)/L and D-dimer concentration >4× the upper limit of normal level at ICU admission, a peak PaCO(2) >60 mmHg at 24 h before ECMO initiation, and no tracheotomy performed during the ICU stay were independently associated with lower odds of ECMO weaning. In the propensity score-matched analysis, a mixed-effect Cox model detected a lower hazard ratio for 120-day all-cause mortality after ICU admission during hospitalization in the ECMO group. The presence of lymphocytopenia, higher D-dimer concentrations at ICU admission and hypercapnia before ECMO initiation could help to identify patients with a poor prognosis. Tracheotomy could facilitate weaning from ECMO. ECMO relative to IMV-only therapy was associated with improved outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Fang, Jing; Li, Rui; Chen, Yue; Qin, Juan-juan; Hu, Ming; Huang, Chao-lin; Cheng, Lin; He, Yi; Li, Yi; Zhou, Qiang; Zhou, Dai-xing; Huang, Fei; Lei, Fang; Yang, Bo; Chen, Jun; Deng, Hong-ping; Yuan, Yu-feng; Xia, Jia-hong; Wan, Song; Li, Hong-liang; Wei, Xiang",Curr Med Sci,577,29

It is much bigger than a bio-medical concern now with the multitudes of socio-economic, socio-political, socio-cultural, and psycho-social impact, which are likely to outlast the pandemic itself by far and long. The pandemic and the resulting challenges across societies highlighted the existing social injustices in a neoliberal world for historically marginalized populations like homeless persons with mental illness (HPMI). The nationwide lockdown in India to resist the spread of the virus posed a unique challenge to this vulnerable population. The present study thus attempts to understand the experience of HPMI during the COVID-19 induced lockdown through the theoretical framework of social justice vis-à-vis injustice. Semi-structured interviews have been conducted on seven HPMI rehabilitated in the community through an NGO situated in Kolkata, India. Seven stakeholders have also been interviewed to understand their experience in providing services to the HPMI during the COVID-19 induced lockdown. Analyses of the narratives have been done using initial coding, focused coding and axial coding through the process of constant comparison of constructivist grounded theory (CGT) methodology. Critical insights from the study bring out experiences of HPMI during COVID-19 as a victim of structural violence, highlighting their exclusion and victimization due to the existing marginalized status, living closer to the edge as a consequence of the lockdown, lack of awareness of the gravity of the pandemic situation. The experiences of the stakeholders, on the other hand, pointed out the role of community members and social workers in partially mitigating the challenges. This study indicates that to mitigate the aftermaths, stakeholders, including community members, need to work together for rebuilding and enhancing the strength and resilience of the marginalized populations like HPMI, who are historically victims of social injustice in the neoliberal pandemic era.","Bhattacharya, Prama; Khemka, Gunjan Chandak; Roy, Laboni; Roy, Sarbani Das",Front Psychiatry,577,22

We investigated the safety and feasibility of fluoroscopy‐guided nasojejunal (NJ) feeding tube placement in the prone position. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent fluoroscopic placement of NJ feeding tubes at a single institution between March 2020 and December 2020. Primary end points were success rate and number of attempts. Chi‐squared and Fischer exact tests were used to compare prone and supine groups. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were included in the study: 53 patients received NJ feeding tubes while prone and 157 while supine. All but one patient in the prone group had ARDS secondary to COVID‐19, whereas 47 (30.3%) had COVID‐19 in the supine group. The rate of successful placement was 94.3% in the prone group and 100% in the supine group. Mean number of attempts was 1.1 (SD, ±0.4) in the prone and 1.0 (SD, ±0.1) in the supine group (P = .14). Prone patients had a longer median fluoroscopy time (69 s, interquartile range [IQR] = 92; vs 48 s, IQR = 43; P < .001) and received a higher radiation dose during the procedure (47 mGy, IQR = 50; vs 25 mGy, IQR = 33; P = .004). No procedural complications were reported. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopy‐guided NJ feeding tube placement in prone patients is feasible and safe. Patient positioning should not delay obtaining postpyloric feeding access.","Kolbeinsson, Hordur Mar; Veldkamp, James; Paauw, James D.",JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr,577,1

Using aggregate app-based GPS positioning data from smartphone users, this study traces the changes in amenity visits in Somerville, MA from January 2019 to December 2020, describing how visits to particular types of amenities have changed as a result of business closures during the public health emergency. Has the pandemic fundamentally shifted amenity-oriented travel behavior or is consumer behavior returning to pre-pandemic trends? To address this question, we calibrate discrete choice models that are suited to Census block-group level analysis for each of the 24 months in a two-year period, and use them to analyze how visitors’ behavioral responses to various attributes of amenity clusters have shifted during different phases of the pandemic. Our findings suggest that in the first few months of the pandemic, amenity-visiting preferences significantly diverged from expected patterns. Even though overall trip volumes remained far below normal levels throughout the remainder of the year, preferences towards specific cluster attributes mostly returned to expected levels by September 2020. We also construct two scenarios to explore the implications of another shutdown and a full reopening, based on November 2020 consumer behavior. While government restrictions have played an important role in reducing visits to amenity clusters, our results imply that cautionary consumer behavior has played an important role as well, suggesting a likely long and slow path to economic recovery. By drawing on mobile phone location data and behavioral modeling, this paper offers timely insights to help decision-makers understand how this unprecedented health emergency is affecting amenity-related trips and where the greatest needs for intervention and support may exist.","Sevtsuk, Andres; Hudson, Annie; Halpern, Dylan; Basu, Rounaq; Ng, Kloe; de Jong, Jorrit",PLoS One,577,1

Methods China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), PubMed, and Embase were extensively searched using the search terms “Shuanghuanglian injection” and “Shuanghuanglian fenzhen” to retrieve articles relevant to SHLI (1992–2020). Retrieved articles were further investigated by two authors to exclude those unrelated to SHLI. The bibliographical references of the included articles were exported as raw data and then treated using the CiteSpace tool to visualize the mapping of the SHLI research domain. Essential clusters and highly frequent keywords were quantified for further analysis. The clusters were automatically labeled by the algorithm of tf*idf for objective analysis. Basic bibliometric features, including article types and yearly trend in article numbers were also determined and discussed. Results The modules of the keywords of interest presented clear boundaries with a high modularity score (Q = 0.73). High-confidence clusters were identified, including bioactivity fingerprint (S = 0.99), equal pupils (S = 0.91), drug preparation department (S = 0.87), difficulty in respiration (S = 0.85), peristalsis (0.88), and Danshen powder injection (S = 0.94). The characteristic keywords in terms of frequency and burstiness were Shuanghuanglian powder for injection (F = 235, B = 5.22), SHLI (F = 112, B = 11.39), and adverse drug reactions (ADRs; F = 104, B = 7.35). Conclusion In the field of SHLI study, there are five major topic categories: bioactivity fingerprint; ADR mechanism and cause detection; proper preparation; clinical evidence accumulation; and efficacy in diseases with no effective treatment and combination usage. The trend for using modern methodologies from a science-based perspective to study SHLI will continue to exist. The causes of multi-factorial ADRs may be an important topic for future studies.","Zhang, Qin; Rong, Guang; Meng, Qinggang; Yu, Mang; Xie, Qingyu; Fang, Jian",,577,1

Apart from RNA interference mediated by its endonuclease activity, the nuclease-deactivated form of Cas13 further provides a versatile RNA-guided RNA-targeting platform for manipulating kinds of RNA modifications post-transcriptionally. Chemical modifications modulate various aspects of RNA fate, including translation efficiency, alternative splicing, RNA–protein affinity, RNA–RNA interaction, RNA stability and RNA translocation, which ultimately orchestrate cellular biologic activities.

This has been related to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as animal studies indicate that these medications increase levels of ACE2, the cellular entry point for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This has prompted clinicians to recommend discontinuing ACEIs and ARBs. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of ACEIs or ARBs treatment on serum levels of ACE2 and other key enzymes in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single center population-based study of 5457 Icelanders from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS) of the elderly (mean age 75±6 years) stratified by ACEIs (N = 699) or ARBs (N = 753) treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The AGES-RS study population was stratified by ACEIs and ARBs medication use and compared for age, body mass index (BMI) (kg/m(2)), hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as serum levels of renin, ACE and ACE2. RESULTS: While renin and ACE levels were significantly raised in serum of individuals on ACEIs or ARBs treatments, the ACE2 levels remained unaffected. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment with ACEIs or ARBs does not raise ACE2 levels in serum. Therefore, the present study does not support the proposed discontinuation of these medications among patients affected with COVID-19.","Emilsson, Valur; Gudmundsson, Elias F.; Aspelund, Thor; Jonsson, Brynjolfur G.; Gudjonsson, Alexander; Launer, Lenore J.; Jennings, Lori L.; Gudmundsdottir, Valborg; Gudnason, Vilmundur",medRxiv,577,10

Consequently, any form of molecular AIT-promoting potent allergen-specific neutralizing antibodies would be preferred to conventional administration of allergen extracts. The potent immunogenicity of virus-like particles (VLPs) could be harnessed for that purpose. The particle size (20–200 nm) optimizes uptake by antigen-presenting cells as well as lymphatic trafficking. Moreover, the display of antigens in repetitive arrays promotes potent B cell activation for the development of sustained antibody responses. The presentation of self-antigens on the particle surface was even capable to break B cell tolerance. In this review, we describe the immunomodulatory properties of the 3 VLP-based strategies designed so far for the treatment of allergic disease: VLP packaged with CpG motifs as well as chimeric particles displaying pro-Th2/Th2 cytokines or allergens (full-length or B cell epitopes).","Pechsrichuang, Phornsiri; Namwongnao, Supannika; Jacquet, Alain",Allergy Asthma Immunol Res,577,27

The purpose of the current study was to determine the serological prevalence of past COVID-19 infection in a cohort of municipal law enforcement (LE) and firefighters (FFs). METHODS: Descriptive analysis of a de-identified data reporting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG), or COR2G, serology results for municipal FRs. As part of the serology process, FRs were surveyed for COVID-19-like symptoms since February 2020 and asked to report any prior COVID-19 nasal swab testing. Descriptive statistics and two-sided Chi Square tests with Yates correction were used to compare groups. RESULTS: Of 318 FRs, 225 (80.2%) underwent serology testing (LE: 163/207 [78.7%]; FF: 92/111 [82.9%]). The prevalence of positive serology for all FRs tested was 3/255 (1.2%). Two LE (1.2%) and one FF (1.1%) had positive serology (P = 1.0). Two hundred and twenty-four FRs responded to a survey regarding prior symptoms and testing. Fifty-eight (25.9%) FRs (44 LE; 14 FFs) reported the presence of COVID-19-like symptoms. Of these, only nine (15.5%) received reverse transcriptase – polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing; none were positive. Two of the three FRs with positive serology reported no COVID-19-like symptoms and none of these responders had received prior nasal RT-PCR swabs. The overall community positive RT-PCR rate was 0.36%, representing a three-fold higher rate of positive seroprevalence amongst FRs compared with the general population (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: Amongst a cohort of municipal FRs with low community COVID-19 prevalence, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-19 IgG Ab was three-fold greater than the general community. Two-thirds of positive FRs reported a lack of symptoms. Only 15.5% of FRs with COVID-19-like symptoms received RT-PCR testing. In addition to workplace control measures, increased testing availability to FRs is critical in limiting infection spread and ensuring response capability.","McGuire, Sarayna S.; Klassen, Aaron B.; Heywood, John; Sztajnkrycer, Matthew D.",Prehospital and disaster medicine,577,21
