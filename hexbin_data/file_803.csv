295535,Laboratory modeling of SARS-CoV-2 exposure reduction through physically distanced seating in aircraft cabins using bacteriophage aerosol - November 2020,2021,"This introductory article describes how modern financialized capitalist economies of the 21st Century, which adopted the neoliberal creed over the last half-century, have been facing increasing vulnerabilities whose acceptance of this policy system has made them progressively susceptible to crises, of which the COVID-19 pandemic will not be the last Government actions, especially on the fiscal side, have led to an unprecedented evolution of key macroeconomic variables which have stood on its head the neoliberal logic Given the requirements to protect our societies from the Coronavirus through programmed cuts in both employment and consumption spending, particularly during the severe lockdowns, government actions have not only starved modern credit-driven financialized economies of their key fuel but have, in many ways, further magnified the income and wealth inequalities that characterize our 21st Century dual economies The challenge will be how to break away from the neoliberal discourse that wants a return to the austerity policy box and to focuses, instead, on much-needed public investments with an eye to the future that will build public capacity so that modern societies become less vulnerable to future crises","Seccareccia, Mario Rochon Louis-Philippe",International Journal of Political Economy,,803
382960,"Masquez-vous, masquez-vous, masquez-vous !",2020,"Aim of Study: To explore the health condition of homecare patients infected with COVID-19, and to assess risk factors for their mortality Methods: Following a retrospective hospital-based research design, the data of 101 patients registered at the Homecare Department in the Armed Forces Hospitals of Southern Region (AFHSR), in Khamis Mushayt City, Aseer Region, Saudi Arabia, who were infected with COVID-19, were reviewed A data collection sheet was designed and used for data collection Results: Most homecare patients were elderly The mean±SD was 74 9±16 9 years Females constituted 58 4% of patients Almost half of the patients (47 5%) were admitted to the hospital Almost three-quarters of homecare patients (72 3%) were hypertensive, 69 3% were diabetic and 36 6% had chronic kidney disease Heart diseases included ischemic heart disease (16 8%), congestive heart failure (11 9%) and atrial fibrillation (10 9%) Neurological diseases included cerebrovascular accidents (19 8%), dementia (8 9%), and epilepsy (5%) Case fatality for COVID-19 among homecare patients was 26 7% Case fatality was significantly higher among those who were hospitalized (p&lt;0 001) Moreover, case fatality rates for COVID-19 among our patients were significantly higher among patients with diabetes (p=0 002), cerebrovascular accidents (p=0 009) and those with epilepsy (p=0 017) Conclusions: Most homecare patients infected with COVID-19 have associated comorbidity, mainly in the form of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney, heart and neurological diseases Case fatality rate due to COVID-19 among homecare patients is high, mainly due to their old age and associated morbidity Recommendations: Case fatality due to COVID-19 among homecare patients can be minimized by prior assessment of the adequacy of home environment for the continuity of care, provision of health education to patients and their family members regarding the recommended health precautions [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Middle East Journal of Family Medicine is the property of Medi+WORLD International Pty Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","alqahtani, Ali Mohammad Alshahrani Faisal Mubarak Esmail Khalaf Mohamed M.; Rezk, Sameh Reda",Middle East Journal of Family Medicine,,803
383831,"Biomarkers of COVID-19, a Longitudinal and Retrospective Assessment of a NYC 1st Wave Cohort",2021,"There is a rising global concern for the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome. We confirm high sequence similarity (>99%) between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hypervariable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches.","Ceraolo, Carmine; Giorgi, Federico M",J Med Virol,,803
432740,"Implications of shortened quarantine among household contacts of index patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection - Tennessee and Wisconsin, April-September 2020",2021,"Background: Although reasonable to assume, it is not yet clear whether malnourished countries are at higher risk for severe or fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) This study aims to identify the countries where prevalent malnutrition may be a driving factor for fatal disease after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection Methods: Using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease 2019, country-level burden of malnutrition was quantified using four indicators: death rates for child growth failure (underweight, stunting, and/or wasting) and years lived with disability (YLD) attributed to iron and vitamin A deficiencies and high body mass index (BMI) Global mortality descriptors of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic were extracted from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and case fatality ratios (CFRs) were calculated introducing a lag time of 10 weeks after the first death of a confirmed case Bivariate analyses for 172 countries were carried out for malnutrition indicators and fatal COVID-19 Correlations between burden indicators were characterized by Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (ρ) and visually by scatterplots Restricted cubic splines and underlying negative binomial regressions adjusted for countries' age-structure, prevalent chronic comorbidities related to COVID-19, population density, and income group were used to explore non-linear relationships Results: Stratified by the World Bank income group, a moderate positive association between YLD rates for iron deficiency and CFRs for COVID-19 was observed for low-income countries (ρ = 0 60, p = 0 027), whereas no clear indications for the association with child growth failure, vitamin A deficiency, or high BMI were found (ρ &lt; 0 30) Countries ranking high on at least three malnutrition indicators and presenting also an elevated CFR for COVID-19 are sub-Saharan African countries, namely, Angola, Burkina Faso, Chad, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Sudan, and Tanzania, as well as Yemen and Guyana Conclusions: Population-level malnutrition appears to be related to increased rates of fatal COVID-19 in areas with an elevated burden of undernutrition, such as countries in the Sahel strip COVID-19 response plans in malnourished countries, vulnerable to fatal COVID-19, should incorporate food security, nutrition, and social protection as a priority component in order to reduce COVID-19 fatality","Mertens, E.; Peñalvo, J.

457693,Relapse Versus Reinfection: A Case of Recurrence of COVID-19 Infection During Pregnancy,2021,"The main aim of this paper is to identify and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cultural and creative industries from the national point of view and to assess the measures applied by the Slovak government in order to eliminate its consequences. The paper is oriented towards a microeconomic and macroeconomic perspective with special attention devoted to the financing of the cultural and creative industries, and the social impacts on the different groups of respondents. Because of the lack of data (even non-existence), this paper presents the results of original primary research conducted among representatives of these industries between November and December 2020 and through online structured interview with the representatives of the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic. The last part of the paper critically evaluates the implemented support measures and their real influence on solving the unprecedented crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in cultural and creative industries. © The Author(s) 2021.","Vitálišová, K.; Borseková, K.; Vaňová, A.; Helie, T.","Scientific Papers of the University of Pardubice, Series D: Faculty of Economics and Administration",,803
