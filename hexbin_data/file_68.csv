96,Transmission Parameters of the 2001 Foot and Mouth Epidemic in Great Britain,2007-06-06,"Despite intensive ongoing research, key aspects of the spatial-temporal evolution of the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Great Britain (GB) remain unexplained. Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.","Chis Ster, Irina; Ferguson, Neil M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876810/,68
563,Temporal Anomalies in Immunological Gene Expression in a Time Series of Wild Mice: Signature of an Epidemic?,2011-05-23,"Although the ecological importance of coinfection is increasingly recognized, analyses of microbial pathogen dynamics in wildlife usually focus on an ad hoc subset of the species present due to technological limitations on detection. Here we demonstrate the use of expression profiles for immunological genes (pattern recognition receptors, cytokines and transcription factors) as a means to identify, without preconception, the likelihood of important acute microbial infections in wildlife. Using a wood mouse population in the UK as a model we identified significant temporal clusters of individuals with extreme expression of immunological mediators across multiple loci, typical of an acute microbial infection. These clusters were circumstantially associated with demographic perturbation in the summertime wood mouse population. Animals in one cluster also had significantly higher individual macroparasite burdens than contemporaries with “normal” expression patterns. If the extreme transcriptional profiles observed are induced by an infectious agent then this implicates macroparasites as a possible player in mediating individual susceptibility or resilience to infection. The form of survey described here, combined with next generation nucleic acids sequencing methods for the broad detection of microbial infectious agents in individuals with anomalous immunological transcriptional profiles, could be a powerful tool for revealing unrecognized, ecologically important infectious agents circulating in wildlife populations.","Friberg, Ida M.; Lowe, Ann; Ralli, Catriona; Bradley, Janette E.; Jackson, Joseph A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3100328/,68
614,Antigen-expressing immunostimulatory liposomes as a genetically programmable synthetic vaccine,2010-10-26,"Liposomes are versatile (sub)micron-sized membrane vesicles that can be used for a variety of applications, including drug delivery and in vivo imaging but they also represent excellent models for artificial membranes or cells. Several studies have demonstrated that in vitro transcription and translation can take place inside liposomes to obtain compartmentalized production of functional proteins within the liposomes (Kita et al. in Chembiochem 9(15):2403–2410, 2008; Moritani et al.in FEBS J, 2010; Kuruma et al. in Methods Mol Biol 607:161–171, 2010; Murtas et al. in Biochem Biophys Res Commun 363(1):12–17, 2007; Sunami et al. in Anal Biochem 357(1):128–136, 2006; Ishikawa et al. in FEBS Lett 576(3):387–390, 2004; Oberholzer et al. in Biochem Biophys Res Commun 261(2):238–241, 1999). Such a minimal artificial cell-based model is ideal for synthetic biology based applications. In this study, we propose the use of liposomes as artificial microbes for vaccination. These artificial microbes can be genetically programmed to produce specific antigens at will. To show proof-of-concept for this artificial cell-based platform, a bacterial in vitro transcription and translation system together with a gene construct encoding the model antigen β-galactosidase were entrapped inside multilamellar liposomes. Vaccination studies in mice showed that such antigen-expressing immunostimulatory liposomes (AnExILs) elicited higher specific humoral immune responses against the produced antigen (β-galactosidase) than control vaccines (i.e. AnExILs without genetic input, liposomal β-galactosidase or pDNA encoding β-galactosidase). In conclusion, AnExILs present a new platform for DNA-based vaccines which combines antigen production, adjuvanticity and delivery in one system and which offer several advantages over existing vaccine formulations.","Amidi, Maryam; de Raad, Markus; Crommelin, Daan J.

851,PepMapper: A Collaborative Web Tool for Mapping Epitopes from Affinity-Selected Peptides,2012-05-25,"Epitope mapping from affinity-selected peptides has become popular in epitope prediction, and correspondingly many Web-based tools have been developed in recent years. However, the performance of these tools varies in different circumstances. To address this problem, we employed an ensemble approach to incorporate two popular Web tools, MimoPro and Pep-3D-Search, together for taking advantages offered by both methods so as to give users more options for their specific purposes of epitope-peptide mapping. The combined operation of Union finds as many associated peptides as possible from both methods, which increases sensitivity in finding potential epitopic regions on a given antigen surface. The combined operation of Intersection achieves to some extent the mutual verification by the two methods and hence increases the likelihood of locating the genuine epitopic region on a given antigen in relation to the interacting peptides. The Consistency between Intersection and Union is an indirect sufficient condition to assess the likelihood of successful peptide-epitope mapping. On average from 27 tests, the combined operations of PepMapper outperformed either MimoPro or Pep-3D-Search alone. Therefore, PepMapper is another multipurpose mapping tool for epitope prediction from affinity-selected peptides.

945,Regulated multicistronic expression technology for mammalian metabolic engineering,1998-01-01,"Contemporary basic research is rapidly revealing increasingly complex molecular regulatory networks which are often interconnected via key signal integrators. These connections among regulatory and catalytic networks often frustrate bioengineers as promising metabolic engineering strategies are bypassed by compensatory metabolic responses or cause unexpected, undesired outcomes such as apoptosis, product protein degradation or inappropriate post- translational modification. Therefore, for metabolic engineering to achieve greater success in mammalian cell culture processes and to become important for future applications such as gene therapy and tissue engineering, this technology must be enhanced to allow simultaneous, in cases conditional, reshaping of metabolic pathways to access difficult-to-attain cell states. Recent advances in this new territory of multigene metabolic engineering are intimately linked to the development of multicistronic expression technology which allows the simultaneous, and in some cases, regulated expression of several genes in mammalian cells. Here we review recent achievements in multicistronic expression technology in view of multigene metabolic engineering.","Fussenegger, Martin; Moser, Samuel; Bailey, James E.",Cytotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3449837/,68
1072,Synthetic Genomics and Synthetic Biology Applications Between Hopes and Concerns,2013-03-11,"New organisms and biological systems designed to satisfy human needs are among the aims of synthetic genomics and synthetic biology. Synthetic biology seeks to model and construct biological components, functions and organisms that do not exist in nature or to redesign existing biological systems to perform new functions. Synthetic genomics, on the other hand, encompasses technologies for the generation of chemically-synthesized whole genomes or larger parts of genomes, allowing to simultaneously engineer a myriad of changes to the genetic material of organisms. Engineering complex functions or new organisms in synthetic biology are thus progressively becoming dependent on and converging with synthetic genomics. While applications from both areas have been predicted to offer great benefits by making possible new drugs, renewable chemicals or clean energy, they have also given rise to concerns about new safety, environmental and socio-economic risks – stirring an increasingly polarizing debate. Here we intend to provide an overview on recent progress in biomedical and biotechnological applications of synthetic genomics and synthetic biology as well as on arguments and evidence related to their possible benefits, risks and governance implications.","König, Harald; Frank, Daniel; Heil, Reinhard; Coenen, Christopher",Curr Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3580775/,68
1285,MicroRNA-based strategy to mitigate the risk of gain-of-function influenza studies,2013-08-11,"Recent gain-of-function studies in influenza A virus H5N1 strains revealed that as few as three amino-acid changes in the hemagglutinin protein confer the capacity for viral transmission between ferrets(1, 2). As transmission between ferrets is considered a surrogate indicator of transmissibility between humans, these studies raised concerns about the risks of gain-of-function influenza A virus research. Here we present an approach to strengthen the biosafety of gain-of-function influenza experiments. We exploit species-specific endogenous small RNAs to restrict influenza A virus tropism. In particular, we found that the microRNA miR-192 was expressed in primary human respiratory tract epithelial cells as well as mouse lungs but absent from the ferret respiratory tract. Incorporation of miR-192 target sites into influenza A virus did not prevent influenza replication and transmissibility in ferrets, but did attenuate influenza pathogenicity in mice. This molecular biocontainment approach should be applicable beyond influenza A virus to minimize the risk of experiments involving other pathogenic viruses.","Langlois, Ryan A.; Albrecht, Randy A.; Kimble, Brian; Sutton, Troy; Shapiro, Jillian S.; Finch, Courtney; Angel, Matthew; Chua, Mark A.; Gonzalez-Reiche, Ana Silvia; Xu, Kemin; Perez, Daniel; García-Sastre, Adolfo; tenOever, Benjamin R.",Nat Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3808852/,68
1493,"Response surface modeling for hot, humid air decontamination of materials contaminated with Bacillus anthracis ∆Sterne and Bacillus thuringiensis Al Hakam spores",2014-05-01,"Response surface methodology using a face-centered cube design was used to describe and predict spore inactivation of Bacillus anthracis ∆Sterne and Bacillus thuringiensis Al Hakam spores after exposure of six spore-contaminated materials to hot, humid air. For each strain/material pair, an attempt was made to fit a first or second order model. All three independent predictor variables (temperature, relative humidity, and time) were significant in the models except that time was not significant for B. thuringiensis Al Hakam on nylon. Modeling was unsuccessful for wiring insulation and wet spores because there was complete spore inactivation in the majority of the experimental space. In cases where a predictive equation could be fit, response surface plots with time set to four days were generated. The survival of highly purified Bacillus spores can be predicted for most materials tested when given the settings for temperature, relative humidity, and time. These predictions were cross-checked with spore inactivation measurements.","Prokop, Edward J; Crigler, John R; Wells, Claire M; Young, Alice A; Buhr, Tony L",AMB Express,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4052701/,68
1613,Adaptive Management and the Value of Information: Learning Via Intervention in Epidemiology,2014-10-21,"Optimal intervention for disease outbreaks is often impeded by severe scientific uncertainty. Adaptive management (AM), long-used in natural resource management, is a structured decision-making approach to solving dynamic problems that accounts for the value of resolving uncertainty via real-time evaluation of alternative models. We propose an AM approach to design and evaluate intervention strategies in epidemiology, using real-time surveillance to resolve model uncertainty as management proceeds, with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) culling and measles vaccination as case studies. We use simulations of alternative intervention strategies under competing models to quantify the effect of model uncertainty on decision making, in terms of the value of information, and quantify the benefit of adaptive versus static intervention strategies. Culling decisions during the 2001 UK FMD outbreak were contentious due to uncertainty about the spatial scale of transmission. The expected benefit of resolving this uncertainty prior to a new outbreak on a UK-like landscape would be £45–£60 million relative to the strategy that minimizes livestock losses averaged over alternate transmission models. AM during the outbreak would be expected to recover up to £20.1 million of this expected benefit. AM would also recommend a more conservative initial approach (culling of infected premises and dangerous contact farms) than would a fixed strategy (which would additionally require culling of contiguous premises). For optimal targeting of measles vaccination, based on an outbreak in Malawi in 2010, AM allows better distribution of resources across the affected region; its utility depends on uncertainty about both the at-risk population and logistical capacity. When daily vaccination rates are highly constrained, the optimal initial strategy is to conduct a small, quick campaign; a reduction in expected burden of approximately 10,000 cases could result if campaign targets can be updated on the basis of the true susceptible population. Formal incorporation of a policy to update future management actions in response to information gained in the course of an outbreak can change the optimal initial response and result in significant cost savings. AM provides a framework for using multiple models to facilitate public-health decision making and an objective basis for updating management actions in response to improved scientific understanding.","Shea, Katriona; Tildesley, Michael J.; Runge, Michael C.; Fonnesbeck, Christopher J.; Ferrari, Matthew J.",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4204804/,68
1679,Finding and identifying the viral needle in the metagenomic haystack: trends and challenges,2015-01-07,"Collectively, viruses have the greatest genetic diversity on Earth, occupy extremely varied niches and are likely able to infect all living organisms. Viral infections are an important issue for human health and cause considerable economic losses when agriculturally important crops or husbandry animals are infected. The advent of metagenomics has provided a precious tool to study viruses by sampling them in natural environments and identifying the genomic composition of a sample. However, reaching a clear recognition and taxonomic assignment of the identified viruses has been hampered by the computational difficulty of these problems. In this perspective paper we examine the trends in current research for the identification of viral sequences in a metagenomic sample, pinpoint the intrinsic computational difficulties for the identification of novel viral sequences within metagenomic samples, and suggest possible avenues to overcome them.","Soueidan, Hayssam; Schmitt, Louise-Amélie; Candresse, Thierry; Nikolski, Macha",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4285800/,68
1689,Animal board invited review: advances in proteomics for animal and food sciences,2014-10-31,"Animal production and health (APH) is an important sector in the world economy, representing a large proportion of the budget of all member states in the European Union and in other continents. APH is a highly competitive sector with a strong emphasis on innovation and, albeit with country to country variations, on scientific research. Proteomics (the study of all proteins present in a given tissue or fluid – i.e. the proteome) has an enormous potential when applied to APH. Nevertheless, for a variety of reasons and in contrast to disciplines such as plant sciences or human biomedicine, such potential is only now being tapped. To counter such limited usage, 6 years ago we created a consortium dedicated to the applications of Proteomics to APH, specifically in the form of a Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action, termed FA1002 – Proteomics in Farm Animals: www.cost-faproteomics.org. In 4 years, the consortium quickly enlarged to a total of 31 countries in Europe, as well as Israel, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. This article has a triple purpose. First, we aim to provide clear examples on the applications and benefits of the use of proteomics in all aspects related to APH. Second, we provide insights and possibilities on the new trends and objectives for APH proteomics applications and technologies for the years to come. Finally, we provide an overview and balance of the major activities and accomplishments of the COST Action on Farm Animal Proteomics. These include activities such as the organization of seminars, workshops and major scientific conferences, organization of summer schools, financing Short-Term Scientific Missions (STSMs) and the generation of scientific literature. Overall, the Action has attained all of the proposed objectives and has made considerable difference by putting proteomics on the global map for animal and veterinary researchers in general and by contributing significantly to reduce the East–West and North–South gaps existing in the European farm animal research. Future activities of significance in the field of scientific research, involving members of the action, as well as others, will likely be established in the future.","Almeida, A.

1986,"Characterization of a New Pathogenic Acanthamoeba Species, A. byersi n. sp., Isolated from a Human with Fatal Amoebic Encephalitis",2013-07-24,"Acanthamoeba spp. are free‐living amoebae that are ubiquitous in natural environments. They can cause cutaneous, nasopharyngeal, and disseminated infection, leading to granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE) in immunocompromised individuals. In addition, they can cause amoebic keratitis in contact lens wearers. Acanthamoeba GAE is almost always fatal because of difficulty and delay in diagnosis and lack of optimal antimicrobial therapy. Here, we report the description of an unusual strain isolated from skin and brain of a GAE patient. The amoebae displayed large trophozoites and star‐shaped cysts, characteristics for acanthamoebas belonging to morphology Group 1. However, its unique morphology and growth characteristics differentiated this new strain from other Group 1 species. DNA sequence analysis, secondary structure prediction, and phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rRNA gene confirmed that this new strain belonged to Group 1, but that it was distinct from the other sequence types within that group. Thus, we hereby propose the establishment of a new species, Acanthamoeba byersi n. sp. as well as a new sequence type, T18, for this new strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Group 1 Acanthamoeba that is indisputably pathogenic in humans.","Qvarnstrom, Yvonne; Nerad, Thomas A.; Visvesvara, Govinda S.",J Eukaryot Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4618466/,68
2098,Zebrafish and Medaka: new model organisms for modern biomedical research,2016-01-28,"Although they are primitive vertebrates, zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes) have surpassed other animals as the most used model organisms based on their many advantages. Studies on gene expression patterns, regulatory cis-elements identification, and gene functions can be facilitated by using zebrafish embryos via a number of techniques, including transgenesis, in vivo transient assay, overexpression by injection of mRNAs, knockdown by injection of morpholino oligonucleotides, knockout and gene editing by CRISPR/Cas9 system and mutagenesis. In addition, transgenic lines of model fish harboring a tissue-specific reporter have become a powerful tool for the study of biological sciences, since it is possible to visualize the dynamic expression of a specific gene in the transparent embryos. In particular, some transgenic fish lines and mutants display defective phenotypes similar to those of human diseases. Therefore, a wide variety of fish model not only sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis in vivo but also provides a living platform for high-throughput screening of drug candidates. Interestingly, transgenic model fish lines can also be applied as biosensors to detect environmental pollutants, and even as pet fish to display beautiful fluorescent colors. Therefore, transgenic model fish possess a broad spectrum of applications in modern biomedical research, as exampled in the following review.","Lin, Cheng-Yung; Chiang, Cheng-Yi; Tsai, Huai-Jen",J Biomed Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730764/,68
2396,Tuberculosis Susceptibility and Vaccine Protection Are Independently Controlled by Host Genotype,2016-09-20,"The outcome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and the immunological response to the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine are highly variable in humans. Deciphering the relative importance of host genetics, environment, and vaccine preparation for the efficacy of BCG has proven difficult in natural populations. We developed a model system that captures the breadth of immunological responses observed in outbred individual mice, which can be used to understand the contribution of host genetics to vaccine efficacy. This system employs a panel of highly diverse inbred mouse strains, consisting of the founders and recombinant progeny of the “Collaborative Cross” project. Unlike natural populations, the structure of this panel allows the serial evaluation of genetically identical individuals and the quantification of genotype-specific effects of interventions such as vaccination. When analyzed in the aggregate, our panel resembled natural populations in several important respects: the animals displayed a broad range of susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, differed in their immunological responses to infection, and were not durably protected by BCG vaccination. However, when analyzed at the genotype level, we found that these phenotypic differences were heritable. M. tuberculosis susceptibility varied between lines, from extreme sensitivity to progressive M. tuberculosis clearance. Similarly, only a minority of the genotypes was protected by vaccination. The efficacy of BCG was genetically separable from susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, and the lack of efficacy in the aggregate analysis was driven by nonresponsive lines that mounted a qualitatively distinct response to infection. These observations support an important role for host genetic diversity in determining BCG efficacy and provide a new resource to rationally develop more broadly efficacious vaccines.","Smith, Clare M.; Proulx, Megan K.; Olive, Andrew J.; Laddy, Dominick; Mishra, Bibhuti B.; Moss, Caitlin; Gutierrez, Nuria Martinez; Bellerose, Michelle M.; Barreira-Silva, Palmira; Phuah, Jia Yao; Baker, Richard E.; Behar, Samuel M.; Kornfeld, Hardy; Evans, Thomas G.; Beamer, Gillian; Sassetti, Christopher M.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5030360/,68
2583,Antibacterial Properties of Visible-Light-Responsive Carbon-Containing Titanium Dioxide Photocatalytic Nanoparticles against Anthrax,2016-12-09,"The bactericidal activity of conventional titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) photocatalyst is effective only on irradiation by ultraviolet light, which restricts the applications of TiO(2) for use in living environments. Recently, carbon-containing TiO(2) nanoparticles [TiO(2)(C) NP] were found to be a visible-light-responsive photocatalyst (VLRP), which displayed significantly enhanced antibacterial properties under visible light illumination. However, whether TiO(2)(C) NPs exert antibacterial properties against Bacillus anthracis remains elusive. Here, we evaluated these VLRP NPs in the reduction of anthrax-induced pathogenesis. Bacteria-killing experiments indicated that a significantly higher proportion (40%–60%) of all tested Bacillus species, including B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis, were considerably eliminated by TiO(2)(C) NPs. Toxin inactivation analysis further suggested that the TiO(2)(C) NPs efficiently detoxify approximately 90% of tested anthrax lethal toxin, a major virulence factor of anthrax. Notably, macrophage clearance experiments further suggested that, even under suboptimal conditions without considerable bacterial killing, the TiO(2)(C) NP-mediated photocatalysis still exhibited antibacterial properties through the reduction of bacterial resistance against macrophage killing. Our results collectively suggested that TiO(2)(C) NP is a conceptually feasible anti-anthrax material, and the relevant technologies described herein may be useful in the development of new strategies against anthrax.","Sun, Der-Shan; Kau, Jyh-Hwa; Huang, Hsin-Hsien; Tseng, Yao-Hsuan; Wu, Wen-Shiang; Chang, Hsin-Hou",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5302719/,68

The modern world intends to replace these noxious chemicals with environmental friendly products for the betterment of life on the planet. Establishing enzymatic processes in spite of chemical processes has been a prime objective of scientists. Various enzymes, specifically microbial proteases, are the most essentially used in different corporate sectors, such as textile, detergent, leather, feed, waste, and others. Proteases with respect to physiological and commercial roles hold a pivotal position. As they are performing synthetic and degradative functions, proteases are found ubiquitously, such as in plants, animals, and microbes. Among different producers of proteases, Bacillus sp. are mostly commercially exploited microbes for proteases. Proteases are successfully considered as an alternative to chemicals and an eco-friendly indicator for nature or the surroundings. The evolutionary relationship among acidic, neutral, and alkaline proteases has been analyzed based on their protein sequences, but there remains a lack of information that regulates the diversity in their specificity. Researchers are looking for microbial proteases as they can tolerate harsh conditions, ways to prevent autoproteolytic activity, stability in optimum pH, and substrate specificity. The current review focuses on the comparison among different proteases and the current problems faced during production and application at the industrial level.

4817,A Novel Substituted Guanidine with High Activity in vitro against Rhinoviruses,1973,"VON WILLEBRAND'S disease (VWD) is an autosomally inherited disorder characterised by low factor VIII activity (antihaemophilic factor, AHF), prolonged bleeding time, reduced retention of platelets in a glass bead column and abnormal distocetin-induced platelet aggregation. The prolonged bleeding time in VWD has been attributed to the absence of a plasma factor, the von Willebrand factor (VWF), as shown by a correction of the bleeding time after infusion of normal and haemophilic plasmas(1). Addition of purified factor VIII in vitro specifically corrects the abnormal platelet retention and ristocetin aggregation in VWD(2–5), whereas transfusion of similar material into dogs with VWD also corrects the prolonged bleeding time (B.N.B., W. J. Dodds, J. A. van Mourik, J.J.S and W. P. Webster, unpublished). This led to the suggestion that factor VIII is closely related if not identical to VWF, although dissociation of factor VIII procoagulant activity from factor VIII-related antigen (F VIII-RA) is observed in certain conditions(6,7). The plasma concentration of F VIII-RA is usually reduced in VWD suggesting a reduced synthesis of factor VIII (VWF)(8). In contrast to this we now report the presence of normal concentrations of F VIII-RA in platelets of patients with VWD. This F VIII-RA supported aggregation induced by ristocetin in a washed platelet system(9), a property of factor VIII which has been attributed to VWF activity.","BOUMA, B. N.; HORDIJK-HOS, J.

Using a geographic information system (GIS), wells were selected that were likely to draw water that had been in contact with lignite; control wells were located in areas devoid of lignite deposits. Well water samples were analyzed for pH, conductivity, organic compounds, and nutrient and anion concentrations. All samples were further tested for presence of fungi (cultures maintained for up to 28 days and colonies counted and identified microscopically) and for metal and trace element concentration by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry and atomic emission spectrometry. Surface water samples were tested for dissolved oxygen and presence of pathogenic leptospiral bacteria. The Spearman correlation method was used to assess the association between the endpoints for these field/laboratory analyses and incidence of cancer of the renal pelvis (RPC) based on data obtained from the Louisiana Tumor Registry for the five Parishes included in the study. Significant associations were revealed between the cancer rate and the presence in drinking water of organic compounds, the fungi Zygomycetes, the nutrients PO(4) and NH(3), and 13 chemical elements. Presence of human pathogenic leptospires was detected in four out of eight (50%) of the surface water sites sampled. The present study of a stable rural population examined possible linkages between aquifers containing chemically reactive lignite deposits, hydrologic conditions favorable to the␣leaching and transport of toxic organic compounds from the lignite into the groundwater, possible microbial contamination, and RPC risk.","Bunnell, Joseph E.; Tatu, Calin A.; Bushon, Rebecca N.; Stoeckel, Donald M.; Brady, Amie M.

5278,Methods for counting particles in microfluidic applications,2009-08-20,"This is the continuation of our studies on the prediction of mutation engineered by randomness in proteins from influenza A virus. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that randomness plays a role in engineering mutations because the measures of randomness in protein are different before and after mutations. Thus we built a cause-mutation relationship to count the mutation engineered by randomness, and conducted several concept-initiated studies to predict the mutations in proteins from influenza A virus, which demonstrated the possibility of prediction of mutations along this line of thought. On the other hand, these concept-initiated studies indicate the directions forwards the enhancement of predictability, of which we need to use the neural network instead of logistic regression that was used in those concept-initiated studies to enhance the predictability. In this proof-of-concept study, we attempt to apply the neural network to modeling the cause-mutation relationship to predict the possible mutation positions, and then we use the amino acid mutating probability to predict the would-be-mutated amino acids at predicted positions. The results confirm the possibility of use of internal cause-mutation relationship with neural network model to predict the mutation positions and use of amino acid mutating probability to predict the would-be-mutated amino acids.","Wu, G.; Yan, S.",Amino Acids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088403/,68

Rigorous qualitative analysis of the model show that it has a globally-stable disease-free equilibrium whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text], is less than unity. The model has an endemic equilibrium whenever [Formula: see text]. The endemic equilibrium is shown to be locally-asymptotically stable for a special case. Numerical simulations of the model show that the use of the combined testing and treatment strategy is more effective than the use of the standard ELISA testing method with ARV treatment, even for the use of condoms as a singular strategy. Furthermore, the universal strategy (which involves the use of condoms, the two testing methods and ARV treatment) is always more effective than the combined use of the standard ELISA testing method and ARVs.","Podder, C.

Successive steps in entry include binding to receptors, endocytosis, passage through one or more membranes, targeting to specific sites within the cell, and uncoating of the genome. For some viruses, the molecular interactions are known in great detail. However, as more viruses are analyzed, and as the focus shifts from tissue culture to in vivo experiments, it is evident that viruses display considerable redundancy and flexibility in receptor usage, endocytic mechanism, location of penetration, and uncoating mechanism. For many viruses, the picture is still elusive because the interactions that they engage in rely on sophisticated adaptation to complex cellular functions and defense mechanisms.","Helenius, Ari",J Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094621/,68

However, data regarding their usefulness in predicting the short-term outcome of end-stage liver disease are not available in India. This prospective study compared the CTP score, MELD score and MELD-Na score as predictors of short-term outcome among patients with end-stage liver disease. METHODS: CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores were determined in 171 patients with end-stage liver disease at a tertiary healthcare centre in India at the time of admission, and the concordance (C-) statistics of the three scores for 3-month mortality were assessed and compared. The aetiology of end-stage liver disease and the clinical presentation were determined. RESULTS: The CTP score, MELD score and MELD-Na score on day 1 were significantly higher among non-survivors than among survivors (p < 0.0001 each). The C-statistic for 3-month mortality for the CTP score was 0.93 (p < 0.0001), that for the MELD score was 0.86 (p < 0.0001) and that for the MELD-Na score was 0.83 (p < 0.0001). The C-statistics of these scores differed significantly for 3-month mortality, and the CTP score was better than the MELD (p < 0.0001) and MELD-Na (p < 0.0001) scores in predicting 3-month mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores were very good predictors of mortality at 3 months among patients with end-stage liver disease. The CTP score was superior to the MELD and MELD-Na scores in predicting 3-month mortality.","Acharya, Gagandeep; Kaushik, Rajeev Mohan; Gupta, Rohit; Kaushik, Reshma",Inflamm Intest Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098314/,68

Acacetin, a natural flavonoid compound, has anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects which can potentially work to reduce sepsis. We investigated the potential protective effect of acacetin on sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) ALI and dissect out the underlying mechanisms. Mice were divided into five groups: a sham group, a sepsis-induced ALI group, and three sepsis groups pre-treated with 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg body weight of acacetin. We found that acacetin significantly attenuated sepsis-induced ALI, in histological examinations and lung edema. Additionally, acacetin treatment decreased protein and inflammatory cytokine concentration and the number of infiltrated inflammatory cells in BALF compared with that in the non-treated sepsis mice. Pulmonary myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was lower in the acacetin-pre-treated sepsis groups than in the sepsis group. The mechanism underlying the protective effect of acacetin on sepsis is related to the regulation of certain antioxidation genes, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), superoxide dismutases (SODs), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1).Taken together, our results indicate that acacetin pre-treatment inhibits sepsis-induced ALI through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activity, suggesting that acacetin may be a potential protective agent for sepsis-induced ALI.","Sun, Li-Chao; Zhang, Hong-Bo; Gu, Cheng-Dong; Guo, Shi-Dong; Li, Gang; Lian, Rui; Yao, Yao; Zhang, Guo-Qiang",Arch Pharm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101724/,68

The current study was conducted to investigate the positive effects of dietary propolis (PR), as a potent naturally produced antioxidant, on growth performance and immune function of turkey poults exposed to oxidative stress induced by PQ injection. Native male turkey poults (n = 120, 49-d-old) were randomly assigned into 4 groups: poults received a basal diet with a daily subcutaneous PQ injection of 5 mg/kg BW for 7 consecutive days (PQ group), an experimental diet containing 1 g/kg PR with a daily subcutaneous PQ injection for 7 days (PR+PQ group), or received the experimental PR diet with a daily subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mL sterile saline for 7 days (PR group); while the control poults received a basal diet with a daily subcutaneous saline injection for 7 consecutive days (C group). The productive performance in the PQ group showed a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the weight gain (WG) and feed intake (FI), and impaired feed conversion ratio (FCR). Propolis supplementation in the PR+PQ group significantly ameliorated the PQ effects on WG and FCR. Turkey poults of the PQ and PR+PQ groups had a significant augmentation in the blood malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), and corticosterone levels, and in contrast, a significant reduction in the triiodothyronine (T(3)), when compared to the C group. While propolis significantly reduced the MDA and corticosterone, and increased the T(3) levels in the PR+PQ group compared to the PQ group. Furthermore, the dietary PR supplementation significantly limited the PQ-suppressive effects on cell- and humoral-mediated immunity and lymphocyte proliferation of turkey poults. In addition, propolis supplementation in the PR and PR+PQ groups markedly reversed the PQ-induced DNA fragmentation and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) over-expression in blood cells. It can be concluded that PR could improve turkey immunity and performance, particularly under inflammation and oxidative stress induced by PQ exposure.","Abass, Ahmed O; Kamel, Nancy N; Khalifa, Walaa H; Gouda, G F; El-Manylawi, M A F; Mehaisen, Gamal M K; Mashaly, Magdi M",Poult Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107162/,68

In evaluating a photochemical treatment process for inactivating parvovirus B19, there lacked simple culture methods to measure infectivity. The recently developed enzyme‐linked immunospot (ELISpot) infectivity assay uses late‐stage erythropoietic progenitor cells and is labor intensive and time consuming. We evaluated a novel, efficient polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibition assay and examined correlations with reductions in infectivity. Methods. Contaminated plasma was treated with 150 μmol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A light and then tested for DNA modification using conventional PCR inhibition and a novel preamplification approach. The novel assay subjected the samples to preamplification cycles using long‐template PCR, followed by quantitative PCR (QPCR) inhibition detection. Both approaches were tested for correlations with reductions in viral infectivity by comparing ELISpot assay results of identical samples. Results. The B19 preamplification inhibition assay showed detection ranges of 2–2.5 log and demonstrated quantitative correlation with up to a 5.8‐log reduction in viral infectivity in ELISpot results. Conventional PCR detected a >5 log reduction in amplification, correlated with a 4.4‐log reduction in viral infectivity. A range of 4‐log inhibition of hepatitis B virus DNA amplification was also achieved. Conclusions. The results demonstrated that a novel preamplification QPCR assay is a useful tool for predicting reductions in infectivity after photochemical treatment. This assay was extended to show utility in circumstances where practical in vitro assays are unavailable for the determination of the efficacy of pathogen inactivation.","Allain, Jean‐Pierre; Hsu, Jocelyn; Pranmeth, Manisha; Hanson, Deborah; Stassinopoulos, Adonis; Fischetti, Lucia; Corash, Laurence; Lin, Lily",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110026/,68

Volunteers whose antibody status before challenge is known and who have been exposed to a known dose of virus at a defined time provide an objective system for controlled observation of antiviral chemotherapy. A perspective on experience with drugs of five different categories of mechanisms of action is presented. Prophylactic and possibly therapeutic control of influenza and rhinovirus infections is possible. Field trials have confirmed that some regimens have beneficial effects and have shown the clinical restrictions of others. Chemotherapy is enhanced by immunoprophylaxis, and vice versa. If the potential of antiviral chemotherapy for clinical use is to be realized, complex virologic problems (some related to drugs and others unrelated) must be overcome.

Several studies have reported the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) after acute gastroenteritis (AGE). Non-gastrointestinal (GI) infections may increase the risk of developing IBS. There are also data showing that a GI infection may trigger functional dyspepsia (PI-FD). The possible development of PI-IBS or PI-FD depends on factors related to both the infection and the host. Microinflammation has been found in patients with post-infectious FGID. Studies performed in animal models show that infection and acute inflammation permanently change gastrointestinal motility and sensitivity. The role of AGE in the development of FGID is important not only because this entity provides an excellent natural model for pathogenic study but also because it provides an opportunity for preventive action.,"Mearin, Fermín; Balboa, Agustín",Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115640/,68

For large genomes, pooled library screening followed by Y2H pairwise retests may be more efficient in terms of time and resources, but multiple sampling is necessary to ensure comprehensive screening. While the Y2H false positives can be efficiently reduced by using built-in controls, retesting, and evaluation of background activation; implementing the multiple variants of the Y2H vector systems is essential to reduce the false negatives and ensure comprehensive coverage of an interactome.","Rajagopala, Seesandra Venkatappa",Prokaryotic Systems Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120425/,68

7966,Anti-endotoxin Properties of Polymyxin B-immobilized Fibers,2019-07-31,"In sepsis death follows an excessive inflammatory response involving cytokines and complement that is activated primarily via the amplifying C3/C5 convertase. Excessive stimulation of complement amplification requires IgG-containing or F(ab′)(2)-containing immune complexes (IC) that capture dimeric C3b on one of their heavy chains or heavy chain fragments. The ability of IgG-IC to capture dimeric C3b by the Fab portion is dependent on an affinity for C3 within the Fab portion, but outside the antigen-binding region. This property is rare among IgG NAbs. In contrast to this, the lack of the Fc portion renders the Fab regions of any F(ab′)(2)-IC accessible to nascent C3b, but dimeric C3b deposits only if F(ab′)(2)-IC form secondary IC with anti-hinge NAbs that rigidify the complex and thereby promote deposition of dimeric C3b. Both types of complexes, C3b(2)-IgG-IC and C3b(2)-F(ab′)(2)-IC/anti-hinge NAbs, are potent precursors of alternative C3 convertases and stimulate complement amplification along with properdin up to 750 times more effectively than C3b and properdin. F(ab′)(2) fragments are not normally generated, but are formed from NAbs by enzymes from pathogens and neutrophils in sepsis. Unlike IgG-IC F(ab′)(2)-IC are not cleared by Fc-receptor dependent processes and circulate long enough to form secondary IC with anti-hinge NAbs that rigidify the complexes such that they capture dimeric C3b and gain the potency to stimulate complement amplification.","Lutz, Hans U.",Naturally Occurring Antibodies (NAbs),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123756/,68

Among the important advantages that viruses provide in such studies is their structural and genetic simplicity. The chapter describes the methods for growth, assay, and purification of viruses and infection of cells by several viruses that have been widely utilized for studies of cellular processes. Most investigations of virus replication at the cellular level are carried out using animal cells in culture. For the events in individual cells to occur with a high level of synchrony, single cycle growth conditions are used. Cells are infected using a high multiplicity of infectious virus particles in a low volume of medium to enhance the efficiency of virus adsorption to cell surfaces. After the adsorption period, the residual inoculum is removed and replaced with an appropriate culture medium. During further incubation, each individual cell in the culture is at a similar temporal stage in the viral replication process. Therefore, experimental procedures carried out on the entire culture reflect the replicative events occurring within an individual cell. The length of a single cycle of virus growth can range from a few hours to several days, depending on the virus type.","Compans, Richard W.; Roberts, Paul C.",Methods Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130218/,68

Ad isolates of serotypes 1–7 grown in HEp-2 or primary rhesus monkey kidney cells were identified by neutralization. Graham 293 cell cultures were used only when specimens were found to be positive for Ad by EM, type-specific Ad40/41 EIA, and for isolates not identified by neutralization. Ads grown in 293 cells were identified by DNA restriction endonuclease analysis. Of the 1187 specimens examined, 105 (9%) were found to be positive for Ad. VC detected 93, while 12 additional positives were detected by EM or EIA. The relative sensitivity of VC, EIA, and EM for the 105 specimens was 89% (93), 45% (47), and 35% (37), respectively. Among the 105 positive specimens, enteric Ad, nonenteric Ad, and untypeable Ad were 28% (29), 65% (68), and 7% (8), respectively.

Cerithiacean euspermatozoa each possess a well‐defined acrosome (extremely varied in shape), a short (2.25—3 μm), very electron‐dense nucleus, an elongate midpiece, and an elongate glycogen piece. A dense ring structure associated with the plasma membrane occurs at the junction of the midpiece and glycogen piece. While features such as the dense ring structure and the systematic periaxonemal arrangement of “glycogen” granules can be understood from a purely functional standpoint, it is suggested that euspermatozoon features also provide information of taxonomic and phylogenetic relevance. On the basis of euspermatozoon midpiece structure, true cerithiaceans can be easily distinguished from other mesogastropods and from neogastropods and are divided tentatively into two groups: Group 1 (Turritellidae, Cerithiidae, Australaba (family uncertain), Planaxidae, Potamididae (subfamily Batillariinae)), and Group 2 (Potamididae (subfamily Potamidinae), Modulidae, Obtortio (family uncertain)).

Thirty‐five examples were found of intrahelical disulfides involving a CXXC motif between the N‐Cap and third helical positions. GLY and PRO were the most common amino acids at positions 1 and 2, respectively. The N‐Cap residue for disulfide bonded CXXC motifs had average (ϕ,ψ) values of (−112 ± 25.2°, 106 ± 25.4°). To further explore conformational requirements for intrahelical disulfides, CYS pairs were introduced at positions N‐Cap‐3; 1,4; 7,10 in two helices of an Escherichia coli thioredoxin mutant lacking its active site disulfide (nSS Trx). In both helices, disulfides formed spontaneously during purification only at positions N‐Cap‐3. Mutant stabilities were characterized by chemical denaturation studies (in both oxidized and reduced states) and differential scanning calorimetry (oxidized state only). All oxidized as well as reduced mutants were destabilized relative to nSS Trx. All mutants were redox active, but showed decreased activity relative to wild‐type thioredoxin.

Owing to the good spatial resolution, multiplanar slice orientation as well as display high contrast resolution of soft tissue, in particular fluids, MR imaging was helpful prior to surgery. It is superior to radiography which failed to allow identification of the abnormality in two of our five cats. MR imaging for middle ear disease should include dorsal and transverse plane images using T1‐ and T2‐ weighted sequences. In the presence of a mass within the bulla or the external ear canal application of contrast medium is helpful.","Allgoewer, Ingrid; Lucas, Susanne; Schmitz, Stephan Albert",Vet Radiol Ultrasound,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169331/,68

The structure of the mouse CstC-encoding gene (Cst3) was examined by sequencing a 6.1-kb genomic DNA containing the entire gene, as well as 0.9 kb of 5′ flanking and 1.7 kb of its 3′ flanking region. The sequence revealed that the overall organization of the gene is very similar to those of the genes encoding human CstC and other type-2 Cst, with two introns at positions identical to those in the human gene. The promoter area does not contain typical TATA or CAAT ☐es. Two copies of a Spl-binding motif, GGGCGG, are present in the 5′ flanking region within 300 bp upstream from the initiation codon. A hexa-nucleotide, TGTTCT, which is a core sequence of the androgen-responsive element (ARE), is found in the promoter region. This region also contains a 21-nucleotide sequence, 5′-AGACTAGCAGCTGACTGAAGC, which contains two potential binding sites for the transcription factor, AP-1. The mouse Cst3 mRNA was detected in all of thirteen tissues examined by Northern blot analysis. Cst3 was mapped in the mouse to a position on distal chromosome 2.","Huh, Changgoo; Nagle, James W.; Kozak, Christine A.; Abrahamson, Magnus; Karlsson, Stefan",Gene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173308/,68

The titers of ANA heightened with increasing age, and attained to 1:1024 by the time mice reached 5 months of age. The occurrence of ANA was associated with development of splenic and hepatic fibrosis, glomerulonephritis and abnormalities of lymphoreticular tissue. The granular deposits of IgG and C3 detected by direct IF were initially found at the basement membrane of dermal‐epidermal junction of rhino mice aged 2.5 months. These deposits distributed progressively in the fibrotic areas of spleen and liver, and renal glomerular tufts at 5 months of age. Dense deposits revealed by electron microscopy were found in the regions where IF of IgG and G3 was observed. Acid buffer eluates from liver and kidney contained IgG reactive with nuclear antigens. Importance of homozygous rhino gene was discussed in relation to development of autoimmune disorders of these mice.","Kawaji, Hisanori; Tsukuda, Eyoichi; Nakaguchi, Takeshi",Pathol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202257/,68

However, technological success is widely dependent on complete understanding of the complexity and heterogeneity of tumor biology on one hand and nanobiointeractions associated with challenges of synthesis, translation, and commercialization on the other. The present study therefore deals with one such targeted approach aiming at synthesizing, characterizing, and understanding the efficacy of molybdenum oxide nanoparticles. The phase structure, morphology, and elemental composition of the synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The cytotoxicity studies revealed that the IC(50) vales of molybdenum trioxide (MoO(3)) particles against skin cancer cells (melanoma and non-melanoma) were around 200–300 μg. The nanoparticles were found to induce mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis driven by the apoptotic genes such as BAX and Bcl(2). Molybdenum being a cofactor for the majority of metabolic enzymes could have triggered the selective internalization of the nanoparticles which in turn could have modified the granularity of the cytoplasm and subsequently lead to mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Further, the anti-angiogenic property of MoO(3) nanoparticles was corroborated using Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and aortic ring assay. Taken together , unraveling the role of MoO(3) nanoparticles in cancer and angiogenesis opens up venues for nano biological intervention of selective cancer cell targeting with minimal damage to the normal cells using natural trace elements that are generally known to influence various metabolic enzymes.","Indrakumar, Janani; Korrapati, Purna Sai",Biol Trace Elem Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223681/,68

12124,"Antimicrobial Activity of Hybrid Nanomaterials Based on Star and Linear Polymers of N,N′-Dimethylaminoethyl Methacrylate with In Situ Produced Silver Nanoparticles",2020-07-07,"Until recently, data supporting the tissue-resident status of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) has been ambiguous since their discovery in the 1950–60s. These progenitor cells were first discovered as bone marrow-derived adult multipotent cells and believed to migrate to sites of injury, opposing the notion that they are residents of all tissue types. In recent years, however, it has been demonstrated that MSC can be found in all tissues and MSC from different tissues represent distinct populations with differential protein expression unique to each tissue type. Importantly, these cells are efficient mediators of tissue repair, regeneration, and prove to be targets for therapeutics, demonstrated by clinical trials (phase 1–4) for MSC-derived therapies for diseases like graft-versus-host-disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn’s disease. The tissue-resident status of MSC found in the lung is a key feature of their importance in the context of disease and injuries of the respiratory system, since these cells could be instrumental to providing more specific and targeted therapies. Currently, bone marrow-derived MSC have been established in the treatment of disease, including diseases of the lung. However, with lung-resident MSC representing a unique population with a different phenotypic and gene expression pattern than MSC derived from other tissues, their role in remediating lung inflammation and injury could provide enhanced efficacy over bone marrow-derived MSC methods. Through this review, lung-resident MSC will be characterized, using previously published data, by surface markers, gene expression patterns, and compared with bone-marrow MSC to highlight similarities and, importantly, differences in these cell types.","Sveiven, Stefanie Noel; Nordgren, Tara M.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7381710/,68

Excess dietary salt intake exaggerates arterial blood pressure (ABP) in multiple models of experimental hypertension. The present study tested whether a high-salt diet exaggerated ABP and vascular dysfunction in a 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) murine model. Male C57BL/6J mice (8–12 wk) were randomly assigned, and fed a 0.1% or 4.0% NaCl diet, and instrumented with telemetry units to measure ABP. Then, the 2K1C model was produced by placing a cuff around the right renal artery. Systolic, diastolic, and mean ABP were significantly higher in mice fed 4.0% vs. 0.1% NaCl at 1 wk but not after 3 wk. Interestingly, 2K1C hypertension progressively increased arterial pulse pressure in both groups; however, the magnitude was significantly greater in mice fed 4.0% vs. 0.1% NaCl at 3 wk. Moreover, pulse wave velocity was significantly greater in 2K1C mice fed 4.0% vs. 0.1% NaCl diet or sham-operated mice fed either diet. Histological assessment of aortas indicated no structural differences among groups. Finally, endothelium-dependent vasodilation was significantly and selectively attenuated in the aorta but not mesenteric arteries of 2K1C mice fed 4.0% NaCl vs. 0.1% NaCl or sham-operated control mice. The findings suggest that dietary salt loading transiently exaggerates 2K1C renovascular hypertension but promotes chronic aortic stiffness and selective aortic vascular dysfunction. NEW & NOTEWORTHY High dietary salt exaggerates hypertension in multiple experimental models. Here we demonstrate that a high-salt diet produces a greater increase in arterial blood pressure at 1 wk after induction of 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) hypertension but not at 3 wk. Interestingly, 2K1C mice fed a high-salt diet displayed an exaggerated pulse pressure, elevated pulse wave velocity, and reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the aorta but not mesenteric arteries. These findings suggest that dietary salt may interact with underlying cardiovascular disease to promote selective vascular dysfunction and aortic stiffness.","DeLalio, Leon J.; Hahn, Scott; Katayama, Pedro L.; Wenner, Megan M.; Farquhar, William B.; Straub, Adam C.; Stocker, Sean D.",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7346535/,68
12515,Polymeric Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery: Recent Developments and Future Prospects,2020-07-19,"Activation and subsequent differentiation of T cells following antigenic stimulation are triggered by highly coordinated signaling events that lead to instilling cells with a discrete metabolic and transcriptional feature. Compelling studies indicate that intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) levels have profound influence on diverse signaling and metabolic pathways of T cells, and hence dictate their functional fate. CD38, a major mammalian NAD(+) glycohydrolase (NADase), expresses on T cells following activation and appears to be an essential modulator of intracellular NAD(+) levels. The enzymatic activity of CD38 in the process of generating the second messenger cADPR utilizes intracellular NAD(+,) and thus limits its availability to different NAD(+) consuming enzymes (PARP, ART, and sirtuins) inside the cells. The present review discusses how the CD38-NAD(+) axis affects T cell activation and differentiation through interfering with their signaling and metabolic processes. We also describe the pivotal role of the CD38-NAD(+) axis in influencing the chromatin remodeling and rewiring T cell response. Overall, this review emphasizes the crucial contribution of the CD38(−)NAD(+) axis in altering T cell response in various pathophysiological conditions.","Kar, Anwesha; Mehrotra, Shikhar; Chatterjee, Shilpak",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7408359/,68
12518,Biofunctional Polymer Coated Au Nanoparticles Prepared via RAFT-Assisted Encapsulating Emulsion Polymerization and Click Chemistry,2020-06-27,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that function as epigenetic modulators regulating almost any gene expression. Similarly, other noncoding RNAs, as well as epigenetic modifications, can regulate miRNAs. This reciprocal interaction forms a miRNA-epigenetic feedback loop, the deregulation of which affects physiological processes and contributes to a great diversity of diseases. In the present review, we focus on miR-615, a miRNA highly conserved across eutherian mammals. It is involved not only during embryogenesis in the regulation of growth and development, for instance during osteogenesis and angiogenesis, but also in the regulation of cell growth and the proliferation and migration of cells, acting as a tumor suppressor or tumor promoter. It therefore serves as a biomarker for several types of cancer, and recently has also been found to be involved in reparative processes and neural repair. In addition, we present the pleiad of functions in which miR-615 is involved, as well as their multiple target genes and the multiple regulatory molecules involved in its own expression. We do this by introducing in a comprehensible way the reported knowledge of their actions and interactions and proposing an integral view of its regulatory mechanisms.","Godínez-Rubí, Marisol; Ortuño-Sahagún, Daniel",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7408929/,68
12537,Landscape of cohesin-mediated chromatin loops in the human genome,2020-07-29,"Endemic to West Africa and South America, mammalian arenaviruses can cross the species barrier from their natural rodent hosts to humans, resulting in illnesses ranging from mild flu-like syndromes to severe and fatal haemorrhagic zoonoses. The increased frequency of outbreaks and associated high fatality rates of the most prevalent arenavirus, Lassa, in West African countries, highlights the significant risk to public health and to the socio-economic development of affected countries. The devastating impact of these viruses is further exacerbated by the lack of approved vaccines and effective treatments. Differential immune responses to arenavirus infections that can lead to either clearance or rapid, widespread and uncontrolled viral dissemination are modulated by the arenavirus multifunctional proteins, NP and Z. These two proteins control the antiviral response to infection by targeting multiple cellular pathways; and thus, represent attractive targets for antiviral development to counteract infection. The interplay between the host immune responses and viral replication is a key determinant of virus pathogenicity and disease outcome. In this review, we examine the current understanding of host immune defenses against arenavirus infections and summarise the host protein interactions of NP and Z and the mechanisms that govern immune evasion strategies.","Stott, Robert J.; Strecker, Thomas; Foster, Toshana L.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7412275/,68

First, a portion of the 18S (p18S), a portion of the 28S (p28S), and the complete ITS2 were separately amplified from individual mites and sequenced. The lengths of the sequences of p18S, p28S, and ITS2 were found to be 1379 bp, 3465~3468 bp, and 200 bp, respectively. The intraspecific sequence variation was 0~0.1% for p28S and 0~1.6% for ITS2, though no variation was observed for p18S, suggesting conservation of rDNA sequences. Second, a portion of the mitochondrial cox1 gene (pcox1) of N. gallinarum was analyzed. The length of the pcox1 sequence is 460 bp, and two distinct groups were observed in N. gallinarum. All pcox1 sequences in group I were identical, and there was only one nucleotide transition observed in group II; however, 7.0~7.2% variations between the two groups were observed, suggesting that two genotypes of N. gallinarum: genotype I and genotype II. Phylogenetic analyses based on pcox1 sequences indicated that N. gallinarum isolates (genotype I or genotype II) clustered into one branch; according to cox1 sequence analysis of Trombiculidae, Walchia hayashii is the closest species. The present study shows that ITS2 rDNA sequence can act as marker for the identification of N. gallinarum samples. Furthermore, analysis of the mitochondrial pcox1 sequence suggests the existence of two genotypes, which has implications for further studies of the ecology and population genetic structures of N. gallinarum.","Zhou, Qiang; Wang, Zhan-Xin; Tao, Jia-Meng; Qin, Jian-Ping; Lu, Jun-Peng; Lin, Rui-Qing; Wang, Li-Mei; Weng, Ya-Biao; Tan, Zhi-Jian",Parasitol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7442544/,68

This case report describes a patient with TSGCT of the spine at C1–C2, which was treated surgically and diagnosed as TSGCT. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old woman with a 4-month history of neck pain and numbness in both upper extremities was referred to our department. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a neoplastic lesion extending from the left epidural space to the erector spinae muscles at the C1–C2 vertebral level, which was isointense on T1-weighted images, heterogeneously hypointense on T2-weighted images, and showed heterogeneous enhancement on gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA)-enhanced T1-weighted images. Computed tomography showed no findings suggestive of bone destruction of the vertebral body. Because the neurological symptoms were progressive, total macroscopic resection of the tumor was performed via a posterior approach. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed the diagnosis of TSGCT. Improvement of the both the neck pain and upper-extremity numbness was noted postoperatively. An MRI obtained 6 months after the surgery revealed no evidence of tumor recurrence and the postoperative course was uneventful. DISCUSSION: TSGCT of the upper cervical spine (C1–C2) is rare, and this is the tenth reported case. If a tumor is heterogeneously hypointense on T2-weighted MRI, which reflects hemosiderosis, the possibility of this tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis.","Furuhata, Ryogo; Iwanami, Akio; Tsuji, Osahiko; Nagoshi, Narihito; Suzuki, Satoshi; Okada, Eijiro; Fujita, Nobuyuki; Yagi, Mitsuru; Matsumoto, Morio; Nakamura, Masaya; Watanabe, Kota",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6461752/,68

Unfortunately, participation rates are low due to enrollment and adherence issues. As such, new CR delivery strategies are of interest, as to improve overall CR delivery. The goal of the study was to obtain a better understanding of the short-term progression of functional capacity throughout multidisciplinary CR, measured as the change in walking distance between baseline six-minute walking test (6MWT) and four consecutive follow-up tests. One-hundred-and-twenty-nine patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease participated in the study, of which 89 patients who completed the whole study protocol were included in the statistical analysis. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to determine whether there was a significant change in mean 6MWT distance (6MWD) throughout CR. A three-way-mixed ANOVA was performed to determine the influence of categorical variables on the progression in 6MWD between groups. Significant differences in mean 6MWD between consecutive measurements were observed. Two subgroups were identified based on the change in distance between baseline and end-of-study. Patients who increased most showed a linear progression. In the other group progression leveled off halfway through rehabilitation. Moreover, the improvement during the initial phase of CR seemed to be indicative for overall progression. The current study adds to the understanding of the short-term progression in exercise capacity of patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease throughout a CR program. The results are not only of interest for CR in general, but could be particularly relevant in the setting of home-based CR.","De Cannière, Hélène; Smeets, Christophe J.

Estrogen deficiency increases the NAFLD risk among postmenopausal women. Thus, effective agents to prevent and treat NAFLD in postmenopausal women are required. Quercitrin (Quer) is a natural glycosylated flavonoid with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipidemic effects. This study investigated whether Quer improves dysregulated lipid metabolism and suppresses hepatic steatosis in ovariectomized (OVX) mice as an experimental model mimicking postmenopausal women. Mice were assigned to the following four groups: SHAM, OVX, OVX + β-estradiol (0.4 mg/kg diet), and OVX + Quer (500 mg/kg diet). Mice were administered a diet with or without Quer for three months. OVX mice displayed significantly higher body mass, epidermal fat, and liver weights than those of SHAM mice. However, these levels were reduced in Quer-treated mice. Quer treatment reduced the levels of serum lipid metabolites, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, Quer reduced liver lipid steatosis and inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. The results of the present study indicate that Quer improves dysregulated lipid metabolism and reduces hepatic steatosis and inflammation by compensating for estrogen deficiency, suggesting that Quer may potentially exert protective effects during hepatic steatosis in postmenopausal women.","Hur, Haeng Jeon; Jeong, Yeon-Hui; Lee, Sang Hee; Sung, Mi Jeong",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7602720/,68

Despite several RAS pathway genes were implicated in NS, 20–30% of patients remain without molecular diagnosis, suggesting the involvement of further genes or multiple mechanisms. Eight patients out of 60, negative for conventional NS mutation analysis, with heterogeneous NS phenotype were investigated by means of target resequencing of 26 RAS/MAPK pathway genes. A trio was further characterized by means of whole-exome sequencing. Protein modeling and in silico prediction of protein stability allowed to identify possible pathogenic RAS pathway variants in four NS patients. A new c.355T>C variant in LZTR1 was found in patient 43. Two patients co-inherited variants in LRP1 and LZTR1 (patient 53), or LRP1 and SOS1 genes (patient 67). The forth patient (56) carried a compound heterozygote of RASAL3 gene variants and also an A2ML1 variant. While these subclinical variants are singularly present in healthy parents, they co-segregate in patients, suggesting their addictive effect and supporting a digenic inheritance, as alternative model to a more common monogenic transmission. The ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK activation state, assessed on immortalized lymphocytes from patients 53 and 67 showed highest phosphorylation levels compared to their asymptomatic parents. These findings together with the lack of their co-occurrence in the 1000Genomes database strengthen the hypothesis of digenic inheritance in a subset of NS patients. This study suggests caution in the exclusion of subclinical variants that might play a pathogenic role providing new insights for alternative hereditary mechanisms.","Ferrari, Luca; Mangano, Eleonora; Bonati, Maria Teresa; Monterosso, Ilaria; Capitanio, Daniele; Chiappori, Federica; Brambilla, Ilaria; Gelfi, Cecilia; Battaglia, Cristina; Bordoni, Roberta; Riva, Paola",Eur J Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608271/,68

Thus, there is a need to investigate the efficacy of other compounds in treating both positive and negative symptoms. We conducted a meta-analysis of English language placebo-controlled clinical trials of naloxone, naltrexone, nalmefene, and buprenorphine in patients with schizophrenia to determine whether opioid antagonists have therapeutic efficacy on positive, negative, total, or general symptoms. We searched online databases Ovid Medline and PsychINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane library/CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from 1970 through February 2019. Following PRISMA guidelines, Hedges g was calculated for each study. Primary study outcomes were the within-subject change on any symptom assessment scale for positive, negative, total, or general symptoms of schizophrenia between active drug and placebo conditions. Thirty studies were included with 434 total patients. We found a significant effect of all drugs on all scales combined with both a standard random effects model: (g = 0.26; P = 0.02; k = 22; CI = 0.03–0.49) and a more inclusive bootstrap model: (g = 0.26; P = 0.0002; k = 30; CI = 0.11–0.51) and a significant effect on total scales with the bootstrap model (g = 0.25288; P = 0.015; k = 19; CI = 0.04–0.35). We also observed a significant effect of all drugs on all positive scales combined with both the random effects (g = 0.33; P = 0.015; k = 17; CI = 0.07–0.60) and bootstrap models (g = 0.32; P < 0.0001; k = 21; CI = 0.13–1.38).

Co-supplementatoin with LC + VD showed beneficial effects on gene expression of myogenic markers and OPG but reduced markers of dystrophy, RANK/RANKL in comparison to LC or VD alone-supplementation. In vitro myotubes treated with glutathione (GSH) precursors also showed a positive effect on OPG and the myogenesis genes, and inhibited RANK/RANKL and muscle-dystrophy markers. This study reveals that the co-supplementation of LC with VD significantly alleviates the markers of musculoskeletal disorders in the skeletal muscle better than monotherapy with LC or VD in HFD-VD-fed mice.","Parsanathan, Rajesh; Achari, Arunkumar E.; Manna, Prasenjit; Jain, Sushil K.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7694620/,68
14344,Recent Advances of Conducting Polymers and Their Composites for Electrochemical Biosensing Applications,2020-09-25,"A lifelong adherence to a gluten-free (GF) diet is currently the only treatment for Celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune disorder that arises after gluten ingestion in individuals who are genetically predisposed. The gluten intake exerts toxic effects through several pathways involving gut barrier integrity, intestinal microbiota composition and immune system stimulation. However, despite the great benefit of GF diet for CD patients, its use has been debated. Indeed, individuals who adopt this diet regime may be at risk of nutrient deficiencies. Emerging evidence supports a beneficial effect of a GF diet also for other pathological conditions, including gluten-related disorders (GRD) often associated to CD, such as Non celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and Dermatitis Herpetiforme (DH) as well as Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Diabetes. This suggests a pathogenic role of gluten in these conditions. Despite the growing popularity of GF diet among consumers, to date, there are limited evidences supporting its use for the management of non-celiac diseases. Therefore, in this review, we discuss whether the GF diet could really improve the general quality of life of patients with GRD and non-GRD conditions, keeping in mind its sensorial limitations and nutritional inadequacies. In addition, we discuss the current motivations, leading to the use of a GF diet, despite the inferior quality of GF products respect to those containing gluten.","Di Liberto, Diana; Carlisi, Daniela; D’Anneo, Antonella; Emanuele, Sonia; Giuliano, Michela; De Blasio, Anna; Calvaruso, Giuseppe; Lauricella, Marianna",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7712796/,68

Homeostasis of these micronutrients is tightly regulated by multiple compensatory mechanisms that balance their concentrations including transporters, importers, and metallothioneins. An altered intake of only one of these trace elements may cause an imbalance in their levels and result in their competition for absorption. Relatively low levels of zinc and increased levels of copper may result in an increased level of oxidative stress and impair the antioxidant properties of multiple enzymes. Altered levels of trace elements were discovered in various pathologies including immunological, degenerative, and inflammatory diseases. Moreover, due to the role of Zn and Cu in oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, they were found to influence cancerogenesis. We review the roles of zinc and copper and their mechanisms in tumor growth, metastasis potential, microenvironment remodeling, and drug resistance. We highlight their role as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, concentrating on their impact on gynecological malignancies.","Michalczyk, Kaja; Cymbaluk-Płoska, Aneta",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761859/,68

However, there is no vaccine or therapeutics against CHIKV infection available. Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) has been shown to produce potent antiviral responses during viral infection. Herein we demonstrated the use of an adenovirus-vectored expressed mouse IFN-α (mDEF201) as a prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against CHIKV in vivo. 6-day-old BALB/c mice were pre- or post-treated intranasally with single dose of mDEF201 at 5 x 10(6) PFU per mouse and challenged with lethal dose of CHIKV. Complete survival protection was observed in mice upon a single dose of mDEF201 administration 1 days prior to virus challenge. Viral load in the serum and multiple organs were significantly reduced upon mDEF201 administration in a dose dependent manner as compare with adenovirus 5 vector placebo set. Histological analysis of the mice tissue revealed that mDEF201 could significantly reduce the tissue morphological abnormities, mainly infiltration of immune cells and muscle fibre necrosis caused by CHIKV infection. In addition, administration of mDEF201 at 6 hours post CHIKV challenge also showed promising inhibitory effect against viral replication and dissemination. In conclusion, single-dose of intranasal administration with mDEF201 as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent within 6 hours post CHIKV infection is highly protective against a lethal challenge of CHIKV in the murine model.","Chen, Huixin; Min, Nyo; Ma, Luyao; Mok, Chee-Keng; Chu, Justin Jang Hann",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7738163/,68
14585,Quantitative glycoproteomics reveals cellular substrate selectivity of the ER protein quality control sensors UGGT1 and UGGT2,2020-12-15,"The way we perceive the world is strongly influenced by our expectations. In line with this, much recent research has revealed that prior expectations strongly modulate sensory processing. However, the neural circuitry through which the brain integrates external sensory inputs with internal expectation signals remains unknown. In order to understand the computational architecture of the cortex, we need to investigate the way these signals flow through the cortical layers. This is crucial because the different cortical layers have distinct intra- and interregional connectivity patterns, and therefore determining which layers are involved in a cortical computation can inform us on the sources and targets of these signals. Here, we used ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to reveal that prior expectations evoke stimulus-specific activity selectively in the deep layers of the primary visual cortex (V1). These findings are in line with predictive processing theories proposing that neurons in the deep cortical layers represent perceptual hypotheses and thereby shed light on the computational architecture of cortex.","Aitken, Fraser; Menelaou, Georgios; Warrington, Oliver; Koolschijn, Renée S.; Corbin, Nadège; Callaghan, Martina F.; Kok, Peter",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7746273/,68

In this study, a DNA construct encoding Nef(60–84), Nef(126–144), Vpr(34–47), Vpr(60–75), Gp160(30–53), Gp160(308–323,) and P24(8–151) epitopes was designed using bioinformatics tools. The pcDNA3.1-nef-vpr-gp160-p24 and pcDNA3.1-nef constructs were prepared in large scale as endotoxin-free form. Moreover, the recombinant Nef-Vpr-Gp160-p24 polypeptide and Nef protein were generated inE. coli. These constructs were delivered using cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) in vivo, and immune responses were assessed for different modalities in BALB/c mice. RESULTS: The recombinant DNA constructs were confirmed as the ~ 867 bp and ~ 648 bp bands related tonef-vpr-gp160-p24 andnef genes on agarose gel. Moreover, the purified Nef-Vpr-Gp160-p24 polypeptide and Nef protein showed the ~ 32 kDa and ~ 30 kDa bands on SDS-PAGE, respectively. The results of immune responses indicated that the heterologous prime/boost regimens using both Nef-Vpr-Gp160-P24 and Nef antigens induced significantly the secretion of IgG2a, IgG2b, IFN-γ and Granzyme B compared to other groups. The levels of Granzyme B in mice immunized with Nef antigen were higher than those immunized with Nef-Vpr-Gp160-P24 antigen. The CPPs showed the same potency with Montanide adjuvant for eliciting immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: The heterologous prime/boost regimens for both antigens could significantly direct immune responses toward Th1 and CTL activity compared to other regimens. Comparing the efficiency of Nef-Vpr-Gp160-P24 and Nef constructs, the Nef-Vpr-Gp160-P24 constructs delivered by CPPs showed promising results as an HIV vaccine candidate.","Davoodi, Saba; Bolhassani, Azam; Namazi, Fatemeh",Biotechnol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7775797/,68
14965,Fast Dissolving Electrospun Nanofibers Fabricated from Jelly Fig Polysaccharide/Pullulan for Drug Delivery Applications,2021-01-12,"BACKGROUND: Nurse-led monitoring of patients for signs and symptoms associated with documented ‘undesirable effects’ of medicines has potential to prevent avoidable harm, and optimise prescribing. INTERVENTION: The Adverse Drug Reaction Profile for polypharmacy (ADRe-p) identifies and documents putative adverse effects of medicines commonly prescribed in primary care. Nurses address some problems, before passing ADRe-p to pharmacists and prescribers for review, in conjunction with prescriptions. OBJECTIVES: We investigated changes in: the number and nature of residents’ problems as recorded on ADRe-p; prescription regimens; medicines optimisation: and healthcare costs. We explored aetiologies of problems identified and stakeholders’ perspectives. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In three UK care homes, 19 residents completed the study, December 2018 to May 2019. Two service users, three pharmacists, six nurses gave interviews. METHODS: This mixed-method process evaluation integrated data from residents’ ADRe-ps and medicines charts, at the study’s start and 5–10 weeks later. RESULTS: We recruited three of 27 homes approached and 26 of 45 eligible residents; 19 completed ADRe-p at least twice. Clinical gains were identified for 17/19 residents (mean number of symptoms 3 SD 1.67, range 0–7). Examples included management of: pain (six residents), seizures (three), dyspnoea (one), diarrhoea (laxatives reduced, two), falls (two of five able to stand). One or more medicine was de-prescribed or dose reduced for 12/19 residents. ADRe administration and review cost ~£30 in staff time. ADRe-p helped carers and nurses bring residents’ problems to the attention of prescribers. IMPLICATIONS: ADRe-p relieved unnecessary suffering. It supported carers and nurses by providing a tool to engage with pharmacists and prescribers, and was the only observable strategy for multidisciplinary team working around medicines optimisation. ADRe-p improved care by: a) regular systematic checks and problem documentation; b) information transfer from care home staff to prescribers and pharmacists; c) recording changes.

15288,Editorial: Developments in Animal Health Surveillance,2021-01-25,"BACKGROUND: Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) is common among hospitalized patients. Though carbapenems are an effective treatment in the face of rising resistance, overuse drives carbapenem resistance (CR). We hypothesized that resistance to routinely used antimicrobials is common, and, despite frequent use of carbapenems, associated with an increased risk of inappropriate empiric treatment (IET), which in turn worsens clinical outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with a culture-positive non-CR cUTI. Triple resistance (TR) was defined as resistance to > 3 of the following: 3rd generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin. Multivariable models quantified the impact of TR and inappropriate empiric therapy (IET) on mortality, hospital LOS, and costs. RESULTS: Among 23,331 patients with cUTI, 3040 (13.0%) had a TR pathogen. Compared to patients with non-TR, those with TR were more likely male (57.6% vs. 47.7%, p < 0.001), black (17.9% vs. 13.6%, p < 0.001), and in the South (46.3% vs. 41.5%, p < 0.001). Patients with TR had higher chronic (median [IQR] Charlson score 3 [2, 4] vs. 2 [1, 4], p < 0.001) and acute (mechanical ventilation 7.0% vs. 5.0%, p < 0.001; ICU admission 22.3% vs. 18.6%, p < 0.001) disease burden. Despite greater prevalence of empiric carbapenem exposure (43.3% vs. 16.2%, p < 0.001), patient with TR were also more likely to receive IET (19.6% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001) than those with non-TR. Although mortality was similar between groups, TR added 0.38 (95% CI 0.18, 0.49) days to LOS, and $754 (95% CI $406, $1103) to hospital costs. Both TR and IET impacted the outcomes among cUTI patients whose UTI was not catheter-associated (CAUTI), but had no effect on outcomes in CAUTI. CONCLUSIONS: TR occurs in 1 in 8 patients hospitalized with cUTI. It is associated with an increase in the risk of IET exposure, as well as a modest attributable prolongation of LOS and increase in total costs, particularly in the setting of non-CAUTI.

We also examined the distribution of culturable S. enterica and determined their antibiotic resistance profiles. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the classes of aminoglycoside, beta‐lactam, and macrolide‐lincosamide‐streptogramin B (MLSB) were targeted in this study. The ttrC gene was detected in 23 out of 25 locations. There was a wider and higher range of the ttrC gene in flooded water versus unflooded water samples (0–2.12 × 10(5) copies/L vs. 0–4.86 × 10(4) copies/L). Culturable S. enterica was isolated from 10 of 25 sampling locations, which was less prevalent than the distribution of the ttrC gene. The antibiotic resistance profiles were not distinct among the S. enterica isolates. The aminoglycoside resistance gene aac(6')‐Iy had the highest relative abundance (around 0.05 copies/16S rRNA gene copy in all isolates) among all ARGs. These findings suggested that the 2018 flooding event led to higher copy numbers of the ttrC genes of S. enterica in some flooded water bodies compared to those in unflooded water bodies. The high ARG level and similar ARG profiles were observed in all S. enterica isolates from both flooded and unflooded samples, suggesting that the antibiotic resistance was prevalent in S. enterica within this region, regardless of flooding.","Mao, Yuqing; Zeineldin, Mohamed; Usmani, Moiz; Uprety, Sital; Shisler, Joanna L.; Jutla, Antarpreet; Unnikrishnan, Avinash; Nguyen, Thanh H.",Geohealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7892206/,68

Although paediatric immunization programmes have significantly reduced the burden of VPD, disease burden in adults still poses a substantial challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries such as those within the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Invasive bacterial diseases (IBDs) are an important public health concern within this region, although vaccines are available to prevent the three most common causative organisms associated with IBD: Neisseria meningitidis (NM), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), and Haemophilus influenzae (HI). For this review, three separate PubMed searches were used to identify English-language publications describing the epidemiology of NM, SP, and HI in adults within the MENA region. Of the 161 total publications retrieved among all 3 literature searches, 39 were included in this review (NM: 8 publications; SP: 27 publications; HI: 4 publications). Publications describing epidemiology in paediatric or overall populations were excluded. Overall, these studies generally observed a high burden of IBD among adults in this region. Although NM, SP, and HI are communicable diseases in several countries, the surveillance systems in the MENA region are largely inadequate, resulting in poor responses to outbreaks and hindering improvement in outcomes of communicable diseases. Improving IBD surveillance would provide necessary estimates of disease burden, resulting in better vaccination strategies and improved outcomes. In conclusion, the present review provides a summary of the available information on the epidemiology of vaccine-preventable IBD in adults within the MENA region and highlights the need for increased disease surveillance and preventive strategies in these countries.

It was found that a higher enhancement factor (up to 275%) can be obtained in a substrate immersed in water, where particles are freee to move, compared to a dried substrate, where the particles (radius [Formula: see text] nm, refractive index [Formula: see text] ) are fixed on the surface. The highest enhancement is obtained at low concentrations because, this case, the particles are trapped preferentially in the regions of highest electric field (hotspots). For high concentrations, it was observed that the hotspots become saturated with particles and that additional particles are forced to occupy regions of lower field. The dielectric metasurface offers low optical absorption compared to conventional gold substrates. This aspect can be important for temperature-sensitive applications. The method shows potential for applications in crystal nucleation, where high solute supersaturation can be achieved near the high-field regions of the metasurface. The high sensitivity for SERS (surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy) at low analyte concentrations makes the proposed method highly promising for detection of small biological particles, such as proteins or viruses.","Kenworthy, Cameron F.; Pjotr Stoevelaar, L.; Alexander, Andrew J.; Gerini, Giampiero",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7994300/,68

Mathematical modeling combined with experiments in cell culture and whole organ culture show that the regulation of the cell death decision strategy is critical to prevent HSV-1 spread.

However, nature, density and therapeutic impact of FcγRIIIA(+) (CD16) effector cells in tumor remain poorly documented. Moreover, the inhibition of cetuximab-mediated ADCC induced by NK cells by the engagement of the new inhibitory CD94-NKG2A immune checkpoint has only been demonstrated in vitro. This multicentric study aimed to determine, on paired primary and metastatic tissue samples from a cohort of mCRC patients treated with cetuximab: 1) the nature and density of FcγRIIIA(+) (CD16) immune cells, 2) the expression profile of HLA-E/β2m by tumor cells as well as the density of CD94(+) immune cells and 3) their impact on both objective response to cetuximab and survival. We demonstrated that FcγRIIIA(+) (CD16) intraepithelial immune cells mainly correspond to tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN), and their high density in metastases was significantly associated with a better response to cetuximab, independently of the expression of the CD94/NKG2A inhibitory immune checkpoint. However, HLA-E/β2m, preferentially overexpressed in metastases compared with primary tumors and associated with CD94(+) tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), was associated with a poor overall survival. Altogether, these results strongly support the use of bispecific antibodies directed against both EGFR and FcγRIIIA (CD16) in mCRC patients, to boost cetuximab-mediated ADCC in RAS wild-type mCRC patients. The preferential overexpression of HLA-E/β2m in metastases, associated with CD94(+) TILs and responsible for a poor prognosis, provides convincing arguments to inhibit this new immune checkpoint with monalizumab, a humanized anti-NKG2A antibody, in combination with anti- FcγRIIIA/EGFR bispecific antibodies as a promising therapeutic perspective in RAS wild-type mCRC patients.","Denis Musquer, Marie; Jouand, Nicolas; Pere, Morgane; Lamer, Juliette Eugène; Bézieau, Stéphane; Matysiak, Tamara; Faroux, Roger; Caroli Bosc, François-Xavier; Rousselet, Marie-Christine; Leclair, François; Mosnier, Jean-François; Toquet, Claire; Gervois, Nadine; Bossard, Céline",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239306/,68

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two single posterior restorations in 30 participants (18 women and 12 men aged 27 to 75 years) were placed into either a unilateral single-tooth defect (n = 17) or on either side of a bilateral teeth defects (n = 15). The bite force (%) of the prostheses, teeth and segments at the maximum intercuspation position (MIP) was evaluated using a T-scan at 5 stages (pre-placement, immediately following placement, and 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-placement). RESULTS: The occlusal force of implant-supported prostheses was significantly (P = .000) lower than those of the control natural teeth at the baseline, then no significant difference was found with that of the mesial teeth at 3 months, and finally it was significantly (P = .000) lower than that of the distal teeth at 6 months; meanwhile, it significantly (P = .008) increased by a mean of 2.04 times from 2 weeks (3.39 ± 2.61%) to 3 months (6.90 ± 4.77%), whereas no significant difference (P = .900) was found from 3 months (6.90 ± 4.77%) to 6 months (7.31 ± 4.60%). In addition, the bite force of the posterior segment on the restored side of both unilateral and bilateral gaps was significantly (P = .013,.001) improved by 3.31% and 6.83%, respectively, although the discrepancy in bite force significantly (P = .039) increased from an initial 3.52% to 5.02% for subjects with bilateral defects, accompanying increases in the proportion (15.38%) of the level III bilateral bite force deviation (P >.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bite force and masticatory ability can be improved with the immediate delivery of a single posterior implant restoration. The bite force distributed on the implant prosthesis inevitably increases after placement of implant prostheses, a routine follow-up and occlusal evaluation are strongly needed.","Zhou, Ting; Wongpairojpanich, Jirapa; Sareethammanuwat, Maytha; Lilakhunakon, Charukrit; Buranawat, Borvornwut",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8253389/,68
19564,"Review on Recent Progress in Magnetic Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Characterization, and Diverse Applications",2021-07-13,"BACKGROUND: Stimulated by the economic challenges faced by many sub-Saharan African countries and the changes in the rotavirus burden across these countries, this study aimed to inform the decision of health policy makers of eight sub-Saharan countries, who are yet to introduce the rotavirus vaccine as of Dec 31, 2020, on the health economic consequences of the introduction of the vaccine in terms of the costs and benefits. METHODS: We did a cost–benefit analysis using a simulation-based decision-analytic model for children aged younger than 1 year, who were followed up to 259 weeks, in the Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Somalia, and South Sudan. Data were collected and analysed between Jan 13, 2020, and Dec 11, 2020. Cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact analysis were done as secondary analyses. Four rotavirus vaccinations (Rotarix, Rotateq, Rotavac, and Rotasiil) were compared with no vaccination. The primary outcome was disability-adjusted life-years averted, converted to monetary terms. The secondary outcomes include rotavirus gastroenteritis averted, and rotavirus vaccine-associated intussusception. The primary economic evaluation measure was the benefit–cost ratio (BCR). FINDINGS: For the modelling period, Jan 1, 2021, to Dec 31, 2030, we found that the benefits of introducing the rotavirus vaccine outweighed the costs in all eight countries, with Chad and the Central African Republic having the highest BCR of 19·42 and 11·36, respectively. Guinea had the lowest BCR of 3·26 amongst the Gavi-eligible countries. Equatorial Guinea and Gabon had a narrow BCR of 1·86 and 2·06, respectively. Rotarix was the optimal choice for all the Gavi-eligible countries; Rotasiil and Rotavac were the optimal choices for Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Introducing the rotavirus vaccine in all eight countries, but with caution in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, would be worthwhile. With the narrow BCR for Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, cautious, pragmatic, and stringent measures need to be employed to ensure optimal health benefits and cost minimisation of the vaccine introduction. The final decision to introduce the rotavirus vaccine should be preceded by comparing its BCR to the BCRs of other health-care projects.

19585,Non-canonical H3K79me2-dependent pathways promote the survival of MLL-rearranged leukemia,2021-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Treatment for interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) is challenging, and literature to guide such treatment is scarce. The reported in-hospital mortality rates of ILD patients with ARF are high (62–66%). Cyclophosphamide is considered a second-line treatment in steroid-refractory ILD-associated ARF. The first aim of this study was to evaluate the in-hospital mortality in patients with ILD-associated ARF treated with cyclophosphamide. The second aim was to compare computed tomographic (CT) patterns and physiological and ventilator parameters between survivors and non-survivors. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with ILD-associated ARF treated with cyclophosphamide between February 2016 and October 2017. Patients were categorized into three subgroups: connective tissue disease (CTD)-associated ILD, other ILD or vasculitis. In-hospital mortality was evaluated in the whole cohort and in these subgroups. Clinical response was determined using physiological and ventilator parameters: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA), PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) before and after cyclophosphamide treatment. The following CT features were quantified: ground-glass opacification (GGO) proportion, reticulation proportion, overall extent of parenchymal disease and fibrosis coarseness score. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 40%. In-hospital mortality rates for CTD-associated ILD, other ILD and vasculitis were 20, 57, and 33%, respectively. The GGO proportion (71% vs 45%) was higher in non-survivors. There were no significant differences in the SOFA score, P/F ratio or Cdyn between survivors and non-survivors. However, in survivors the P/F ratio increased from 129 to 220 mmHg and Cdyn from 75 to 92 mL/cmH2O 3 days after cyclophosphamide treatment. In non-survivors the P/F ratio hardly changed (113–114 mmHg) and Cdyn even decreased (27–20 mL/cmH2O). CONCLUSION: In this study, we found a mortality rate of 40% in patients treated with cyclophosphamide for ILD-associated ARF. Connective tissue disease-associated ILD and vasculitis were associated with a lower risk of death. In non-survivors, the CT GGO proportion was significantly higher. The P/F ratio and Cdyn in survivors increased after 3 days of cyclophosphamide treatment.

19766,Development of antibacterial compounds that constrain evolutionary pathways to resistance,2021-07-19,"Crop variety identification is an essential link in seed detection, phenotype collection and scientific breeding. This paper takes peanut as an example to explore a new method for crop variety identification. Peanut is a crucial oil crop and cash crop. The yield and quality of different peanut varieties are different, so it is necessary to identify and classify different peanut varieties. The traditional image processing method of peanut variety identification needs to extract many features, which has defects such as intense subjectivity and insufficient generalization ability. Based on the deep learning technology, this paper improved the deep convolutional neural network VGG16 and applied the improved VGG16 to the identification and classification task of 12 varieties of peanuts. Firstly, the peanut pod images of 12 varieties obtained by the scanner were preprocessed with gray-scale, binarization, and ROI extraction to form a peanut pod data set with a total of 3365 images of 12 varieties. A series of improvements have been made to VGG16. Remove the F6 and F7 fully connected layers of VGG16. Add Conv6 and Global Average Pooling Layer. The three convolutional layers of conv5 have changed into Depth Concatenation and add the Batch Normalization(BN) layers to the model. Besides, fine-tuning is carried out based on the improved VGG16. We adjusted the location of the BN layers. Adjust the number of filters for Conv6. Finally, the improved VGG16 model's training test results were compared with the other classic models, AlexNet, VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, DenseNet201 and MobileNetv2 verify its superiority. The average accuracy of the improved VGG16 model on the peanut pods test set was 96.7%, which was 8.9% higher than that of VGG16, and 1.6–12.3% higher than that of other classical models. Besides, supplementary experiments were carried out to prove the robustness and generality of the improved VGG16. The improved VGG16 was applied to the identification and classification of seven corn grain varieties with the same method and an average accuracy of 90.1% was achieved. The experimental results show that the improved VGG16 proposed in this paper can identify and classify peanut pods of different varieties, proving the feasibility of a convolutional neural network in variety identification and classification. The model proposed in this experiment has a positive significance for exploring other Crop variety identification and classification.","Yang, Haoyan; Ni, Jiangong; Gao, Jiyue; Han, Zhongzhi; Luan, Tao",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8333428/,68

Methods: A three-part, sequential mixed-methods study was conducted that comprised (i) a thematic analysis of data from five focus groups (with 47 ALS health professionals from 41 UK organizations and four service user representatives), (ii) a nationwide cross-sectional survey (281 ALS healthcare professionals) and (iii) a freedom of information request (251 organizations). Results: UK nutritional management services for pwALS are coordinated from specialist (n = 22) and non-specialist care centers (n = 89), with national variability in the organization and delivery of services. Multidisciplinary working was highlighted to facilitate the coordination of nutritional care. However, the need to provide evidence-based continuing education for HCPs was evident. Overall, the lack of clear guidelines on the nutritional management of people with ALS was identified as a key barrier to the delivery of effective nutritional care, as was the lack of transparency and consistency in the commissioning of nutritional services. Further concerns over the timeliness of the dietetic intervention and equity of access and provision were raised. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that development of guidelines for nutritional management, particularly at diagnosis and pre-gastrostomy, could drive standardization of high quality nutritional care for pwALS. Such guidance has the potential to reduce inequalities in geographical provision by providing clarity for those commissioning specialist nutrition services.","Halliday, Vanessa; Zarotti, Nicolò; Coates, Elizabeth; McGeachan, Alexander; Williams, Isobel; White, Sean; Beever, Daniel; Norman, Paul; Gonzalez, Sarah; Hackney, Gemma; Ezaydi, Naseeb; Stavroulakis, Theocharis; Bradburn, Mike; McDermott, Christopher",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8312499/,68
20332,Platelet-Therapeutics to Improve Tissue Regeneration and Wound Healing—Physiological Background and Methods of Preparation,2021-07-22,"BACKGROUND: C-X-C chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) is frequently elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a variety of inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases, has been detected in meningeal B cell aggregates in brain tissues of multiple sclerosis patients, and proposedly recruits B cells into the inflamed CNS. Besides B cells also follicular helper T (Tfh) cells express the cognate receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) and follow CXCL13 gradients in lymphoid tissues. These highly specialized B cell helper T cells are indispensable for B cell responses to infection and vaccination and involved in autoimmune diseases. Phenotypically and functionally related circulating CXCR5+CD4 T cells occur in blood. Their co-recruitment to the inflamed CSF is feasible but unresolved. METHODS: We approached this question with a retrospective study including data of all patients between 2017 and 2019 of whom immune phenotyping data of CXCR5 expression and CSF CXCL13 concentrations were available. Discharge diagnoses and CSF laboratory parameters were retrieved from records. Patients were categorized as pyogenic/aseptic meningoencephalitis (ME, n = 29), neuroimmunological diseases (NIMM, n = 22), and non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NIND, n = 6). ANOVA models and Spearman’s Rank-Order correlation were used for group comparisons and associations of CXCL13 levels with immune phenotyping data. RESULTS: In fact, intrathecal CXCL13 elevations strongly correlated with CXCR5+CD4 T cell frequencies in the total cohort (p < 0.0001, r = 0.59), and ME (p = 0.003, r = 0.54) and NIMM (p = 0.043, r = 0.44) patients. Moreover, the ratio of CSF-to-peripheral blood (CSF/PB) frequencies of CXCR5+CD4 T cells strongly correlated with CXCL13 levels both in the total cohort (p = 0.001, r = 0.45) and ME subgroup (p = 0.005, r = 0.50), indicating selective accumulation. ME, NIMM and NIND groups differed with regard to CSF cell counts, albumin quotient, intrathecal IgG, CXCL13 elevations and CXCR5+CD4 T cells, which were higher in inflammatory subgroups. CONCLUSION: The observed link between intrathecal CXCL13 elevations and CXCR5+CD4 T cell frequencies does not prove but suggests recruitment of possible professional B cell helpers to the inflamed CSF. This highlights CSF CXCR5+CD4 T cells a key target and potential missing link to the poorly understood phenomenon of intrathecal B cell and antibody responses with relevance for infection control, chronic inflammation and CNS autoimmunity.

This paper aims at exploring why some studies have more academic and societal impact, attracting more attention from academics and health professionals. Academic and societal impact was addressed using traditional academic metrics and alternative metrics, often known as altmetrics. We conducted a systematic search following the PRISMA statement through three well-known databases, and identified 212 papers published during 1998–2019. We conducted zero-inflated negative binomial regressions to explore the influence of bibliometric and content determinants on traditional academic and alternative metrics. We observe that the factors influencing alternative metrics are more varied and difficult to apprehend than those explaining traditional impact metrics. We also conclude that, independently of how the impact is measured, the paper’s content, rather than bibliometric characteristics, better explains its impact. In the specific case of research on Six Sigma applied to health, the papers with more impact address process improvement focusing on time and waste reduction. This study sheds light on the aspects that better explain publications’ impact in the field of Six Sigma application in health, either from an academic or a societal point of view.","Hernández-Lara, Ana-Beatriz; Sánchez-Rebull, Maria-Victoria; Niñerola, Angels",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8394710/,68

20896,Cascade Deep Forest With Heterogeneous Similarity Measures for Drug–Target Interaction Prediction,2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND: In the context of demographic aging, active aging must be encouraged. In addition, the increase in life expectancy requires specific care for the elderly. Therefore, it is important to ensure appropriate training and education to caregivers. Educational institutions put value in positively influencing the attitudes and behaviours towards elderly people in order to ensure the quality of patient care in the future. Questionnaires are often used to assess attitudes. Among them, the University of California, Los Angeles Geriatrics Attitudes Scale (UCLA-GAS) was developed to assess attitudes towards older people and caring for older patients. This scale has been used to evaluate attitude of healthcare professionals and students including undergraduate physiotherapy students. To our knowledge, there is no scale that assesses the same concept in French. Therefore, this study aimed to translate and adapt the UCLA-GAS into French and to test its psychometric properties. METHODS: We conducted this study in two phases. First, we translated and adapted the UCLA-GAS from English into French following the five recommended stages of cross-cultural adaptation. Second, we validated the French version of the scale with undergraduate physiotherapy students. One hundred nineteen students participated from the first to the third academic years. We estimated reliability and validity of the scale. We performed correlation analyses between the French version of the UCLA-GAS (UCLA-GAS-F) with the Aging Stereotypes and Exercise Scale (ASES) and the Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire (AAQ). RESULTS: The scale was translated and adapted into French. Results of the validation phase showed that the UCLA-GAS-F had high test-retest reliability (ICC 0.83, 95%CI 0.74–0.89), but internal consistency below 0.7 (Cronbach’s alpha 0.49 to 0.57). The scale showed no ceiling or floor effect. As expected, the French version showed a weak correlation to the ASES (r = 0.28, p = .003) and to the AAQ (r = 0.32, p = .001).

21600,Quantitative Determination and Environmental Risk Assessment of 102 Chemicals of Emerging Concern in Wastewater-Impacted Rivers Using Rapid Direct-Injection Liquid Chromatography—Tandem Mass Spectrometry,2021-09-07,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Venetoclax is an antagonist of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, and is currently approved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recently, clinical use has shown that patients develop resistance to venetoclax. Therefore, the demand for novel targets for treatment of CLL remains high. One such target is autophagy, an evolutionarily old system for degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles that recovers the energy for normal cellular functions. Here, the antileukemic potential of different autophagy inhibitors was evaluated in patient-derived CLL cells. Among these, inhibitors of the AMPK/ULK1 pathway and late-stage autophagy were the most potent, with selective cytotoxic activities seen. They also show activity against CLL cells with unfavorable genetic characteristics. These inhibitors complement the cytotoxic action of venetoclax. In conclusion, targeting autophagy shows potential as a novel approach for treatment of patients with CLL. ABSTRACT: Continuous treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with venetoclax, an antagonist of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, can result in resistance, which highlights the need for novel targets to trigger cell death in CLL. Venetoclax also induces autophagy by perturbing the Bcl-2/Beclin-1 complex, so autophagy might represent a target in CLL. Diverse autophagy inhibitors were assessed for cytotoxic activities against patient-derived CLL cells. The AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin, the ULK1/2 inhibitor MRT68921, and the autophagosome–lysosome fusion inhibitor chloroquine demonstrated concentration-dependent and time-dependent cytotoxicity against CLL cells, even in those from hard-to-treat patients who carried del(11q) and del(17p). Dorsomorphin and MRT68921 but not chloroquine triggered caspase-dependent cell death. According to the metabolic activities of CLL cells and PBMCs following treatments with 10 µM dorsomorphin (13% vs. 84%), 10 µM MRT68921 (7% vs. 78%), and 25 µM chloroquine (41% vs. 107%), these autophagy inhibitors are selective toward CLL cells. In these CLL cells, venetoclax induced autophagy, and addition of dorsomorphin, MRT68921, or chloroquine showed potent synergistic cytotoxicities. Additionally, MRT68921 alone induced G2 arrest, but when combined with venetoclax, it triggered caspase-dependent cytotoxicity. These data provide the rationale to target autophagy and for autophagy inhibitors as potential treatments for patients with CLL.","Avsec, Damjan; Jakoš Djordjevič, Alma Tana; Kandušer, Maša; Podgornik, Helena; Škerget, Matevž; Mlinarič-Raščan, Irena",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8466897/,68

The server cBioPortal was used to analyze the mutations and copy number alterations, whereas GENT2, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Onco-Lnc, and PrognoScan were used to examine the survival rate. The protein-protein interaction network of SYK kinase and its co-expressed genes was conducted via Gene-MANIA. Considering the SYK kinase may be the targeted site, the selected phytochemicals were assessed by molecular docking using PyRx 0.8 packages. Molecular interactions were also observed by following the Ligplot+ version 2.2. YASARA molecular dynamics simulator was applied for the post-validation of the selected phytochemicals. Results: Our result reveals an increased level of mRNA expression of the SYK gene in colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) samples compared to those in normal tissues. A significant methylation level and various genetic alterations recurrence of the SYK gene were analyzed where the fluctuation of the SYK alteration frequency was detected across different CRC studies. As a result, a lower level of SYK expression was related to higher chances of survival. This was evidenced by multiple bioinformatics platforms and web resources, which demonstrated that the SYK gene can be a potential biomarker for CRC. In this study, aromatic phytochemicals, such as kaempferol and glabridin that target the macromolecule (SYK kinase), showed higher stability than the controls, and we have estimated that these bioactive potential phytochemicals might be a useful option for CRC patients after the clinical trial. Conclusions: Our onco-informatics investigation suggests that the SYK gene can be a potential prognostic biomarker of CRC. On the contrary, SYK kinase would be a major target, and all selected compounds were validated against the protein using in-silico drug design approaches. Here, more in vitro and in vivo analysis is required for targeting SYK protein in CRC.","Biswas, Partha; Dey, Dipta; Rahman, Atikur; Islam, Md. Aminul; Susmi, Tasmina Ferdous; Kaium, Md.

Considering the burden of mental health disorders and the lack of efficacy of available treatments, there is a need for biomarkers to predict tailored or personalized treatments. However, identifying reliable biomarkers for complex mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety and PTSD, has been challenging, likely owing to the heterogeneity, comorbidity and differences in experiences and histories of individuals. For these reasons, taking a transdiagnostic approach, which identifies biomarkers that map onto shared symptoms/constructs across disorders could be most effective for informing personalized or precision medicine approaches in psychiatry. Transdiagnostic features of anxiety, depression and anhedonia have been examined in relation to brain activity and connectivity patterns. Neuroendocrine and inflammatory markers, which are altered in depression and other comorbid illness, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), might be useful in differentiating transdiagnostic symptom profiles as well as treatment responses. Ultimately, biomarker research that looks beyond diagnostic categories and embraces the complexity of individuals' lives and experiences might be more effective in moving towards precision medicine in psychiatry.","McQuaid, Robyn J.",Brain Behav Immun Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8474161/,68
22634,The vignette for V13N3 issue,2006-02-12,"BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by a novel coronavirus, can lead to severe respiratory failure and death. CDC recommends screening patients who traveled to endemic countries for fever, respiratory symptoms, and exposure to MERS-positive contacts and healthcare facilities. UCLA is a large, academic, medical center located in a diverse city with frequent international travel. We implemented a travel screening (TS) questionnaire in our electronic medical record (EMR) (Figure 1) to identify high-risk patients in order to implement early isolation practices and testing. This study describes the use and performance of our TS for identifying suspect MERS cases. METHODS: An EMR-based tool prompts nurses to ask patients at triage or admission whether they have traveled out of the country in the past 30 days (Figure 1). If patients answer affirmatively, the EMR prompts nurses to inquire about travel to specific high-risk countries and to review symptoms and exposure risks. Upon notification of a potential MERS case, the EID physician on-call reviews the TS, clinical history, epidemiologic risks, and makes a determination whether further evaluation and/or isolation for suspect MERS is necessary. We reviewed travel history, demographics, and symptoms of patients who triggered a positive TS from April 2017 to September 2018. RESULTS: The ED completed 115,815 distinct TS on 81,197 individuals during this time period. The median time from ED arrival to TS completion was 6.4 minutes. 308 ED encounters triggered a positive TS; an additional 257 encounters in other units triggered a positive TS, resulting in 565 positive TS (Table 1). 122 (22%) expressed ≥1 MERS symptom and 29 (24%) expressed both fever and respiratory symptoms. Of these symptomatic patients, 0 had a history of contact with a MERS case; 3 had a history of contact with a healthcare facility while traveling; and 4 had a history of contact with camels. No patients were diagnosed with MERS (Table 2). CONCLUSION: A history of travel to the MERS endemic countries is relatively common at a large urban hospital. Routine electronic screening of patients is an efficient way to identify high-risk travelers. This EMR tool could be modified for other emerging pathogens, such as measles or Ebola, to identify high-risk patients.

In response to the need, we have developed a simulation-based optimization methodology for generating dynamic predictive mitigation strategies for pandemic outbreaks affecting several regions. Our methodology can accommodate varying virus and population dynamics. It progressively allocates a limited budget to procure vaccines and antivirals, capacities for their administration, and resources required to enforce social distancing. The methodology uses measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, which are translated into the costs of lost productivity and medical services. The simulation model was calibrated using historic pandemic data. We illustrate the use of our methodology on a mock outbreak involving over four million people residing in four major population centers in Florida, USA. A sensitivity analysis is presented to estimate the impact of changes in the budget availability and variability of some of the critical parameters of mitigation strategies. The methodology is intended to assist public health policy makers.","Uribe-Sánchez, Andrés; Savachkin, Alex; Santana, Alfredo; Prieto-Santa, Diana; Das, Tapas K.",OR Spectr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080196/,68

In granting this, we overlook some quantitative details in his calculation, such as the apparent implication that the bubbles would contain gas at 10 or 20 kbar, and yet that their compression (by a factor of 64,000 in volume) can be calculated by ideal gas theory. He ignores the fundamental difference in rate control between martensitic conversion of crystals from one modification to another, which makes a product of the same chemical composition as the starting material, and other processes of crystal growth requiring a composition change. In the former class, to which production of diamond by the action of shock waves on graphite belongs, the limit on growth velocity is essentially the shock wave velocity. Thus, so far as that is concerned, quite a large diamond might be made within a few microseconds. Further characteristics of martensitic processes are, however, that the product takes the form of thin lenses, whereby the constraint by the matrix on shape change in the converting region is minimised and, second, that as a rule there is a multiplicity of orientations of the martensitic product in the parent crystal, so that a microcrystalline product results.","FRANK, F.

Cases were selected by placental or cord pathology &/or clinical findings in the fetus/neonate. Virus was detected in placenta, umbilical cord &/or fetal/infant organs from 17 pregnancies (1 set twins; 15 newborns & 3 stillborns). Antigen was found in single mesenchymal & epithelial cells without characteristic viral cytopathology. Viral cultures were positive in one case (skin vesicles). Five mothers had clinical or laboratory evidence of HSV 1/2 infections before or during pregnancy, but none had evidence of active infection at delivery. Thirteen pregnancies ended prematurely & 5 infants/fetuses were small for gestational age. Ten newborns were severely ill. Four infants died before 7-1/2 months of age. Of 11 survivors, 2 have severe CNS abnormalities, 1 persistent pulmonary disease & 2 remain hospitalized. Diagnoses associated with GAB positive herpes virus in specific organs include NEC, hepatitis with cholestatic jaundice, interstitial pneumonitis, aseptic meningitis, progressive cystic brain degeneration, & cardiac arrhythmias.

Contamination may be controlled either by preventing its occurrence or by inactivating the contaminating virus. The majority of agents transmitted in this way are human enteric viruses, produced either in the intestines or the liver. They are shed in human feces (noroviruses also in vomitus) in a broad range of circumstances, and they are relatively stable outside the host. Non-enteric viruses are less often transmitted via foods and are generally less environmentally stable. Insofar as vaccines are available, they are able to prevent fecal shedding. Viruses shed in feces via the water-carriage toilet may be eliminated by proper treatment and disinfection of the wastewater. In the foods context, the most effective antiviral measures are cooking and hand washing.

This study focuses on the infiltration-induced inter-unit pollutant dispersion in a high-rise residential (HRR) building. The outdoor wind pressure distribution on the building facades was obtained from the wind tunnel experiments. And the inter-household infiltration and tracer gas transmission were simulated using multi-zone model. The risk levels along building height and under different wind directions were examined, and influence of component leakage area was analysed. It is found that, the cross-infection risk can be over 20% because of the low air infiltration rate below 0.7 ACH, which is significantly higher than the risk of 9% obtained in our previous on-site measurement with air change rate over 3 ACH. As the air infiltration rate increases along building height, cross-infection risk is generally higher on the lower floors. The effect of wind direction on inter-unit dispersion level is significant, and the presence of a contaminant source in the windward side results in the highest cross-infection risks in other adjacent units on the same floor. Properly improving internal components tightness and increasing air change via external components are beneficial to the control of internal inter-unit transmission induced by infiltration. However, this approach may increase the cross-infection via the external transmission, and effective control measures should be further explored considering multiple transmission routes.","Wu, Yan; Niu, Jianlei; Liu, Xiaoping",Build Simul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090850/,68

Although their detection usually involves viral reactivation without the involvement of pulmonary tissue, viral lung disease may occur in a particular population of patients. Although histological examination for specific cytopathic effects forms the basis of diagnosis, the use of modern virological tests (amplification using real-time polymerase chain reaction to estimate the vial load) should replace the histological tests in the near future. HSV bronchopneumonitis is associated with the reactivation of HSV in oropharyngeal and oral-labial lesions. It seems to clearly affect patients’ outcome due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, only interventional studies will be able to determine its real impact. To date, use of acyclovir in these patients remains to be assessed. Although CMV reactivation in the blood is frequent in ICU patients, CMV pneumonia is difficult to diagnose because of the cumbersomeness of the procedure (open lung biopsies). Its true prognosis remains uncertain.

In bacterial meningitis, abnormal and asymmetrical enhancement of the leptomeninges and the subarachnoid space is typical. Initial neuroimaging has to rule out infectious foci of the skull base such as purulent sinusitis or mastoiditis. In patients with focal deficits or seizures, MRI is the tool of choice to diagnose vascular or septic complications. Neoplastic, viral, or fungal infections of the CNS may present with similar changes of the meninges; however, fungal meningitis normally causes a thicker and more nodular enhancement. In case of basal accentuation of the leptomeningeal contrast enhancement and conspicuous signal changes in the basal cisterns, one has to consider tuberculous meningitis for differential diagnosis, especially in patients with HIV infection. Non-infectious causes of meningeal enhancement comprise several primary and secondary tumors (e.g., CNS lymphoma, medulloblastoma, or breast cancer), granulomatous diseases, and post-operative changes.","Rohde, Stefan",Inflammatory Diseases of the Brain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119920/,68

Diverse virus types have been shown to associate with numerous distinct platelet receptors. This association can benefit the virus or the host, and thus the platelet is somewhat of a renegade. Evidence is accumulating to suggest that viruses are capable of entering platelets. For at least one type of RNA virus (dengue virus), the platelet has the necessary post-translational and packaging machinery required for production of replicative viral progeny. As a facilitator of immunity, the platelet also participates in eradicating the virus by direct and indirect mechanisms involving presentation of the pathogen to the innate and adaptive immune systems, thus enhancing inflammation by release of cytokines and other agonists. Virus-induced thrombocytopenia is caused by tangential imbalance of thrombopoeisis, autoimmunity, and loss of platelet function and integrity.","Pryzdial, Edward L.

25133,Virologie,2008,"Mutation, reassortment, and recombination are the major sources of genetic variation of plant viruses (García-Arenal et al., 2001; Worobey & Holmes, 1999). During mixed infections, viruses can exchange genetic material through recombination or reassortment of segments (when the parental genomes are fragmented) if present in the same cell context of the host plant. Hybrid progeny viruses might then arise, some of them with novel pathogenic characteristics and well adapted in the population that can cause new emerging diseases. Genetic exchange provides organisms with a tool to combine sequences from different origins which might help them to quickly evolve (Crameri et al., 1998). In many DNA and RNA viruses, genetic exchange is achieved through recombination (Froissart et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2005). As increasing numbers of viral sequences become available, recombinant viruses are recognized to be frequent in nature and clear evidence is found for recombination to play a key role in virus evolution (Awadalla, 2003; Chenault & Melcher, 1994; Moonan et al., 2000; Padidam et al., 1999; Revers et al., 1996; García-Arenal et al., 2001; Moreno et al., 2004). Understanding the role of recombination in generating and eliminating variation in viral sequences is thus essential to understand virus evolution and adaptation to changing environments Knowledge about the existence and frequency of recombination in a virus population might help understanding the extent at which genes are exchanged and new virus variants arise. This information is essential, for example, to predict durability of genetic resistance because new recombinant variants might be formed with increased fitness in host-resistant genotypes. Determination of the extent and rate at which genetic rearrangement through recombination does occur in natural populations is also crucial if we use genome and genetic-mapping information to locate genes responsible of important phenotypes such as genes associated with virulence, transmission, or breakdown of resistance. Therefore, better estimates of the rate of recombination will facilitate the development of more robust strategies for virus control (Awadalla, 2003).","Moriones, Enrique; García-Andrés, Susana; Navas-Castillo, Jesús",Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121651/,68

25222,Vertebrates as Hosts and Reservoirs of Zoonotic Microbial Agents,2010-11-10,"The human body is covered by barriers separating it from the external and internal surroundings. The “milieu enterieur” has to be stabilised in spite of the variable external and internal conditions of toxic, osmotic, microbial and climatic environmental circumstances. This first line of barriers is composed of skin and mucous membranes of complicated structures. A second line of barrier system is present in our organisms. Certain organs have to be separated from the immune system and other parts of the body because of evolutionary reasons (eye-bulb and testicles) because of unique proteins “unknown” for the acquired immune system. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is providing enhanced safety circumstances for the central nervous system. The second line of barriers is represented by the special properties of the capillary endothelial system. The maternal-fetal barrier is the most complex. At the maternal fetal interface two individuals of two different haplotypes has to be live 9 months separated by a very complicated dynamic barrier. The placenta is the organ, which is separating the maternal and fetal tissues. Similar to others the bidirectional transport of gasses, metabolites, cells, proteins, regulatory substances, are transported by active or passive transcellular and intercellular mechanisms. The fetal immune system develops immunotolerance to all maternal cells and antigens transferred transplacentally. The problem is to mitigate the maternal immune system to tolerate the paternal haplotype of the fetus. In the case of normal pregnancy a complex series of physiological modifications can solve the problem without harmful consequences to the mother and fetus. The outermost contact cells of trophoblasts express instead of HLA-class Ia and class II antigens non-variable HLA-C, HLA-E, HLA-F and HLA-G antigens. The first consequence of this is reduction of the activity of maternal natural killer cells and maternal dendritic cells; Progesteron, micro-RNA and mediators influence the development of T effector-cells. The production of soluble HLA-G(5 and 6) and IL-10 supports the differentiation of Th-2 CD4(+) helper cells, reducing the ability of maternal cells to kill fetal cells. Series of receptors and costimulators are expressed by the different lines of semi-allogenic trophoblast cells to bind HLA-G and mitigate maternal immune response; The maternal immunotolerance is further facilitated by the activation of CD4(+)CD25(bright)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (T(REG)) cells. Infections have to be prevented during pregnancy. The cells of placenta express 10 Toll-like receptors a group of pattern recognition receptors responsible for innate immunity. The interferon level is also higher in the placental tissues than in the somatic fetal or maternal cells. The complement system is also adapted to the requirements of the pregnancy and fetal damage is inhibited by the production of “assymmetric IgG antibodies” under hormonal and placental-regulation. These modifications prevent the activation of complement, cytotoxic activity, opsonising ability, antigen clearance and precipitating activity of the molecules. The Achilles’ heels of the different barriers are regularly found by virus infections. Lamina cribrosa of the blood-brain barrier, optical nerve of the eyes, etc. the risk factors of the maternal-fetal barrier has been summarised in Table 1.1.","Berencsi, György; Takács, Maria",Maternal Fetal Transmission of Human Viruses and their Influence on Tumorigenesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121758/,68

Viral infections are known for inflicting colossal economic losses worldwide in food/work/companion animals. During the last few decades, emergence of a number of new viral diseases in animals, humans and plants has been visualized. Animal disease surveillance and monitoring is essential for the sustainability of healthy livestock production systems internationally. Preparedness for combating the emerging, re-emerging, exotic and transboundary diseases requires comprehensive monitoring and precision detection systems that are pliable under the field situations. With collective and concerted scientific interventions, a few of the animal viral diseases have been stamped out globally or regionally. Rinderpest, popularly called cattle plague, was eradicated from India in 2006 and globally in 2011. Notably, India achieved the disease-free status by OIE in 2014 for African horse sickness (peste equine), a deadly viral disease of equines. Likewise, equine infectious anaemia (EIA) and equine influenza (EI) have been controlled to a greater extent in India by adopting surveillance and monitoring along with zoo sanitary measures.

So, a highly efficient molecular-based advance detection technique, i.e., loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method, is developed for diagnosis of viral infections by various workers. It is based on amplification of DNA at very low level under isothermal conditions, using a set of four specifically designed primers and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. This technique is found to be superior than most of the molecular techniques like PCR, RT-PCR, and real-time PCR due to its high specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity. Major advantage of LAMP method is its cost-effectiveness as it can be done simply by using water bath or dry bath. Here, in this review information regarding almost all the effective LAMP techniques which is developed so far for diagnosis of numerous viral pathogens is presented.","Saharan, P.; Khatri, P.; Dingolia, S.; Duhan, J.

25662,The Epidemic Process in Zoonoses and Sapronoses,2010-11-10,"Biological risks and threats come in many forms which can contribute to the globalisation of insecurity. The end of the twentieth century saw increased momentum to reframe infectious diseases from purely health issues to those of security concern. HIV/AIDS, SARS, bird flu, and swine flu pandemics in the twenty-first century have challenged nation-states and international institutions. Added to this challenge are the developments and breakthroughs in scientific experiments. While such progress has the potential to eradicate disease and improve human well-being, it also has the potential to present new risks and possible threats to society if the knowledge is used inappropriately. Biological dual-use research can inherently have both beneficial and dangerous consequences. Several incidents have highlighted the potential dangers associated with scientific experiments such as the accidental creation of the highly virulent mousepox, the reconstruction of the 1918 influenza virus, and the manipulation of the H5N1 bird flu virus. Almost all items necessary to produce lethal biological agents are dual-use and can be readily found in pharmaceutical laboratories. The ability to obtain a pathogen, weaponise the agent, and employ or disperse it, needs to be considered in terms of capability and intent and the increasing franchisation of terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda. The availability of open-source information and material, developments in biotechnology sciences, and inexpensive equipment make the production of bioweapons an attractive option for non-state actors. For example, in recent times individuals and non-state actors have developed or obtained ricin and anthrax with the intention of using it for either personal or political harm. Biological agents are not constrained by sovereign borders and can have a devastating effect either in the form of an infectious disease pandemic or as a result of scientific experimentation. This chapter analyses key issues and problems associated with biological security issues and dual-use research including governance arrangements to address those concerns.","Parker, Rita",Global Insecurity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122325/,68
25674,Nanotechnology — In Relation to Bioinformatics,2009,"All eukaryotic positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses, (+)ssRNA, replicate their genome in associationwith membranes of host cells. The presence of a replicating virus frequently induces proliferationand rearrangement of the host membranes into various cytopathic structures, including invaginations, vesicles,spherules or membranous webs. Such structures are considered to be virus-induced organelles specializedin replication functions. Virtually all membranes are able to be rearranged to support replication. Thus,membranes from peroxisomes, endosomes, lysosomes, vacuoles, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are used for(+)ssRNA virus replication, but the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is by far the preferred organelle. The specifictype of membrane system utilized in assembling the viral replication complex is strictly dependent on individualviruses and is likely to be genetically determined. The various molecular interactions that govern ER targetingof plant viruses highlight how viruses can exploit the diversity of interactions that occurs between proteinsand membrane or lipid structures.","Ritzenthaler, Christophe; Elamawi, Rabab",The Plant Endoplasmic Reticulum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122339/,68

This paper, which is based on a systematic literature review of academic papers, seeks to synthesize and examine the key challenges impeding public e-procurement implementation. These challenges are categorized using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework as follows (1) Technological challenges: e-procurement acceptance and usage, disruptive innovation characteristic of e-procurement, use of digital signatures, security and privacy of technology and technical aspects of e-procurement (2) Organizational challenges: stakeholders’ behavior, leaders’ behavior, shortcomings in leadership, lack of training and skilled personnel, resistance to change, organizational power and politics and the creation of public value underlying e-procurement (3) Environmental/Contextual challenges: regulatory framework for public procurement, Small-and-Medium-Size Enterprise issues, and context of the country. Key e-procurement implementation challenges are grounded in human and contextual issues.

28157,Patent survey on biotechnology advances,2005-04-26,"Encouraged by the crucial need to understand merchant adoption of mobile payment, this study explores the role trust play in the adoption of mobile payment by merchant and the enablers for merchant’s trust in mobile payment systems. This was done by Conceptualising the characteristics of the service provider and technology characteristics as the two dimensions that could influence merchant adoption of mobile payments. The study was done through the lenses of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Trust-Theoretic Model and adopted a qualitative approach where two merchants were selected from the health sector. The findings demonstrate that the role of merchant trust is very critical for adoption due to m-payment technology and security risk. Hence, sufficient trust-building structures in mobile payment space are essential for the adoption of mobile payment by merchants. Moreover, the findings indicate mobile service provider characteristics and the mobile technology characteristics are both imperative toward building trust in mobile payment systems for merchants’ adoption. The study also found that the trust of both technology and service provider has a far more critical influence on merchants’ adoption of mobile payments than perceived usefulness or ease of use. The study, therefore, recommends that service providers should consider the opportunity to nurture merchant trust because merchant trust acts as a fundamental enabler for the adoption of mobile payments. Other implications are also discussed.","Yeboah, Eunice; Boateng, Richard; Owusu, Acheampong; Afful-Dadzie, Eric; Ofori-Amanfo, Joshua","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134291/,68

We explore this claim and other consequences for knowledge workers using data from a sequential quantitative-qualitative, mixed-method study in Norway. 88 RPA users from different sectors and industries where first surveyed to identify differences in utilization and effects from RPA. Then, differences were explored in 24 in-depth interviews in the public and private sectors, including financial industry, manufacturing, and oil and gas. Results indicate that RPA is used to either layoff or not reemploy knowledge workers, but also to empower knowledge workers with more interesting tasks. Private sector was different from public sector in that private, financial companies have experienced the strongest reduction in the need for employment. RPA often lead to layoffs indirectly, and to reduced need for consultants, especially in financial companies. In contrast, public companies use RPA more for innovations in their service production from increased quality in data registration, handling of invoices, and data migration between systems. We conclude that RPA is maturing as a management tool motivated by cost reductions from reduced employment, and we suggest propositions for further research.","Eikebrokk, Tom Roar; Olsen, Dag Håkon","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134300/,68

Es werden immer häufiger immunsupprimierte Patienten (Infektiologie, Rheumatologie, Hämatologie/Onkologie, Transplantation von Organen usw.) behandelt. Das zunehmende Problem der Antibiotikaresistenz von Erregern und die Konsequenzen nosokomialer Infektionen erfordern eine verlässliche Epidemiologie auf diesem Gebiet. Konsequenzen betreffen einerseits Patienten, bei denen es zu einer erhöhten Morbidität und Letalität durch nosokomiale Infektionen kommt, aber andererseits auch das Gesundheitswesen, dem zusätzliche — vermeidbare? — finanzielle Belastungen entstehen. Evidenzbasierte Empfehlungen, bei denen der jeweilige Einzelfall und die örtlichen Besonderheiten ebenfalls Berücksichtigung finden, sind Voraussetzung für eine sinnvolle und kosteneffektive Vorgehensweise zur Senkung der nosokomialen Infektionsrate. In vielen Studien sind Häufigkeiten und Folgen verschiedener nosokomialer Infektionsarten sowie Maßnahmen zu ihrer Prävention untersucht worden. Um die Qualität solcher Studien und die darauf basierenden Empfehlungen von Experten, die ja oftmals ebenfalls mit Kosten verbunden sind, kritisch beurteilen zu können, ist epidemiologisches Wissen unverzichtbar. Dies beinhaltet selbstverständlich auch die Kenntnis der jeweiligen Erreger solcher Infektionen sowie das Wissen um erregerspezifische Übertragungswege.

We present DRS-LaG, a Deep Reinforcement Learning System, based on Local and Global preferences. We capture these global content preferences by tracking a key analytics KPI, the number of views. The problem is formulated using an agent which predicts the next page to be visited by the user, based on the historic webpage content and analytics. In an offline setting, we show how the model can be used for predicting the next webpage that the user visits.

30647,Abstracts of poster presentations: The distribution of ventilation‐perfusion ratios in a premature foal,2010-06-10,"The aim of the present study was to determine whether bovine coronavirus (BCV) has the ability to initiate infection in a human colon carcinoma cell line, Caco‐2, that has been established to spontaneously differentiate after confluence. When Caco‐2 cells were infected with BCV, a titer of 5.5 × 10(6) plaque‐forming units (p.f.u.)/mL was found in the culture supernatant at 5 days postinfection. Two clones, Caco‐2/CA1 and Caco‐2/CA2, were then isolated by monitoring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cell proliferation activities. The ALP activity level of CA1 cells was significantly higher than that of CA2 cells, while the level of cell proliferation activity of CA1 was significantly lower than that of CA2. When CA1 and CA2 cells were infected with BCV at confluence, virus hemagglutination (HA) was detected in the culture supernatant at 5 days postinfection for CA1 cells and at 8 days postinfection for CA2 cells. Thus, BCV propagation was substantially delayed in CA2 cells, suggesting that a cellular factor(s) that appears at the differentiation stage may control BCV propagation. BCV‐susceptible CA1 and CA2 cells showing different levels of ALP activity would be useful for further experiments to elucidate the mechanism of BCV propagation.","MORI, Kenichi; INOUE, Yuuki; MUKAI, Takao; OHORI, Hitoshi",Anim Sci J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159700/,68

31358,"Colds, flu and memories",2003-10-01,"In analogy to DNA microarrays, protein microarrays offer a new distinct possibility to perform sensitive high‐throughput global proteome analysis. However, the development of the protein microarray technology will place high demands upon the design of both probes and solid supports. The analysis of thousands of heterogeneous proteins on a single microarray requires the use of uniform probes, such as antibodies, directly designed for protein microarray applications. We have recently generated a human recombinant single‐chain Fv antibody library, genetically constructed around one framework, the nCoDeR‐library, containing 2 × 1010 clones. Single framework antibody fragments (sinFabs) selected from this library were successfully applied as probes for microarrays providing sensitive detection in the 600 attomol (mass spectrometry) and the 300 zeptomole range (fluorescence). However, the choice of framework is critical. We have shown that the selected nCoDeR framework displayed excellent functional on‐chip stability and arrayed dehydrated probes retained their activity for several months. Furthermore, we have addressed the issues of biocompatibility of the solid support and immobilization strategies for our microarray setup. An in‐house‐designed substrate, macroporous silicon coated with nitrocellulose (MAP3‐NC7), displayed properties equal to, or better than, those of five commercially available supports used as reference surfaces. We have also evaluated different coupling strategies, such as adsorption, covalent coupling, diffusion and affinity coupling. Using a novel affinity tag, the double‐(his)6‐tag, we increased the binding efficiency of sinFab‐molecules to Ni2(+)‐coated solid supports, thereby allowing nonpurified probes to be directly applied.","Steinhauer, C.; Wingren, C.; Borrebaeck, C.

31686,Cervical Lymphadenopathy,2010-07-28,"This chapter explains laboratory techniques for diagnosis of virus infections. An exact virological diagnosis is necessary for studies of the epidemiology of viral infections and for the control of epidemics and nosocomial infections. Most known viruses causing disease in man can be demonstrated by use of cell cultures or experimental animals. The virus infection is indicated by the more or less characteristic changes that the virus causes in cell cultures or by the appearance of disease in experimental animals. The cells of different origin and age may have a markedly varying susceptibility to different viruses. For diagnostic purposes a virus laboratory must therefore have access to a battery of cell lines from animals and man. It is pointed out that demonstration, by use of laboratory techniques; of a virus infection in a patient does not necessarily imply that this infection is the cause of the patient's disease. Many viruses often give inapparent infections or are excreted for a long time after the acute disease.","Grandien, Monica; Svedmyr, Arne",Textbook of Medical Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173587/,68
32516,Synthesis and physico-chemical properties of poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-based hydrogels with titania nanoparticles,2019-11-22,"OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, a newly identified coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)) has caused outbreaks of pneumonia in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via cell receptor ACE II (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). In order to identify possible prime target cells of SARS-CoV-2 by comprehensive dissection of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coexpression pattern in different cell types, five datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of lung, oesophagus, gastric mucosa, ileum and colon were analysed. DESIGN: Five datasets were searched, separately integrated and analysed. Violin plot was used to show the distribution of differentially expressed genes for different clusters. The ACE2-expressing and TMPRRSS2-expressing cells were highlighted and dissected to characterise the composition and proportion. RESULTS: Cell types in each dataset were identified by known markers. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were not only coexpressed in lung AT2 cells and oesophageal upper epithelial and gland cells but also highly expressed in absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon. Additionally, among all the coexpressing cells in the normal digestive system and lung, the expression of ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in the ileum and colon. CONCLUSION: This study provides the evidence of the potential route of SARS-CoV-2 in the digestive system along with the respiratory tract based on single-cell transcriptomic analysis. This finding may have a significant impact on health policy setting regarding the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study also demonstrates a novel method to identify the prime cell types of a virus by the coexpression pattern analysis of single-cell sequencing data.","Zhang, Hao; Kang, Zijian; Gong, Haiyi; Xu, Da; Wang, Jing; Li, Zhixiu; Li, Zifu; Cui, Xinggang; Xiao, Jianru; Zhan, Jian; Meng, Tong; Zhou, Wang; Liu, Jianmin; Xu, Huji",Gut,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211082/,68

During recent years several approaches have been proposed, assuming observing the side surfaces, mainly based on the analysis of the regularity of visible patterns, which represent the consecutive printed layers. These methods, based on the use of general purpose image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, Hough transform, entropy and texture analysis, make it possible to classify the printed samples, independently of the filament’s colour, into low and high quality classes, with the use of photos or 3D scans of the side surfaces. The next step of research, investigated in this paper, is the combination of various proposed approaches to develop a combined metric, possibly highly correlated with subjective opinions. Since the correlation of single metrics developed mainly for classification is relatively low, their combination makes it possible to achieve much better results, verified using an original, newly developed database containing 107 captured images and 3D scans of the 3D printed surfaces with various colours and local distortions caused by external factors, together with Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) gathered from independent observers. Obtained results are promising and may be a starting point for further research towards the optimisation of the newly developed metrics for the automatic assessment of the 3D printed surfaces, mainly for aesthetic purposes.","Fastowicz, Jarosław; Lech, Piotr; Okarma, Krzysztof",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304756/,68

38744,Gandhi on Caturvarṇa and Niṣkāma Karma: A Re-interpretation,2020-09-05,"The management of carbapenem-resistant infections is often based on polymyxins, tigecycline, aminoglycosides and their combinations. However, in a recent systematic review, we found that Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) co-resistant to carbapanems, aminoglycosides, polymyxins and tigecycline (CAPT-resistant) are increasingly being reported worldwide. Clinical data to guide the treatment of CAPT-resistant GNB are scarce and based exclusively on few case reports and small case series, but seem to indicate that appropriate (in vitro active) antimicrobial regimens, including newer antibiotics and synergistic combinations, may be associated with lower mortality. In this review, we consolidate the available literature to inform clinicians dealing with CAPT-resistant GNB about treatment options by considering the mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems. In combination with rapid diagnostic methods that allow fast detection of carbapenemase production, the approach proposed in this review may guide a timely and targeted treatment of patients with infections by CAPT-resistant GNB. Specifically, we focus on the three most problematic species, namely Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Several treatment options are currently available for CAPT-resistant K. pneumonia. Newer β-lactam-β-lactamase combinations, including the combination of ceftazidime/avibactam with aztreonam against metallo-β-lactamase-producing isolates, appear to be more effective compared to combinations of older agents. Options for P. aeruginosa (especially metallo-β-lactamase-producing strains) and A. baumannii remain limited. Synergistic combination of older agents (e.g., polymyxin- or fosfomycin-based synergistic combinations) may represent a last resort option, but their use against CAPT-resistant GNB requires further study.","Karakonstantis, Stamatis; Kritsotakis, Evangelos I; Gikas, Achilleas",Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7461763/,68

41330,Vets' and Pet Owners' Views About Antibiotics for Companion Animals and the Use of Phages as an Alternative,2020-09-29,"ABSTRACT: Does regional corruption exacerbate regional carbon emissions? To answer this, based on the spatial Durbin model, this study empirically examines the impact of regional corruption on carbon emission, using panel data from 30 provinces in China during the period 2002–2017. The results show that: (1) there is an indistinctive N-shaped relationship between regional corruption and carbon emissions at the national level. Regional corruption tends to initially aggravate carbon emissions, then contributes to emission reduction, and then finally boosts carbon emissions. However, this effect is not statistically significant. The results suggest that the role of regional corruption on carbon emissions is twofold. Corruption can exacerbate and can also inhibit regional carbon emissions. (2) Pronounced regional heterogeneity exists with regard to the influence of corruption on carbon emissions. Regional corruption and carbon emissions show a significant N-shaped dynamic relationship in China’s central region, while the relationship is not significant in the eastern and western regions. (3) The impact of regional corruption on carbon emissions varies with time. For 2002–2009, regional corruption did not have a significant effect on carbon emissions. For 2010–2017, the direct effect became significant, and an apparent N-shaped relationship formed between regional corruption and carbon emissions. Based on the empirical results, this paper proposes several policy recommendations regarding corruption and carbon governance.

42641,Metal Complex Bactericides with Detergent Properties,2020-12-01,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the major causes of nosocomial infections worldwide which can cause several diseases in children and adults. The globally dissemination of hyper-virulent strains of K. pneumoniae and the emergence of antibiotics-resistant isolates of this pathogen narrows down the treatment options and has renewed interest in its vaccines. Vaccine candidates of Klebsiella pneumoniae have not been adequately protective, safe and globally available yet. In K. pneumoniae infection, it is well known that B cells that induce robust humoral immunity are necessary for the host complete protection. Identifying the B cell epitopes of antigens is valuable to design novel vaccine candidates. In the present study using immunoinformatics approaches we found B cell epitopes of four K. pneumoniae type 1 fimbriae antigens namely FimA, FimF, FimG, and FimH. Linear and conformational B cell epitopes of each antigen were predicted using different programs. Subsequently, many bioinformatics assays were applied to choose the best epitopes including prediction antigenicity, toxicity, human similarity and investigation on experimental records. These assays resulted in final four epitopes (each for one Fim protein). These final epitopes were modeled and their physiochemical properties were estimated to be used as potential vaccine candidates. Altogether, we found four B cell epitopes of K. pneumoniae Fim antigens that are immunogen, antigenic, not similar to human peptides, not allergen and not toxic. Also, they have suitable physiochemical properties to administrate as vaccine, although their complete efficacy should be also shown in vitro and in vivo.

43547,Poly(α-l-lysine)-based nanomaterials for versatile biomedical applications: Current advances and perspectives,2020-12-13,"Frailty, a clinical syndrome characterized by vulnerability to stressors resulting from a loss of physiological reserve across multiple systems, is a common condition that affects older adults. In patients with COVID 19 infection, frailty may place older adults at higher risk for poor clinical outcomes including hospitalizations. The aim of this study was to determine independent variables associated with all-cause hospitalization in Veterans with COVID 19 infection. This was a cross-sectional study nested within a retrospective cohort study of Veterans who contracted COVID 19 as detected by PCR. A VA Frailty Index (VA-FI) was generated at baseline as a proportion of morbidity, function, sensory loss, cognition and mood and other variables from electronic health records. The VA-FI categorized Veterans into non-frail (FI<.21) and frail (FI≥.21). At the time or after the COVID 19 testing, hospitalization data was aggregated, and proposed variables were subjected to stepwise backward logistic regression. Likelihood ratios were obtained, and those with p<0.05 were identified as independent risk factors for hospitalization. A total of 2621 Veterans with COVID 19 infection were identified during the study period with a total of 650 hospitalizations. Mean age was 54.99 (SD=16.71) years, 59.80% White, 87.60% male, 25.10% frail.

44217,MATHLA: a robust framework for HLA-peptide binding prediction integrating bidirectional LSTM and multiple head attention mechanism,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Mount Sinai Beth Israel (MSBI) is a 220 bed acute care hospital located in the Manhattan borough of Manhattan in New York City. Prior to COVID-19, the hospital had one 16-bed Medical/Surgical ICU. When the COVID epidemic struck New York City, the MSBI ED was flooded with critically ill patients requiring ICU care. Seven other ICUs were opened, all of which were filled with COVID patients. The majority of these patients required central lines for the multiple antibiotics, steroids, and vasopressors they needed to survive. Agency RNs were brought in to care for ICU patients. In April, the MSBI Infection Prevention (IP) department received several CLABSI notifications through its data mining system. The IPs were alarmed at the number of CLABSIs occurring in ICU COVID patients with central lines. ICU CLABSI Rates in an Acute Care Hospital During the COVID-19 Epidemic in New York City [Image: see text] METHODS: A baseline assessment, using the central line maintenance bundle, was conducted on all COVID patients with central lines. This assessment revealed issues with central line maintenance, including: undated, bloody, and non-intact dressings, poorly placed CHG impregnated disks; blood in end-caps, and missing alcohol impregnated caps on ports. The decision was made to bring in infusion RNs from an outpatient system site to perform daily rounds on central lines. These RNs performed daily intensive maintenance bundle rounds for a month during the COVID epidemic. During their rounds, ICU nurses and managers were notified of central line dressing and cap issues and educated on how to correct them. These RNs also e-mailed daily reports of their findings to Nursing Leadership for their review. Central Line Audit Team: RNs Who Monitored Central Lines in COVID ICUs in An Acute Care Hospital in NYC [Image: see text] Central Line Audit Team: RNs Who Monitored Central Lines in COVID ICUs in An Acute Care Hospital in NYC RESULTS: Central line rounds performed after the intervention showed a great improvement in compliance with the central line maintenance bundle, from 13% during the first rounds performed in April, to 88% in May, less than a month after these rounds started. Since this intervention, the ICU CLABSI rate has decreased from a rate of 3.3 per 1,000 central line days in April and May to a current rate of 0. CONCLUSION: The timely identification and root cause analysis of a problem must be followed by timely, intensive, and repeated interventions that are designed to attack the causes of problems at their source. After the crisis period is over, the interventions must be maintained to ensure that gains made can be sustained.

The current study aimed to examine the associations between job demands, coping strategies (i.e. emotion-focused coping and problem-focused coping) and psychological distress exhibited by social workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the mediating role of different coping strategies was investigated for the associations revealed. The participants were 615 social workers, working in various organisations and with diverse populations in Israel. Each completed a validated self-report questionnaire. Results revealed that job demands were significantly associated with higher psychological distress, and that coping strategies, especially emotion-focused coping was associated with higher psychological distress and with job demands. In addition, emotion-focused coping strategies were found to mediate the association between job demands and psychological distress, especially ventilation of emotion beyond other strategies, which relate to emotion-focused coping. These findings are discussed with relation to a stress and coping theory, suggesting that in social work practice there is a need for intervention measures to improve social workers’ coping strategies during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ben-Ezra, Menachem; Hamama-Raz, Yaira",Br J Soc Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7799205/,68

Preservation of ecological functions of the soil cover and its status in areas newly developed or excluded from agriculture determines the rate and occurrence time of ecological risks and threats to food security. The global role and cost of soil resources increase. Russia is characterized by the maximal area of soil cover: approximately 14.5 × 10(6) km(2) or one sixth of the soil cover of the Earth. Soils are underestimated as a unique national wealth and strategic resource. The amounts of applied agrochemicals are insufficient for the reproduction of soil fertility. The food security in the country is achieved and food products are exported due to nonreimbursable expenses of reserves of soil fertility.

Our research explores this topic through (1) an analysis of three documents (the Belém Declaration; the Réseau Ecosocialist Manifesto; and Ecuador’s National Development Plan), which mirror ecosocialist goals and are actively followed by a group of people, and (2) a stakeholder power analysis of the actors involved in the controversial Belo Monte Dam project in Brazil. Five agents feature prominently in the discussion, two of which contrast with traditional red-green thought: social movements, indigenous groups, the affluent capitalist class, left-wing political parties and the state. Their specific capabilities and power resources determine the different roles they could assume in a transition from a capitalist to an ecosocialist situation. We also argue that the particular opportunity context within which their activities are taking place constitutes a key consideration in transformative agency.","Cremona, Elisabeth; Ioris, Antonio Augusto Rossotto",Environment and Development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972056/,68

This chapter suggests that the university’s entrepreneurial behaviour needs to be conceptualised within the institutional perspective of “rules of the game”, which simultaneously constrain and facilitate interactions of the key players. The idea of the “Innovation Triad” focuses our attention on the knowledge-based institutional environment and identifies the key actors and interactions: rule makers (RMs), knowledge entrepreneurs (KEs), and knowledge incubators (KIs) (Datta and Adesola, International Journal of Technology Management and Sustainable Development 17 (3): 197–202, 2018). The book makes important theoretical and empirical contributions to the burgeoning literature on academic entrepreneurship, and sets out the three-part structure of macro- (institutional environment), meso- (inter-organisational), and micro- (intra-organisational) level aspects of the Entrepreneurial University.","Adesola, Sola; Datta, Surja",Entrepreneurial Universities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980818/,68
49776,Synthetic Biology,2020-09-29,"This chapter focuses on the mental health system of Guatemala through interviews with the directors that run this system. In Guatemala, the majority of the public mental health system is composed of one psychiatric hospital—the National Mental Health Hospital Carlos Federico Mora, known as Federico Mora. Based on liberation psychology (Martin-Baró, 1989), I situate mental health within the relational, and in a historical perspective. Eight directors give insight into how the mental health system operates in the country. Findings reveal a high demand for mental health services that is unattended. An effort to avoid the services at the Federico Mora by organizations requiring psychiatric referrals. Finally, a history that ties the creation of the Federico Mora to the internal armed conflict. I argue that in a country where psychological violence was used against the civilian population by the state, mental health is a political issue. In addition, an unresponsive mental health system that uses violence in their care practices is a political strategy that through action and inaction normalizes state terror. In other words, the Federico Mora oppresses Guatemalans receiving services through violence (action) and those requiring services and not able to access them (inaction). This pattern is consistent with that of feminicide. Feminicide implicates the state in the killing of women by men as an act of gendered violence, and as such is a political term (Sanford, 2008; Carney & Torres, 2010; Menjívar, 2011). Because of this context, I propose teaching toward decoloniality as a paradigm centering the mental health needs of Guatemalans.","Figueroa, Chantal",Dis/ability in the Americas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981120/,68

51014,Simulations of Lévy Walk,2021-03-30,"BACKGROUND: With the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand and availability of telehealth in outpatient care has increased. Although use of telehealth has been studied and validated for various medical specialties, relatively few studies have looked at its role in gastroenterology despite burden of chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). AIMS: To assess effectiveness of telehealth medicine in gastroenterology by comparing medication adherence rate for patients seen with telehealth and traditional in-person appointment for various GI conditions. METHODS: Retrospective chart analysis of patients seen in outpatient gastroenterology clinic was performed to identify patients who were given prescription to fill either through telehealth or in-person appointment. By using provincial pharmacy database, we determined the prescription fill rate. RESULTS: A total of 241 patients were identified who were provided prescriptions during visit with their gastroenterologists. 128 patients were seen through in-person visit during pre-pandemic period. 113 patients were seen through telehealth appointment during COVID pandemic. The mean age of patients in telehealth cohort was 42 years (57% male). On average patients had 10 prior visits with their gastroenterologists before index appointment, used for adherence assessment. 92% of patients were seen in follow-up, while 8% were seen in initial consultation. The majority of the patients in the telehealth cohort had IBD (89%), while the remaining 11% had various diagnoses, including functional GI disorder, gastroesophageal reflux disease, viral hepatitis, or hepatobiliary disorders. Biologic therapy was the most commonly prescribed medication (66.4%). 45 patients were provided either new medication or dose change, and 68 patients had prescription refill to continue their current medications. It took a mean of 18 days (SD = 16.2) for patients to fill their prescriptions. Prescription fill rate for patients seen through telehealth and in-person visit were 98.2% and 89.1% (P = 0.004) respectively. Patients seen through telehealth were 6.8 times more likely to fill their prescriptions compared to the in-person counterparts (OR 6.82, CI 1.51 – 30.68, P = 0.004). When we compared adherence rate while excluding biologic therapies, the prescription fill rate was 94.7% in telehealth group and 81.4% in in-person group (OR 4.11, CI 0.88 – 19.27, P = 0.056). Due to high level of adherence, statistical analysis comparing adherent and non-adherent groups was performed but yielded insignificant results. CONCLUSIONS: Medication adherence rate for patients seen through telehealth was higher compared to patients seen through in-patient visit in this study. Telehealth is a viable alternative for outpatient care especially for patients with chronic GI conditions such as IBD.

52016,Assessing the Innovation-finance Nexus for SMEs: Evidence from the Arab Region (MENA),2021-04-24,"Globally, many countries are facing an increasing burden of chronic disease due to ageing populations, of which cardiovascular disease forms a large proportion. Excess dietary sodium contributes to cardiovascular disease risk and requires intervention at a population level. This study aimed to quantify the impact of several salt reduction initiatives on population health over a 30-year horizon using GeoDEMOS, a population model from Singapore. Four interventions were modelled in four demographic groups in 2020 for a total of 16 intervention scenarios. The effect of 0.5, 2.0, and 4.0 g/day reductions in daily salt consumption, along with adherence to the World Health Organization guidelines of a maximum of 5.0 g of salt each day, was modelled in the entire population, including the overweight and obese, the elderly, and diabetics. In each scenario, the number of averted incident cases of acute myocardial infarction and stroke, along with the disability-adjusted life years up to 2050, was monitored. We found 4.0 g/day reductions in salt consumption were the most effective when implemented across the entire population, resulting in 24,000 averted incident cases of cardiovascular disease and 215,000 disability-adjusted life years over 30 years. This is a large figure when compared with the 29,200 projected annual incident cases of cardiovascular disease in 2050. When targeted at specific high-risk demographic groups, the largest effects were observed in the overweight and obese, with the same intervention yielding 10,500 averted incident cases of cardiovascular disease and 91,500 disability-adjusted life years. Quantifying the benefits of salt reduction initiatives revealed a significant impact when administered across the entire population or the overweight and obese. Health promotion efforts directed toward sustainably reducing salt consumption will help to lower the chronic disease burden on the healthcare system in years to come.","Tan, Ken Wei; Quaye, Sharon Esi Duoduwa; Koo, Joel Ruihan; Lim, Jue Tao; Cook, Alex R.; Dickens, Borame L.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8065991/,68
52464,The marvelous optical performance of AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet light-emitting diodes with AlInGaN-based last quantum barrier and step electron blocking layer,2021-05-04,"In recent years, smartphone users are interested in large volumes to view live videos and sharing video resources over social media (e.g., Youtube, Netflix). The continuous streaming of video in mobile devices faces many challenges in network parameters namely bandwidth estimation, congestion window, throughput, delay, and transcoding is a challenging and time-consuming task. To perform these resource-intensive tasks via mobile is complicated, and hence, the cloud is integrated with smartphones to provide Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). To resolve the issue, we propose a novel framework called delay aware bandwidth estimation and intelligent video transcoder in mobile cloud. In this paper, we introduced four techniques, namely, Markov Mobile Bandwidth Cloud Estimation (MMBCE), Cloud Dynamic Congestion Window (CDCW), Queue-based Video Processing for Cloud Server (QVPS), and Intelligent Video Transcoding for selecting Server (IVTS). To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we implemented a testbed using the two mobile configurations and the public cloud server Amazon Web Server (AWS). The study and results in a real environment demonstrate that our proposed framework can improve the QoS requirements and outperforms the existing algorithms. Firstly, MMBCE utilizes the well-known Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to estimate the best bandwidth of mobile using reward function. MMBCE improves the performance of 50% PDR compared with other algorithms. CDCW fits the congestion window and reduces packet loss dynamically. CDCW produces 40% more goodput with minimal PLR. Next, in QVPS, the M/M/S queueing model is processed to reduce the video processing delay and calculates the total service time. Finally, IVTS applies the M/G/N model and reduces 6% utilization of transcoding workload, by intelligently selecting the minimum workload of the transcoding server. The IVTS takes less time in slow and fast mode. The performance analysis and experimental evaluation show that the queueing model reduces the delay by 0.2 ms and the server’s utilization by 20%. Hence, in this work, the cloud minimizes delay effectively to deliver a good quality of video streaming on mobile.","Tamizhselvi, S.P.; Muthuswamy, Vijayalakshmi",Peer Peer Netw Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8087536/,68

54868,Ultrasonically Processed WSe(2) Nanosheets Blended Bulk Heterojunction Active Layer for High-Performance Polymer Solar Cells and X-ray Detectors,2021-06-10,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary agenesis is a rare congenital anomaly with a reported prevalence of about 1 in 100,000 births. It may be bilateral or unilateral. Among the unilateral form, left lung agenesis is more common (70%); however, it is the right lung agenesis which carries a dismal prognosis due to the frequent association with a gamut of other congenital anomalies and greater degree of mediastinal shift leading to tracheo-bronchial and vascular distortion. The patients of unilateral pulmonary agenesis usually present in infancy or early childhood. Presentation in late adulthood as seen in our patient is rare. We present a case of left pulmonary agenesis that was diagnosed in 4th decade of life. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old male presented with gradually progressive exertional dyspnea of 1 month duration. Clinical examination revealed tachycardia and tachypnea. Chest radiograph showed opaque left hemithorax with ipsilateral mediastinal shift. Computed tomography clinched the diagnosis by demonstrating absence of left main bronchus, lung and left pulmonary artery with shift of heart, and great mediastinal vessels into left hemithorax. The patient was managed conservatively and discharged with attachment to out-patient department for regular follow-up. CONCLUSION: Presentation of unilateral lung agenesis in late adulthood, as seen in the present case is extremely rare. This case report highlights that, a rare condition like unilateral pulmonary agenesis, should be considered in the list of differentials in an adult presenting with opaque hemithorax with ipsilateral mediastinal shift on radiography.","Parry, Arshed Hussain; Raheem, Mujahed Abdulsattar Ibrahim; Ismail, Hussam Hassan; Sharaf, Osama",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217785/,68

This study investigated the seroprevalence of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella-zoster in newly employed female nurses. METHODS: We conducted a survey on the seroprevalence of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella-zoster in newly employed female nurses at a university hospital from 2011 to 2019, before the nurses were given their department placements and duty start. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent and chemiluminescence immunoassays were used to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies. We analyzed whether there was a significant difference in seroprevalence depending on the age, birth year, birth season, and region of residence (metropolitan residency: yes or no). RESULTS: The arithmetic mean ages of the participants were 28.6 ± 4.8, 23.5 ± 3.2, 23.6 ± 3.0, and 26.1 ± 4.5 years for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella-zoster, respectively. The seropositivity rates were 93.9% (551/587), 60.2% (50/83), 83.3% (3,093/3,711), and 89.5% (978/1,093) for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella-zoster, respectively. Significant differences in the seroprevalence when assessed according to the age and birth year were noted with measles, while significant differences in the seroprevalence were only noted with rubella and varicella-zoster when assessed according to birth year and age, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified the levels of antibody prevalence in new female nurses. Considering the seropositivity levels, cost-effectiveness, and convenience for the participants, we recommend that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination be provided without serologic testing for all new female nurses and the varicella-zoster vaccination only be performed for persons who are negative after serologic testing. And it would be useful if the vaccinations were combined with compulsory worker health examinations, such as the pre-placement health examinations.","Yoo, Yeongjae; Park, Won-Ju; Cho, Seunghyeon; Lim, Dae-Young; Kim, Suwhan; Kang, Wonyang; Kim, Hyeonjun; Moon, Jai-Dong",Ann Occup Environ Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8264122/,68

A governance framework is first presented followed by a discussion of recent developments in relation to elements of the framework as part of a mini-review of the literature. Emerging risks and opportunities around the changing nature of work, corporate culture, blockchain and cyber security were highlighted, with a particular emphasis on climate-related risks. Key questions to ask as a non-executive director or governance and risk committee members regarding these risks include could our sector or organisation be impacted by these emerging risks and opportunities? What could be the implications if these risks were to materialise and to what extent will our current business and operating model be impacted? How could our organisation be seizing the opportunity created by the pending changes in these areas? The findings and implications of the governance and risk issues are highlighted for the extractives sector and are especially important as the extractive sector faces challenges in its transformation. The study is novel as it highlights insights from the practitioner perspective of governance which is not captured in the literature. Recommended remedies for each risk are provided, and businesses are advised to undertake a focused review of non-financial risks, including corporate or organisational culture.","Guerin, Turlough",Miner Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8290139/,68

Phyto-fabrication of AgNPs was confirmed by using spectrophotometry, SEM imaging and X-ray diffraction analysis. The morphological and optical characterization manifested that the AgNPs are crystalline and exist in the size range of 30–100 nm. Various concentrations (10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mg/L) of AgNPs were applied in combinations on sunflower seeds and crop plants. The effects of biosynthesized AgNPs were evaluated for agro-morphological parameters (plant height, flowering initiation and seed weight), biochemical metabolites (chlorophyll, proline, soluble sugar, amino acid and protein contents) and enzymatic activities (superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase) in sunflower and 60 mg/L concentration of AgNPs on sunflower seeds and foliar sprays on plants in combination were found to be effective to elicit biochemical modifications to improve secondary metabolites. It was also observed experimentally that 60 mg/L concentration of AgNPs improved the biochemical, fatty acid and enzymatic attributes of sunflower plants, which in turn improved the plant agro-morphological parameters. Near-infrared spectroscopic analysis results confirmed the improvement in the seed quality, oil contents and fatty acid composition (palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid) after the applications of AgNPs. The findings of the present investigation confirm the exogenous applications of bio-fabricated AgNPs in combinations on seeds and plants to improve the plant yield, seed quality and secondary metabolite contents of the sunflower plants.","Batool, Syeda Umber; Javed, Bilal; Sohail,; Zehra, Syeda Sadaf; Mashwani, Zia-ur-Rehman; Raja, Naveed Iqbal; Khan, Tariq; ALHaithloul, Haifa Abdulaziz Sakit; Alghanem, Suliman Mohammed; Al-Mushhin, Amina A.

The planned central zone was never built, but the local community places, as urban hubs for meeting and gathering, have been developed within the initially conceived open public spaces. Considering their importance for establishing and strengthening local communities, the article focuses on the development tendencies detected in emerging urban hubs of the residential Blocks 37 and 38. Unlike many other blocks of New Belgrade, which have been exposed to drastic changes of their original Modernist structure, their authentic setting have remained mostly intact since their construction in the 1970s. Therefore, they are selected as the examples of a new process of community planning which has followed the activities of place making. Triggered both by the changed patterns of use and the specificities of original spatial features, these changes also influence the local neighborhood while shifting the perception of the previously neglected open public spaces. The emerging hubs are analyzed on the level of networks, configuration and places, providing an insight into ongoing transformation of both the space and the local community.","Jovanović, Predrag R.; Stupar, Aleksandra B.",Urban Des Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8350556/,68

57121,Das Virus als Game Changer,2021-08-27,"Emerging intelligent society shall change the way people are organised around their work and consequently also as a society. One approach to investigating intelligent systems and their social influence is information processing. Intelligence is information processing. However, factual and ethical information are different. Facts concern true vs. false, while ethics is about what should be done. David Hume recognised a fundamental problem in this respect, which is that facts can be used to derive values. His answer was negative, which is critical for developing intelligent ethical technologies. Hume’s problem is not crucial when values can be assigned to technologies, i.e. weak ethical artificial intelligence (AI), but it is hard when we speak of strong ethical AI, which should generate values from facts. However, this paper argues that Hume’s aporia is grounded on a mistaken juxtaposition of emotions and cognition. In the human mind, all experiences are based on the cooperation of emotions and cognitions. Therefore, Hume’s guillotine is not a real obstacle, but it is possible to use stronger forms of ethical AI to develop new ethics for intelligent society.","Saariluoma, Pertti",Hum.-Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8380863/,68

The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of mindfulness practices on emotion regulation, on the perception of stress, and on the psychological well-being of graduate students. Forty-five (45) graduate students participated in the study, divided into an intervention and a control group. Questionnaires were applied for self-assessment of mindfulness, perceived stress, and psychological well-being, in addition to qualitative interviews in the pre- and post-timeframes of a mindfulness-based intervention. Quantitative data were analyzed using ANOVAs for repeated measures, while the interviews were analyzed using the thematic content analysis technique. The results indicated increases in the levels of mindfulness and psychological well-being, and a reduction in perceived stress in the intervention group, post-intervention.

Yet, the practical viability of walk-sharing is largely dependent on community acceptance, which has not, until now, been explored. Gaining useful insights on the community’s spatio-temporal and social preferences in regard to walk-sharing will ensure the establishment of practical viability of walk-sharing in a real-world urban scenario. We aim to derive practical viability using defined performance metrics (waiting time, detour distance, walk-alone distance and matching rate) and by investigating the effectiveness of walk-sharing in terms of its major objective of improving pedestrian safety and safety perception. We make use of the results from a web-based survey on the public perception on our proposed walk-sharing scheme. Findings are fed into an existing agent-based walk-sharing model to investigate the performance of walk-sharing and deduce its practical viability in urban scenarios.","Bhowmick, Debjit; Winter, Stephan; Stevenson, Mark; Vortisch, Peter",Comput.Urban Sci.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8419668/,68

Then the functions of UBL4A in antiviral immune response were characterized. Overexpression of UBL4A promoted RNA virus-induced ISRE or IFN-β or NF-κB activation, leading to enhanced type I IFN transcription and reduced virus replication. Consistently, knockdown of UBL4A resulted in reduced type I IFN transcription and enhanced virus replication. Additionally, overexpression of UBL4A promoted virus-induced phosphorylation of TBK1, IRF3, and IKKα/β. Knockdown of UBL4A inhibited virus-induced phosphorylation of TBK1, IRF3, and IKKα/β. Coimmunoprecipitation showed that UBL4A interacted with TRAF6, and this interaction was enhanced upon viral infection. Ubiquitination assays showed that UBL4A promoted the K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6. Therefore, we reveal a novel positive feedback regulation of UBL4A in innate immune response combating virus invasion by enhancing the K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6.","Peng, Shu-Jie; Yao, Ran-Ran; Yu, Shuang-Shuang; Chen, Hong-Yan; Pang, Xuewen; Zhang, Yu; Zhang, Jun",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1800750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451677/,68

Simultaneously, HCV cure has become a reality, with the advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and expansion of treatment programs. As a result, HCV screening recommendations now include all adults, including pregnant individuals, and many countries have endorsed widespread DAA access as a strategy to achieve HCV eradication. However, almost universally, pregnant individuals have been systematically excluded from HCV clinical research and treatment programs. This omission runs counter to public health strategies focused on elimination of HCV but is consistent with a historical pattern of exclusion of pregnant individuals from research. Our systematic review of publications on HCV treatment with DAAs in pregnancy revealed only one interventional study, which evaluated sofosbuvir/ledipasvir in 8 pregnant individuals. Given the paucity of research on this issue of great public health importance, we aimed to appraise the current landscape of HCV research/treatment and analyze the ethical considerations for responsibly including pregnant individuals. We propose that pregnancy may be an opportune time to offer HCV treatment given improved access, motivation, and other health care monitoring occurring in the antenatal period. Moreover, treatment of pregnant individuals may support the goal of eliminating perinatal HCV transmission and overcome the established challenges with transitioning care after delivery. The exclusion of pregnant individuals without justification denies them and their offspring access to potential health benefits, raising justice concerns considering growing data on DAA safety and global efforts to promote equitable and comprehensive HCV eradication. Finally, we propose a path forward for research and treatment programs during pregnancy to help advance the goal of HCV elimination.","Jhaveri, Ravi; Yee, Lynn M; Antala, Swati; Murphy, Margaret; Grobman, William A; Shah, Seema K",Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.31825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743550/,68

With the increase in air pollution due to different potential sources, pollution monitoring stations are deployed across the nation with sophisticated analytical methodologies. However, phytoplankton can also serve as an indicator of air pollution as they possess the ability to absorb particulate contaminants. With previous studies on indicator species based on aquatic habitats, this study was carried out to comprehend the interaction between gaseous oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, particulate matter with diameter less than 10 and 2.5 μm (PM10, PM 2.5), with the population density, abundance and frequency of terrestrial epiphytic microalgae from residential and commercial areas of Chennai District, Tamil Nadu. There was a significant correlation between the members of Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Cyanophyceae with the abovementioned air pollutants. Cluster analysis, CCA and NMDS analysis were done to find the interaction pattern.

60997,Adhesive Dentistry: Understanding the Science and Achieving Clinical Success.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Exercise may exacerbate the adverse health effects of air pollution by increasing the inhalation of air pollutants. We investigated the combined effects of long-term exposure to fine particle matter (PM2.5) and habitual exercise on deaths from natural causes in Taiwan. METHODS We recruited 384 130 adults (aged ≥ 18 yr) with 842 394 medical examination records between 2001 and 2016, and followed all participants until May 31, 2019. We obtained vital data from the National Death Registry of Taiwan. We estimated PM2.5 exposure using a satellite-based spatiotemporal model, and collected information on exercise habits using a standard self-administered questionnaire. We analyzed the data using a Cox regression model with time-dependent covariates. RESULTS A higher level of habitual exercise was associated with a lower risk of death from natural causes, compared with inactivity (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.88 for the moderate exercise group; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68 for the high exercise groups), whereas a higher PM2.5 exposure was associated with a higher risk of death from natural causes compared with lower exposure (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98-1.07, and HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.20, for the moderate and high PM2.5 exposure groups, respectively). Compared with inactive adults with high PM2.5 exposure, adults with high levels of habitual exercise and low PM2.5 exposure had a substantially lower risk of death from natural causes. We found a minor, but statistically significant, interaction effect between exercise and PM2.5 exposure on risk of death (HR 1.03 95% CI 1.01-1.06). Subgroup analyses, stratified by PM2.5 categories, suggested that moderate and high levels of exercise were associated with a lower risk of death in each PM2.5 stratum, compared with inactivity. INTERPRETATION Increased levels of exercise and reduced PM2.5 exposure are associated with a lower risk of death from natural causes. Habitual exercise can reduce risk regardless of the levels of PM2.5 exposure. Our results suggest that exercise is a safe health improvement strategy, even for people residing in relatively polluted regions.","Guo, Cui; Yu, Tsung; Chang, Ly-Yun; Lin, Changqing; Yang, Hsiao Ting; Bo, Yacong; Zeng, Yiqian; Tam, Tony; Lau, Alexis K H; Lao, Xiang Qian",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.202729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400482/,68

RESULTS Assessing the re-admission rate, among 47 patients evaluated prior to implementation of the protocol, seven (14.9%) were re-admitted, and when observing the 48 patients evaluated after implementation, one (2.1%) was re-admitted, showing statistical significance (p < 0.05). The chance of re-admission before the protocol was eight times the chance of hospitalization after implementation (95% CI: 1.01 to 377.7). By comparing the clinical complications among the groups, it was observed that there was a lower rate of complications following implementation of the protocol (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION The introduction of a multidisciplinary protocol to standardize the management of patients undergoing THA decreased the rates of rehospitalization and clinical complications after the procedure.","Barros, Antônio Augusto Guimarães; Mendes, Carlos Henrique Cardoso; Temponi, Eduardo Frois; Costa, Lincoln Paiva; Vassalo, Carlos Cesar; Guedes, Euler de Carvalho",Revista brasileira de ortopedia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rboe.2017.08.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28971083/,68

New strategies to prevent SSIs would thus have a huge impact, also in light of increasing global rates of antimicrobial drug resistance. Considering the indispensable role of innate immune cells in host defense in surgical wounds, enhancing their function may represent a potential strategy for prevention of SSIs. Trained immunity is characterized by metabolic, epigenetic, and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. These functional changes take place at multiple levels, namely, at the level of bone marrow precursors, circulating innate immune cells, and resident tissue macrophages. Experimental studies have shown that induction of trained immunity can protect against various infections. Increasing evidence suggests that it may also lower the risk and severity of SSIs. This may occur through several different mechanisms. First, trained immunity enhances local host defense against soft tissue infections, including those caused by Staphylococcus aureus, the most common cause of SSIs. Second, training effects on nonimmune cells such as fibroblasts have been shown to improve wound repair. Third, trained immunity may prevent or reverse the postoperative immunoparalysis that contributes to risk of infections following surgery. There are multiple approaches to inducing trained immunity, such as vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine, topical administration of β-glucan, or treatment with the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod. Clinical-experimental studies should establish if and how induction of trained immunity can best help prevent SSIs and what patient groups would most benefit.","Ter Steeg, Lieke; Domínguez-Andrés, Jorge; Netea, Mihai G; Joosten, Leo A B; van Crevel, Reinout",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00049-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34585978/,68

Despite the severity in many endemic regions, clinically approved intervention targeting the virus remains unavailable. CD4+ T cells have been shown to mediate CHIKV-induced joint inflammation in mice. We demonstrate here that transfer of splenic CD4+ T cells from virus-infected C57BL/6 mice into virus-infected T cell receptor-deficient (TCR-/-) mice recapitulated severe joint pathology including inflammation, vascular leakages, subcutaneous edema, and skeletal muscle necrosis. Proteome-wide screening identified dominant CD4+ T cell epitopes in nsP1 and E2 viral antigens. Transfer of nsP1- or E2-specific primary CD4+ T cell lines into CHIKV-infected TCR-/- recipients led to severe joint inflammation and vascular leakage. This pathogenic role of virus-specific CD4+ T cells in CHIKV infections led to the assessment of clinically approved T cell-suppressive drugs for disease intervention. Although drugs targeting interleukin-2 pathway were ineffective, treatment with fingolimod, an agonist of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor, successfully abrogated joint pathology in CHIKV-infected animals by blocking the migration of CD4+ T cells into the joints without any effect on viral replication. These results set the stage for further clinical evaluation of fingolimod in the treatment of CHIKV-induced joint pathologies.","Teo, Teck-Hui; Chan, Yi-Hao; Lee, Wendy W L; Lum, Fok-Moon; Amrun, Siti Naqiah; Her, Zhisheng; Rajarethinam, Ravisankar; Merits, Andres; Rötzschke, Olaf; Rénia, Laurent; Ng, Lisa F P",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aal1333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28148838/,68

The focus is on studies that assessed the effectiveness of ultraviolet (UV) light devices, hydrogen peroxide systems, and self-disinfecting surfaces to reduce healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). RECENT FINDINGS The contaminated surface environment in hospitals plays an important role in the transmission of several key nosocomial pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., Clostridium difficile, Acinetobacter spp., and norovirus. Multiple clinical trials have now demonstrated the effectiveness of UV light devices and hydrogen peroxide systems to reduce HAIs. A limited number of studies have suggested that 'self-disinfecting' surfaces may also decrease HAIs. SUMMARY Many studies have demonstrated that terminal cleaning and disinfection with germicides is often inadequate and leaves environmental surfaces contaminated with important nosocomial pathogens. 'No touch' methods of room decontamination (i.e., UV devices and hydrogen peroxide systems) have been demonstrated to reduce key nosocomial pathogens on inoculated test surfaces and on environmental surfaces in actual patient rooms. Further UV devices and hydrogen peroxide systems have been demonstrated to reduce HAI. A validated 'no touch' device or system should be used for terminal room disinfection following discharge of patients on contact precautions. The use of a 'self-disinfecting' surface to reduce HAI has not been convincingly demonstrated.","Weber, David J; Kanamori, Hajime; Rutala, William A",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27257798/,68

In a sense, consumers believe that if sugar does not appear as an ingredient on the product label, but is intrinsic in the food (and will appear as a nutrient), it is 'good'. As an ingredient, however, it is viewed as a 'bad chemical' associated with tooth decay and obesity. The reality is that unless processing induced modifications have occurred, the sugar molecule within a plant tissue is the same molecule structure as present in purified sugar. The same calorific value. However, there is an argument that humans eat too refined food and that if sugars were eaten in their natural context (e.g. within a fruit), their presence and concentration would be in harmony (where different nutrients complement and balance the sugar concentration) with the human body. This reflects the process of eating, satiety, presence of other nutrients (including water) and the associated impact of the indigestible components of plant foods on the transit/nutrient bioavailability control and thus benefits through the gut. The authors explore these issues in this article and seek to provide a scientific basis to different sides of the argument - sugar is good or bad depending on how (in which format and how much/how concentrated) it is consumed. More importantly perhaps, how should sugar consumption - an important nutrient - can be managed to optimise the benefits but reduce the disadvantages? This article is protected by copyright.

However, the growing pace of scientific publications across disciplines makes it increasingly difficult to stay abreast of research literature. Natural language processing (NLP) methods are emerging as a valuable strategy for conducting content analyses of academic literature. We sought to apply NLP to identify publication trends in the journal Implementation Science, including key topic clusters and the distribution of topics over time. A parallel study objective was to demonstrate how NLP can be used in research synthesis. METHODS We examined 1711 Implementation Science abstracts published from February 22, 2006, to October 1, 2020. We retrieved the study data using PubMed's Application Programming Interface (API) to assemble a database. Following standard preprocessing steps, we use topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to cluster the abstracts following a minimization algorithm. RESULTS We examined 30 topics and computed topic model statistics of quality. Analyses revealed that published articles largely reflect (i) characteristics of research, or (ii) domains of practice. Emergent topic clusters encompassed key terms both salient and common to implementation science. HIV and stroke represent the most commonly published clinical areas. Systematic reviews have grown in topic prominence and coherence, whereas articles pertaining to knowledge translation (KT) have dropped in prominence since 2013. Articles on HIV and implementation effectiveness have increased in topic exclusivity over time. DISCUSSION We demonstrated how NLP can be used as a synthesis and translation method to identify trends and topics across a large number of (over 1700) articles. With applicability to a variety of research domains, NLP is a promising approach to accelerate the dissemination and uptake of research literature. For future research in implementation science, we encourage the inclusion of more equity-focused studies to expand the impact of implementation science on disadvantaged communities.","Scaccia, Jonathan P; Scott, Victoria C",Implementation science : IS,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-021-01120-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33902657/,68

During obesity, the adipose tissue undergoes immunometabolic and functional transformation. Adipose tissue inflammation is driven by innate and adaptive immune cells and instigates insulin resistance. Here, we discuss the role of innate immune cells, that is, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, natural killer cells, innate lymphoid type 2 cells, dendritic cells, and mast cells, in the adipose tissue in the healthy (lean) and diseased (obese) state and describe how their function is shaped by the obesogenic microenvironment, and humoral, paracrine, and cellular interactions. Moreover, we particularly outline the role of hypoxia as a central regulator in adipose tissue inflammation. Finally, we discuss the long-lasting effects of adipose tissue inflammation and its potential reversibility through drugs, caloric restriction, or exercise training.","Michailidou, Zoi; Gomez-Salazar, Mario; Alexaki, Vasileia Ismini",Journal of innate immunity,https://doi.org/10.1159/000515117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849008/,68
62783,Modern technical approaches in resectional hepatic surgery.,2015,"The assessment of human spatial short-term memory has mainly been performed using visual stimuli and less frequently using auditory stimuli. This paper presents a framework for the development of SLAM-based Augmented Reality applications for the assessment of spatial memory. An AR mobile application was developed for this type of assessment involving visual and tactile stimuli by using our framework. The task to be carried out with the AR application is divided into two phases: 1) a learning phase, in which participants physically walk around a room and have to remember the location of simple geometrical shapes; and 2) an evaluation phase, in which the participants are asked to recall the location of the shapes. A study for comparing the performance outcomes using visual and tactile stimuli was carried out. Fifty-three participants performed the task using the two conditions (Tactile vs Visual), but with more than two months of difference (within-subject design). The number of shapes placed correctly was similar for both conditions. However, the group that used the tactile stimulus spent significantly more time completing the task and required significantly more attempts. The performance outcomes were independent of gender. Some significant correlations among variables related to the performance outcomes and other tests were found. The following significant correlations among variables related to the performance outcomes using visual stimuli and the participants' subjective variables were also found: 1) the greater the number of correctly placed shapes, the greater the perceived competence; 2) the more attempts required, the less the perceived competence. We also found that perceived enjoyment was higher when a higher sense of presence was induced.

63345,Outcome of negative-pressure wound therapy for open abdomen treatment after nontraumatic lower gastrointestinal surgery: analysis of factors affecting delayed fascial closure in 101 patients.,2014,"BACKGROUND Although indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging has been reported to be useful for assessing colorectal perfusion, unstable quantification remains an issue. We performed ICG fluorescence observation from the luminal side and examined the usefulness of the transanal approach. METHODS A total of 69 patients who underwent left-side colon surgery were enrolled in this cohort study. After the anastomosis had been constructed, ICG 0.2 mg/kg was injected intravenously. The anastomotic site was then observed by a scope inserted transanally. The following items were examined in the areas of the anastomotic site with the highest- and lowest-fluorescence intensity: maximum fluorescence (Fmax), time from ICG injection to Fmax (Tmax), time from start of dyeing to Fmax (ΔT), and the contrast pattern of the mucosa. RESULTS Anastomotic leakage (AL) occurred in nine cases. Tmax and ΔT values of the lowest-fluorescence area in the distal intestine showed significant differences in the cases with AL (P = 0.015 and P = 0.040, respectively). Regarding the contrast pattern of the mucosa of the lowest-fluorescence area in the proximal and distal intestine, the patients in whom the vessels were not depicted in the area had a significantly higher incidence of AL than those in whom vessels were depicted in the area (P = 0.031 and P = 0.030, respectively). Some of the areas in which vessels were not depicted by ICG fluorescence observation from the luminal side corresponded to the points of leakage. There were heterogeneous changes that might not be grasped by observation from the serosal side. CONCLUSION Transanal ICG fluorescence imaging can evaluate perfusion over the entire circumference of the anastomosis in detail and aid in assessing the risk of AL. Therefore, the examination of the detailed low-perfusion area enables us to take measures for AL and to search for safer operative managements.","Amagai, Hiroyuki; Miyauchi, Hideaki; Muto, Yorihiko; Uesato, Masaya; Ohira, Gaku; Imanishi, Shunsuke; Maruyama, Tetsuro; Tochigi, Toru; Okada, Koichiro; Maruyama, Michihiro; Matsubara, Hisahiro",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07315-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31820154/,68
63649,Development and Validation of a New Nomogram for Predicting Clinically Relevant Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula After Pancreatoduodenectomy.,2020-09-08,"BACKGROUND To date, laparoscopic caudate lobectomy (LCB) remains a challenge, and evidence about its value is rare. Therefore, this study was performed to assess the benefits of LCB for patients with tumours located in the caudate lobe compared with open caudate lobectomy (OCB). METHODS From October 2015 to June 2019, 102 patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were eligible for this study. The patients were divided into LCB and OCB groups. Short-term outcomes between the groups were compared with propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS LCB was performed in 31 of the 102 included patients. After PSM, 30 patients with well-balanced baseline levels were enrolled in each group. Intraoperative blood loss in the LCB group was less than that in the OCB group (median, 100 versus 200 mL, P = 0.017), even though it did not reach a statistically significant difference after PSM (median, 100 versus 187.5 mL, P = 0.085). Moreover, although post-operative overall complications were similar in the two groups, a tendency of lower rates of respiratory infection in the LCB group than the OCB group was observed (0% versus 12.7%, P = 0.054 before PSM; 0% versus 16.7%, P = 0.063 after PSM). There was no early mortality in either group. LCB had a shorter post-operative hospital stay than OCB (median, 5 versus 6 days, P < 0.001). However, the hospitalization cost was higher in the LCB group than in the OCB group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION LCB is safe and feasible in selected patients when performed by experienced surgeons.","Peng, Yufu; Liu, Fei; Xu, Hongwei; Guo, Suqi; Wei, Yonggang; Li, Bo",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.16512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33377587/,68

METHODS Between March 29 and May, 2020, the words COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, COVID-19 and pregnancy, SARS-CoV2 and pregnancy, and SARS and pregnancy were searched in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases; the guidelines from well-known societies and institutions (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [RCOG], American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology [ISUOG], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO]) were also included. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in a pandemic with > 3.3 million cases and 230 thousand deaths until May 2nd. It is caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus and may lead to severe pulmonary infection and multi-organ failure. Past experiences show that unique characteristics in pregnancy make pregnant women more susceptible to complications from viral infections. Yet, this has not been reported with this new virus. There are risk factors that seem to increase morbidity in pregnancy, such as obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 35), asthma and cardiovascular disease. Current reports describe an increased rate of preterm birth and C-section. Vertical transmission is still a possibility, due to a few reported cases of neonatal positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasal swab, amniotic fluid, and positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) in neonatal blood. Treatments must be weighed in with caution due to the lack of quality trials that prove their effectiveness and safety during pregnancy. Medical staff must use personal protective equipment in handling SARS-CoV2 suspected or positive patients and be alert for respiratory decompensations.","Czeresnia, Ricardo Mamber; Trad, Ayssa Teles Abrao; Britto, Ingrid Schwach Werneck; Negrini, Romulo; Nomura, Marcelo Luís; Pires, Pedro; Costa, Fabricio da Silva; Nomura, Roseli Mieko Yamamoto; Ruano, Rodrigo",Revista brasileira de ginecologia e obstetricia : revista da Federacao Brasileira das Sociedades de Ginecologia e Obstetricia,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1715137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32992359/,68

The aim of this retrospective study was to compare endovascular treatment and outcome in AIS patients with and without underlying stenosis of the M1 segment. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 533 acute stroke patients with an isolated M1 occlusion who underwent mechanical thrombectomy between 02/2010 and 08/2017 were included. Underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) was present in 10 patients (1.9%), whereas 523 patients (98.1%) had an embolic occlusion without stenosis. RESULTS There was no difference in age, admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, risk factors, Alberta stroke program early CT score or collaterals between the groups. Procedure time (155 vs 40 min, P = 0.001) was significantly longer in the ICAS group where rescue stent-angioplasty was performed in all patients. There was no statistical difference in final modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score between both groups (70 vs 88%, P = 0.115). Favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2) at 90 days was less frequent in patients with ICAS than in the embolic group (0 vs 49.4%, P = 0.004). The mortality rate tended to be higher in the ICAS group (44.4 vs 19.4%, P = 0.082). CONCLUSION In patients with AIS, rescue therapy with stent placement to treat underlying ICAS of the M1 segment is technically feasible; however, in our study, a significantly lower rate of favorable outcome was observed in these patients compared to those with thromboembolic M1 occlusions.

64642,Determination of impurities in heparin by capillary electrophoresis using high molarity phosphate buffers.,2009,"Women who are overweight or obese have increased health risks during and beyond pregnancy, with consequences for their infants' shorter and longer-term health. Exclusive breastfeeding to six months has many benefits for women and their infants. However, women who are overweight or obese have lower rates of breastfeeding intention, initiation and duration compared to women with normal weight. This systematic review aimed to examine evidence of i) breastfeeding barriers and support experienced and perceived by women who are overweight or obese, ii) support shown to be effective in increasing breastfeeding initiation and duration among these women, and iii) perceptions of healthcare professionals, peer supporters, partners and family members regarding providing breastfeeding support to these women. Sixteen quantitative and qualitative papers were included and critically appraised. Thematic synthesis was undertaken to obtain findings. Maternal physical barriers such as larger breasts, difficulties of positioning to breastfeed, delayed onset of lactation, perceived insufficient supply of breast milk, and impact of caesarean birth were evident. Maternal psychological barriers including low confidence in ability to breastfeed, negative body image, embarrassment at breastfeeding in public and experiencing stigma of obesity were also described. Support from healthcare professionals and family members influenced breastfeeding outcomes. Education for maternity care professionals is needed to enable them to provide tailored, evidence-based support to women who are overweight or obese who want to breastfeed. Research on healthcare professionals, partners and family members' experiences and views on supporting this group of women to breastfeed is needed to support development of appropriate interventions.","Chang, Yan-Shing; Glaria, Amaia Artazcoz; Davie, Philippa; Beake, Sarah; Bick, Debra",Maternal & child nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.12865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240826/,68

Scientists measure trace elements in environmental media in order to assess the quality and safety of ecosystems and to quantify the burden of anthropogenic pollution. Among the available analytical techniques, X-ray based methods are particularly powerful, as they can quantify trace elements in situ. Chemical extraction is not required, as is the case for many other analytical techniques. In the last few years, the potential for X-ray techniques to be applied in the environmental sciences has dramatically increased due to developments in laboratory instruments and synchrotron radiation facilities with improved sensitivity and spatial resolution. In this report, we summarize the principles of the X-ray based analytical techniques most frequently employed to study trace elements in environmental samples. We report on the most recent developments in laboratory and synchrotron techniques, as well as advances in instrumentation, with a special attention on X-ray sources, detectors, and optics.

64994,Measuring Error Identification and Recovery Skills in Surgical Residents.,2017,"BACKGROUND Polypharmacy is an important challenge in clinical practice. We aimed at determining the effect of polypharmacy on functional outcome and treatment effect of alteplase in acute ischemic stroke. METHODS Post-hoc analysis of the randomized, placebo-controlled WAKE-UP trial of MRI-guided intravenous alteplase in unknown onset stroke. Polypharmacy was defined as intake of ≥5 medications at baseline. Comorbidities were assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The primary efficacy variable was favorable outcome defined by a score of 0-1 on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. We used logistic regression analysis to test for an association of polypharmacy with functional outcome, and for interaction of polypharmacy and the effect of thrombolysis. RESULTS Polypharmacy was present in 133/503 (26%) patients. Patients with polypharmacy were older (mean age 70 vs 64 years; P<0.0001) and had a higher score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at baseline (median 7 vs 5; P=0.0007). A comorbidity load defined by a CCI score ≥2 was more frequent in patients with polypharmacy (48% vs 8%; P<0.001). Polypharmacy was associated with lower odds of favorable outcome (adjusted odds ratio 0.50, 95% CI, 0.30-0.85; P=0.0099), while the CCI score was not. Treatment with alteplase was associated with higher odds of favorable outcome in both groups, with no heterogeneity of treatment effect (test for interaction of treatment and polypharmacy, P=0.29). CONCLUSION In stroke patients, polypharmacy is associated with worse functional outcome after intravenous thrombolysis independent of comorbidities. However, polypharmacy does not interact with the beneficial effect of alteplase.","Jensen, Märit; Boutitie, Florent; Cheng, Bastian; Cho, Tae-Hee; Ebinger, Martin; Endres, Matthias; Fiebach, Jochen B; Fiehler, Jens; Ford, Ian; Galinovic, Ivana; Königsberg, Alina; Puig, Josep; Roy, Pascal; Wouters, Anke; Thijs, Vincent; Lemmens, Robin; Muir, Keith W; Nighoghossian, Norbert; Pedraza, Salvador; Simonsen, Claus Z; Gerloff, Christian; Thomalla, Götz",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015924/,68

However, the strength of the conclusions drawn from individual studies in the current literature may be constrained by the small sample size of each trial. Following a systematic literature retrieval of studies, meta-analyses were conducted by pooling the standardized mean differences (SMDs) using random-effects models to assess the efficacy of tDCS on cerebellar ataxia, measured by standard clinical rating scales. Domain-specific effects of tDCS on gait and hand function were further evaluated based on 8-m walk and 9-hole peg test performance times, respectively. To determine the safety of tDCS, the incidences of adverse effects were analyzed using risk differences. Out of 293 citations, 5 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 72 participants with cerebellar ataxia were included. Meta-analysis indicated a 26.1% (p = 0.003) improvement in ataxia immediately after tDCS with sustained efficacy over months (28.2% improvement after 3 months, p = 0.04) when compared with sham stimulation. tDCS seems to be domain-specific as the current analysis suggested a positive effect on gait (16.3% improvement, p = 0.04) and failed to reveal differences for hand function (p = 0.10) with respect to sham. The incidence of adverse events in tDCS and sham groups was similar. tDCS is an effective intervention for mitigating ataxia symptoms with lasting results that can be sustained for months. This treatment shows preferential effects on gait ataxia and is relatively safe.","Chen, Tiffany X; Yang, Chen-Ya; Willson, Gloria; Lin, Chih-Chun; Kuo, Sheng-Han",Cerebellum,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12311-020-01181-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32833224/,68

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant medication, supply and equipment, and provider shortages, limiting the resources available for provision of surgical care. In response to mandates restricting surgery to high-acuity procedures during this period, our institution developed a multidisciplinary Low-Resource Operating Room (LROR) Taskforce in April 2020. This study describes our institutional experience developing an LROR to maintain access to urgent surgical procedures during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. A delineation of available resources and resource replacement strategies was conducted, and a final institution-wide plan for operationalizing the LROR was formed. Specialty-specific subgroups then convened to determine best practices and opportunities for LROR utilization. Orthopedic surgery performed in the LROR using wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT) is presented as a use case. Results. Overall, 19 limited resources were identified, spanning across the domains of physical space, drugs, devices and equipment, and personnel. Based on the assessment, the decision to proceed with creation of an LROR was made. Sixteen urgent orthopedic surgeries were successfully performed using WALANT without conversion to general anesthesia. Conclusion. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a LROR was successfully designed and operationalized. The process for development of a LROR and recommended strategies for operating in a resource-constrained environment may serve as a model for other institutions and facilitate rapid implementation of this care model should the need arise in future pandemic or disaster situations.","Turcotte, Justin J; Gelfand, Jeffrey M; Jones, Christopher M; Jackson, Rubie S",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/15533506211003530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780646/,68

In addition, waterborne MS2 viruses were directly subjected to the APCP treatment for up to 3 min. MS2 viruses with and without the APCP exposure were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Viral inactivation was shown to exhibit linear relationships with the APCP generation power and exposure time (R(2) > 0.95 for all energy levels tested) up to 95% inactivation (1.3-log reduction) after a subsecond airborne exposure at 28 W; about the same inactivation level was achieved for waterborne viruses with an exposure time of less than 1 min. A larger amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as atomic oxygen, in APCP was detected for a higher generation power with Ar-O2 and He-O2 gas carriers.

As meat lipid repercussions on human health depend on their fatty acid (FA) profile, this study aimed at analysing the individual FA at weaning and at the end of the feeding finishing period, especially trans and cis 18:1 isomers in total lipids of the Longissimus thoracis muscle in GB male calves. Distribution of main FA in veal lipids was characterized by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis on a high polar glass capillary column. Total trans and cis 18:1 isomers were purified, from total FA (TFA) methyl esters, by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, to allow subsequent specific analysis of their different isomers by GLC. Calves stayed with their mothers at pasture for 2 or 5 months in intensive or semi-extensive systems, followed by an indoor feeding period. The weaned (W) group was finished on concentrate and hay, whereas the non-weaned (NW) group was finished on concentrate and hay and it continued suckling until slaughter. The studied effects did not present interactions. The duration of the indoor finishing period hardly had a significant influence on the parameters analysed. Compared to W calves, NW calves had higher proportions (% TFA) of 18:3n-3 (+38%, P < 0.0001), 20:5n-3 (+22%, P = 0.005), 22:5n-3 (+13%, P = 0.042), cis monounsaturated FA (MUFA; +8%, P = 0.032), total MUFA (+8%, P = 0.013), n-3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA; +25%, P = 0.0001) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; +48%, P < 0.0001) to the detriment of 18:0 (-10%, P = 0.002), 18:2n-6 (-25%, P = 0.004) and n-6 PUFA (-20%, P = 0.011).

We retrospectively studied whether the admission serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) can serve as nearly predictor of disease severity during COVID-19 infection in comparison with other hematologic and inflammatory markers. Methods We included all consecutive patients who were admitted in Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco, between February to April 2020, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection using SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid via RT-PCR. The complete blood count and serum CRP level were routinely measured on admission. All clinical and laboratory data of patients were collected and analyzed. The classification of the disease severity was in accordance with the clinical classification of the WHO interim guidance, and the management of patients were adapted to the national management guideline. We estimated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of blood routine parameters as well as their association with COVID-19 disease severity. Results 145 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. The median age (range) was 50 (32-63) years, and 75 (51.7%) were men. 101 patients were classified in the non-severe group and 44 patients in the severe group. Based on disease severity, significant differences were observed in the age, gender, comorbidities, and respiratory symptom. Similarly, the biological analysis found significant differences for the neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, and CRP level. However, according to ROC curves of these laboratory biomarkers, the AUC of CRP at 0.872 was significantly higher than all other parameters. Further, CRP was independently associated with severity of COVID-19 disease (OR = 1.11, 95% IC (1.01-1.22) and or = 1.13, 95% IC (1.04-1.23)). Conclusions This study found that the CRP level at admission represent a simple and independent factor that can be useful for early detection of severity during COVID-19 and the easy guidance of primary care.","Ahnach, Maryame; Zbiri, Saad; Nejjari, Sara; Ousti, Fadwa; Elkettani, Chafik",Journal of medical biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.5937/jomb0-27554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312067/,68

Here, we report the broad-spectrum activity against HCMV of isavuconazole (ICZ), a new extended-spectrum triazolic antifungal drug. ICZ inhibited the replication of clinical isolates of HCMV as well as strains resistant to the currently available DNA polymerase inhibitors. The antiviral activity of ICZ against HCMV could be linked to the inhibition of human cytochrome P450 51 (hCYP51), an enzyme whose activity we previously demonstrated to be required for productive HCMV infection. Moreover, time-of-addition studies indicated that ICZ might have additional inhibitory effects during the first phase of HCMV replication. Importantly, ICZ showed synergistic antiviral activity in vitro when administered in combination with different approved anti-HCMV drugs at clinically relevant doses. Together, these results pave the way to possible future clinical studies aimed at evaluating the repurposing potential of ICZ in the treatment of HCMV-associated diseases.","Mercorelli, Beatrice; Celegato, Marta; Luganini, Anna; Gribaudo, Giorgio; Lepesheva, Galina I; Loregian, Arianna",Antiviral research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2021.105062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33722615/,68

This paper evaluates the design and progress of the report to mid 2020, but with some reflection on the new COVID 19 era, particularly as it relates to the expansion of entitlements to achieve UHC. The authors explore how close Sláintecare is to the UHC ideal. They also review the phased strategy of implementation in Sláintecare that utilises a systems-thinking approach with interlinkages between entitlements, funding, capacity and implementation. Finally the authors review the Sláintecare milestones against the reality of implementation since the publication of the report in 2017, cognisant of government policy and practice. Some of the initial assumptions around the context of Sláintecare were not realised and there has been limited progress made toward expanding entitlements, and certainly short of the original plan. Nevertheless there have been positive developments in that there is evidence that Government's Implementation Strategy and Action Plans are focussing on reforming a complex adaptive system rather than implementing a blueprint with such initiatives as integrated care pilots and citizen engagement. The authors find that this may help the system change but it risks losing some of the essential elements of entitlement expansion in favour of organisational change.","Thomas, Steve; Johnston, Bridget; Barry, Sarah; Siersbaek, Rikke; Burke, Sara",Health policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2021.01.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531170/,68

OBJECTIVE To present some technical considerations about children undergoing laparoscopic ileal-J-pouch anorectal anastomosis. SETTINGS AND PATIENTS All patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing laparoscopic ileal-J-pouch anorectal anastomosis were evaluated from January 2006 to February 2011. INTERVENTION The new technical innovations herein are (1) total laparoscopic approach, (2) a very short 3-cm J-pouch ileal reservoir created outside the stoma incision, (3) preservation of the entire anal canal and the Knight-Griffen double stapled anastomosis, less than 3 cm from the dentate line, (4) use of a Multiple Instrument Access Port system in the stoma skin incision to reduce the number of port site incisions and (5) proctectomy performed using only an electrosurgical vessels sealing device thus avoiding clips to close rectal pedicle. RESULTS Seventeen laparoscopic ileo J-pouch low rectal anastomosis were performed by the same surgical staff. Three complications occurred postoperatively: one bowel obstruction, one ileostomy prolapse, and one anastomotic stricture. Satisfactory functional results were achieved in all, there was no significant perineal excoriation and quality of life was excellent. CONCLUSIONS A Multiport Instrument Access Port placed in the stoma site allowed the use of more instruments through a single incision. The very short ileo J-pouch low rectal anastomosis has been shown to be a safe, feasible, and effective reconstructive procedure.","Mattioli, Girolamo; Guida, Edoardo; Pini-Prato, Alessio; Avanzini, Stefano; Rossi, Valentina; Barabino, Arrigo; Coran, Arnold G; Jasonni, Vincenzo",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-011-3030-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22127486/,68

71660,Intrathoracic Pressure Regulation Augments Stroke Volume and Ventricular Function in Human Hemorrhage.,2015,"BACKGROUND Administration of ε-aminocaproic acid (εACA), as adjuvant therapy following incompletely embolized cranial dural arteriovenous (dAVFs) and direct carotid artery to cavernous sinus fistulae (CCFs), is a strategy to promote post-procedural thrombosis. However, the efficacy of εACA to treat incompletely obliterated dAVFs and CCFs has not been published. The purpose of this study was to determine if administration of εACA following incomplete embolization of cranial dAVFs or CCFs was associated with an increased likelihood of cure on follow-up imaging compared with patients not given adjuvant εACA. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was performed. All patients who underwent treatment of a dAVF or CCF at our institution between 1998 and 2016 were reviewed (n=262). Patients with residual shunting following the first attempted endovascular embolization were included in the analysis (n=52). The study groups were those treated with εACA following incomplete obliteration of the fistula and those who were not. The primary outcome was obliteration of the fistula on initial follow-up imaging. Complication rates between cohorts were compared. RESULTS 20 (38%) patients with incompletely obliterated fistulae were treated with adjuvant εACA. A trend towards an improved rate of complete obliteration on initial follow-up imaging was observed in the group treated with εACA (55% vs 34% in the group not treated with εACA, p=0.14). No difference in clinical outcomes or thromboembolic complications was observed between the groups. CONCLUSIONS In summary, these data suggest that administration of εACA is a safe adjuvant therapy in the management of cranial dAVFs and CCFs that are incompletely treated endovascularly.","Howard, Brian M; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Prater, Adam; Cawley, C Michael; Dion, Jacques E; Tong, Frank C",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29021312/,68

71847,Recent Advances on Synthetic and Polysaccharide Adhesives for Biological Hemostatic Applications.,2020,"INTRODUCTION Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is often observed in critically ill patients. In most affected patients OD persists throughout hospital stay and negatively impacts on clinical outcomes. Here we systematically explore routine clinical practice standards for recognition/screening, diagnosis and treatment of OD in accredited Swiss ICUs. METHODS An online, 23-item questionnaire-based survey was performed to investigate current standards of care for OD in Switzerland (DICE). All (n = 49) accredited Swiss teaching hospitals providing specialist training for adult intensive care medicine were contacted. Senior intensivists were interviewed on how they would screen for, diagnose and treat OD in the ICU. RESULTS The total response rate was 75.5%, with information available on all tertiary care academic centres. 67.6% (25/37) of institutions stated that they have established standard operating procedures for OD using a mostly sequential diagnostic approach (86.5%, 32/37). In 75.7% (28/37) of institutions, OD confirmation is performed without the use of instrumental techniques such as flexible (or fibre-endoscopic) evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Presumed key risk factors for OD were admission for acute neurological illness, long-term mechanical ventilation, ICU-acquired weakness and pre-existing neurological disease. Reported presumed OD-related complications typically include aspiration-induced pneumonia, increased rates of both reintubation and tracheostomy and increased ICU readmission rates. CONCLUSIONS Many Swiss ICUs have established standard operating procedures, with most using sequential clinical approaches to assess ICU patients at risk of dysphagia. OD confirmation is mostly performed using non-instrumental techniques. In general, it appears that awareness of OD and ICU educational curricula can be further optimised.","Zuercher, Patrick; Moret, Céline; Schefold, Joerg C",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2019.20111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330036/,68

It is a cross-sectional study conducted with a sample of 3,477 participants of the telephone survey of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-COVID-19 initiative), who reported going out of the home in the past week. The adherence was based on the frequency of leaving the house, the need to venture outside the home, use of masks, and sanitization of hands. Statistical analysis was based on the Poisson model with robust variance. Predisposing factors for severe forms of COVID-19 included age ≥65 years, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Social support included living arrangements and social distancing during the pandemic. Approximately 46% of the participants showed higher adherence, which was positively associated with the number of predisposing factors for severe forms of COVID-19. Social support was not associated with adherence, nor was this association modified after adjustments. The conclusion drawn is that higher adherence is concentrated among the elderly with greater predisposition to severe forms of COVID-19, irrespective of social support, albeit preventive measures should be adopted by all.","Ygnatios, Nair Tavares Milhem; Andrade, Fabíola Bof de; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda; Torres, Juliana Lustosa",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232021265.00822021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34076127/,68

This study aimed to identify the mechanism of circRNA_0043691 in regulating the progression of GC. GSE141977 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omibus ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ). Differentially expressed circRNAs were obtained by R software. The expression levels of circRNA_0043691 in GC tissue and normal tissue were identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Knockdown of circRNA_0043691 was then constructed and verified by qRT-PCR. Cell viability, migration, and invasion capacity were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, Transwell migration, and invasion, respectively. Next, knockdown of miR-873-3p was constructed and co-cultured with circRNA_0043691 knockdown to identify whether knockdown of miR-873-3p could attenuate the circRNA_0043691 knockdown on GC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion. The relationship between miR-873-3p and circRNA_0043691 or GART was predicted by bioinformatics tools and verified by dual-luciferase reporter. A total of 211 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed, including 143 remarkably downregulated circRNAs and 68 significantly upregulated circRNAs. CircRNA_0043691 was upregulated in GC tissue. Knockdown of circRNA_0043691 decreased cell viability, migration, and invasion in GC cells. CircRNA_0043691 has potential putative binding sites with miR-873-3p. Moreover, CircRNA_0043691 positively regulated GART expression by sponging miR-873-3p. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-591 could partially attenuate the si-circRNA_0043691 on the GART expression. GART was upregulated in GC tissue and knockdown of GART could inhibit GC cells proliferation and invasion. Knockdown of circRNA_0043691 delayed the progression of GC via modulating the miR-873-3p-GART axis.","Zhang, Yu; Hu, Gengyuan; Zhang, Zhenxing; Jing, Yuanming; Tao, Feng; Ye, Minfeng",Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00335-021-09900-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370061/,68

Outbreaks can occur in kenneled dog populations and result in significant levels of morbidity and mortality. This highly contagious disease is characterized by the sudden onset of clinical signs, including pyrexia, dyspnea, and hemorrhagic nasal discharge. The pathogenesis of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus infection in dogs is poorly understood. This study systematically characterized the histopathological changes in the lungs of 39 dogs from a large rehoming shelter in London, United Kingdom; the dogs were infected with S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. An objective scoring system demonstrated that S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus caused pneumonia in 26/39 (66.7%) dogs, and most of these dogs (17/26 [65.4%]) were classified as severe fibrino-suppurative, necrotizing, and hemorrhagic. Three recently described superantigen genes (szeF, szeN, and szeP) were detected by PCR in 17/47 (36.2%) of the S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus isolates; however, there was no association between the presence of these genes and the histopathological score. The lungs of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus-infected dogs with severe respiratory signs and lung pathology did however have significantly higher mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) than in uninfected controls, suggesting a role for an exuberant host immune response in the pathogenesis of this disease.","Priestnall, Simon L; Erles, Kerstin; Brooks, Harriet W; Cardwell, Jacqueline M; Waller, Andrew S; Paillot, Romain; Robinson, Carl; Darby, Alistair C; Holden, Matthew T G; Schöniger, Sandra",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.00188-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20861329/,68

Careless retraction of the cerebellum by a spatula could be the major cause of surgical complications. In our method, a patient is laid supine avoiding the complicated positioning. The subfloccular approach from a small cranial window sited on the more lateral and basal side of the occipital cranium enables the surgeon to reach all the segments of the facial nerve root without a spatula. We introduce our surgical procedures in detail along with our excellent results. Methods A total of 100 consecutive patients experiencing primary HFS were operated on with MVD by a single surgeon in our institution from August 2012 to April 2014. Results Overall, 94 patients showed the complete disappearance or a satisfactory alleviation of HFS. De novo neurologic deficits were not encountered after surgery including hearing impairment. In 47 cases, multiple offending vessels were observed in multiple possible affected sites in addition to the root entry/exit zone.

The search for newer and better vaccines for TB is an ongoing endeavor and latest results from trials of candidate TB vaccines such as M72AS01 look promising. However, recent encouraging data from BCG revaccination trials in adults combined with studies on mucosal and intravenous routes of BCG vaccination in non-human primate models have renewed interest in BCG for TB prevention. In addition, several well-demonstrated non-specific effects of BCG, for example, prevention of viral and respiratory infections, give BCG an added advantage. Also, BCG vaccination is currently being widely tested in human clinical trials to determine whether it protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or death with detailed analyses and outcomes from several ongoing trials across the world awaited. Through this review, we attempt to bring together information on various aspects of the BCG-induced immune response, its efficacy in TB control, comparison with other candidate TB vaccines and strategies to improve its efficiency including revaccination and alternate routes of administration.

Materials and methods An electronic survey was distributed globally to record the operational considerations to mitigate biosafety risks in the laboratory. Additionally, the laboratories were asked to indicate the operational challenges they faced. Results A total of 1210 valid submissions were included in this analysis. Most of the survey participants worked in hospital laboratories. Around 15% of laboratories restricted certain tests on patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19 over biosafety concerns. Just over 10% of the laboratories had to restrict their test menu or services due to resource constraints. Approximately a third of laboratories performed temperature monitoring, while two thirds of laboratories increased the frequency of disinfection. Just less than 50% of the laboratories split their teams. The greatest reported challenge faced by laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic is securing sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), analytical equipment, including those used at the point of care, as well as reagents, consumables and other laboratory materials. This was followed by having inadequate staff, managing their morale, anxiety and deployment.

75066,Contents list.,2021-01-21,"Rare Actinomycetes from underexplored marine environments are targeted in drug discovery studies due to the Actinomycetes' potentially huge resource of structurally diverse natural products with unusual biological activity. Of all marine bacteria, 10 % are Actinomycetes, which have proven an outstanding and fascinating resource for new and potent bioactive molecules. Past and present efforts in the isolation of rare Actinomycetes from underexplored diverse natural habitats have resulted in the isolation of about 220 rare Actinomycete genera of which more than 50 taxa have been reported to be the producers of 2,500 bioactive compounds. That amount represents greater than 25 % of the total Actinomycetes metabolites, demonstrating that selective isolation methods are being developed and extensively applied. Due to the high rediscovery rate of known compounds from Actinomycetes, a renewed interest in the development of new antimicrobial agents from rare and novel Actinomycetes is urgently required to combat the increasing number of multidrug-resistant human pathogens. To facilitate that discovery, this review updates all selective isolation media including pretreatment and enrichment methods for the isolation of marine rare Actinomycetes. In addition, this review demonstrates that discovering new compounds with novel scaffolds can be increased by intensive efforts in isolating and screening rare marine genera of Actinomycetes. Between 2007 and mid-2013, 80 new rare Actinomycete species were reported from marine habitats. They belong to 23 rare families, of which three are novel, and 20 novel genera. Of them, the family Micromonosporaceae is dominant as a producer of promising chemical diversity.","Subramani, Ramesh; Aalbersberg, William",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5229-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24057404/,68
75116,A meta-analysis comparing the outcomes of LigaSure Small Jaw versus clamp-and-tie technique or Harmonic Focus Scalpel in thyroidectomy.,2017,"BACKGROUND Food flavors are relatively low molecular weight chemicals with unique odor-related functional groups that may also be associated with mutagenicity. These chemicals are often difficult to test for mutagenicity by the Ames test because of their low production and peculiar odor. Therefore, application of the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach is being considered. We used the StarDrop™ Auto-Modeller™ to develop a new QSAR model. RESULTS In the first step, we developed a new robust Ames database of 406 food flavor chemicals consisting of existing Ames flavor chemical data and newly acquired Ames test data. Ames results for some existing flavor chemicals have been revised by expert reviews. We also collected 428 Ames test datasets for industrial chemicals from other databases that are structurally similar to flavor chemicals. A total of 834 chemicals' Ames test datasets were used to develop the new QSAR models. We repeated the development and verification of prototypes by selecting appropriate modeling methods and descriptors and developed a local QSAR model. A new QSAR model ""StarDrop NIHS 834_67"" showed excellent performance (sensitivity: 79.5%, specificity: 96.4%, accuracy: 94.6%) for predicting Ames mutagenicity of 406 food flavors and was better than other commercial QSAR tools. CONCLUSIONS A local QSAR model, StarDrop NIHS 834_67, was customized to predict the Ames mutagenicity of food flavor chemicals and other low molecular weight chemicals. The model can be used to assess the mutagenicity of food flavors without actual testing.","Kasamatsu, Toshio; Kitazawa, Airi; Tajima, Sumie; Kaneko, Masahiro; Sugiyama, Kei-Ichi; Yamada, Masami; Yasui, Manabu; Masumura, Kenichi; Horibata, Katsuyoshi; Honma, Masamitsu",Genes and environment : the official journal of the Japanese Environmental Mutagen Society,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41021-021-00182-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931133/,68

75369,Brachycephalic airway syndrome.,2013,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Agitation associated with schizophrenia remains an important clinical concern and if not managed effectively, can escalate into aggressive behavior. This is a review of the recent biomedical literature on agitation in individuals with schizophrenia. RECENT FINDINGS Themes in the recent literature include consideration of comorbidities such as cigarette smoking and cannabis use. Surveys reveal that pharmacological approaches to manage agitation have changed little, with haloperidol remaining in common use and intramuscular administration of antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepines being frequently administered to more severely agitated/aggressive individuals. Of note, ketamine has been recently adopted for use in severe agitation in medical emergency departments, but the risk of this medication for people with schizophrenia is unclear. At present, inhaled loxapine remains the only rapidly acting noninjectable FDA-approved treatment for agitation associated with schizophrenia. In development is an intranasal formulation for olanzapine (a well characterized atypical antipsychotic already approved to treat agitation) and a sublingual film for dexmedetomidine (an α2-adrenergic agonist used as an anesthetic and now being repurposed). SUMMARY Comorbidities can contribute to agitation and can make an accurate differential diagnosis challenging. The ongoing development of rapidly acting novel formulations of antiagitation medications, if successful, may facilitate clinical treatment by providing additional options.","Citrome, Leslie",Current opinion in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0000000000000685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33395103/,68
75606,Body adiposity index to analyze the percentage of fat in young men aged between 7 and 17 years.,2021-03-24,"Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a representative member of the New World alphaviruses. It is transmitted by mosquito vectors and causes highly debilitating disease in humans, equids, and other vertebrate hosts. Despite a continuous public health threat, very few compounds with anti-VEEV activity in cell culture and in mouse models have been identified to date, and rapid development of virus resistance to some of them has been recorded. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using a modified nucleoside analog, β-d-N 4-hydroxycytidine (NHC), as an anti-VEEV agent and defined the mechanism of its anti-VEEV activity. The results demonstrate that NHC is a very potent antiviral agent. It affects both the release of genome RNA-containing VEE virions and their infectivity. Both of these antiviral activities are determined by the NHC-induced accumulation of mutations in virus-specific RNAs. The antiviral effect is most prominent when NHC is applied early in the infectious process, during the amplification of negative- and positive-strand RNAs in infected cells. Most importantly, only a low-level resistance of VEEV to NHC can be developed, and it requires acquisition and cooperative function of more than one mutation in nsP4. These adaptive mutations are closely located in the same segment of nsP4. Our data suggest that NHC is more potent than ribavirin as an anti-VEEV agent and likely can be used to treat other alphavirus infections.IMPORTANCE Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) can cause widespread epidemics among humans and domestic animals. VEEV infections result in severe meningoencephalitis and long-term sequelae. No approved therapeutics exist for treatment of VEEV infections. Our study demonstrates that β-d-N 4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) is a very potent anti-VEEV compound, with the 50% effective concentration being below 1 μM. The mechanism of NHC antiviral activity is based on induction of high mutation rates in the viral genome. Accordingly, NHC treatment affects both the rates of particle release and the particle infectivity. Most importantly, in contrast to most of the anti-alphavirus drugs that are under development, resistance of VEEV to NHC develops very inefficiently. Even low levels of resistance require acquisition of multiple mutations in the gene of the VEEV-specific RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsP4.","Urakova, Nadya; Kuznetsova, Valeriya; Crossman, David K; Sokratian, Arpine; Guthrie, David B; Kolykhalov, Alexander A; Lockwood, Mark A; Natchus, Michael G; Crowley, Michael R; Painter, George R; Frolova, Elena I; Frolov, Ilya",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01965-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29167335/,68

Successful management of acute bacterial infections requires early diagnosis and treatment, which are not always easy to achieve. Structural imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are often applied to this problem. However, these methods generally rely on secondary inflammatory changes and are frequently not specific to infection. The use of nuclear medicine (NM) techniques can add crucial complementary information, allowing visualization of infectious pathophysiology beyond morphologic imaging. This review will discuss the current structural and functional imaging techniques used for the diagnosis of bacterial infection and their roles in different clinical scenarios. We will also present several new radiotracers in development, with an emphasis on probes targeting bacteria-specific metabolism. As highlighted by the current COVID-19 epidemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, similar thinking may apply in imaging viral pathogens; for this case prominent effects on host proteins most notably ACE2 might also provide worthwhile imaging targets.","Polvoy, Ilona; Flavell, Robert R; Ohliger, Michael; Rosenberg, Oren; Wilson, David M","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.120.244939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764120/,68

Design systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PEDRO, OpenGrey and ClinicalTrials.gov for observational studies of prognostic factors of functional outcome after hip fracture among surgically treated adults with mean age of 65 years and older. Study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were completed independently by two reviewers. The Quality in Prognosis Studies Tool was used for quality assessment and assigning a level of evidence to factors. Proposed mechanisms for reported associations were extracted from discussion sections. Results from 33 studies of 9,552 patients, we identified 25 prognostic factors of functional outcome after hip fracture surgery. We organised factors into groups: demographics, injury and comorbidities, body composition, complications, and acute care. We assigned two factors a weak evidence level-anaemia and cognition. We assigned Parkinson's disease an inconclusive evidence level. We could not assign an evidence level to the remaining 22 factors due to the high risk of bias across studies. Frailty was the proposed mechanism for the association between anaemia and functional outcome. Medication management, perceived potential, complications and time to mobility were proposed as mechanisms for the association between cognition and functional outcome. Conclusion we identified one modifiable and one immutable prognostic factor for functional outcomes after hip fracture surgery. Future research may target patients with anaemia or cognitive impairment by intervening on the prognostic factor or the underlying mechanisms.","Sheehan, K J; Williamson, L; Alexander, J; Filliter, C; Sobolev, B; Guy, P; Bearne, L M; Sackley, C",Age and ageing,https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afy057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668839/,68

METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Scopus for studies that examined any neurocognitive or behavioural outcomes in offspring of mothers with pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy in accordance with a published protocol (PROSPERO CRD42018109038). Title and abstract review, full-text review and data extraction were performed independently and in duplicate. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analyses of summary measures were performed using random-effects models. RESULTS Nineteen articles including at least 18,681 exposed and 2,856,688 control participants were identified for inclusion. Exposure to maternal pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy was associated with a lower pooled intelligence quotient in the offspring (pooled weighted mean difference -3.07 [95% CI -4.59, -1.55]; I2 = 0%) and an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders (effect estimate 1.98 [95% CI 1.46, 2.68]; I2 = 0%). There was also an increased risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (pooled HR 1.36 [95% CI 1.19, 1.55]; I2 = 0%), though this was based on only two studies. Although most studies were found to be high quality in terms of participant selection, in many studies, comparability of cohorts and adequacy of follow-up were sources of bias. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION There is evidence to suggest that in utero exposure to maternal pre-existing diabetes is associated with some adverse neurocognitive and behavioural outcomes. It remains unclear what the role of perinatal factors is and the degree to which other environmental factors contribute to these findings.","Yamamoto, Jennifer M; Benham, Jamie L; Dewey, Deborah; Sanchez, J Johanna; Murphy, Helen R; Feig, Denice S; Donovan, Lois E",Diabetologia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-019-4923-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278412/,68

77321,Accounting for Group-Specific Allele Effects and Admixture in Genomic Predictions: Theory and Experimental Evaluation in Maize.,2020-07-17,"BACKGROUND The Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (ILE) remains the procedure of choice for localized middle or lower esophageal carcinoma. Nevertheless, anastomotic leak remains a common complication with rates from 3% to 25% and a stricture rate as high as 40%. The frequency of these complications suggests that the procedure itself may have inherent limitations including the use of potentially ischemic tissue for the esophagogastric anastomosis. We introduce a modified technique that reduces operative steps, preserves blood supply, and uses a modified esophagogastric anastomosis. METHODS All consecutive patients undergoing ILE with the described modified technique were identified. An esophagram was performed on postoperative day six or seven. To ensure that all cases were identified, anastomotic leaks were defined as any radiographic evidence of contrast extravasation. RESULTS A total of 110 patients underwent the modified esophagectomy with 2 anastomotic leaks (1.82%) and zero strictures. There was 1 late death but no early deaths (<30 or 90 days) or early re-admissions (<30 days). The average number of risk factors was 2.12, and 98 patients (90%) had at least 1 risk factor in their medical history. CONCLUSIONS The modifications proposed simplify procedural steps, limit unnecessary dissection and introduce a technique that ends the practice of connecting ischemic tissue. We believe this technique contributes to surgical durability and reduces the rate of postoperative leak and eliminates stricture.","Housman, Brian; Lee, Dong-Seok; Wolf, Andrea; Nicastri, Daniel; Kaufman, Andrew; Rizk, Nabil; Housman, Arno; Song, Kimberly; Hakami, Ardeshir; Flores, Raja M",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.26550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081346/,68
77412,European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) as Vectors and Reservoirs of Pathogens Affecting Humans and Domestic Livestock.,2021-02-10,"Coronaviruses induce in infected cells the formation of replicative structures, consisting of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes, where viral RNA synthesis supposedly takes place and to which the nonstructural proteins (nsp's) localize. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the presumed intermediate in RNA synthesis, is localized to the DMV interior. However, as pores connecting the DMV interior with the cytoplasm have not been detected, it is unclear whether RNA synthesis occurs at these same sites. Here, we studied coronavirus RNA synthesis by feeding cells with a uridine analogue, after which nascent RNAs were detected using click chemistry. Early in infection, nascent viral RNA and nsp's colocalized with or occurred adjacent to dsRNA foci. Late in infection, the correlation between dsRNA dots, then found dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, and nsp's and nascent RNAs was less obvious. However, foci of nascent RNAs were always found to colocalize with the nsp12-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting viral RNA synthesis by using click chemistry and indicate that dsRNA dots do not necessarily correspond with sites of active viral RNA synthesis. Rather, late in infection many DMVs may harbor dsRNA molecules that are no longer functioning as intermediates in RNA synthesis.","Hagemeijer, Marne C; Vonk, Annelotte M; Monastyrska, Iryna; Rottier, Peter J M; de Haan, Cornelis A M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.07207-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22438542/,68

Little is known about the mechanisms that govern the development of respiratory and neurological disease. Using a hamster model of lethal NiV and HeV infection, we describe the role of the route and dose of infection on the clinical outcome and determine virus tropism and host responses following infection. Infection of hamster with a high dose of NiV or HeV resulted in acute respiratory distress. NiV initially replicated in the upper respiratory tract epithelium, whereas HeV initiated infection primarily in the interstitium. In contrast, infection with a low dose of NiV or HeV resulted in the development of neurological signs and more systemic spread of the virus through involvement of the endothelium. The development of neurological signs coincided with disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and expression of tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 β (IL-1β). In addition, interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) was identified as playing an important role in NiV and HeV pathogenesis. These studies reveal novel information on the development and progression of NiV and HeV clinical disease, provide a mechanism for the differences in transmission observed between NiV and HeV outbreaks, and identify specific cytokines and chemokines that serve as important targets for treatment.","Rockx, Barry; Brining, Douglas; Kramer, Joshua; Callison, Julie; Ebihara, Hideki; Mansfield, Keith; Feldmann, Heinz",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00473-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21593160/,68

Experimental Design: C57BL/6-mice bearing syngeneic RM1-PGLS tumors were treated with 225Ac-PSMA617, an anti-PD-1 antibody, or both. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by tumor volume measurements (computed tomography), time to progression (TTP) and survival. Results: PSMA-RNT or anti-PD-1 alone tended to prolong TTP (isotype-control 25d; anti-PD-1 33.5d, p=0.0153; RNT 30d, p=0.1038) and survival (control 28d; anti-PD-1 37d, p=0.0098; RNT 32d, p=0.1018). Combining PSMA-RNT and anti-PD-1 significantly improved disease control compared to either monotherapy.

METHODS Patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy for stroke were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2002-2011). Multivariable logistic regression evaluated the association of surgical timing with mortality, discharge to institutional care, and poor outcome (a composite end point including death, tracheostomy and gastrostomy, or discharge to institutional care). Covariates included patient demographics, comorbidities, year of admission, and hospital characteristics. However, standard stroke severity scales and infarct volume were not available. RESULTS Among 1301 admissions, 55.8% (n=726) underwent surgery within 48 hours. Teaching hospital admission was associated with earlier surgery (P=0.02). The timing of intervention was not associated with in-hospital mortality. However, when evaluated continuously, later surgery was associated with increased odds of discharge to institutional care (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.31, P=0.005) and of a poor outcome (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.23; P=0.02). When evaluated dichotomously, the odds of discharge to institutional care and of a poor outcome did not differ at 48 hours after hospital admission, but increased when surgery was pursued after 72 hours. Subgroup analyses found no association of surgical timing with outcomes among patients who had not sustained herniation. CONCLUSION s-In this nationwide analysis, early decompressive craniectomy was associated with superior outcomes. However, performing decompression before herniation may be the most important temporal consideration.","Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar H; Robertson, Faith C; Vaitkevicius, Henrikas; Aziz-Sultan, M Ali; Guttieres, Donovan; Dunn, Ian F; Du, Rose; Gormley, William B",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.116.014727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28108618/,68

80173,NGF-TrkA signaling dictates neural ingrowth and aberrant osteochondral differentiation after soft tissue trauma.,2021-08-16,"Cell membrane-bound proteolytic enzymes (ectopeptidases) are integral membrane proteins, orientated asymmetrically with the catalytic site exposed to the extracellular surface, which enables a versatile range of physiological and pathological functions. Ectopeptidases may regulate the release of many growth factors and their receptors into the circulation, as well as activating or inactivating circulating signalling molecules, thereby regulating the availability of ligands for the corresponding receptors. Additionally, many of these ectopeptidases have functions not limited to proteolysis, but are able in themselves to function as receptors, transducing intracellular signals. A versatile range of functions, such as the modulation of cell-signalling, matrix degradation, cell adhesion and migration, which are particularly important for tumour cell growth and dissemination, are attributed largely to the ectopeptidases. Even a minor disruption in the normal proteolytic equilibrium can influence tumor progression, and a range of ectopeptidases, including neutral endopeptidase 24.11, aminopeptidase N, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and the disintegrin-metalloproteinases, have been shown to be involved in tumour development and metastasis. The ability to degrade and inactivate peptide hormones and growth factors, with the resultant modulation of the tumour-host interface, may play an important role in the pathogenesis, development or progression of a range of cancers, and the extracellular orientation of the ectopeptidases makes them particularly accessible, and therefore interesting, with regard to therapeutical applications.","Carl-McGrath, S; Lendeckel, U; Ebert, M; Röcken, C",Histology and histopathology,https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-21.1339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16977585/,68
80345,A showcase of green chemistry: Sustainable synthetic approach of zirconium-based MOF materials.,2021-05-06,"With coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), we have witnessed a shift from public health to planetary health and a growing recognition of the importance of systems science in developing effective solutions against pandemics in the 21st century. COVID-19 and the history of frequent infectious outbreaks in the last two decades suggest that COVID-19 is likely a dry run for future ecological crises. Now is the right time to plan ahead and deploy the armamentarium of systems science scholarship for planetary health. The science of epigenomics, which investigates both genetic and nongenetic traits regarding heritable phenotypic alterations, and new approaches to understanding genome regulation in humans and pathogens offer veritable prospects to boost the global scientific capacities to innovate therapeutics and diagnostics against novel and existing infectious agents. Several reversible epigenetic alterations, such as chromatin remodeling and histone methylation, control and influence gene expression. COVID-19 lethality is linked, in part, to the cytokine storm, age, and status of the immune system in a given person. Additionally, due to reduced human mobility and daily activities, effects of the pandemic on the environment have been both positive and negative. For example, reduction in environmental pollution and lesser extraction from nature have potential positive corollaries on water and air quality. Negative effects include pollution as plastics and other materials were disposed in unconventional places and spaces in the course of the pandemic. I discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with the science of epigenomics, specifically with an eye to inform and prevent future ecological crises and pandemics that are looming on the horizon in the 21st century. In particular, this article underscores that epigenetics of both viruses and the host may influence virus infectivity and severity of attendant disease.","Dzobo, Kevin",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/omi.2021.0024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904782/,68

AIM A method for accurate and applicable real-time quantification of local sO2 with OA imaging. APPROACH We combine multiple illumination (MI) sensing with learned spectral decoloring (LSD). We train LSD feedforward neural networks and random forests on Monte Carlo simulations of spectrally colored absorbed energy spectra, to apply the trained models to real OA measurements. We validate our combined MI-LSD method on a highly reliable, reproducible, and easily scalable phantom model, based on copper and nickel sulfate solutions. RESULTS With this sulfate model, we see a consistently high estimation accuracy using MI-LSD, with median absolute estimation errors of 2.5 to 4.5 percentage points. We further find fewer outliers in MI-LSD estimates compared with LSD. Random forest regressors outperform previously reported neural network approaches. CONCLUSIONS Random forest-based MI-LSD is a promising method for accurate quantitative OA oximetry imaging.","Kirchner, Thomas; Frenz, Martin",Journal of biomedical optics,https://doi.org/10.1117/1.jbo.26.8.085001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350736/,68

General clinical recommendations for cancer patients were released, even if limited clinical cancer-specific data were available. A number of critical issues have come out during COVID-19 pandemic in the management of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). To explore the changes in the treatment of patients with MBC during COVID-19 pandemic, we promoted a survey to the oncologists operating in the Italian breast units. The results of this survey show that Italian oncologists have tried to ensure continuity of care for patients with MBC. De-escalation of cancer treatments, especially monotherapy administration, and greater use of oral anticancer drugs are the main changes that emerge from this survey.

However, there is not a consensus that the added expense of this technique necessitates monitoring in all stages of surgical management. METHODS A retrospective review of 180 surgical cases of 30 patients with EOS from July 2003 to July 2012 was performed. All monitoring alerts as judged by the neuromonitoring team were identified. Both somatosensory-evoked potentials and transcranial electric motor-evoked potentials were studied and no limiting thresholds for reporting electrophysiological changes were deemed appropriate. RESULTS Of 150 monitored cases there were 18 (12%) monitoring alerts. This represented 40% of the patient cohort over the 9-year study period. CONCLUSIONS Index versus routine lengthening rate of alerts showed no significant difference in incidence of monitoring alerts. Conversely, several patients whose primary implantation surgeries were uneventful had monitoring alerts later in their treatment course. Intraoperative neuromonitoring is warranted throughout all stages of surgical management of EOS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level IV.

80928,An Extended Role of Continuous Flow Device in Pediatric Mechanical Circulatory Support.,2016,"ABSTRACT The Food Safety Modernization Act, specifically the Produce Safety Rule, requires growers to clean and sanitize food contact surfaces to protect against produce contamination. An ATP monitoring device is a potential sanitation tool to monitor the efficacy of an on-farm cleaning and sanitation program that could help growers meet regulatory expectations mandated by the Produce Safety Rule. This ATP monitoring device uses bioluminescence to detect all ATP (found in bacteria and produce matter cells) from a swabbed surface. Because little work has been done to test the efficacy of these tools under postharvest conditions, the present study evaluated ATP measurement for postharvest food contact surface cleanliness evaluation. Concentrations of leafy greens (spinach, romaine, and red cabbage, with or without Listeria innocua) were used as organic matter applied to stainless steel, high-density polyethylene plastic, and bamboo wood coupons to represent postharvest food contact surfaces. The ATP levels on the coupons were then measured by using swabs and an ATP monitoring device. Results showed that the concentration of L. innocua and leafy greens on a food contact surface had a highly significant effect on the ATP monitoring device reading (P < 0.0001). The ATP monitoring device had a lower limit of detection for L. innocua at 4.5 log CFU per coupon. The type of leafy green on a food contact surface did not affect the ATP reading (P = 0.88). Leafy greens with added L. innocua had a higher ATP reading when compared with saline and L. innocua, demonstrating the presence of leafy green matter contributes to ATP reading when combined with L. innocua. The different food contact surfaces had different ATP response readings (P = 0.03), resulting in no detectable levels of bacteria and/or leafy green material from bamboo wood surfaces (P = 0.16). On the basis of our results, the ATP measurement is an appropriate tool to measure produce or bacterial contamination on stainless steel or high-density polyethylene plastic surfaces; however, it is not recommended for wood surfaces.

However, it remains unclear what type of tDCS stimulation is most effective. Our aim was to give an overview of the evidence network regarding the efficacy and safety of tDCS and to estimate the effectiveness of the different stimulation types. METHODS This is a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with network meta-analysis (NMA). We searched the following databases until 4 February 2020: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, Web of Science, and four other databases. We included studies with adult people with stroke. We compared any kind of active tDCS (anodal, cathodal, or dual, that is applying anodal and cathodal tDCS concurrently) regarding improvement of our primary outcome of functional communication, versus control, after stroke. PROSPERO ID CRD42019135696. RESULTS We included 25 studies with 471 participants. Our NMA showed that tDCS did not improve our primary outcome, that of functional communication. There was evidence of an effect of anodal tDCS, particularly over the left inferior frontal gyrus, in improving our secondary outcome, that of performance in naming nouns (SMD = 0.51; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.90). There was no difference in safety between tDCS and its control interventions, measured by the number of dropouts and adverse events.

Twelve years after GKS, he suffered from subarachnoid hemorrhage. Initial angiogram showed no vascular lesions; second left vertebral angiogram, 10 days after admission, demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm in the lateral pontine segment of the left AICA. The proximal portion of the AICA was occluded by a coil. Postoperative MRI revealed an infarction on the left side of the pons and brachium pontis. Although the patient suffered from mild postoperative cerebellar ataxia and facial and abducens nerve palsy, he was discharged 1 month postoperatively requiring no assistance with activities of daily living. Twelve months later, he recovered satisfactorily with a modified Rankin Scale grade of 1, and no recanalization of the aneurysm was found on MR angiography. Endovascular parent artery occlusion for ruptured aneurysms at distal AICA carries the risk of brain stem infarction, but should be considered when no other option is available such as after radiotherapy for VS.","Murakami, Mamoru; Kawarabuki, Kentaro; Inoue, Yasuo; Ohta, Tsutomu",Neurologia medico-chirurgica,https://doi.org/10.2176/nmc.cr.2015-0034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26667081/,68

83243,Spectral representation of reduced protein models.,2009,"BACKGROUND In early 2020, the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) spread rapidly throughout the whole world, causing a massive response in terms of health resource disposal. Moreover, lockdowns were imposed in entire countries. This study aims to assess whether there was a downward trend in emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures accomplished throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine patients' and diseases' characteristics. METHODS This is a multicentric retrospective observational cohort analysis conducted on patients who underwent EGS procedures during the lockdown and the same period of the previous year in the three Third Level Hospitals of Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. RESULTS During the study period, 138 patients underwent EGS procedures versus the 197 patients operated on in 2019, meaning a 30.0% decrease in the number of surgeries performed. The incidence rate for EGS procedures was 2.5 surgeries per day during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 3.5 surgeries per day in 2019 (P<0.001). The characteristics of patients operated on in 2020 were comparable to those of patients who underwent EGS in 2019, except for the higher prevalence of male patients during the COVID-19 pandemic (76.8 vs. 55.8; P<0.001). No difference was recorded in disease severity between the two study periods. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant reduction in EGS procedures carried out was recorded. However, no clear explanation can be given to elucidate this fact.","Bellio, Gabriele; Germani, Paola; Biloslavo, Alan; Del Zotto, Giulio; Lirusso, Chiara; Crestale, Sara; Silvestro, Roberto; Crespi, Stefania; Faion, Matteo; Ubiali, Paolo; DE Manzini, Nicolò",Minerva surgery,https://doi.org/10.23736/s2724-5691.21.08517-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047527/,68

Standardized submission data and PRRSV real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test results from porcine samples were retrieved from four VDLs representing 95% of all swine samples tested in NAHLN laboratories in the US. Anonymized data were retrieved and organized at the case level using SAS (SAS® Version 9.4, SAS® Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) with the use of PROC DATA, PROC MERGE, and PROC SQL scripts. The final aggregated and anonymized dataset comprised of 547,873 unique cases was uploaded to Power Business Intelligence-Power BI® (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) to construct dynamic charts. The number of cases tested for PRRSV doubled from 2010 to 2018, with that increase mainly driven by samples typically used for monitoring purposes rather than diagnosis of disease. Apparent seasonal trends for the frequency of PRRSV detection were consistently observed with a higher percentage of positive cases occurring during fall or winter months and lower during summer months, perhaps due to increased testing associated with well-known seasonal occurrence of swine respiratory disease. PRRSV type 2, also known as North American genotype, accounted for 94.76% of all positive cases and was distributed across the US. PRRSV type 1, also known as European genotype, was geographically restricted and accounted for 2.15% of all positive cases. Co-detection of both strains accounted for 3.09% of the positive cases. Both oral fluid and processing fluid samples, had a rapid increase in the number of submissions soon after they were described in 2008 and 2017, respectively, suggesting rapid adoption of these specimens by the US swine industry for PRRSV monitoring in swine populations. As part of this project, a bio-informatics tool defined as Swine Disease Reporting System (SDRS) was developed. This tool has real-time capability to inform the US swine industry on the macroepidemiological aspects of PRRSV detection, and is easily adaptable for other analytes relevant to the swine industry.","Trevisan, Giovani; Linhares, Leticia C M; Crim, Bret; Dubey, Poonam; Schwartz, Kent J; Burrough, Eric R; Main, Rodger G; Sundberg, Paul; Thurn, Mary; Lages, Paulo T F; Corzo, Cesar A; Torrison, Jerry; Henningson, Jamie; Herrman, Eric; Hanzlicek, Gregg A; Raghavan, Ram; Marthaler, Douglas; Greseth, Jon; Clement, Travis; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Linhares, Daniel C L",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618236/,68

The goal of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of aligned nanofibrillar collagen scaffolds (BioBridge) positioned across the area of lymphatic obstruction in guiding lymphatic regeneration. In a porcine model of acquired lymphedema, animals were treated with BioBridge scaffolds, alone or in conjunction with autologous lymph node transfer as a source of endogenous lymphatic growth factor. They were compared with a surgical control group and a second control group in which the implanted BioBridge was supplemented with exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C). Three months after implantation, immunofluorescence staining of lymphatic vessels demonstrated a significant increase in lymphatic collectors within close proximity to the scaffolds. To quantify the functional impact of scaffold implantation, bioimpedance was used as an early indicator of extracellular fluid accumulation. In comparison to the levels prior to implantation, the bioimpedance ratio was significantly improved only in the experimental BioBridge recipients with or without lymph node transfer, suggesting restoration of functional lymphatic drainage. These results further correlated with quantifiable lymphatic collectors, as visualized by contrast-enhanced computed tomography.

By interacting with cellular receptors, the Env protein complex initiates the infectious cycle of HIV. After the first contact has been established Env disassembles by shedding gp120 while the remaining gp41 undergoes a number of conformational changes which drive fusion of the cellular and the viral membranes. Here we investigated the membrane interactions and oligomerization of the two gp41 heptad repeat domains NHR and CHR. While these are thought to form a six-helix bundle in the post-fusion state little is known about their structure and role during prior fusion events. When investigated in aqueous buffer by CD and fluorescence quenching techniques the formation of NHR/CHR hetero-oligomers is detected. An equilibrium of monomers and hetero-oligomers is also observed in membrane environments. Furthermore, the partitioning to POPC or POPC/POPG 3/1 vesicles of the two domains alone or in combination has been studied. The membrane interactions were further characterized by 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy of uniaxially oriented samples which shows that the polypeptide helices are oriented parallel to the bilayer surface. The 31P solid-state NMR spectra of the same samples are indicative of considerable disordering of the membrane packing. The data support models where NHR and CHR insert in the viral and cellular membranes, respectively, where they exhibit an active role in the membrane fusion events.","Aisenbrey, Christopher; Bechinger, Burkhard",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Health care systems changed operating schedules, staff work pattern, and how patients are cared for. The effects of these changes reached patients, staff and training in different ways. METHODS We searched the Pubmed and EMBASE for articles related to COVID-19. We also searched local emails and information provided to staff during the pandemic RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic affected organizations, patients, and staff. The organizations and staff had to adapt to the times to provide a safe and appropriate service to our patients. CONCLUSION The pandemic challenged and changed the way we work as health care providers, and how we train the future surgeons. Changes in the system were effective.","Mohamed Ahmed, Eltayeb; Chen, Edward P",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.15098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33058270/,68
85927,Hippocampal neurons with stable excitatory connectivity become part of neuronal representations.,2020-11-03,"OBJECTIVE Managing retraction of the lumbar plexus is critical to safely performing lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) via the transpsoas approach. Occasionally, a transitional psoas is encountered at L4/5 and has been postulated to be a contraindication to transpsoas LLIF. A case series of patients with transitional psoas who underwent L4/5 LLIFs is presented. METHODS This retrospective review assessed 79 consecutive patients who underwent L4/5 LLIF during a 24-month period. Preoperative imaging was reviewed, and patients were classified into 2 groups: normal psoas or transitional psoas. Intraoperative features and outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients underwent L4/5 LLIFs, of whom 23 had transitional psoas anatomy and 56 had normal psoas anatomy. Among patients with transitional psoas, the center of the psoas was a mean (range) of 11.2 (5.2-26.6) mm in front of the center of the vertebral body compared with 2.0 (0-4) mm in the normal psoas group. The mean (range) retraction time was similar between groups (10.8 [6.7-14.9] minutes in the TP group versus 11.0 [7.8-15.0] minutes in the NP group). No permanent motor injuries occurred in either group, and no differences in length of stay or preoperative or postoperative Oswestry Disability Index scores were found between the groups. The protocol for L4/5 LLIF in patients with transitional psoas anatomy is described. CONCLUSIONS Transitional psoas anatomy is frequently encountered in surgical candidates for L4/5 LLIF. Through careful identification of the lumbar plexus and judicious retraction, the transpsoas LLIF can safely be performed in these patients.","Ohiorhenuan, Ifije E; Martirosyan, Nikolay L; Wewel, Joshua T; Sagar, Soumya; Uribe, Juan S",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.12.105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385599/,68

87097,Promoterless gene targeting without nucleases ameliorates haemophilia B in mice.,2015,"Targeted mass spectrometry is a promising technology for site-specific quantification of posttranslational modifications. However, a major constraint is the limited sensitivity for quantifying low-abundance PTMs, requiring the use of affinity reagents for enrichment. Herein, we demonstrate the direct site-specific quantification of ERK phosphorylation isoforms (pT, pY, pTpY) and their relative stoichiometry using a sensitive targeted MS approach termed high-pressure, high-resolution separations with intelligent selection, and multiplexing (PRISM). PRISM provides effective enrichment of target peptides into a given fraction from complex mixture, followed by selected reaction monitoring quantification. Direct quantification of ERK phosphorylation in human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) was demonstrated from as little as 25 μg tryptic peptides from whole cell lysates. Compared to immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography, PRISM provided ∼10-fold higher signal intensities, presumably due to the better peptide recovery of PRISM. This approach was applied to quantify ERK phosphorylation dynamics in HMEC treated by different doses of epidermal growth factor at both the peak activation (10 min) and steady state (2 h). The maximal ERK activation was observed with 0.3 and 3 ng/mL doses for 10 min and 2 h time points, respectively. The dose-response profiles of individual phosphorylated isoforms showed that singly phosphorylated pT-ERK never increases significantly, while the increase of pY-ERK paralleled that of pTpY-ERK. This data supports for a processive, rather than distributed model of ERK phosphorylation. The PRISM-SRM quantification of protein phosphorylation illustrates the potential for simultaneous quantification of multiple PTMs.","Shi, Tujin; Gao, Yuqian; Gaffrey, Matthew J; Nicora, Carrie D; Fillmore, Thomas L; Chrisler, William B; Gritsenko, Marina A; Wu, Chaochao; He, Jintang; Bloodsworth, Kent J; Zhao, Rui; Camp, David G; Liu, Tao; Rodland, Karin D; Smith, Richard D; Wiley, H Steven; Qian, Wei-Jun",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/ac503797x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25517423/,68

We tested the validity of contrast-enhanced MRI in quantifying scarred and viable myocardium after cell therapy in a porcine model of convalescent MI. METHODS AND RESULTS Yucatan minipigs underwent induction of MI and 2-3 weeks later were randomized to receive intracoronary infusion of 12.5×10(6) mismatched allogeneic CDCs or vehicle. Allogeneic CDCs induced mild local mononuclear infiltration but no systemic immunogenicity. MRI revealed that allogeneic CDCs attenuated remodeling, improved global and regional function, decreased scar size, and increased viable myocardium compared with placebo 2 months post-treatment. Extensive histological analysis validated quantitatively the MRI measurements of scar size, scar mass, and viable mass. CDCs neither altered gadolinium contrast myocardial kinetics nor induced changes in vascular density or architecture in viable and scarred myocardium. Histology demonstrated that CDCs lead to cardiomyocyte hyperplasia in the border zone, consistent with the observed stimulation of endogenous regenerative mechanisms (cardiomyocyte cycling, upregulation of endogenous progenitors, angiogenesis). CONCLUSIONS Contrast-enhanced MRI accurately measures scarred and viable myocardium after cell therapy in a porcine model of convalescent MI. MRI represents a useful tool for assessing dynamic changes in the infarct and monitoring regenerative efficacy.","Malliaras, Konstantinos; Smith, Rachel R; Kanazawa, Hideaki; Yee, Kristine; Seinfeld, Jeffrey; Tseliou, Eleni; Dawkins, James F; Kreke, Michelle; Cheng, Ke; Luthringer, Daniel; Ho, Chak-Sum; Blusztajn, Agnieszka; Valle, Ileana; Chowdhury, Supurna; Makkar, Raj R; Dharmakumar, Rohan; Li, Debiao; Marbán, Linda; Marbán, Eduardo",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.113.002863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24061088/,68
87464,Individualizing Management of Complex Esophageal Pathology Using Three-Dimensional Printed Models.,2015,"INTRODUCTION We compared single incision laparoscopic surgery with flexible endoscope (""flexible SILS"") and with rigid optic (""rigid SILS"") for access to 11 elective sites of peritoneal carcinomatosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Back-to-back flexible and rigid SILS peritoneoscopy were performed in ten live pigs. SILS peritoneoscopy was performed using a flexible endoscope or a rigid optic, in random order, together with two rigid 5-mm laparoscopic forceps. Primary endpoint was access success rate to 11 elective sites of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Findings for the most favorable option were then assessed in four human cadavers. RESULTS In the porcine model, the overall rate of access to targets was 98% with flexible SILS and 87% with rigid SILS (p < 0.001). Both flexible and rigid SILS allowed a 100% access rate to diaphragmatic domes, paracolic gutters, splenic and hepatic hilum, pelvic floor, and trigonal bladder. The rates of access to other sites by flexible versus rigid SILS, respectively, were: root of the mesentery (90 vs. 50%), origin of the inferior mesenteric vein (90 vs. 50%), inferior vena cava (100 vs. 90%), and cul-de-sac of Douglas (100 vs. 50%). No complications were observed. Procedures were performed in mean time of 26 and 24 min, respectively. These findings were confirmed for flexible SILS in four human cadavers. CONCLUSIONS Flexible SILS is superior to rigid SILS to evaluate the peritoneal cavity in a timely manner. This suggests a need for flexible instrumentation or other technical solutions to perform thorough minimally invasive surgical evaluation of peritoneal carcinomatosis.","Ladjici, Y; Dray, X; Marteau, P; Valleur, P; Pocard, M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2218-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22437951/,68

METHODS Following informed consent baseline mini-mental status exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and geriatric depression scale (GDS) were obtained. Intraoperatively OAA/S, BIS, and propofol (timing and exact amounts) administered were recorded. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected for Alzheimer's (AD) biomarkers. Mean Ce level (AvgCe) during surgery was calculated using the area under the Ce measurement series from incision to closure, divided by surgical time. Average OAA/S (AvgOAA/S), and BIS (AvgBIS) were similarly calculated. Pearson correlations of AvgCe with AvgOAA/S and AvgBIS were calculated overall and by CDR. Nonparametric locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) fits of AvgOAA/S and AvgBIS on AvgCe were produced, stratified by CDR. Multivariable regression incorporating baseline cognitive measurements or AD biomarkers assessed AvgOAA/S or AvgBIS associations with AvgCe. RESULTS In 186 participants AvgBIS and AvgOAA/S correlated with AvgCe (Pearson ρ = - 0.72; p < 0.0001 and Pearson ρ = - 0.81; p < 0.0001, respectively), and remained unchanged across CDR levels. Association patterns of AvgOAA/S or AvgBIS on AvgCe guided by LOWESS fits and modeled through regression, were similar when stratified by CDR (p = 0.16). Multivariable modeling found no independent effect on AvgBIS or AvgOAA/S by MMSE, CDR, GDS, or AD biomarkers after accounting for AvgCe. CONCLUSIONS When administering sedation in conjunction with spinal anesthesia, cognitive impairment does not affect the relationship between predicted propofol AvgCe and AvgOAA/S or AvgBIS.","Sieber, Frederick; Neufeld, Karin; Oh, Esther S; Gottschalk, Allan; Wang, Nae-Yuh",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-020-01043-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32466776/,68

However, oncological outcomes, especially mid- or long-term outcomes, are still lacking. The objective of this study was to present our eight-year experience of uniportal VATS anatomical lung resection, including mid-term oncological outcomes. METHODS All consecutive patients undergoing uniportal VATS anatomical lung resection between June 2012 and February 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS We analyzed data of 170 patients (100 male and 70 female), with a median age of 67 years. The median follow-up time was 21 months (range 11-41). The DFS of the entire cohort was 66.3 months. Stage-correlated DFS was 73.1 months for stage I, 42.6 months for stage II, 30.6 months for stage III and 12.5 months for stage IV. The OS of the entire court was 67 months. Stage-correlated OS was 75.6 months for stage I, 50.2 months for stage II, 31.7 months for stage III and 12.5 months for stage IV. CONCLUSIONS Uniportal VATS anatomical lung resection for lung cancer can be performed with satisfactory mid-term histology- and stage-related outcomes, which is consistent with prior results of traditional VATS or thoracotomy.","Kang, Do Kyun; Kang, Min Kyun; Heo, Woon; Hwang, Youn-Ho",Thoracic cancer,https://doi.org/10.1111/1759-7714.13774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655658/,68

OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies exploring the association between maternal diabetes and preterm infant outcomes. METHODS Medline, PubMed and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases were searched without language restriction from 1 January 2000 until 19 August 2019. Studies examining preterm infants <37 weeks gestational age and reporting prespecified outcomes of this review based on maternal diabetes as primary exposure variable were included. RESULTS Of 7956 records identified through database searches, 9 studies were included in the study. No significant association was found between maternal diabetes and in-hospital mortality (adjusted RR (aRR) 0.90 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.11); 6 studies; participants=1 191 226; I2=83%). Similarly, no significant association was found between maternal diabetes and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (aRR 1.00 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.07); 4 studies; participants=107 902; I2=0%), intraventricular haemorrhage or cystic periventricular leukomalacia (aRR 0.91 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.03); 3 studies; participants=115 050; I2=0%), necrotising enterocolitis (aRR 1.13 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.42); 5 studies; participants=142 579; I2=56%) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (aRR 1.17 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.61); 5 studies; participants=126 672; I2=84). A sensitivity analysis where low risk of bias studies were included in the meta-analyses showed similar results; however, the heterogeneity was lower for in-hospital mortality and ROP. CONCLUSION Maternal diabetes was not associated with in-hospital mortality and severe neonatal morbidities in preterm infants.

89828,Doing biocultural anthropology: Continuity and change.,2020-07-18,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) is increasingly used in clinical research to assess soft tissue hydration. It is known that physical characteristics of electrodes, such as low intrinsic impedance, low electrode/skin contact impedance and type of gel, affect the reliability of noninvasive bioimpedance assessments. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of intrinsic impedance of electrode on the bioimpedance vector displacement in RXc graph. SUBJECTS/METHODS The intrinsic impedance is measured in nine pregelled disposable Ag/AgCl electrodes usually used for bioimpedance measures. The BIVA method is performed on 35 healthy volunteers using a 50 kHz phase-sensitive bioimpedance analyzer (BIA 101 Anniversary) with the lowest intrinsic impedance electrode and highest. The individual bioimpedance vector is plotted on the bivariate normal interval of reference population. The differences in the mean bioimpedance vectors obtained with each electrode are plotted, with their 95% confidence ellipses, on the dRXc graph. The paired one-sample Hotelling's T2-test is used to compare the differences of the mean bioimpedance vectors. RESULTS We found large variability in intrinsic resistance (11-665 Ω) and reactance (0.25-2.5 Ω) values of the electrodes analyzed and significant displacement (P<0.05) of bioimpedance vector positions in healthy adults according to the paired one-sample Hotelling's T2-test. CONCLUSIONS A robust study of all physical characteristics of commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes is necessary to reach consensus on pregelled Ag/AgCl electrodes valid for bioimpedance measurement. This information will enable BIVA users to avoid systemic errors when performing BIVA assessments, specifically when these measurements are used for clinical interpretations.","Nescolarde, L; Lukaski, H; De Lorenzo, A; de-Mateo-Silleras, B; Redondo-Del-Río, M P; Camina-Martín, M A",European journal of clinical nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2016.121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27380885/,68

The outcome of patients who developed appendicitis during mandated COVID-19 quarantine has yet to be examined. The main objective was to establish whether there was an increased rate of perforated appendicitis seen during COVID-19 quarantine. Secondary objectives included observing the type of procedure performed, length of stay, and associated complications. Materials and Methods: This retrospective analysis was designed to look at the rates of appendicitis and perforated appendicitis observed during mandatory ""safer at home order"" from March to May 2020. The same time period a year earlier was used for comparative analysis. The study utilized data gathered from a single health care system, which consisted of a large regional referral center with three emergency rooms (ERs). Patients were included in the study if they presented to any ER in our health care system with a chief complaint of acute appendicitis. Perforated appendicitis was determined either radiographically or intraoperatively. Interventions included surgery, percutaneous drainage, or medical management. Results: There were 107 patients who were included. During quarantine, a total of 48 patients presented with acute appendicitis, with 16 perforations, compared with the previous year where 59 patients presented with acute appendicitis, with 10 perforations (33% versus 17% P = .04). Most patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy (91%, n = 98), six patients (6%) were managed with intravenous antibiotics and 3 patients (3%) with percutaneous drainage. Patients who perforated had a longer duration of symptoms (2 versus 1, P = .03), white blood cell count (13,190 versus 15,960 cells/mm3, P = .09), and longer operative time (72 versus 89 minutes, P = .01). Patients who perforated had an increased length of stay and rate of complication. Conclusion: There was an overall increased rate of perforated appendicitis seen during quarantine compared with the previous year. Patients with perforated appendicitis had an increased length of stay, longer operative time, and increased rate of complications. Thus, although people were staying home due to public health safety orders, it negatively impacted those who developed appendicitis who may have presented to the hospital otherwise sooner.","Finkelstein, Paige; Picado, Omar; Muddasani, Kiranmayi; Wodnicki, Henry; Mesko, Thomas; Unger, Stephen; Bao, Philip; Jorge, Irving; Narayanan, Sumana; Ben-David, Kfir",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

In light of the disappointing findings in previous surveys, a survey was conducted to assess patient perceptions and characterize patient experiences/levels of satisfaction with post-surgical pain management. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Survey included a random sample of US adults who had undergone surgery within 5 years from the survey date. Participants were asked about their concerns before surgery, severity of perioperative pain, pain treatments, perceptions about post-surgical pain and pain medications, and satisfaction with treatments they received. RESULTS Of the 300 participants, ∼86% experienced pain after surgery; of these, 75% had moderate/extreme pain during the immediate post-surgical period, with 74% still experiencing these levels of pain after discharge. Post-surgical pain was the most prominent pre-surgical patient concern, and nearly half reported they had high/very high anxiety levels about pain before surgery. Approximately 88% received analgesic medications to manage pain; of these, 80% experienced adverse effects and 39% reported moderate/severe pain even after receiving their first dose. STUDY LIMITATIONS Key study limitations include the relatively small population size, potential for recall bias associated with the 14-month average time delay from surgery date to survey date, and the inability to account for influences of type of surgery and intraoperative anesthetic/analgesic use on survey results.

Vanadium dioxide (VO2) exhibits a first-order MI transition at 340 K. For more than half a century, it has been debated whether electron correlation or the structural instability due to dimerised V ions is the more essential driving force behind this MI transition. Here, we show that an ultrahigh magnetic field of 500 T renders the insulator phase of tungsten (W)-doped VO2 metallic. The spin Zeeman effect on the d electrons of the V ions dissociates the dimers in the insulating phase, resulting in the delocalisation of electrons. As the Mott-Hubbard gap essentially does not depend on the spin degree of freedom, the structural instability is likely to be the more essential driving force behind the MI transition.","Matsuda, Yasuhiro H; Nakamura, Daisuke; Ikeda, Akihiko; Takeyama, Shojiro; Suga, Yuki; Nakahara, Hayato; Muraoka, Yuji",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17416-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681051/,68

These providers lacked relevant critical care training. We investigated whether a focused video-based learning curriculum could effectively teach high priority intensive care topics in this unprecedented setting to these neurology providers. Methods Neurocritical care clinicians led a multidisciplinary team in developing a 2.5-hour lecture series covering the critical care management of COVID-19 patients. We examined whether provider confidence, stress, and knowledge base improved after viewing the lectures. Results A total of 88 residents and APPs participated across 2 academic institutions. 64 participants (73%) had not spent time as an ICU provider. After viewing the lecture series, the proportion of providers who felt moderately, quite, or extremely confident increased from 11% to 72% (60% difference, 95% CI 49-72%) and the proportion of providers who felt nervous/stressed, very nervous/stressed, or extremely nervous/stressed decreased from 78% to 48% (38% difference, 95% CI 26-49%). Scores on knowledge base questions increased an average of 2.5 out of 12 points (SD 2.1; p < 0.001). Conclusion A targeted, asynchronous curriculum on critical care COVID-19 management led to significantly increased confidence, decreased stress, and improved knowledge among resident trainees and APPs. This curriculum could serve as an effective didactic resource for neurology providers preparing for the COVID-19 ICU.","Ch'ang, Judy H; Ford, Jenna; Cifrese, Laura; Woodward, Elliott; Mears, Jennifer; Lowrie, Rachel; Holland, Chloe; Kaplan, Aaron; Zhang, Cenai; Guterman, Elan L",The Neurohospitalist,https://doi.org/10.1177/19418744211016220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567395/,68

In the three cases presented here, young women who were suspected to have mature cystic teratoma, based on CT scan and MRI, were ultimately diagnosed with immature teratoma Ic (b) G1 after laparoscopic operation. They underwent salpingo-oophorectomy of the affected side only and have shown no sign of recurrence during follow-up. We sometimes encounter patients with immature teratoma who have no findings pointing to malignancy on CT or MRI. Generally, if the components of immature nerve cells that represent immature teratoma are very few, it is difficult to diagnose the entity as immature teratoma with imaging evaluations such as CT or MRI. In many hospitals, laparoscopic surgery is selected for patients with ovarian mature teratoma. Therefore, it is essential to attempt as much as possible not to disseminate the fluid content of the tumor into the intra-abdominal space during laparoscopic operation, because in rare cases the tumor turns out not to be benign mature teratoma.","Nishida, Masakazu; Kawano, Yasushi; Yuge, Akitoshi; Nasu, Kaei; Matsumoto, Harunobu; Narahara, Hisashi",Clinical medicine insights.

METHODS The conceptual framework of HIT-6 was evaluated using baseline data from the PROMISE-2 study (NCT02974153; N = 1072). A unidimensional graded response model within the item response theory (IRT) framework was used to evaluate model fit and item characteristics. Using baseline and week 12 data, convergent and discriminant validity of the HIT-6 was evaluated by correlation coefficients. Sensitivity to change was assessed by evaluating correlations between HIT-6 scores and change scores for other established reference measures. All examined correlations were specified a priori with respect to direction and magnitude. Known-groups analyses were anchored using Patient Global Impression of Change and monthly headache days at week 12. RESULTS A unidimensional model fit the data well, supporting that the 6 items measure a single construct. All item slopes and thresholds were within acceptable ranges. In both the validity and sensitivity to change analyses, all observed correlations conformed to directional expectations, and most conformed to magnitude expectations. Known-groups analyses demonstrated that the HIT-6 total score can distinguish between clinically meaningful CM subgroups. CONCLUSION The HIT-6 was successfully calibrated using IRT with data from PROMISE-2. Results from these analyses were generally consistent with previous literature and provided supportive evidence that the HIT-6 is well suited for measuring the impact of headache and migraine in the CM population.","Houts, Carrie R; McGinley, James S; Wirth, R J; Cady, Roger; Lipton, Richard B","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-020-02668-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079313/,68

Today, animals perform a vital role in experiments and concerns for laboratory animal welfare are enshrined in the 3R framework of reduction, refinement and replacement. This case study explores a refinement in humane euthanasia of guinea pigs via the use of an irreversible penetrating spring-loaded captive bolt (CB). Penetrating spring-loaded CB stunning for euthanasia (CBE) was performed on 12 guinea pigs with the parameters for humane slaughter of production animals in order to assess the suitability of this method of euthanasia in contrast to blunt force trauma (BFT). All 12 of the guinea pigs were rendered immediately unconscious with excellent experimental tissue quality collection, high repeatability of results and operator (n = 8) preference over BFT. Overall, CBE in guinea pigs appears to be a feasible refinement for animal welfare, human preference and improved tissue quality for experimental collection in settings where uncontaminated tissues are required.","Cohen, Shari; Kwok, Melody; Huang, Joel",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10081356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764350/,68

Using models of fear appeal message processing, this study investigated the nature and prevalence of threat and efficacy messages in news coverage of the virus. Such models have traditionally been applied to strategic health message contexts (e.g., campaigns) rather than to health news coverage. Results suggest that most stories made reference to the threat of the H1N1 virus, sometimes overemphasizing and sensationalizing virus-related death. With regard to efficacy, approximately half mentioned actions individuals or organizations/communities could take to protect themselves from the virus, but almost none provided evidence that such methods are effective, and some explicitly questioned their effectiveness. In addition, a number of stories referenced uncertainty about the threat of the virus (38%) and/or solutions to the potential threat (18%).

91906,Important Notice.,1981,"BACKGROUND Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterised by substantial heterogeneity in treatment response. With an expanding number of therapeutic agents, identifying optimal treatment at the patient level remains a major challenge. AIM To systematically review the available literature on predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response in IBD. METHODS An electronic literature search was performed on 30 January 2018 using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Retrospective, prospective, uncontrolled and controlled studies reporting on biomarkers predicting therapeutic response in paediatric and adult IBD populations were eligible for inclusion. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the QUIPS tool. Due to anticipated heterogeneity and limited data, a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment was planned. RESULTS Of the 10 638 citations identified, 92 articles met the inclusion criteria. Several potential DNA, mRNA and protein markers were evaluated as predictive biomarkers. Most studies focused on predicting response to anti-TNF agents. Substantial between-study heterogeneity was identified with respect to both the biomarkers studied and the definition of response. None of the included studies received a low risk of bias rating for all six domains. Currently, none of the biomarkers is sufficiently predictive for clinical use. CONCLUSIONS The search for predictive biomarkers is still in its infancy and current evidence is limited. Future research efforts should take into account the high patient heterogeneity within prospective trials with objective response assessment. Predictive models will most likely comprise a combination of several molecular markers from integrated omics-levels and clinical characteristics.","Stevens, Toer W; Matheeuwsen, Mijntje; Lönnkvist, Maria H; Parker, Claire E; Wildenberg, Manon E; Gecse, Krisztina B; D'Haens, Geert R",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.15033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30378142/,68

However, radioresistance eventually occurs, resulting in poor outcomes in patients with cancer. Radioresistance is associated with multiple signaling pathways, particularly pro-survival signaling pathways. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) cascade is an important signaling pathway that initiates several cellular processes and is regulated by various stimuli, including IR. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the pro-survival effects of active ERK, activation of ERK has also been associated with cell death, indicating that radiosensitization may occur by ERK stimulation. In this context, the present review describes the associations between ERK signaling, cancer and IR, and discusses the association between ERK and its pro-survival function in cancer cells, including stimuli, molecular mechanisms, clinical use of inhibitors and underlying limitations. Additionally, the present review introduces the view that active ERK may induce cell death, and describes the potential factors associated with this process. This review describes the various outcomes induced by active ERK to prompt future studies to aim to enhance radiosensitivity in the treatment of cancer.","Lu, Yinliang; Liu, Baocai; Liu, Ying; Yu, Xinyue; Cheng, Guanghui",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724338/,68

We hypothesized that the intensity of the FLAIR clot signal in patients with acute stroke may predict the efficacy of recanalization by thrombectomy devices. In this study we compared the pretreatment FLAIR signal intensity of the clots in the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) and the degree of angiographic recanalization rate after mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS 25 consecutive acute stroke patients with ICA terminus (ICA-T) occlusion diagnosed with MRI at the UCLA Medical Center between 2002 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The intensity of the FLAIR clot signal at the distal ICA was blindly compared with the angiographic recanalization status (successful recanalization defined as Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score of 2b-3) and non-successful recanalization as TICI score 0-2a) after endovascular treatment. Multivariate logistic regression analysis for successful recanalization was performed. RESULTS Successful recanalization was achieved in 40% of patients (10/25) and showed a significantly higher FLAIR intensity (p=0.014). The cut-off value for clot intensity on the FLAIR sequence to predict recanalization was 0.7952, with 70% sensitivity and 80% specificity (95% CI 0.59 to 0.96) using a receiver operating characteristic curve. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only a high FLAIR clot intensity (>0.7952) was associated with successful recanalization (OR 16.79; 95% CI 1.29 to 218.92; p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS High signal intensity on FLAIR clot imaging may predict successful recanalization after endovascular therapy for ICA-T occlusion.","Fujimoto, Motoaki; Salamon, Noriko; Takemoto, Koichiro; Takao, Hiroyuki; Song, Ligang; Tateshima, Satoshi; Viñuela, Fernando",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443411/,68

However, there are still no reliable data on the main ecotoxicological characteristics of most individual avermectins. Although many QSAR models have been proposed to describe the acute toxicity of organic compounds towards Tetrahymena pyriformis (T. pyriformis), avermectins are outside the applicability domain of these models. The influence of the molecular structures of various organic compounds on the acute toxicity towards T. pyriformis was studied using the OCHEM web platform (https://ochem.eu). A data set of 1792 toxicants was used to create models. The QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) models were developed using the molecular descriptors Dragon, ISIDA, CDK, PyDescriptor, alvaDesc, and SIRMS and machine learning methods, such as Least Squares Support Vector Machine and Transformer Convolutional Neural Network. The HYBOT descriptors and Random Forest were used for a comparative QSAR investigation. Since the best predictive ability was demonstrated by the Transformer Convolutional Neural Network model, it was used to predict the toxicity of individual avermectins towards T. pyriformis. During a structural interpretation of the developed QSAR model, we determined the significant molecular transformations that increase and decrease the acute toxicity of organic compounds.","Tinkov, O V; Grigorev, V Y; Grigoreva, L D",SAR and QSAR in environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1080/1062936x.2021.1932583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34157880/,68

95447,Robotic transduodenal excision of ampullary tumour.,2017,"The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic upon human health, economic activity and social engagement have been swift and far reaching. Emerging evidence shows that the pandemic has had dramatic mental health impacts, bringing about increased anxiety and greater social isolation due to the physical distancing policies introduced to control the disease. In this context, it is possible to more deeply appreciate the health consequences of loneliness and social isolation, which researchers have argued are enduring experiences for many people and under-recognised contributors to public health. In this paper, we examine the social and psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on what this has revealed about the need to better understand and respond to social isolation and loneliness as public health priorities. Social isolation and loneliness are understood to be distinct conditions, yet each has been found to predict premature mortality, depression, cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline. Estimates of the prevalence and distribution of social isolation and loneliness vary, possibly ranging from one-in-six to one-in-four people, and the lack of knowledge about the extent of these conditions indicates the need for population monitoring using standardised methods and validated measures. Reviews of the evidence relating to social isolation and loneliness interventions have found that befriending schemes, individual and group therapies, various shared activity programs, social prescription by healthcare providers, and diverse strategies using information and communication technologies have been tried. There remains uncertainty about what is effective for different population groups, particularly for prevention and for addressing the more complex condition of loneliness. In Australia, a national coalition - Ending Loneliness Together - has been established to bring together researchers and service providers to facilitate evidence gathering and the mobilisation of knowledge into practice. Research-practice partnerships and cross-disciplinary collaborations of this sort are essential for overcoming the public health problems of loneliness and social isolation that have pre-existed and will endure beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Smith, Ben J; Lim, Michelle H",Public health research & practice,https://doi.org/10.17061/phrp3022008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32601651/,68

We review the literature on craniofacial chondroblastomas with particular emphasis on extratemporal lesions. Case Presentation A 27-year-old woman presented with severe headache, left facial dysesthesias, and diplopia. Physical examination revealed hypesthesia in the left maxillary nerve dermatome, and complete left abducens nerve palsy. Imaging demonstrated an expansile intraosseous mass originating in the upper clivus with extension superiorly into the sella turcica and laterally to involve the medial wall of the left cavernous sinus. The tumor was completely resected via an endoscopic endonasal approach, with postoperative improvement in lateral gaze palsy. Histopathology was consistent with chondroblastoma. Conclusion Chondroblastoma is a rare tumor of the craniofacial skeleton that should be included in the differential diagnosis of an osteolytic lesion of the clivus. Complete surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment.","Liu, Jonathan; Ahmadpour, Arjang; Bewley, Arnaud F; Lechpammer, Mirna; Bobinski, Matthew; Shahlaie, Kiarash",Journal of neurological surgery reports,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0035-1564601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26623238/,68

Low back pain and other spine disorders are prevalent among those exposed to whole-body vibration in occupational and military settings. Although standards for limiting exposure to whole-body vibration have been in place for decades, there is a lack of understanding of whole-body vibration-associated risks among safety and healthcare professionals. Consequently, disorders associated with whole-body vibration exposure remain prevalent in the workforce and military. The relationship between whole-body vibration and low back pain in humans has been established largely through cohort studies, for which vibration inputs that lead to symptoms are rarely, if ever, quantified. This gap in knowledge highlights the need for the development of relevant in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models to study such pathologies. The parameters of vibrational stimuli (eg, frequency and direction) play critical roles in such pathologies, but the specific cause-and-effect relationships between whole-body vibration and spinal pathologies remain mostly unknown. This paper provides a summary of whole-body vibration parameters; reviews in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models for spinal pathologies resulting from whole-body vibration; and offers suggestions to address the gaps in translating injury biomechanics data to inform clinical practice.","Patterson, Folly; Miralami, Raheleh; Tansey, Keith E; Prabhu, Raj K; Priddy, Lauren B",Animal models and experimental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/ame2.12163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179716/,68

There is anecdotal evidence of reduction in organ donation and transplantation (ODT) activity across the world. METHODS The weekly organ donation and liver transplant numbers over a 3-month period (17th Feb 2020 till 17th May 2020) for the USA, UK and India were compared to their previous year's activity. Liver transplant activity in 6 centers from these countries with varying local COVID-19 caseload was also compared. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant contraction in organ donation and liver transplantation in all 3 countries. Peak reduction ranged from 25% in the USA to over 80% in the UK and India. The reduction was different for deceased donor and living donor liver transplantation and varied between centers within a country. There was early evidence of recovery of deceased donation in the USA and UK and resumption of living donor liver transplantation activity in India towards the end of the study period. A number of policy changes were undertaken at national and transplant center levels to ensure safe transplantation despite significant redirection of resources to combat the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS There was a substantial reduction in organ donation and liver transplantation activity across the 3 countries with signs of recovery towards the end of the study period. Multiple factors including COVID-19 severity, stress on resources and influence of regulatory agencies and local factors are responsible for the reduction and recovery.","Reddy, Mettu S; Hakeem, Abdul R; Klair, Tarunjeet; Marcon, Francesca; Mathur, Abhishek; Samstein, Benjamin; Mohanka, Ravi; Mathur, Surendra K; Prachalias, Andreas; Menon, Krishna V; Muiesan, Paolo; Rela, Mohamed; Emond, Jean C",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804803/,68

This study examined how parental worry and family-based disaster education related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Method: Parents reported parental worry, family-based disaster education and their children's (5-8-year-old young elementary schoolchildren [n = 245] and 245 9-13-year-old early adolescents [n = 245]) internalizing and externalizing problems. Results: Data analysis showed that (a) across ages, parental worry related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems significantly and positively; (b) the significant and negative relationships between family-based disaster education and internalizing and externalizing problems were only supported in young elementary schoolchildren; and (c) high level of parent worry attenuated the negative link between family-based disaster education and young elementary schoolchildren's internalizing problems. Conclusion: This study expands our knowledge about relationships between parental worry and children's disaster-related well-being, and highlights the importance of adapting family-based disaster education to different ages. Data suggest that parents of young elementary schoolchildren and early adolescents both should avoid showing excessive worry in front of their children during the pandemic to help reduce their children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Effective family-based disaster education can mitigate young elementary schoolchildren's emotional distress and behavioral problems, the effect of which may be maximized if parents can avoid being overly worried. Parents of early adolescents should support their children in acquiring pandemic-related information independently and encourage them to seek support outside the family.

We conducted a convergent mixed method analysis of audience responses to actor Tom Hanks' March 11, 2020 disclosure of his COVID-19 diagnosis via social media. We collected our data within 24 hours of his announcement, allowing us to quickly capture emotional and cognitive responses to the announcement and to assess both demographic and psychosocial differences in types of people who heard the news in this time frame and those who had not. In our study, 587 participants had heard the news of Hanks' disclosure while 95 had not. Participants who had heard responded to an open-ended prompt asking if the disclosure affected them at all. Those who had not heard were funneled into a field intervention to test how random assignment to seeing Hanks' disclosure post or not would affect audiences' COVID-19-related emotions, cognitions, and willingness to enact prevention behaviors. The results of this mixed methods study revealed differences in responses to Hanks' disclosure based on health information source trust and involvement with Hanks as well as effects of the intervention on efficacy for dealing with COVID-19. We discuss implications for health communication theory and crafting messages that can effectively build off the attentional inertia generated by celebrity illness disclosures to encourage prevention efforts.","Myrick, Jessica Gall; Willoughby, Jessica Fitts",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1871169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33445967/,68
99059,An Overview of the FRAME Summer Studentship 2020 Award Winners.,2020-10-22,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), a newly emerging disease in China, posed a public health emergency of China. Wuhan is the most serious affected city. Some measures have been taken to control the transmission of COVID-19. From Jan. 23rd, 2020, gradually increasing medical resources (such as health workforce, protective clothing, essential medicines) were sent to Wuhan from other provinces, and the government has established the hospitals to quarantine and treat infected individuals. Under the condition of sufficient medical resources in Wuhan, late-stage of epidemic showed a downward trend. Assessing the effectiveness of medical resources is of great significance for the future response to similar disease. Based on the transmission mechanisms of COVID-19 and epidemic characteristics of Wuhan, by using time-dependent rates for some parameters, we establish a dynamical model to reflect the changes of medical resources on transmission of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Our model is applied to simulate the reported data on cumulative and new confirmed cases in Wuhan from Jan. 23rd to Mar. 6th, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number R0 = 2.71, which determines whether the disease will eventually die out or not under the absence of effective control measures. Moreover, we calculate the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), which is used to measure the 'daily reproduction number'. We obtain that Re(t) drops less than 1 since Feb. 8th. Our results show that delayed opening the 'Fire God Hill' hospital will greatly increase the magnitude of the outbreak. This shows that the government's timely establishment of hospitals and effective quarantine via quick detection prevent a larger outbreak.","Wang, Li Ping; Wang, Jing; Zhao, Hong Yong; Shi, Yang Yang; Wang, Kai; Wu, Peng; Shi, Lei",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987508/,68
99457,Assessing Pain Control Efficacy of Meloxicam and Ketoprofen When Compounded with Iron Dextran in Nursing Piglets Using A Navigation Chute.,2020-07-21,"Background Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) has been shown to improve motor performance in people with and without disabilities. Previous investigations on the use of nGVS to improve upper-limb motor performance have focused on unimanual fine motor movements, nevertheless, bimanual gross movements are also essential for conducting activities of daily living and can be affected as a result of cerebral dysfunction. Consequently, in this study we investigated the effects of nGVS on bimanual gross motor performance. Methods Twelve healthy participants completed a visuomotor task in which they performed bimanual upper-limb movements using two robots. During the task, participants tracked a target that oscillated following a sinusoidal amplitude-modulated trajectory. In half of the trials, participants received subthreshold nGVS, in the other half, they received sham stimulation. Primary outcome measure: percent improvement in root mean square error (RMSE) between the target's and cursors' trajectories. Secondary outcome measures: percent improvement in lag between the cursors and target; and percent improvement in RMSE between the cursors' trajectories. A post-test questionnaire was administered to evaluate the experience of participants. Results Tracking error was not affected by nGVS: left -2.6(5.5)%, p = 0.128; right -0.9(6.2)%, p = 0.639; nor was bimanual coordination -1.5(9.6)%, p = 0.590. When comparing if one hand was affected more than the other, we did not find a statistically significant difference (-1.7(3.3)%, p = 0.098). Similar results were found for the lag. Questionnaire results indicated that the robotic devices did not limit participants' movements, did not make participants feel unsafe, nor were they difficult to control. Furthermore, participants did not feel unsafe with the nGVS device, nor did they report any discomfort due to nGVS. Conclusion Results suggest that nGVS applied to people without disabilities do not affect bimanual gross motor performance. However, as this was the first study to investigate such effects, stimulation parameters were based on previous unimanual fine motor studies. Future studies should investigate optimal stimulation parameters for improving upper-limb gross motor performance. Overall, participants felt safe using the robotic devices and receiving the noisy electrical stimulation. As such, a similar setup could potentially be employed for subsequent studies investigating the relation between upper-limb performance and nGVS.","Valdés, Bulmaro A; Menon, Carlo",Frontiers in neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.01132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31749673/,68

Communication strategies disseminate information among the population that such masks are essential for mitigating virus diffusion. However, scientific studies are not conclusive in showing the undisputed filtration efficiency of fabric/cloth facial masks (both commercial and homemade). OBJECTIVES This study examines scientific data about the effectiveness of face masks before and during the COVID-19 emergency. Present trends in the making of commercial and homemade fabric/cloth face masks are also examined. METHODS Statistical data of published studies are analyzed and compared. Main considerations and suggestions are also extracted and discussed. Current approaches are examined for assessing the characteristics and effectiveness of fabric/cloth commercial and homemade face masks intended for the population. RESULT Conflicting data exist as to whether non-medical masks have a protective effect from the spread of respiratory viruses. Both medical masks (MDs) and respiratory personal protection equipment (PPE) show a given effectiveness value. CONCLUSION Concerning commercial and homemade fabric/cloth masks, giving general indications on the choice of materials and their assemblage is difficult as it is not possible to assess the effectiveness of the filter media with respect to the kind of multiphase fluid that may be emitted upon breathing, sneezing, or coughing under different environmental conditions. This is particularly important because airflow rate, temperature, humidity, and duration of use will affect the performance of filter media. Moreover, while a mask may have excellent filter media, droplets may leak into the face-piece unless there is an adequate facial seal. In the presence of leaks, any type of mask may actually offer less protection independently of its nominal filtering effìciency.","Santarsiero, A; Giustini, M; Quadrini, F; D'Alessandro, D; Fara, G M",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,https://doi.org/10.7416/ai.2020.2390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33258868/,68
99900,Hints of hope with remdesivir.,2020-05-11,"OBJECTIVE Low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) is being evaluated in several national trials as a screening modality for the early detection of lung cancer. The goal of the present study was to determine whether lung cancer screening could be done while minimizing the number of benign biopsy specimens taken in an area endemic for histoplasmosis. METHODS The subjects were recruited by letters mailed to area physicians and local advertisement. The inclusion criteria were age older than 50 years and at least a 20 pack-year smoking history. The exclusion criteria were symptoms suggestive of lung cancer or a history of malignancy in the previous 5 years. The participants completed a questionnaire and underwent a chest CT scan at baseline and annually for 5 years. The management of positive screening results was determined using a defined algorithm: annual follow-up CT scan for nodules less than 5 mm; 6-month follow-up CT scan for nodules 5 to 7 mm; review by our multidisciplinary tumor board for nodules 8 to 12 mm; and biopsy for nodules greater than 12 mm. RESULTS A total of 132 patients were recruited. Of the 132 patients, 61% had positive baseline CT findings and 22% had positive findings on the annual CT scans. Six cancers were detected. Of these 6 patients, 5 had stage I disease and underwent lobectomy, and 1 had stage IIIA disease and underwent induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by lobectomy. All patients were alive and disease free at a mean follow-up of 41.7 ± 18.6 months. No biopsies were performed for benign lesions. Also, no cancers were missed when the protocol was followed. CONCLUSIONS Screening with CT can be done effectively in an area endemic for histoplasmosis while minimizing benign biopsies.","Starnes, Sandra L; Reed, Michael F; Meyer, Cris A; Shipley, Ralph T; Jazieh, Abdul-Rahman; Pina, Elsira M; Redmond, Kevin; Huffman, Lynn C; Pandalai, Prakash K; Howington, John A",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.08.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20933243/,68
99912,Effects of different mating strategies in broiler breeder during peak and postpeak phase on subsequent broiler performance.,2020-07-01,"Increasing attention has been devoted to allosteric modulators as the preferred therapeutic agents for their colossal advantages such as higher selectivity, fewer side effects, and lower toxicity since they bind at allosteric sites that are topographically distinct from the classic orthosteric sites. However, the allosteric binding pockets are not conserved and there are no cogent methods to comprehensively characterize the features of allosteric sites with the binding of modulators. To overcome this limitation, our lab has developed a novel algorithm that can quantitatively characterize the receptor-ligand binding feature named Molecular Complex Characterizing System (MCCS). To illustrate the methodology and application of MCCS, we take G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as an example. First, we summarized and analyzed the reported allosteric binding pockets of class A GPCRs using MCCS. Sequentially, a systematic study was conducted between cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and its allosteric modulators, where we used MCCS to analyze the residue energy contribution and the interaction pattern. Finally, we validated the predicted allosteric binding site in CB2 via MCCS in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Our results demonstrate that the MCCS program is advantageous in recapitulating the allosteric regulation pattern of class A GPCRs of the reported pockets as well as in predicting potential allosteric binding pockets. This MCCS program can serve as a valuable tool for the discovery of small-molecule allosteric modulators for class A GPCRs.","Feng, Zhiwei; Liang, Tianjian; Wang, Siyi; Chen, Maozi; Hou, Tianling; Zhao, Jack; Chen, Hui; Zhou, Yuehan; Xie, Xiang-Qun",ACS chemical neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941011/,68

Current diagnostic tests are based on the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method, which is the gold standard test that involves the amplification of viral RNA. However, the RT-qPCR assay has limitations in terms of sensitivity and quantification. In this study, we tested both qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect low amounts of viral RNA. The cycle threshold (CT) of the viral RNA by RT-PCR significantly varied according to the sequences of the primer and probe sets with in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA or viral RNA as templates, whereas the copy number of the viral RNA by ddPCR was effectively quantified with IVT RNA, cultured viral RNA, and RNA from clinical samples. Furthermore, the clinical samples were assayed via both methods, and the sensitivity of the ddPCR was determined to be equal to or more than that of the RT-qPCR. However, the ddPCR assay is more suitable for determining the copy number of reference materials. These findings suggest that the qPCR assay with the ddPCR defined reference materials could be used as a highly sensitive and compatible diagnostic method for viral RNA detection.","Park, Changwoo; Lee, Jina; Hassan, Zohaib Ul; Ku, Keun Bon; Kim, Seong Jun; Kim, Hong Gi; Park, Edmond Changkyun; Park, Gun-Soo; Park, Daeui; Baek, Seung-Hwa; Park, Dongju; Lee, Jihye; Jeon, Sangeun; Kim, Seungtaek; Lee, Chang-Seop; Yoo, Hee Min; Kim, Seil",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2009.09006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33397829/,68

We evaluated the optimal location for placement of a cerebral oximeter probe while avoiding the frontal sinus in pediatric patients. This retrospective observational study included 203 pediatric patients aged 3-17 years who had undergone brain computed tomography from November 2010 to December 2015. The patients were divided into five subgroups based on their age. The frontal sinus height was measured from the superior orbital rim. Pneumatization of the frontal sinus was not visible in 78% (3-5 years) and 22% (6-8 years) of the patients. The mean (SD) of the frontal sinus height was 5.9 (3.4), 9.5 (4.1), 14.0 (6.2) 18.6 (8.4), and 21.1 (7.9) mm in the 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, and 15-17 year age-groups, respectively. Age was positively correlated with the frontal sinus height (r = 0.61, P < 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.513-0.688).

101364,How an ancient microbial arms race remodeled human cells.,2020-07-31,"It is becoming increasingly recognized that the tumor microenvironment significantly contributes to the development, progression, and metastasis of cancer and also plays a role in response to treatment. The tumor microenvironment is a complex and heterogeneous niche comprised of stromal cells, cancer cells, blood vessels, areas of hypoxia and necrotic tissue, fibrosis, and extracellular matrix. Cellular communication takes place within the tumor microenvironment, both via cell to cell contact, and through extracellular mechanisms such as exosomal signaling. Exosomes are very small membrane-bound vesicles that have been shown to play key roles in the progression of cancer including modulation of the tumor microenvironment through the induction of angiogenesis, the transfer of genetic information that confers drug resistance, and increased cell migration, invasion, proliferation, and survival, as well as the modulation of immune cell interactions. The role of exosomes in several different cancers has been investigated. In the context of osteosarcoma, understanding how exosomes may modulate the tumor microenvironment to support metastatic growth particularly in the lung, the most common site of metastases, may identify novel therapeutic targets for relapsed patients.","Wolf-Dennen, Kerri; Kleinerman, Eugenie S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43085-6_13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767243/,68

The 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza A virus is now endemic in both populations. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of different vaccines in reducing nasal shedding in pigs following pH1N1 virus challenge. We also assessed transmission from immunized and challenged to naive, directly in-contact pigs. Pigs were immunised with either adjuvanted, whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines or viral vectored (ChAdOx1 and MVA) vaccines expressing either the homologous or heterologous influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein as well as an influenza viral pseudotype (S-FLU) vaccine expressing heterologous HA. Only two vaccines containing homologous HA, which also induced high hemagglutination inhibitory antibody titers, significantly reduced virus shedding in challenged animals. Nevertheless, virus transmission from challenged to naive, in-contact animals occurred in all groups, although was delayed in groups of vaccinated animals with reduced virus shedding.IMPORTANCE This study was designed to determine whether vaccination of pigs with conventional, WIV or viral-vectored vaccines reduces pH1N1 swine influenza virus shedding following challenge and can prevent transmission to naive in-contact animals. Even when viral shedding was significantly reduced following challenge, infection was transmissible to susceptible co-housed recipients. This knowledge is important to inform disease surveillance and control strategies, and to determine the vaccine coverage required in a population, thereby defining disease moderation or herd protection. WIV or viral-vectored vaccines homologous to the challenge strain significantly reduced virus shedding from directly infected pigs, but vaccination did not completely prevent transmission to co-housed naive pigs.","Everett, Helen E; van Diemen, Pauline M; Aramouni, Mario; Ramsay, Andrew; Coward, Vivien J; Pavot, Vincent; Canini, Laetitia; Holzer, Barbara; Morgan, Sophie; Woolhouse, Mark E J; Tchilian, Elma; Brookes, Sharon M; Brown, Ian H; Charleston, Bryan; Gilbert, Sarah",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01787-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33268518/,68

We believe that this combination of portability, cost-effectiveness and performance will enable more accessible healthcare.","Kaigala, Govind V; Hoang, Viet N; Stickel, Alex; Lauzon, Jana; Manage, Dammika; Pilarski, Linda M; Backhouse, Christopher J",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/b714308g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18299747/,68

102786,Kinetics of Inactivation of Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger Spores and Staphylococcus albus on Paper by Chlorine Dioxide Gas in an Enclosed Space.,2016,"BACKGROUND There is a worldwide rising tendency of women deciding to become physicians; hence, one of the most remarkable fields of investigation is the wellbeing of female doctors. The aim of this study was to describe female physicians' reproductive health in Hungary and to explore the potential correlation between their reproductive disorders and burnout symptoms. Up to our present knowledge, there have not been any studies investigating the correlation between reproductive disorders and burnout of female physicians; therefore, our study represents a unique approach. METHODS Data in this representative cross-sectional epidemiological study were obtained from online questionnaires completed by 3039 female physicians. Participants in a representative nationwide survey (Hungarostudy, 2013) served as controls (n = 1069). Differences between physicians and the control group were disclosed by chi-square test. Correlations between certain factors of reproductive health and the three dimensions of burnout were detected by Pearson correlations and X2 test. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between burnout and reproductive health. RESULTS Female physicians were more often characterised by time-to-pregnancy interval longer than one year (18.4% vs. 9.8%), were bearing more high-risk pregnancies (26.3% vs.16.3%), and were more likely to be undergoing infertility therapy (8.5% vs. 3.4%) and experiencing miscarriage (20.8% vs. 14.6%) during their reproductive years, compared with the general female population. With the exception of miscarriages, the difference remained significant in all comparisons with the professional control group. Both high-risk pregnancies and miscarriages of doctors were associated with depersonalisation (p = 0.028 and p = 0.012 respectively) and personal accomplishment (p = 0.016 and p = 0.008 respectively) dimensions of burnout. Results of the multivariate analysis showed that, beside traditional risk factors, depersonalisation acted as an important explanatory factor in case of high-risk pregnancies (OR = 1.086). CONCLUSIONS There is a circulatory causality between burnout and the development of reproductive disorders. Burnout is an important risk factor for high-risk pregnancies and miscarriages, and it has a negative effect on the outcome of pregnancies. At the same time, women suffering from reproductive disorders are more likely to develop burnout syndrome. Improvement of working conditions and prevention of burnout in female doctors are equally important tasks.","Győrffy, Zsuzsa; Dweik, Diána; Girasek, Edmond",BMC women's health,https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6874-14-121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25273522/,68

But there are opportunities for any adversity to be mitigated by advances in the understanding of human, especially nutritional, ecobiology and in its more accessible and affordable evaluation and monitoring. Viral pandemics are on the rise with climate change and loss of ecosystems. They threaten human civilisation and planetary habitability. Human security is dependent on sustainable livelihoods of which food and water systems are a vital part. We are socioecological beings and depend for our health on biodiversity and the food diversity that ensures; and on connectedness and communication, made more difficult in pandemics. Rapid and accessible point-of-care (POC) tools are now becoming available to compliment other selfmonitoring network approaches, whether checklist or questionnaire, physical, chemical, or biological, for healthcare and nutritional health. They can provide information as several complimentary and interdependent health indices to facilitate personal, group and community action and management plans. This applies to indices of both communicable and non-communicable disease which problems separately and together are compromising health prospects. These indices include ones of physical and mental activities, dietary patterns, metabolites, blood pressure and now the presence and severity of viruses like Covid-19.Of imminent relevance and promise are optically- readable biosensor based strips for nasal, pharyngeal or salivary samples to check viral presence or finger prick blood for immunoglobulins and interleukins.

Complex systems are made up of heterogeneous elements that interact with one another, have emergent properties that are not explained by understanding the individual elements of the system, persist over time, and adapt to changing circumstances. Public health is starting to use results from systems science studies to shape practice and policy, for example in preparing for global pandemics. However, systems science study designs and analytic methods remain underutilized and are not widely featured in public health curricula or training. In this review we present an argument for the utility of systems science methods in public health, introduce three important systems science methods (system dynamics, network analysis, and agent-based modeling), and provide three case studies in which these methods have been used to answer important public health science questions in the areas of infectious disease, tobacco control, and obesity.","Luke, Douglas A; Stamatakis, Katherine A",Annual review of public health,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031210-101222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22224885/,68
102851,Dynamic tracheal occlusion improves lung morphometrics and function in the fetal lamb model of congenital diaphragmatic hernia.,2011,"Nanofluids (NFs) have been expanding their applications in many areas as high-performance heat transfer fluid (HTF) for heating and cooling purposes. This is mainly due to the improved thermophysical properties relative to the base fluid (BF). The addition of nanoparticles (NPs) to BF, to obtain NFs, increases the thermal conductivity, hence better heat transfer properties and thermal performance. The properties of NFs can be considered somehow intermediate between those of the BF and the added solid NPs. The improved heat transfer using NFs results in increased energy conversion efficiency, which results in reduced energy consumption for heating or cooling applications. BF and their environmental impacts (EIs) have been widely discussed within the scope of their applications as a HTF, with most of the attention given to the improved energy efficiency. The IEs of NPs and their toxicity and other characteristics have been extensively studied due to the widespread applications on newly engineered NPs. However, with the evolution of expanding the applications of NFs, the different EIs were not well addressed. The discussion should consider both the base fluid and NPs added in combination as the NF constitutes. The current work presents a brief discussion on the EIs of NFs. The discussion presented in this work considers the NPs as the primary contributor to the EIs of different NFs. It was found that the EIs of NFs depend significantly on the type of NP used, followed by the BF, and finally, the loading of NPs in BF. The use of non-toxic and naturally occurring NPs at lower NPs loading in water as NF promises a much lower EIs in terms of toxicity energy requirements for production, and other EIs, while still maintaining high thermal performance. The production methods of both NPs, i.e., synthesis route, and NF, i.e., one-step or two-step, were found to have a significant effect on the associated EIs of the produced NF. The simpler NP synthesis route and NF production will result in much lower chemicals and energy requirements, which in turn reduce the EIs.","Elsaid, Khaled; Olabi, A G; Wilberforce, Tabbi; Abdelkareem, Mohammad Ali; Sayed, Enas Taha",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385840/,68
103034,Culture of Care Enhancement in Egypt: The Impact of Laboratory Animal Science Training on Participants' Attitudes.,2021-05-13,"INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND Xeroform® is a petrolatum-based fine mesh gauze containing 3% bismuth tribromophenate. Bismuth, similar to other metals, has antimicrobial properties. Xeroform® has been used for decades in burn and plastic surgery as a donor site dressing and as a covering for wounds or partial thickness burns. Despite this, the antimicrobial spectrum of Xeroform® remains largely unknown. We examined the in-vitro efficacy of Xeroform® against common burn pathogens using zone-of-inhibition methodology in a commercial research facility. METHODS/DESIGN Pure strains of 15 common burn pathogens including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, Acinetobacter baumennii, Klebsiella pneumonia, Extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella, Beta hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Salmonella enterica ssp. Enterica were inoculated at a strength of 106-1010 CFU/ml onto appropriate agar plates. A sterile 1 in2 Xeroform® square was placed in the center of each plate, and the Zone of Inhibition (ZOI) was measured following 18-24h of incubation at 37°C. A second bismuth pharmaceutical (bismuth subsalicylate, Pepto-Bismol®) was then tested using the same methodology against the same strains of MRSA, MSSA, E. coli, K. pneumonia and S. marcescens. Finally, 3% w/v bismuth tribromophenate in glycerol suspension was tested against 13 burn pathogens for antimicrobial activity independent of the Xeroform® dressing by measure of Zone of Inhibition. RESULTS/FINDINGS For Xeroform®, none of the fifteen pathogens had a measurable zone of inhibition on any plate. Bismuth subsalicylate showed a zone of inhibition for MSSA in 3 plates (mean of 47.2mm), in one of three plates for MRSA (13.8mm), and in one of three plates for S. marcesens (89.6mm). There was no zone of inhibition seen for K. pneumonia or E. coli. Bismuth tribromophenate, when not bound to Xeroform® showed activity against 12 of 13 pathogens. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS While bismuth subsalicylate, and bismuth tribromophenate unbound to Xeroform® demonstrate antimicrobial activity, it appears that Xeroform® dressings do not. The utility of Xeroform® in burn medicine may relate more to use as an impervious dressing than to antimicrobial effect. Donor sites are clean surgical wounds and clean partial thickness burns may have minimal colonization present. In such circumstances, an inactive and impervious dressing may be all that is necessary to promote wound healing.","Barillo, David J; Barillo, Anthony R; Korn, Sarah; Lam, Kan; Attar, Paul S",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.burns.2016.10.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28641915/,68
103202,Fair algorithms for selecting citizens' assemblies.,2021-08-04,"With only 536 cases and 11 fatalities, India took the historic decision of a 21-day national lockdown on March 25. The lockdown was first extended to May 3 soon after the analysis of this paper was completed, and then to May 18 while this paper was being revised. In this paper, we use a Bayesian extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (eSIR) model designed for intervention forecasting to study the short- and long-term impact of an initial 21-day lockdown on the total number of COVID-19 infections in India compared to other less severe non-pharmaceutical interventions. We compare effects of hypothetical durations of lockdown on reducing the number of active and new infections. We find that the lockdown, if implemented correctly, can reduce the total number of cases in the short term, and buy India invaluable time to prepare its healthcare and disease-monitoring system. Our analysis shows we need to have some measures of suppression in place after the lockdown for increased benefit (as measured by reduction in the number of cases). A longer lockdown between 42-56 days is preferable to substantially ""flatten the curve"" when compared to 21-28 days of lockdown. Our models focus solely on projecting the number of COVID-19 infections and, thus, inform policymakers about one aspect of this multi-faceted decision-making problem.

It was the first event of its kind to be hosted at the new research center, which was constructed to boost drug discovery and development in the KSA in collaboration with institutions, such as the Academic Drug Discovery Consortium in the United States of America (USA), Structural Genomics Consortium of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom (UK), and Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in China. The program was divided into two parts. A pre-symposium day took place on October 10, during which courses were conducted on clinical trials, preclinical drug discovery, molecular biology and nanofiber research. The attendees had the opportunity for one-to-one meetings with international experts to exchange information and foster collaborations. In the second part of the conference, which took place on October 11 and 12, the clinical trials pipeline, design and recruitment of volunteers, and economic impact of clinical trials were discussed. The Saudi Food and Drug Administration presented the regulations governing clinical trials in the KSA. The process of preclinical drug discovery from small molecules, cellular and immunologic therapies, and approaches to identifying new targets were also presented. The recommendation of the conference was that researchers in the KSA must invest more fund, talents and infrastructure to lead the region in phase I clinical trials and preclinical drug discovery.

Although the potential to further develop this technology is clear, the limitations of commercially available devices are poorly understood. This systematic review examines the current utilisation of advanced bipolar RF fusion technology for non-vascular applications in thoracic and abdominal tissues and organs. METHODS Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane library databases were searched. Studies examining the non-vascular application of advanced bipolar RF technology in the abdomen and thorax were assessed. Measurement of seal sufficiency and the extent of tissue injury induced by bipolar RF energy application were the main outcomes of interest. RESULTS Forty-six animal and human studies conducted in and ex vivo across a range of tissue types, met the inclusion criteria. The diversity of study protocols together with the heterogeneity of their outcomes prevented pooled analysis. However, the experimental animal studies assessed suggest that bipolar RF fusion devices are capable of effectively sealing most tissue types with the notable exception of large caliber bronchi (>4 mm) and bile ducts, where the rate of seal failure was unacceptably high. Human studies were additionally found to predominantly use bipolar RF technology as a means of parenchymal and ductal occlusion. A similar trend was seen amongst animal studies with only a handful of papers examining bipolar RF energy use for (bowel) anastomosis. CONCLUSION Bipolar RF fusion devices are capable of safely sealing a variety of thoracic and anterior abdominal tissues with an injury and leakage profile comparable to established technologies. Although thermal monitoring is increasingly sophisticated and multimodal, consistent real time tracking of a multitude of parameters is necessary in order to expand RF fusion technology utilisation to complete an array of tasks such as vessel ligation, ductal obliteration and anastomosis in the open and laparoscopic environments.","Arya, Shobhit; Mackenzie, Hugh; Hanna, George B",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3893-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25407912/,68

Such switches are often based on clinical judgment or experience, but it is preferable to base such decisions on valid empirical data when available. The first part of this two-part series described findings from early sequential treatment trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to illustrate how data derived from suboptimally designed trials pro-duce only the appearance of knowledge rather than reliable knowledge. Although these early trials suggested that 50% to 60% of patients who had not benefited from one SSRI could benefit when switched to a second SSRI, this conclusion is not supported by pharmacologic data or recent research findings. Part I of this series reviewed differences between treatment in clinical trials and routine practice settings that might account for those discrepancies. This second part of the series describes five different types of study designs, ranging from the least to the most rigorous, to help clinicians decide how much credence to give to results produced by these different types of studies and thus how to better recognize when studies are providing the appearance rather than the substance of knowledge.

103754,Acute traumatic patellar tendon rupture: Early and late results of surgical treatment of 38 cases.,2015,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is the preferred contemporary procedure for the surgical management of a significant apical pelvic organ prolapse. In the presence of a uterus it is possible for the patient to have subtotal hysterectomy and cervicopexy, total hysterectomy with colpopexy or uterine conservation and hysteropexy. However, hysteropexy seems to be associated with a higher risk of anterior compartment failure compared with cervicopexy or colpopexy. It is not uncommon for an asymmetrically large anterior compartment defect to co-exist with a symptomatic apical pelvic organ prolapse. In a cervicopexy or colpopexy, this asymmetry can be balanced by creating a de novo vaginal apex from the superior part of the anterior vaginal wall. However in a hysteropexy the attachment of the base of the anterior mesh to the vagina and cervical isthmus limits the ability to do this. METHODS In this video we present a solution where the shape of the posterior mesh is modified to include two horizontal arms that are passed through openings in the broad ligament and attached to the cervical isthmus anteriorly. RESULTS This frees the anterior Y-shaped mesh to be fixed to the anterior vaginal wall only and hence provides the required tension to create the de novo apex.

OBJECTIVE To describe the techniques of RPL and RNL, and present multi-center outcome data for patients undergoing these procedures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was a retrospective analysis of 27 patients undergoing RPL and RNL at five tertiary academic institutions between 2008 and 2014. SURGICAL PROCEDURE RPL and RNL without use of renal ischemia. MEASUREMENTS We assessed stone clearance by visual assessment and postoperative imaging. We also examined other factors, including complications (Clavien grade), estimated blood loss, operative time, and length of stay. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Twenty-seven patients underwent 28 procedures for a mean renal stone size of 2.74cm (standard deviation: 1.4, range: 0.8-5.8). The mean stone volume was 10.2cm3. RPL accounted for 26 of these procedures. RNL was performed in one patient, while another underwent combined RPL-RNL. Indications included failed previous endourological management (13), staghorn calculi (five), gas containing stone (one), calyceal diverticulum (one), complex urinary tract reconstruction (two), and patient preference (four). The mean patient age was 35.6 yr and mean body mass index was 25.5kg/m2. Mean operative time/console times were 182min and 128min, respectively. The mean estimated blood loss was 38ml. The mean length of stay was 1.7 d. There was no significant change in preoperative and postoperative serum creatinine levels. The overall complication rate was 18.5% (Clavien 1=3.7%; 2=7.4%; 3b=7.4%). The complete stone-free rate was 96%. CONCLUSIONS RPL and RNL are safe and reasonable options for removing renal stones in select patients. In particular, RPL allows the removal of stones without transgressing the parenchyma, reducing potential bleeding and nephron loss. PATIENT SUMMARY The robotic approach allows for complete removal of the renal stone without fragmentation, thereby maximizing chances for complete stone clearance in one procedure.","Swearingen, Ryan; Sood, Akshay; Madi, Rabii; Klaassen, Zachary; Badani, Ketan; Elder, Jack S; Wood, Kyle; Hemal, Ashok; Ghani, Khurshid R",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2016.10.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28085668/,68

The response to ESKD, particularly regarding kidney replacement therapy (KRT), depends on local disease burden, culture, and socioeconomics. Here, we explore geographic variation and global trends in ESKD incidence and prevalence and examine variations in KRT modality, practice patterns, and mortality. We conclude with a discussion on disparities in access to KRT and strategies to reduce ESKD global burden and to improve access to treatment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). SUMMARY From 2003 to 2016, incidence rates of treated ESKD were relatively stable in many higher income countries but rose substantially predominantly in East and Southeast Asia. The prevalence of treated ESKD has increased worldwide, likely due to improving ESKD survival, population demographic shifts, higher prevalence of ESKD risk factors, and increasing KRT access in countries with growing economies. Unadjusted 5-year survival of ESKD patients on KRT was 41% in the USA, 48% in Europe, and 60% in Japan. Dialysis is the predominant KRT in most countries, with hemodialysis being the most common modality. Variations in dialysis practice patterns account for some of the differences in survival outcomes globally. Worldwide, there is a greater prevalence of KRT at higher income levels, and the number of people who die prematurely because of lack of KRT access is estimated at up to 3 times higher than the number who receive treatment. Key Messages: Many people worldwide in need of KRT as a life-sustaining treatment do not receive it, mostly in LMICs where health care resources are severely limited. This large treatment gap demands a focus on population-based prevention strategies and development of affordable and cost-effective KRT. Achieving global equity in KRT access will require concerted efforts in advocating effective public policy, health care delivery, workforce capacity, education, research, and support from the government, private sector, nongovernmental, and professional organizations.","Thurlow, John S; Joshi, Megha; Yan, Guofen; Norris, Keith C; Agodoa, Lawrence Y; Yuan, Christina M; Nee, Robert",American journal of nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000514550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33752206/,68

Antrodia cinnamomea (AC), a well-known Chinese folk medicine in Taiwan, possesses numerous biological capabilities, most notably an anti-tumor effect. However, the clinical use of AC as complementary medicine combined with adjuvant therapy is unexplored. In this case report, we evaluated AC combined with PAL plus FUL to reduce the tumor burden in an MBC patient. PATIENT CONCERNS A Slovenian woman diagnosed with relapsed bone metastases of breast cancer (BC) was unable to undergo surgery and refused radiation therapy due to fear of side effects; she also feared the side effects of adjuvants. However, she was eager to live with a high quality of life. DIAGNOSIS Stage IV, HR-positive/HER2-negative BC with relapse of bone metastases. INTERVENTIONS After diagnosis of relapse of bone metastases, she received adjuvant with PAL plus FUL. Additionally, she chose to take AC orally (10 g/d). OUTCOMES The pain was mostly relieved, and the side effects of adjuvant therapy reduced. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed reduction of tumor size at the fifth month of adjuvant therapy plus AC. After 14 months of adjuvant therapy plus AC, the tumors at the thoracic vertebrae T1 and T3 were found to have shrunk from 35.2 and 12.0 mm to 28.1 and 9.9 mm, respectively. Remarkably, no further metastases were observed. LESSONS According to the circulating tumor cells (CTCs) test data, AC had better anti-tumor efficacy on active tumor cells than PAL plus FUL. Thus, AC could be an effective complementary medicine for adjuvant therapy in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative MBC. Interestingly, continued elevation of carcinoma antigen 15-3 and lactate dehydrogenase levels but decreasing levels of alkaline phosphatase were observed, which may be indicative of the potent efficacy of treatment resulting in massive tumor cell death. The CTCs test may be a sensitive approach to monitor the progression of BC and subsequently evaluate the efficiency of therapy.","Long, Huei; Hu, Chi-Tan; Prijatelj, Vesna; Weng, Ching-Feng",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629666/,68

105105,Effects of level of dietary cation-anion difference and duration of prepartum feeding on performance and metabolism of dairy cows.,2018,"The objective of this study is to use near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) coupled with multivariate chemometric models to monitor granule and tablet quality attributes in the formulation development and manufacturing of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CIP) immediate release tablets. Critical roller compaction process parameters, compression force (CFt), and formulation variables identified from our earlier studies were evaluated in more detail. Multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square (PLS) models were developed during the development stage and used as a control tool to predict the quality of granules and tablets. Validated models were used to monitor and control batches manufactured at different sites to assess their robustness to change. The results showed that roll pressure (RP) and CFt played a critical role in the quality of the granules and the finished product within the range tested. Replacing binder source did not statistically influence the quality attributes of the granules and tablets. However, lubricant type has significantly impacted the granule size. Blend uniformity, crushing force, disintegration time during the manufacturing was predicted using validated PLS regression models with acceptable standard error of prediction (SEP) values, whereas the models resulted in higher SEP for batches obtained from different manufacturing site. From this study, we were able to identify critical factors which could impact the quality attributes of the CIP IR tablets. In summary, we demonstrated the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics as a powerful tool to monitor critical quality attributes (CQA) identified during formulation development.","Kona, Ravikanth; Fahmy, Raafat M; Claycamp, Gregg; Polli, James E; Martinez, Marilyn; Hoag, Stephen W",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-014-0180-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25319052/,68

Here we integrate anonymized, geolocalized mobility data with census and demographic data to build a detailed agent-based model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission in the Boston metropolitan area. We find that a period of strict social distancing followed by a robust level of testing, contact-tracing and household quarantine could keep the disease within the capacity of the healthcare system while enabling the reopening of economic activities. Our results show that a response system based on enhanced testing and contact tracing can have a major role in relaxing social-distancing interventions in the absence of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","Aleta, Alberto; Martín-Corral, David; Pastore Y Piontti, Ana; Ajelli, Marco; Litvinova, Maria; Chinazzi, Matteo; Dean, Natalie E; Halloran, M Elizabeth; Longini, Ira M; Merler, Stefano; Pentland, Alex; Vespignani, Alessandro; Moro, Esteban; Moreno, Yamir",Nature human behaviour,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-0931-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32759985/,68

METHODS A search for articles was conducted in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and LILACS up to June 2021. Studies that assessed excess weight, overweight and obesity in the adult population were eligible. Two authors selected studies, collected data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of excess weight, overweight, and obesity by sex and period of years. Pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in the meta-analysis of the random effects model. Heterogeneity (I2) was investigated by meta-regression and publication bias was investigated by Egger's test. RESULTS A total of 7,938 references were identified in the search strategies, of which eighty-nine studies and nine national surveys, conducted from 1974-2020, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of excess weight in Brazilian adults increased from 33.5% (95% CI: 25.0; 42.6%) in 1974-1990 to 52.5% (95% CI: 47.6; 57.3%) in 2011-2020. The pooled prevalence of overweight in Brazilian adults was 24.6% (95% CI: 18.8; 31.0%) from 1974-1990 and 40.5% (95% CI: 37.0; 43.9%) from 2011-2020. The pooled prevalence of obesity in Brazilian adults increased by 15.0% from 1974-1990 to 2011-2020. The increases were observed for both men and women in almost all periods. The prevalence of excess weight and obesity remained higher among women in all periods. CONCLUSIONS A continuous increase in the prevalence of excess weight, overweight and obesity were observed over the years. The prevalence of excess weight affected half of Brazilian adults in the period from 2011-2020 and both sexes.","Kodaira, Katia; Abe, Flavia Casale; Galvão, Tais Freire; Silva, Marcus Tolentino",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582470/,68

106178,Efficacy of a new bivalent vaccine of porcine circovirus type 2 and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Fostera™ PCV MH) under experimental conditions.,2016,"BACKGROUND Nearly half of child pneumonia deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Microbial communities in the nasopharynx are a reservoir for pneumonia pathogens and remain poorly described in African children. METHODS Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from children with pneumonia (N = 204), children with upper respiratory infection symptoms (N = 55) and healthy children (N = 60) in Botswana between April 2012 and April 2014. We sequenced the V3 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene and used partitioning around medoids to cluster samples into microbiota biotypes. We then used multivariable logistic regression to examine whether microbiota biotypes were associated with pneumonia and upper respiratory infection symptoms. RESULTS Mean ages of children with pneumonia, children with upper respiratory infection symptoms and healthy children were 8.2, 11.4 and 8.0 months, respectively. Clustering of nasopharyngeal microbiota identified 5 distinct biotypes: Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulum-dominant (23%), Haemophilus-dominant (11%), Moraxella-dominant (24%), Staphylococcus-dominant (13%) and Streptococcus-dominant (28%). The Haemophilus-dominant [odds ratio (OR): 13.55; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.10-87.26], the Staphylococcus-dominant (OR: 8.27; 95% CI: 2.13-32.14) and the Streptococcus-dominant (OR: 39.97; 95% CI: 6.63-241.00) biotypes were associated with pneumonia. The Moraxella-dominant (OR: 3.71; 95% CI: 1.09-12.64) and Streptococcus-dominant (OR: 12.26; 95% CI: 1.81-83.06) biotypes were associated with upper respiratory infection symptoms. In children with pneumonia, HIV infection was associated with a lower relative abundance of Dolosigranulum (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Pneumonia and upper respiratory infection symptoms are associated with distinct nasopharyngeal microbiota biotypes in African children. A lower abundance of the commensal genus Dolosigranulum may contribute to the higher pneumonia risk of HIV-infected children.","Kelly, Matthew S; Surette, Michael G; Smieja, Marek; Pernica, Jeffrey M; Rossi, Laura; Luinstra, Kathy; Steenhoff, Andrew P; Feemster, Kristen A; Goldfarb, David M; Arscott-Mills, Tonya; Boiditswe, Sefelani; Rulaganyang, Ikanyeng; Muthoga, Charles; Gaofiwe, Letang; Mazhani, Tiny; Rawls, John F; Cunningham, Coleen K; Shah, Samir S; Seed, Patrick C",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000001607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28399056/,68

Related to the complex nature of chronic pain, treatments have a pharmacological and non-pharmacological approach. Due to the opioid epidemic, alternative therapies have been introduced, and components of the plant Cannabis Sativa, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) have gained recent interest as a choice of treatment. The exact mechanism for CBD is currently unknown, but unlike the CBD's psychoactive counterpart, THC, the side effects of CBD itself have been shown to be overall much more benign. The current pharmaceutical products for the treatment of chronic pain are known as nabiximols, and they contain a ratio of THC combined with CBD, which has been promising.

106451,Surgical outcomes of total thyroidectomy using the LigaSure™ Small Jaw versus LigaSure Precise™: A retrospective study of 2000 consecutive patients.,2017,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has reached an epidemic level globally. Most current treatments ameliorate the hyperglycemic symptom of the disease but are not effective in correcting its underlying cause. One important causal factor of T2D is ectopic accumulation of lipids in metabolically sensitive organs such as liver and muscle. Mitochondrial uncoupling, which reduces cellular energy efficiency and increases lipid oxidation, is an appealing therapeutic strategy. The challenge, however, is to discover safe mitochondrial uncouplers for practical use. Niclosamide is an anthelmintic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that uncouples the mitochondria of parasitic worms. Here we show that niclosamide ethanolamine salt (NEN) uncouples mammalian mitochondria at upper nanomolar concentrations. Oral NEN increases energy expenditure and lipid metabolism in mice. It is also efficacious in preventing and treating hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet. Moreover, it improves glycemic control and delays disease progression in db/db mice. Given the well-documented safety profile of NEN, our study provides a potentially new and practical pharmacological approach for treating T2D.","Tao, Hanlin; Zhang, Yong; Zeng, Xiangang; Shulman, Gerald I; Jin, Shengkan",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282357/,68

106921,Outcome of abdominosacral resection for locally advanced primary and recurrent rectal cancer.,2012,"Background: To describe genetic molecular findings in individuals with congenital nystagmus, foveal hypoplasia, and subnormal vision, with normal ocular pigmentation (absence of diffuse transillumination or transparent retinal pigment typical for albinism). Methods: This is a retrospective, multicenter study of ophthalmic, systemic, and genetic features, as collected from medical records of patients diagnosed with infantile nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia. Ophthalmic findings include best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), biomicroscopic examination, cycloplegic refraction, retinal examination, macular optical coherence tomography, and electroretinography. Genetic information was retrieved from the participating genetic clinics and included ethnicity and molecular diagnosis. Results: Thirty-one individuals met the inclusion criteria and had a secure molecular diagnosis. Mutations in two genes predominated, constituting 77.4% of all the represented genes: SLC38A8 (45.1%) and PAX6 (32.3%). Seventy-eight percent of the subjects who had a measurable BCVA had moderate and severe visual impairment (range 20/80 to 20/270). Most patients with a mutation in SLC38A8 had mild to moderate astigmatism, while most patients with PAX6 mutation had moderate and severe myopia. Patients in the PAX6 group had variable degrees of anterior segment manifestations. Conclusion: In our cohort, the main causative genes for congenital nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia in normally pigmented eyes were SLC38A8 and PAX6. A mild phenotype in PAX6 mutations may be an under-diagnosed cause of nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia. Reaching an accurate genetic diagnosis is essential for both the patients and their family members. This enables predicting disease prognosis, tailoring correct follow-up, and providing genetic counseling and family planning to affected families.","Ehrenberg, Miriam; Bagdonite-Bejarano, Laura; Fulton, Anne B; Orenstein, Naama; Yahalom, Claudia",Ophthalmic genetics,https://doi.org/10.1080/13816810.2021.1888128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594928/,68

107271,Selection of proteins with desired properties from natural proteome libraries using mRNA display.,2011,"BACKGROUND MIRUS™ is a device for target-controlled inhalational sedation in the ICU in combination with use of isoflurane, or sevoflurane, or desflurane. The feasibility of this device has recently been proven; however, ICU staff exposure may restrict its application. We investigated ICU ambient room pollution during daily work to estimate ICU personnel exposure while using MIRUS™. METHODS This observational study assessed pollution levels around 15 adult surgical patients who received volatile anaesthetics-based sedation for a median of 11 hours. Measurements were performed by photoacoustic gas monitoring in real-time at different positions near the patient and in the personnel's breathing zone. Additionally, the impact of the Clean Air™ open reservoir scavenging system on volatile agent pollution was evaluated. RESULTS Baseline concentrations [ppm] during intervention and rest periods were isoflurane c ¯ mean = 0.58 ± 0.49, c ¯ max = 5.72; sevoflurane c ¯ mean = 0.22 ± 0.20, c ¯ max = 7.93; and desflurane c ¯ mean = 0.65 ± 0.57, c ¯ max = 6.65. Refilling MIRUS™ with liquid anaesthetic yielded gas concentrations of c ¯ mean = 2.18 ± 1.48 ppm and c ¯ max = 13.03 ± 9.37 ppm in the personnel's breathing zone. Air pollution in the patient's room was approximately five times higher without a scavenging system. CONCLUSION Ambient room pollution was minimal in most cases, and the measured values were within or below the recommended exposure limits. Caution should be taken during refilling of the MIRUS™ system, as this was accompanied by higher pollution levels. The combined use of air-conditioning and gas scavenging systems is strongly recommended.","Herzog-Niescery, Jennifer; Vogelsang, Heike; Gude, Philipp; Seipp, Hans-Martin; Uhl, Waldemar; Weber, Thomas P; Bellgardt, Martin",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30088264/,68

Leukotrienes (LT), biosynthesized from arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), constitute a potent family of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators. δ-Garcinoic acid (δ-GA) (1), a natural vitamin E analogue, was chosen for further structural optimization as it selectively inhibited 5-LO activity in cell-free and cell-based assays without impairing the production of specialized pro-resolving mediators by 15-LO. A model of semi-quantitative prediction of 5-LO inhibitory potential developed during the current study allowed the design of 24 garcinamides that were semi-synthesized. In accordance with the prediction model, biological evaluations showed that eight compounds potently inhibited human recombinant 5-LO (IC50 < 100 nM).

Radiographs, ECG, blood pressure measurement and echocardiography revealed left-sided congestive heart failure, left ventricular concentric hypertrophy, left atrial dilation, severe diastolic dysfunction, hypotension, and vagotonus-associated sinus bradycardia with a first degree AV-block as well as a right bundle brunch block. NT-ProBNP and troponin I concentrations were elevated (NT-ProBNP > 1500 pmol/l, Troponin I 32.87 ng/ml). Presumptive diagnosis was acute myocarditis. Bartonella henselae PCR and Toxoplasma gondii IgM titer were negative. Initial IgG titer amounted to 1:32 (reference range: < 1:32) and on later testing this was negative. FeLV and FIV tests exhibited negative results. Coronavirus testing was not performed because the cat was vaccinated accordingly. A metastatic infection with Proteus mirabilis, which had been isolated from the urine, appeared possible. Alternatively, a hypersensivity reaction to drugs or a stress-induced myocarditis was taken into consideration. The hospitalized cat was treated with furosemide (initialy and in the course of further treatment), theophyllin (initially), continuous infusion with lactated Ringer's solution, pimobendan, and the addition of enrofloxacin to the ongoing amoxicillin/clavulanic acid administration. After 4 days, the cat's general condition improved satisfactorily and blood pressure returned to normal range. Left ventricular hypertrophy resolved, however, diastolic dysfunction as well as left atrial dilation persisted.

We implemented a surveillance system in hospitals in Bangladesh to screen acutely ill hospitalized patients with severe respiratory infection and meningoencephalitis for zoonotic exposures. Patients were screened for the risk of zoonotic exposures with five questions covering vocational exposures, sick domestic animal and wild animal contact, and date palm sap consumption in the three weeks preceding illness onset. Patients giving at least one positive response were considered a potential zoonotic exposure. From September 2013 to March 2017, a total of 11 429 hospitalized patients across 14 participating hospitals were screened for exposures. Overall, 2% of patients reported a potential zoonotic exposure in the three-week period prior to becoming ill. Sixteen per cent of hospitalized patients with reported exposures died. After routine surveillance diagnostic testing, 88% of patients admitted to the hospital after a potential zoonotic exposure did not have a laboratory diagnosed aetiology for their illness.

Cellular activation through pattern recognition receptors induces interferon production in a wide variety of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types, including dendritic cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and cells of neuronal origin. The relative contribution of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells to the overall interferon response is an important issue which has not been fully addressed. Using irf7(-/-) and wild-type bone marrow chimeras we analyzed the contribution of IFN-I from bone marrow-derived sources in the control of viral infections and immunopathology in mice. We found that during systemic cytopathic virus infection, hematopoietic cells were essential for production of IFN-I, inhibition of viral spread to peripheral organs, and limiting cell damage. In a model of autoimmune diabetes induced by noncytopathic virus infection, hematopoietic cell-derived IFN-I was essential for CD8(+) T cell-dependent cytotoxicity in pancreatic beta-islet cells and induction of diabetes. These data suggest that during systemic viral infection primarily hematopoietic cell-derived IFN-I controls viral replication and viral-induced disease.","Lang, Philipp A; Cervantes-Barragan, Luisa; Verschoor, Admar; Navarini, Alexander A; Recher, Mike; Pellegrini, Marc; Flatz, Lukas; Bergthaler, Andreas; Honda, Kenya; Ludewig, Burkhard; Ohashi, Pamela S; Lang, Karl S",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2007-10-117861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18971424/,68

Materials and Methods Semen ejaculates from nine Black Bengal bucks were collected by artificial vagina (n=20/buck). Ejaculates were evaluated for in vitro sperm characters and electrophoretic profile of seminal protein. In vitro sperm characters were evaluated immediately after collection, after completion of equilibration period, and after freeze-thawing. For seminal protein studies, seminal plasma proteins were precipitated by ice-cold ethanol method, and sperm proteins were extracted by Triton X detergent extraction method. Discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed to assess the molecular weight of seminal proteins. Correlation between in vitro sperm characters and protein bands was determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient, and two-way ANOVA was applied to find the individual buck differences. Results Significant difference (p<0.01) among the bucks was noticed in the in vitro sperm characters evaluated at all the three stages of semen evaluation such as immediately after collection, after completion of equilibration period, and post-freeze thawing. Progressive loss of sperm motility, membrane integrity, and other in vitro sperm characters were noticed during cryopreservation. A total of ten protein bands in the molecular weight ranging from 17 to 180 kDa were found in the SDS-PAGE of seminal plasma proteins, while nine bands of 17-134 kDa were observed in sperm proteins. Seminal plasma proteins of molecular weight 75, 62-49, 20, and 17 kDa and sperm proteins of 75, 20, and 17 kDa were present in all the nine bucks (100%) screened, and variation among the bucks was noticed for the presence of other proteins. Seminal plasma protein of 180-134 kDa showed a negative correlation with individual motility (-0.716) and functional membrane integrity of sperm cells (-0.724) in post-freeze-thaw analysis and 48 kDa protein had a positive correlation with individual motility (0.649) and functional membrane integrity of sperm cells (0.664) in post-thaw analysis.

This article reviews the most relevant viral, bacterial and protozoal diseases and their cutaneous manifestations. Many of the diseases discussed have overlapping presentations or may mimic more common noninfectious disease processes. The purpose of the article is to reinforce knowledge of common and uncommon infectious diseases, help practitioners identify possible infectious dermatoses, create a comprehensive and prioritized differential list, and provide guidance for the diagnosis of these diseases. A working knowledge of these clinical syndromes is important if what is thought to be a case of a common disease does not respond to conventional management. AUDIENCE This review is aimed at veterinarians who treat cats and especially those with an interest in feline dermatology. Tables are included to allow the reader to formulate a concise list of differential diagnoses for clinically similar presentations. The diagnostic approach to a case of ulcerative facial dermatitis is reviewed in a Case Notes quiz. Evidence base: This article includes up-to-date information regarding dermatologic manifestations of less commonly encountered feline cutaneous infectious diseases.

The aim of this study is to review outcomes of patients who underwent laparoscopic GES therapy for diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis at a large referral center. METHODS Patients who underwent GES (Enterra Therapy System; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) implantation with subsequent interrogation and programming between March 2001 and November 2011 were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 113 patients underwent GES placement or revision during the study period. One hundred eleven patients underwent primary GES at our institution, while two patients underwent GES generator revision at our institution. Primary operations were completed laparoscopically in 110 of 111 cases, with one conversion to laparotomy due to severe adhesions. At a mean follow-up of 27 months (1-113), symptom improvement was achieved in 91 patients (80 %) and was similar for both the diabetic and idiopathic subgroups. Need for supplemental nutrition (enteral and/or parental) decreased in both groups. CONCLUSIONS GES placement is feasible using a laparoscopic approach. Medical refractory gastroparesis in the diabetic and idiopathic groups had significant symptom improvement with no difference between the two groups.

Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the vulnerability of human fetuses and infants to the effects of OPs because of their rapid growth and organ development, cell differentiation, and immaturity of metabolism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prenatal exposure to OPs characterized by different physicochemical properties using non-invasive biological samples (meconium and placenta). A total of 88 placenta and 53 meconium samples were collected in Ourense, a city located in northwestern Spain, at the delivery and after birth from mothers and their infants from the University Hospital of Ourense, respectively. Selective pressurized liquid extraction (SPLE) methodologies were used to determine the targeted OPs in the selected biological samples. Cleanup of extracts was performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using EZ-POP cartridges and detection by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (QqQ-MS/MS). The targeted OPs were detected with the following mean level total concentration order polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) > organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) > non-dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDLPCBs) > pyrethroids (PYRs) > polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) > dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls (DLPCBs) > organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) for placenta and ΣNDLPCBs > ΣPAHs > ΣOCPs > ΣPYRs > ΣOPPs > ΣDLPCBs > ΣPBDEs for meconium, respectively. Significant correlations (p < .050) between the socio-demographic characteristics of the selected population (mother's parity, age, weight increase during pregnancy, place of living and smoking habits) and log transformed concentration of some of the targeted OPs (OCPs, PBDEs, PYRs, OPPs and PAHs) were detected. The results obtained shown the complementary information given by both biological samples selected.

In 30% of the cases, PMP realize a widespread involvement of the peritoneal cavity. In these extreme situations, we developed, devoted strategies to optimize the feasibility and safety of CCRS. This study describes the surgical resections required for CCRS and the consequent approaches that we propose to achieve CCRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS We defined ""huge PMP"" by a peritoneal cancer index (PCI) ≥ 28. Surgical procedures of patients operated on between 1994 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed from a prospective database in a single institution. RESULTS During this period, 311 patients were operated on and 247 (79%) underwent CCRS + HIPEC. Among them, 100 patients presented ""huge"" PMP and 54 patients underwent CCRS + HIPEC. In patients with ""huge"" PMP, the rate of CCRS + HIPEC was 25% before 2002 and reached 71% between 2011 and 2014. We identified 3 conditions for CCRS 1) to guaranty a sufficient length of residual small bowel 2) to preserve the left gastric vessels in order to preserve the superior third of the stomach 3) to ensure that the hepatic pedicle can be entirely cleared from its tumor involvement. None of the other peritonectomy procedures were decisional for CCRS. CONCLUSION Our learning curve improved the selection and completion rate of CCRS + HIPEC for ""huge PMP"".

Rheumatic patients are required to engage in effective health management but their behavior is often influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. This cross-sectional study aims to examine patients' experiences during the current pandemic and its implication on their health perception and behavior. METHOD A patient-centered electronic survey was used, randomly sampling rheumatic patients in Saudi Arabia during March and April 2020. Questions included patients' socio-demographics, diseases, medications, COVID-19 knowledge, source of information, fear level, disease activity perception, health care utilization, medication accessibility, and therapeutic compliance (measured using a modified version of Medication Adherence Reporting Scale). Correlation and regression coefficients were used to evaluate associations among the aforementioned variables. RESULTS A total of 637 respondents were included. The majority were rheumatoid arthritis patients (42.7%). Patients' knowledge about COVID-19 was correlated with social media use (P = .012). Fear of COVID-19 infection correlated with healthcare facility for follow-up visits (P = .024) and fear of disease deterioration if contracting the infection correlated with patients' levels of knowledge (P = .035). Both types of fear did not correlate with patients' perceptions of disease activity. However, patients' perceptions of worsened disease activity were correlated with unplanned healthcare visits (P < .001), medication non-adherence, and difficulty accessing medication (P = .010 and .006, respectively).

Only few data are available regarding the impact of Linx on high-resolution manometry (HRM) variables. METHODS The prospectively collected database of patients who underwent Linx procedure at a single institution was queried. All patients who completed pre- and postoperative HRM, GERD health-related quality of life (GERD-HRQL) questionnaire, and functional outcome swallowing scale (FOSS) questionnaire were included in the study. KEY RESULTS Forty-five out of 304 patients were included. At a median follow-up of 12 months (IQR 10) after surgery, a statistically significant increase of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) total length (P = .002), intra-abdominal length (P = .001), integrated relaxation pressure (IRP), intrabolus pressure (IBP), and esophagogastric contractile integral (EGJ-CI) was noted (P < .001). Distal esophageal amplitude (P = .004), mean distal contractile integral (DCI) (P < .001), post multiple repeated swallows DCI (P = .001), and the percent of normal peristalsis increased (P = .040). All patients were relieved of reflux symptoms. Ineffective esophageal motility reversed to normal in 36% of patients after surgery. The only factor significantly associated with postoperative dysphagia was preoperative dysphagia (P = .006). Postoperatively, a significant correlation between IRP and DCI (r = 0.361 and P = .019) and between IBP and DCI (r = 0.443 and P = .003) was found. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES The Linx procedure had a remarkable effect on esophageal motility in the short-term follow-up. It appears that the overall postoperative increase of IRP and IBP may justify the higher DCI values. Preoperative dysphagia was the only factor associated with postoperative dysphagia.","Riva, Carlo Galdino; Siboni, Stefano; Sozzi, Marco; Lazzari, Veronica; Asti, Emanuele; Bonavina, Luigi",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633258/,68

We evaluated how the choice of either a postal or non-postal PVSA submission strategy was associated with compliance to PVSA and effectiveness of vasectomy. METHODS We studied vasectomies performed in the UK from 2008 to 2019, reported in annual audits by Association of Surgeons in Primary Care members. We calculated the difference between the two strategies for compliance with PVSA, and early and late vasectomy failure. We determined compliance by adding the numbers of men with early failure and those given clearance. We performed stratified analyses by the number of test guidance for clearance (one-test/two-test) and the study period (2008-2013/2014-2019). RESULTS Among 58 900 vasectomised men, 32 708 (56%) and 26 192 (44%) were advised submission by postal and non-postal strategies, respectively. Compliance with postal (79.5%) was significantly greater than with non-postal strategy (59.1%), the difference being 20.4% (95% CI 19.7% to 21.2%). In compliant patients, overall early failure detection was lower with postal (0.73%) than with non-postal (0.94%) strategy (-0.22%, 95% CI -0.41% to -0.04%), but this difference was neither clinically nor statistically significant with one-test guidance in 2014-2019. There was no difference in late failure rates. CONCLUSIONS Postal strategy significantly increased compliance to PVSA with similar failure detection rates. This resulted in more individuals receiving clearance or early failure because of the greater percentage of postal samples submitted. Postal strategy warrants inclusion in any future guidelines as a reliable and convenient option.","Atkinson, Melanie; James, Gareth; Bond, Katie; Harcombe, Zoe; Labrecque, Michel",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2021-201064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34321257/,68

Metabolic and hepatorenal biochemistry and the rs9939609 FTO polymorphism were investigated in prepubertal children born with IUGR. Ninety-eight prepubertal children (46 IUGR and 52 AGA), subdivided in <5 years and >5 years old groups were included. Anthropometry; creatinine, eGFR, urea, AST, ALT, triglycerides, uric acid, total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, glucose, C-peptide, insulin and glucagon z-scores; HOMA-IR; leptin and adiponectin concentrations; rs9939609 FTO polymorphism frequency were measured. In males, weight and ALT were higher and adiponectin was lower, in IUGR < 5 years; C-peptide, insulin and leptin were higher in IUGR > 5 years; C-peptide was higher in all IUGR, than the respective AGA. In females, creatinine and triglycerides were higher in IUGR < 5 years old; creatinine was higher and eGFR was lower in all IUGR, than the respective AGA. In males and females, creatinine was higher in all IUGR, than the respective AGA; C-peptide, insulin and HOMA-IR were lower, and AST was higher in IUGR < 5 than in IUGR > 5 years old. FTO rs9939609 frequency did not differ between IUGR and AGA. In conclusion prepubertal males born with IUGR increased weight, insulin and leptin and decreased adiponectin, as compared to males born AGA, emerge as early metabolic syndrome characteristics. The concentrations of these hormones do not differ between prepubertal males and females born with IUGR. Weight control, healthy nutrition and physical exercise should be recommended to these children. The deranged renal (particularly evident in females below the age of 5) and liver biochemistry in prepubertal children born with IUGR suggests that hepatorenal derangements might commence in utero.

The development of valid and reproducible assessment tools is the first step. Medical educators across specialties acknowledge the challenges and remain motivated to develop a relevant, generalizable, and measurable system. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) remains committed to its responsibility to the public by assuring that the process and outcome of graduate medical education in the nation's residency programs produce competent, safe, and compassionate doctors. The Milestones Project is the ACGME's current strategy in the evolution to a competency-based system, which allows each specialty to develop its own set of subcompetencies and 5-level progression, or milestones, along a continuum of novice to expert. The education community has now had nearly 5 years of experience with these rubrics. While not perfect, Milestones 1.0 provided important foundational information and insights. The first iteration of the Anesthesiology Milestones highlighted some mismatch between subcompetencies and current and future clinical practices. They have also highlighted challenges with assessment and evaluation of learners, and the need for faculty development tools. Committed to an iterative process, the ACGME assembled representatives from stakeholder groups within the Anesthesiology community to develop the second generation of Milestones.

This cross-sectional investigation aimed to evaluate associations between religious/spiritual factors and mental health symptoms among community residents in a southern US state. In particular, we focused on perceptions of God's distance, a salient aspect of religious/spiritual struggle that has received little scrutiny in health research. METHODS Participants included 551 respondents assessed during a period of gradual reopening but rising infection rates. Mental health outcomes were assessed using standardized measures of generalized anxiety, depression, and trauma symptoms. Perceptions of an affirming relationship with God, anger at God, and disappointment at God's distance were evaluated using an adapted version of the Attitudes-Toward-God Scale-9. RESULTS In multivariate analyses that accounted for pandemic-related and demographic factors, positive relationships with God were related to diminished symptoms on all three mental heatlh indices (all p's ≤.003), whereas disappointment with God's distance was associated with more pronounced difficulties (all p's ≤.014). LIMTATIONS The cross-sectional design precludes causal conclusions. CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that perceived relationships with God are tied to clinically relevant mental health outcomes during periods of major upheaval. Disappointment with God's distance may be an important, understudied dimension of religious/spiritual struggle meriting further investigation.","Sherman, Allen C; Park, Crystal L; Salsman, John M; Williams, Mark L; Amick, Benjamin C; Hudson, Teresa J; Messias, Erick L; Simonton-Atchley, Stephanie",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34217962/,68

Design, Setting, and Participants The Vitamin E in Neuroprotection Study (VENUS) was a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that recruited participants from January 30, 2011, to December 7, 2014, with 12 months of follow-up. This trial screened 14 289 patients with diabetes from 6 health clinics and ambulatory care units from 5 public hospitals in Malaysia. A total of 391 patients who reported neuropathic symptoms were further assessed with Total Symptom Score (TSS) and Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS). Patients 20 years or older with a TSS of 3 or higher and an NIS of 2 or higher were recruited. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive 200 mg of mixed tocotrienols twice daily or matching placebo for 12 months. Patients with hyperhomocysteinemia (homocysteine level ≥2.03 mg/L) received oral folic acid, 5 mg once daily, and methylcobalamin, 500 μg thrice daily, in both groups. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was patient-reported neuropathy TSS (lancinating pain, burning pain, paresthesia, and asleep numbness) changes at 12 months. The secondary outcomes were NIS and sensory nerve conduction test result. Results Of 391 eligible patients, 300 were recruited (130 [43.3%] male; mean [SD] age, 57.6 [8.9] years; mean [SD] duration of diabetes, 11.4 [7.8] years) and 229 (76.3%) completed the trial. The TSS changes between the tocotrienols and placebo groups at 12 months (-0.30; 95% CI, -1.16 to 0.56; P = .49) were similar. No significant differences in NIS (0.60; 95% CI, -1.37 to 2.65; P = .53) and sensory nerve conduction test assessments were found between both groups. In post hoc subgroup analyses, tocotrienols reduced lancinating pain among patients with hemoglobin A1C levels greater than 8% (P = .03) and normohomocysteinemia (homocysteine level <2.03 mg/L; P = .008) at 1 year. Serious adverse events in both groups were similar, except more infections were observed in the tocotrienols group (6.7% vs 0.7%, P = .04). Results reported were of modified intention-to-treat analyses. Conclusions and Relevance Supplementation of oral mixed tocotrienols, 400 mg/d for 1 year, did not improve overall neuropathic symptoms. The preliminary observations on lancinating pain among subsets of patients require further exploration.

114715,The Relevance of and Surgical Approach to the Suprahyoid Region in Thyroglossal Duct Surgery.,2020-07-15,"STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE To determine whether bed rest is a risk factor for specific medical complications. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Flat bed rest after incidental durotomy is commonly used to reduce the risk of CSF leakage and associated complications. METHODS Retrospective case series of consecutive patients after lumbar laminectomy were identified. Medical records were reviewed for duration of bed rest and complications (pulmonary, wound, neurological, gastrointestinal, and urinary) in the chart notes, repair methods, subfascial drain placement, consultant notes, imaging reports, and discharge summaries. Patients were compared with duration of bed rest >24 hours versus duration of bed rest ≤24 hours. The incidence of complications was compared between groups using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS There were a total of 42 patients with incidental durotomy. There were 18 patients in the bed rest ≤24 hours group and 24 patients in the bed rest >24 hours group. Comparing the bed rest ≤24 hours to bed rest >24 hours patients, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of postdurotomy-related neurological complications, wound complications, and need for revision surgery. There was a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of total medical complications in the ≤24-hour group (0% vs. 50%, P=0.0003). CONCLUSION There was an increased incidence of medical complications in the bed rest group >24 hours. Flat bed rest after modern dural repair method may not be a necessity in all cases and may be associated with a higher incidence of medical complications.","Radcliff, Kristen E; Sidhu, Gursukhman D S; Kepler, Christopher K; Gruskay, Jordan; Anderson, David Greg; Hilibrand, Alan; Albert, Todd J; Vaccaro, Alexander R",Clinical spine surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/bsd.0b013e31827d7ad8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23197257/,68

115022,"[Paramecium, a model organism to study ciliogenesis and ciliopathies].",2021,"The Medicare program has transitioned to paying healthcare providers based on the quality of care delivered, not on the quantity. In May 2015, SAGES held its first ever Quality Summit. The goal of this meeting was to provide us with the information necessary to put together a strategic plan for our Society over the next 3-5 years, and to participate actively on a national level to help develop valid measures of quality of surgery. The transition to value-based medicine requires that providers are now measured and reimbursed based on the quality of services they provide rather than the quantity of patients in their care. As of 2014, quality measures must cover 3 of the 6 available National Quality domains. Physician quality reporting system measures are created via a vigorous process which is initiated by the proposal of the quality measure and subsequent validation. Commercial, non-profit, and governmental agencies have now been engaged in the measurement of hospital performance through structural measures, process measures, and increasingly with outcomes measures. This more recent focus on outcomes measures have been linked to hospital payments through the Value-Based Purchasing program. Outcomes measures of quality drive CMS' new program, MACRA, using two formats: Merit-based incentive programs and alternative payment models. But, the quality of information now available is highly variable and difficult for the average consumer to use. Quality metrics serve to guide efforts to improve performance and for consumer education. Professional organizations such as SAGES play a central role in defining the agenda for improving quality, outcomes, and safety. The mission of SAGES is to improve the quality of patient care through education, research, innovation, and leadership, principally in gastrointestinal and endoscopic surgery.","Lidor, Anne; Telem, Dana; Bower, Curtis; Sinha, Prashant; Orlando, Rocco; Romanelli, John",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5627-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28664439/,68

116226,Genomics and the Evolutionary History of Equids.,2020-11-16,"OBJECTIVE To compared the positive rate of anal swab nucleic acid test and clinical characteristics of critical and general coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS Clinical data of 18 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the First People's Hospital of Lianyungang City from February to March 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into general group (n = 11) and critical ill group (n = 7) according to the severity of the disease. The differences of gender, age, epidemiological characteristics, fever duration after admission, underlaying disease, positive rate of anal swab nucleic acid test at admission and two times of negative pharyngeal swab test were compared between the two groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in gender, age, fever duration after admission or underlaying disease between the two groups. The number of anorectal swab positive cases in critically ill group was significantly higher than that in general group (cases: 4 vs. 1, P = 0.047). After two negative pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test, the number of anal swab positive cases in critical illness group was still higher than that in general group (cases: 2 vs. 0), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.137). The number of non-local infection in critical ill group was significantly higher than that in general group (cases: 4 vs. 0, P = 0.047). All of the 4 non-local infected patients had a history of living in Wuhan. CONCLUSIONS The patients with anorectal swab nucleic acid positive may have a more serious condition. It may be a risk to transfer ill patients out of the isolation ward by the criteria of only two times of negative pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test. Patients returning to our city after infection in Wuhan may be more serious.","Xu, Caiyun; Song, Jiafu; Liu, Suxia; Zheng, Hui; Kang, Xiuwen; Li, Yong; Xu, Huiling; Liu, Kexi",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200611-00631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33198857/,68

In contrast, the equine fossil record shows that an extraordinarily richer diversity existed in the past and provides multiple examples of a highly dynamic evolution punctuated by several waves of explosive radiations and extinctions, cross-continental migrations, and local adaptations. In recent years, genomic technologies have provided new analytical solutions that have enhanced our understanding of equine evolution, including the species radiation within Equus; the extinction dynamics of several lineages; and the domestication history of two individual species, the horse and the donkey.

The infection rapidly spread to more than 200 countries around the world. The clinical presentation of the disease may vary from mild illness to severe pneumonia such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The chest computed tomography (CT) has an important complementary role in diagnosis of the disease. The predominant CT findings of the disease are ground glass opacities and consolidations located in subpleural areas of lower lobes. Widespread ground-glass opacities, consolidation, air bronchograms, central involvement of lung parenchyma, mediastinal lymphadenopathy are more common in patients with the severe form of the disease. CT imaging also guides in differentiation of alternative diagnosis or in assessment of associated pulmonary embolism during the course of the disease.

Coronavirus has now spread to all of the continents. We aimed to consider clinical characteristics, laboratory data of COVID-19 that provided more information for the research of this novel virus. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study on the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of a series of the 100 confirmed patients with COVID-19. These patients were admitted to the hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences (Ayatollah Rohani, Shahid Beheshti and Yahyanejad hospitals) form 25 February 2020 to 12 March 2020. RESULTS Nineteen patients died during hospitalization and 81 were discharged. Non-survivor patients had a significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD: 46.37, 95% CI: 20.84, 71.90; P= 0.001), white blood cells (WBCs) (MD: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.67; P< 0.001) and lower lymphocyte (MD: -8.75, 95% CI: -12.62, -4.87; P< 0.001) compared to survivor patients Data analysis showed that comorbid conditions (aRR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.09, 8.21, P= 0.034), higher CRP levels (aRR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.03, P= 0.044), and lower lymphocyte (aRR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.73, 0.93, P= 0.003) were associated with increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS Based on our findings, most non-survivors are elderly with comorbidities. Lymphopenia and increased levels of WBCs along with elevated CRP were associated with increased risk of death. Therefore, it is best to be regularly assessed these markers during treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Javanian, Mostafa; Bayani, Masomeh; Shokri, Mehran; Sadeghi-Haddad-Zavareh, Mahmoud; Babazadeh, Arefeh; Yeganeh, Babak; Mohseni, Sima; Mehraein, Raheleh; Sepidarkish, Mahdi; Bijani, Ali; Rostami, Ali; Shahbazi, Mehdi; Tabari, Afrooz Monadi; Shabani, Asieh; Masrour-Roudsari, Jila; Hasanpour, Amir Hossein; Gholinejad, Hossein Emam; Ghorbani, Hossein; Ebrahimpour, Soheil",Romanian journal of internal medicine = Revue roumaine de medecine interne,https://doi.org/10.2478/rjim-2020-0013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396143/,68

We evaluated the safety of a new FS in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS Multicentre, open-label Phase II/III RCT to evaluate the safety of the new FS. The trial was approved by the Ethic Committee of each three participating Centre. FS includes two components (component 1: fibrinogen; component 2: thrombin), each of them subjected to two viral inactivation procedures. Out of 200 screened patients, 185 eligible patients (49 females, 136 males), aged between 18 and 75 years, undergoing major thoracic surgery were randomized to receive FS (#91 patients) as an adjuvant for air leak control or no treatment (#94 patients, control group). Safety variables were: percentage of subjects with adverse events associated with the therapy; formation of antibodies against bovine aprotinin; vital signs (blood pressure, body temperature, heart and respiratory rate); laboratory parameters. RESULTS Overall operative mortality was 3.2% (6/185), 1.1% in the FS group and 5.3% in the control group, respectively. Twenty patients (22%) had adverse events in the FS group and 22 (23.4%) in the control group. Atrial fibrillation (five patients in the FS group and four in the control group) and hyperpyrexia (five and seven patients, respectively, in the two groups) were the most common adverse events. No patient reported thromboembolic events (pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) during the in hospital stay or within 1 month from discharge. None of the adverse events was considered as treatment related. The formation of bovine aprotinin antibodies was reported in a total of 34 patients (37.4%) in the FS group and was not related to any adverse effect.

Food insecure people appear to implement several coping strategies and dietary compromises to avoid hunger. Less explored in the literature is how these strategies impact consumption of food inside and outside of the home. METHODS An online survey was completed by adults (n=1292) residing in one of five Australian states. The questionnaire comprised of the six-item US Household Food Security Survey Module, 12 socio-demographic variables and 32 questions related to elements of food literacy. RESULTS Food insecure respondents were more likely to frequent fast food venues (p = 0.002), take away (p <0.001) and food courts (p <0.001) than their food secure counterparts. Food secure respondents reported greater use of raw (p = 0.043) and fresh, pre-prepared produce (p = 0.002) when cooking, whereas food insecure respondents were more likely to prepare food using only frozen, pre-packaged products (p <0.001). No significant differences were found between food security status and the enjoyment and social bonding derived from cooking. CONCLUSIONS Food insecure respondents appeared to be accessing a poorer quality of food through greater consumption of take away and fast food. These dietary compromises are most likely related to perceived financial, time or cooking facilities constraints and to a lesser extent food literacy skills. SO WHAT?: This study highlights some of the health and social inequities apparent within food insecure populations. Food insecure households should be supported to access healthy fresh food and in home cooking practices. While a multi strategy approach is required, healthy food environment policy, particularly in disadvantaged areas, should be considered to guarantee all Australians have dignified access to nutritious food.","Butcher, Lucy M; O'Sullivan, Therese A; Ryan, Maria M; Lo, Johnny; Nyanjom, Julie; Wilkins, Hugh C; Devine, Amanda",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,https://doi.org/10.1002/hpja.427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991748/,68

METHODS Data sources were PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science databases for publications between 2011 and 2016. Publications were included if they studied SDM during the clinical encounter for minority adults in clinical care in the United States. We conducted a narrative, descriptive synthesis of each study. RESULTS From over 5000 publications identified through the search strategy, 18 met eligibility criteria following an abstract and full text (n = 685) review in Covidence. Studies focused on SDM in developing treatment plans (n = 10), and were conducted in primary care (n = 6) or hospital/health system settings (n = 6). Patients' decision preferences ranged from physician-driven altogether or initially, to patient-driven style. A comprehensive list of SDM facilitators and barriers was developed. CONCLUSION Despite strong policy and research SDM support to increase patient communication and a growing published literature, results suggest lack of representation of minority populations in contemporary literature. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Provider training may be needed to facilitate patient-provider transition from a passive toward a more active SDM engagement over time while confidence, trust and rapport is established.","Perez Jolles, Monica; Richmond, Jennifer; Thomas, Kathleen C",Patient education and counseling,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2019.02.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777613/,68

However, the psychological impact of these surgeries has not been fully studied. On one hand, surgical weight loss has been reported to improve standard quality of life and resolution of symptoms of depression. But on the other hand, reports of self-harm and increased ER visits for self-harm suggest other psychological difficulties. Inability to handle anxiety following surgical weight loss has alarming potential ramifications for these gastric surgery patients. In the present study, we used models of diet-induced obesity and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) to ask whether anxiety behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis gene changes were affected by surgical weight loss under two diet regimens: i.e. low-fat diet (LFD) and high-fat diet (HFD). We show reduced exploratory behavior in the open field test but increased time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Furthermore, we show increased plasma levels of corticosterone in female VSG recipients in the estrus phase and increased levels of hypothalamic arginine-vasopressin (avp), pro-opiomelanocortin (pomc), and tyrosine hydroxylase (th). We report reduced dopamine receptor D1 (drd1) gene in prefrontal cortex (PFC) in VSG animals in comparison to Sham. Further we report diet-driven changes in stress-relevant gene targets in the hypothalamus (oxt, pomc, crhr1) and adrenal (nr3c1, nr3c2, mc2r). Taken together, these data suggest a significant impact of both surgical weight loss and diet on the HPA axis and further impact on behavior. Additional assessment is necessary to determine whether molecular and hormonal changes of surgical weight loss are the source of these findings.","Himel, Alexandra R; Cabral, Sharon A; Shaffery, James P; Grayson, Bernadette E",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29979735/,68

Cardiovascular liabilities are not consistently detected in early-stage clinical trials and often become apparent when drugs are administered chronically for extended periods of time. Vital sign data collection outside of the clinic offers an opportunity for deeper physiological characterization of drug candidates and earlier safety signal detection. A working group representing expertise from biopharmaceutical and technology sectors, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) public-private partnerships, academia, and regulators discussed and presented a remote cardiac monitoring case study at the FNIH Biomarkers Consortium Remote Digital Monitoring for Medical Product Development workshop to examine applicability of the biomarker qualification evidentiary framework by the FDA. This use case examined the components of the framework, including the statement of need, the context of use, the state of the evidence, and the benefit/risk profile. Examination of results from 2 clinical trials deploying 510(k)-cleared devices for remote cardiac data collection demonstrated the need for analytical and clinical validity irrespectively of the regulatory status of a device of interest, emphasizing the importance of data collection method assessment in the context of intended use. Additionally, collection of large amounts of ambulatory data also highlighted the need for new statistical methods and contextual information to enable data interpretation. A wider adoption of this approach for drug development purposes will require collaborations across industry, academia, and regulatory agencies to establish methodologies and supportive data sets to enable data interpretation and decision-making.","Izmailova, Elena S; Wood, William A; Liu, Qi; Zipunnikov, Vadim; Bloomfield, Daniel; Homsy, Jason; Hoffmann, Steven C; Wagner, John A; Menetski, Joseph P",Digital biomarkers,https://doi.org/10.1159/000515110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34056520/,68

We investigated whether one person using a handheld aerosolized insecticide could achieve efficacy levels comparable to targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS), using pyrethroid-resistant Aedes aegypti in a semi-field setting with experimental houses in Mexico. The insecticide product (H24, a carbamate and pyrethroid mixture), available over-the-counter locally, was sprayed only on known Ae. aegypti-resting surfaces, for example, walls less than 1.5 m and dark hidden areas. In six identical houses with paired bedrooms, one bedroom was treated, and the other remained an untreated control. Each week for 8 weeks, 100 female pyrethroid-resistant Ae. aegypti were released in each bedroom and followed up daily. Mortality rates in treated bedrooms exceeded 90% for at least 2 weeks, and more than 80% (89.2; 95% CI: 79.98-98.35) for 3 weeks or more. Mortality rates in control houses were zero. Results demonstrate that the immediate impact of TIRS can be delivered by one person using existing products, at an estimated cost for the average household in Mexico of under US$3 per month. Triggered by early outbreak signs, dissemination via community hubs and mass/social media of instructions to treat the home immediately, with monthly re-treatment thereafter, provides a simple means to engage and empower householders. Compatible with integrated vector management strategies, it enables self-protection even if existing agencies falter, a situation exemplified by the potential impact on vector control of the restrictions imposed during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.","Dzib-Florez, Sergio; Ponce-García, Gustavo; Medina-Barreiro, Anuar; González-Olvera, Gabriela; Contreras-Perera, Yamili; Del Castillo-Centeno, Felipe; Ahmed, Ahmed M M; Che-Mendoza, Azael; McCall, Philip J; Vazquez-Prokopec, Gonzalo; Manrique-Saide, Pablo",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32748782/,68

To reduce the interpersonal transmission of coughed particles, the objective of this study was to analytically and experimentally investigate the performance of downward plane jets with various discharge velocities. Chamber measurements were conducted to examine the interaction between a transient cough jet (discharge velocities of 12 m/sec and 16 m/sec) and a steady downward plane jet (discharge velocities from 1.0-8.5 m/sec) with respect to the transport of and human exposure to coughed particles. The results show that a relatively high-speed cough can easily penetrate a downward plane jet with a discharge velocity of less than 6 m/sec. A downward plane jet with a discharge velocity of 8.5 m/sec can bend the cough jet to a certain extent. In this study, momentum comparison of the cough jet and the downward plane jet shows that the value of personal exposure to coughed particles depends on the ratio of jet momentums. The results show that when the two momentums are equivalent or if the downward plane jet has a greater momentum, the cough jet is deflected downward and does not reach the breathing zone of the target thermal dummy. Using the ratio of the two momentums, it may be estimated whether the transmission of a cough jet can be controlled. A trajectory model was developed based on the ratio of the two momentums of a cough jet and a downward jet and was validated using the experimental data. In addition, the predicted trajectory of the cough jet agreed well with the results from smoke visualization experiments. This model can be used to guide the design of downward plane jet systems for protection of occupants from coughed particles.","Cao, Guangyu; Liu, Shichao; Boor, Brandon E; Novoselac, Atila",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2017.1316383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28557668/,68

Coagulation dysfunction is a hallmark in patients with COVID-19. Fulminant thrombotic complications emerge as critical issues in patients with severe COVID-19. Objective: To present a review of the literature and discuss the mechanisms of COVID-19 underlying coagulation activation and the implications for anticoagulant and thrombolytic treatment in the management of COVID-19. Data Sources: We performed a systemic review of scientific papers on the topic of COVID-19, online available via the PubMed NCBI, medRxiv, and Preprints as of May 15, 2020. We also shared our experience on the management of thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: COVID-19-associated coagulopathy ranges from mild laboratory alterations to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with a predominant phenotype of thrombotic/multiple organ failure. Characteristically, high D-dimer levels on admission and/or continuously increasing concentrations of D-dimer is associated with disease progression and poor overall survival. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the immune-hemostatic response. Drastic inflammatory responses including, but not limited to, cytokine storm, vasculopathy, and NETosis may contribute to an overwhelming activation of coagulation. Hypercoagulability and systemic thrombotic complications necessitate anticoagulant and thrombolytic interventions, which provide opportunities to prevent or reduce ""excessive"" thrombin generation, while preserving ""adaptive"" hemostasis and bring additional benefit via their anti-inflammatory effect in the setting of COVID-19.","Fei, Yang; Tang, Ning; Liu, Hefei; Cao, Wenjing",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0324-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32551814/,68

Thus, for example, physicians must not exploit the patient-physician relationship for personal financial gain through the practice of self-referral. But how far does the duty to patient welfare extend? Must physicians assume a serious risk to their own health to ensure that patients receive needed care? In the past, physicians were expected to provide care during pandemics without regard to the risk to their own health. In recent decades, however, the duty to treat during pandemics has suffered from erosion even while the risks to physicians from meeting the duty has gone down. After exploring the historical evolution of the duty to treat and the reasons for the duty, I conclude that restoring a strong duty to treat would protect patient welfare without subjecting physicians to undue health risks.","Orentlicher, David",American journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2018.304582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30252517/,68

Addavax-adjuvanted sRSV vaccination induced higher levels of IgG1 isotype antibodies and more effective lung viral clearance upon RSV infection but promoted enhanced respiratory disease of weight loss, pulmonary inflammation, and NK and NK T (NKT) cell infiltrations in the lungs. Antibody treatment depleting NK cells prior to RSV infection resulted in preventing severe weight loss and histopathology, as well as attenuating infiltration of dendritic cell subsets and TNF-α+ T cells in the lungs.

More recently, these higher rates have been attributed to underlying social, structural, and environmental determinants of health including resource inequities, inadequate housing, and occupational and environmental hazards that result in greater exposure to and less protection from COVID-19. 5,6 Augmented by the added physiologic stress of pregnancy, these comorbidities and disparities compound the risk of pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy, thromboembolism, and hemorrhage, often resulting in lasting physical and mental health consequences.","Stratton, Pamela; Gorodetsky, Elena; Clayton, Janine",Journal of the National Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2021.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883068/,68

A scattering program has been implemented to carry out calculations of RA cross sections, accounting for coupled dynamics on the lowest ionic and the lowest neutral diabatic 1Σ+ states. The study shows that the non-adiabatic treatment gives a cross section that exceeds that of conventional adiabatic dynamics by one to four orders of magnitude. The contribution to the RA rate constant from Na and Cl approaching each other in the A1Π state has also been computed using an established quantum mechanical method.

This study describes the adaptation of the in-person curriculum to a streamlined, online format, in the setting of the Covid19 pandemic. We hypothesized that high levels of skill proficiency and learner satisfaction observed in previous in-person cohorts would be sustained amongst trainees in the online setting. OBJECTIVE Our primary aim was to assess the skills proficiency of a cohort of internal medicine interns undergoing online training for GOC discussions with the 3-Act Model. Our secondary goal was to assess learners' satisfaction with the pre-recorded didactic video and online role plays. METHODS Our team used REDCap for the data collection, and as the user-facing hub for learners to access didactic video content and for submitting surveys. We used Zoom to host synchronous discussions and role-play sessions. Trainers used the previously validated Goals of Care Assessment Tool (GCAT) to objectively rate intern proficiency in 2 role plays each. RESULTS Twenty-one internal medicine interns began the training; 20 completed the training and were assessed using the GCAT. All but 1 intern who completed the training (19 of 20, 95%) achieved proficiency in leading a GOC discussion as measured objectively using the GCAT. Learner satisfaction was high: (i) 100% of respondents recommended the training to others as a 'good' (26.7%) or 'outstanding' experience (73.3%); (ii) 93.3% were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' using a online, distance-learning format for the pre-recorded didactic component; (iii) 80% were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' using an online, distance-learning format for the role-play component; and (iv) 93.3% were content with the number of role plays. The amount of time dedicated to this training decreased compared to prior years when done in person (6 hours) - to 4 hours and 40 minutes for learners and under 4 hours for trainers. CONCLUSION After completing the adapted online 3-Act Model training, nearly all learners were scored to be proficient in GOC communication skills and reported high satisfaction with the online curriculum. Achieving high quality more efficiently represents genuine educational value. Further, these online teaching results show that the 3-Act Model training can be delivered to geographically distanced learners.","Roberts, Benjamin; Mehta, Ambereen K; McWhirter, Michelle; Dy, Sydney Morss; Wright, Scott M; Wu, David Shih",Journal of pain and symptom management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.02.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33587992/,68

Here, we review recent advancements in RTK structure determination and in the understanding of RTK activation. We argue that further progress in the field will necessitate new ways of thinking, and we introduce the concept that RTK dimers explore ensembles of microstates, each characterized by different kinase domain dimer conformations, but the same extracellular domain dimer structure. Many microstates are phosphorylation-competent and ensure the phosphorylation of one specific tyrosine. The prevalence of each microstate correlates with its stability. A switch in ligand will lead to a switch in the extracellular domain configuration and to a subsequent switch in the ensemble of microstates. This model can explain how different ligands produce specific phosphorylation patterns, how receptor overexpression leads to enhanced signaling even in the absence of activating ligands, and why RTK kinase domain structures have remained unresolved in cryogenic electron microscopy studies.","Karl, Kelly; Hristova, Kalina",Current opinion in structural biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2021.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399300/,68

Biological impoverishment, habitat fragmentation, climate change, increasing toxification, and the rapid global movement of people and other living organisms have worked synergistically to diminish ecosystem function. This has resulted in unprecedented levels of disease emergence driven by human-induced environmental degradation, which poses a threat to the survival and health of biodiversity. What is often overlooked in the discussion of the health consequences to humans is that critically endangered wildlife species are at grave risk of extinction by disease outbreaks. As habitat becomes more compressed and with migration routes cut off, gene pools of small species are stranded in isolated habitat fragments. Species now are vulnerable to encroachment, malnutrition, environmental pollutants, and epidemics from domestic animals and humans. Furthermore, the continuous degradation of ecosystems is leading to increased stress, immunosuppression, and greater susceptibility to disease. Disease can be catastrophic to a diminished stressed population, becoming in some instances the leading factor of local, regional, and global extinctions. The strategies of the new field of conservation medicine include long-term monitoring, health assessment, and interventions to protect species at risk. We particularly must minimize the threat of any potentially catastrophic disease outbreaks resulting from anthropogenic changes to the environment.

A new nonhuman primate stroke model was developed by using endovascular trapping techniques to limit collateral vessels with serial MR imaging and neurologic assessments. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight adult rhesus monkeys (female, 7-13 years of age) underwent MR imaging and Spetzler neurologic assessment followed by endovascular stroke induction consisting of superselective endovascular placement of surgical silk sutures into the right MCA by using a trapping technique. Two initial subjects were euthanized immediately following postocclusion MR imaging. The subsequent 6 subjects recovered and underwent follow-up MR imaging and Spetzler neurologic assessments at 48 hours, with 4 being followed to 96 hours. Stroke infarct volumes were measured, and the longitudinal Spetzler clinical neurologic scores were assessed. The brain tissues were harvested and prepared with hematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS Focal permanent cerebral ischemia was induced in the targeted right MCA territory in all subjects. The volumes of the ischemic lesions at 6, 48, and 96 hours were 3.18 ± 1.007 mL (standard error of the mean) (n = 8), 6.70 ± 1.666 mL (standard error of the mean) (n = 6), and 7.23 ± 1.371 mL (standard error of the mean) (n = 4). For the survival animals, the immediate postsurgical Spetzler grading score improved from 60.7 at 24 hours to 68.7 at 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS We report a trapping modification to an established endovascular suture stroke model that yielded reproducible ischemia and clinically quantifiable neurologic deficits with no strokes in nontarget areas. This technique may be useful in evaluating translational stroke and penumbral imaging research in addition to preclinical testing of neuroprotective therapies.","Tong, F C; Zhang, X; Kempf, D J; Yepes, M S; Connor-Stroud, F R; Zola, S; Howell, L",AJNR.

The objective of this study was to assess the influence of catheter lumen diameter on TEG parameters with kaolin-activated native blood in a swine haemorrhagic shock model, using standardized sampling techniques. We hypothesized that one or more TEG parameters will differ between venous samples collected from catheters with different diameter lumens. Ten male landrace swine were included in the study. Standard cut-down techniques on both femoral veins were performed and catheterized with a 14-gauge (14G) and a 20-gauge (20G) catheter of the same length. Blood withdrawal times were standardized to 3 s and TEG parameters (R, K, α, maximum amplitude, G and coagulation index) were measured or calculated. Significant differences were detected for R (14G < 20G; P = 0.002), K (14G < 20G; P = 0.026), maximum amplitude (14G > 20G; P = 0.02), G (14G > 20G; P = 0.001) and coagulation index (14G > 20G; P < 0.001). No significant differences were measured for α (P = 0.058).

124709,Results of routine shunting and patch closure during carotid endarterectomy.,2012,"BACKGROUND According to the current guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology, patients with left-sided infective endocarditis are treated with intravenous antibiotics for 4-6 weeks, leading to extensive hospital stay and high costs. Recently, the Partial Oral Treatment of Endocarditis (POET) trial suggested that partial oral treatment is effective and safe in selected patients. Here, we investigated if such patients are seen in our daily clinical practice. METHODS We enrolled 119 adult patients diagnosed with left-sided infective endocarditis in a retrospective, observational study. We identified those that would be eligible for switching to partial oral antibiotic treatment as defined in the POET trial (e.g. stable clinical condition without signs of infection). Secondary objectives were to provide insight into the time until each patient was eligible for partial oral treatment, and to determine parameters of longer hospital stay and/or need for extended intravenous antibiotic treatment. RESULTS Applying the POET selection criteria, the condition of 38 patients (32%) was stable enough to switch them to partial oral treatment, of which 18 (47.3%), 8 (21.1%), 9 (23.7%) and 3 patients (7.9%) were eligible for switching after 10, 14, 21 days or 28 days of intravenous treatment, respectively. CONCLUSION One-third of patients who presented with left-sided endocarditis in routine clinical practice were possible candidates for switching to partial oral treatment. This could have major implications for both the patient's quality of life and healthcare costs. These results offer an interesting perspective for implementation of such a strategy, which should be accompanied by a prospective cost-effectiveness analysis.","Vroon, J C; Liesdek, O C D; Boel, C H E; Arends, J E; Niessen, F A; van Heusden, H C; Cramer, M J; van der Spoel, T I G; Chamuleau, S A J",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-020-01490-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940869/,68
124797,Symposium 8.,2020,"Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based treatment for borderline personality disorder and other problems associated with emotional dysregulation. It has traditionally been deployed as a face-to-face programme comprised of attendance at group skills training, individual therapy and phone coaching. Social distancing measures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic led to a cessation of therapeutic programmes in many places. This survey of DBT clinicians in a regional State mental health service in Australia explored the impact of the cessation of DBT programmes in the region and obstacles to engaging with people via online platforms. Clinicians have been able to engage in DBT informed care, but it was perceived that many people have experienced a clinical deterioration or have increased their use of crisis services, which is entirely appropriate, as group skills programmes have ceased. Movement to online platforms of delivery poses problems, as some people do not have the access to internet or privacy in their home environments to engage in online therapy. Ideally, clinicians need to be supported through education, supervision and coaching in the use of telehealth interventions. Social distancing requirements has enabled an opportunity to carefully consider how programmes can be adapted to enable the extension of these programmes to those who have traditionally been unable to access them.","Lakeman, R; Crighton, J",Issues in mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2020.1817208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32931341/,68
124911,Unraveling peak asymmetry in chromatography through stochastic theory powered Monte Carlo simulations.,2020-08-16,"PURPOSE Inflammatory edema after ischemia-reperfusion may impair renal allograft function after kidney transplantation. This study examines the effect of edema-related pressure elevation on renal function and describes a simple method to relieve pressure within the renal compartment. METHODS Subcapsular pressure at 6, 12, 24, 48 hr, and 18 days after a 45 min warm ischemia was determined in a murine model of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Renal function was measured by Tc-MAG3 scintigraphy and laser Doppler perfusion. Structural damage was assessed by histologic analysis. As a therapeutic approach, parenchymal pressure was relieved by a standardized circular 0.3 mm incision at the lower pole of the kidney capsule. RESULTS Compared with baseline (0.9+/-0.3 mm Hg), prolonged ischemia was associated with a sevenfold increase in subcapsular pressure 6 hr after ischemia (7.0+/-1.0 mm Hg; P<0.001). Pressure levels remained significantly elevated for 24 hr. Without therapy, a significant decrease in functional parameters was found with considerably reduced tubular excretion rate (33+/-3.5%, P<0.001) and renal perfusion (64.5+/-6.8%, P<0.005). Histologically, severe tissue damage was found. Surgical pressure relief was able to significantly prevent loss of tubular excretion rate (62.5+/-6.8%, P<0.05) and renal blood flow (96.2+/-4.8%; P<0.05) and preserved the integrity of renal structures. CONCLUSIONS Our data support the hypothesis of the existence of a renal compartment syndrome as a consequence of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Surgical pressure relief effectively prevented functional and structural renal impairment, and we speculate that this approach might be of value for improving graft function after renal transplantation.","Herrler, Tanja; Tischer, Anne; Meyer, Andreas; Feiler, Sergej; Guba, Markus; Nowak, Sebastian; Rentsch, Markus; Bartenstein, Peter; Hacker, Marcus; Jauch, Karl-Walter",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0b013e3181c40aba; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20061917/,68

The MS program is focused on specific uncertainties about the real effect, safety, costs, and routine use of new and insufficiently assessed relevant medical devices carefully selected to ensure the value of the additional research needed, by means of structured, controlled, participative, and transparent procedures. However, despite a clear political commitment and economic support from national and regional health authorities, several difficulties were identified along the development and implementation of the first wave of MS, delaying its execution and final reporting. Resolution of these difficulties at the regional and national levels and a greater collaborative impulse in the European Union, given the availability of an appropriate methodological framework already provided by EUnetHTA, might provide a faster and more efficient comparative RWE of improved quality and reliability at the national and international levels.","Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro; Gutierrez-Ibarluzea, Iñaki; Díaz, Pilar; Imaz-Iglesia, Iñaki; González-Enríquez, Jesús; Castro, José Luis; Espallargues, Mireia; García-Armesto, Sandra; Arriola-Bolado, Paloma; Rivero-Santana, Amado; Perestelo-Pérez, Lilisbeth; González-Pacheco, Himar; Álvarez-Pérez, Yolanda; Faraldo-Vallés, María José; Puñal-Riobóo, Janet; Ramallo-Fariña, Yolanda; Sánchez-Gómez, Luis María; Asua-Batarrita, José; Reviriego-Rodrigo, Eva; Moreno-Rodríguez, Anai; Juárez-Rojo, Celia; Vicente-Saiz, Marisa; Orejas-Pérez, Eugenia; Knabe-Guerra, Jutta; Prieto-Yerro, Isabel; González Del Yerro-Valdés, Cristina",International journal of technology assessment in health care,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462321000295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942712/,68

We performed a retrospective review of 23 patients with intractable haematospermia who were diagnosed with seminal vesicle haematocele and/or calculi by transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy (TSV). Patients' demographics, disease durations, operative times, and MRI and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) results were recorded. McNemar's test was used to compare the positive diagnostic rates of MRI and TRUS. All patients had undergone preoperative seminal vesicle MRI and TRUS to identify the aetiology of the haematospermia. The average age and disease duration were 39.3 years and 24.1 months, respectively. The mean operative time was 81.1 min. The positive result rates for MRI and TRUS were 95.7% (22/23) and 39.1% (9/23), respectively. Compared with TRUS, MRI had a significantly higher preoperative positive diagnostic rate (p < 0.01). These results suggest that MRI should be considered as a method for diagnosing intractable haematospermia in patients when TRUS findings are negative or inconclusive.","Han, Hu; Lei, Hong-En; Zhang, Xiao-Dong; Tian, Long",Andrologia,https://doi.org/10.1111/and.14054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955038/,68

Analysis of the work flow will identify factors contributing to the in-hospital delays. METHODS AND RESULTS In the endovascular arm of the IMS III trial, the following time intervals were calculated: stroke onset to emergency department arrival; emergency department to computed tomography (CT); CT to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator start; intravenous tissue plasminogen activator start to randomization; randomization to groin puncture; groin puncture to thrombus identification; thrombus identification to start of endovascular therapy; and start of endovascular therapy to reperfusion. The effects of enrollment time, CT angiography use, interhospital transfers, and intubation on work flow were evaluated. Delays occurred notably in the time intervals from intravenous tissue plasminogen activator initiation to groin puncture (median 84 minutes) and start of endovascular therapy to reperfusion (median 85 minutes). The CT to groin puncture time was significantly shorter during working hours than after. Times from emergency department to reperfusion and groin puncture to reperfusion decreased over the trial period. Patients with CT angiography had shorter emergency department to reperfusion and onset to reperfusion times. Transfer of patients resulted in a longer onset to reperfusion time compared with those treated in the same center. Age, sex, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and intubation did not affect delays. CONCLUSIONS Important delays were identified before reperfusion in the IMS III trial. Delays decreased as the trial progressed. Use of CT angiography and endovascular treatment in the same center were associated with time savings. These data may help in optimizing work flow in current and future endovascular trials. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

128056,Transvaginal uterine evisceration during labor in a Bengal queen.,2019,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a well-known cause for thromboembolism. Although blood stasis in the left atrium and hypercoagulable state of the blood have been emphasized as important mechanisms, limited attention has been paid to the endocardial changes in maintaining the balance of local coagulation, which may also contribute to the thrombus formation in AF. In the present study, left atrial appendage samples were obtained at heart surgery from nonvalvular AF and non-AF patients without atrial thrombus. Immunohistochemistry for endocardial markers including thrombomodulin (TM) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) was performed and semiquantitatively graded. In immunohistochemistry analysis, decreased expression of TM was found in patients with nonvalvular AF compared with those without AF ( P < .001). There was no difference in TFPI expression between the 2 groups ( P = .213). Patients with TM score of 0 or 1 seemed to have larger left atrial diameter (LAD) than those with TM score of 2 or 3 (44.0 (7.9) vs 40.6 (3.9); P = .009), while no relationship between LAD and TFPI expression was found (43.4 (7.0) vs 42.9 (7.8); P = .485). In conclusion, TM expression in the atrial endocardium is decreased in nonvalvular AF without atrial thrombus, while TFPI expression is not. Downregulated TM expression might be associated with enlarged LAD.","An, Kang; Mei, Ju; Zhu, Jiaquan; Tang, Min",Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1177/1076029617751176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29364003/,68

Psychological measures were assessed before and up to 2 years after the implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D). METHODS AND RESULTS One hundred thirty-two patients were enrolled in this monocentric prospective study (44/88 CRT-D/ICD, mean age 61 ± 14 years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 31 ± 9%, and 29% women). Psychological assessment was performed before device implantation as well as after 5, 12, and 24 months. After device implantation, mean total HFA, HFA-fear, HFA-attention, general anxiety, and QoL improved significantly. Depression and HFA-related avoidance of physical activity did not change. CRT-D patients compared with ICD recipients and women compared with men reported worse QoL at baseline. Younger patients (<median of 63 years) had higher levels of general anxiety and lower levels of HFA-avoidance at baseline than older patients. After 24 months, groups no longer differed from each other on these scores. Patients with a history of shock or anti-tachycardia pacing (shock/ATP; N = 19) reported no improvements in psychological measures and had significantly higher total HFA and HFA-avoidance levels after 2 years than participants without shock/ATP. CONCLUSIONS Anxiety and QoL improved after device implantation, and depression and HFA-avoidance remained unchanged. HFA may be more pronounced after shock/ATP. Psychological counselling in these patients to reduce HFA and increase physical activity should be considered.","Kindermann, Ingrid; Wedegärtner, Sonja Maria; Bernhard, Benedikt; Ukena, Julia; Lenski, Denise; Karbach, Julia; Schwantke, Igor; Ukena, Christian; Böhm, Michael",ESC heart failure,https://doi.org/10.1002/ehf2.13416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047078/,68

The aim of this study was to examine the association between the implementation of discharge planning and the length of stay of acute psychiatric inpatients in Japan. METHODS This retrospective cross-sectional study included 449 patients discharged from the 'psychiatric emergency ward' of 66 hospitals during a two-week period from March 7 to 20, 2011. The assigned nurse or nursing assistant for each patient provided information on the implementation of discharge planning in the hospital stay. RESULTS Approximately one quarter of the 449 patients (n = 122) received no support for coordination with post-discharge community care resources. The 122 patients who had received no support for community care coordination had a significantly lower mean age at admission, a shorter length of stay, and a higher rate of either no follow-up or unidentified post-discharge outpatient service than the other 327 patients. Multilevel linear regression analysis demonstrated a significantly greater length of stay among patients who were older, those who had a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia, those who were admitted compulsorily, those who received hospital outpatient services, and those who received community care coordination support from the assigned nurse or nursing assistant. The implementation of support for community care coordination did not indicate a significant association with these factors, which have been related to an increased risk of psychiatric readmission. CONCLUSION Patients to whom the assigned nurse or nursing assistant provided support on community care coordination experienced a significantly greater length of hospital stay. The implementation of support for community care coordination did not indicate a significant association with these factors, which have been related to an increased risk of psychiatric readmission. The mental health policy should increase focus on discharge planning in the acute psychiatric setting to enhance a link between psychiatric inpatient care and post-discharge community care resources.","Nakanishi, Miharu; Niimura, Junko; Tanoue, Michika; Yamamura, Motoe; Hirata, Toyoaki; Asukai, Nozomu",International journal of mental health systems,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-015-0015-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26029254/,68

Given the global spatial heterogeneity in case-fatality rates, we applied the Blinder-Oaxaca regression decomposition technique to identify how putative sociodemographic, structural, and environmental sources influence variation in case-fatality rates. We show that compositional and associational differences in country-level risk factors explain a substantial proportion of the coronavirus disease 2019-related case-fatality rate gap across nations. Asian countries fair better vis-à-vis case-fatality rate differences mainly due to variation in returns to sociodemographic, structural, and environmental sources among their citizens, relative to those who share similar attributes but live in Europe or North America. The variation in case-fatality rate is driven by Asian populations being better able to buffer the harmful effects of the very risk factors purported to exacerbate the risk of coronavirus disease 2019-related death. The dire circumstances in which we find ourselves demand better understanding of how preexisting conditions across countries contribute to observed disparities in case-fatality rates.","Kranjac, Ashley Wendell; Kranjac, Dinko",Pathogens and global health,https://doi.org/10.1080/20477724.2020.1868824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33380287/,68

However, the exact degree and extent of that obligation, and the various scenarios under which it might be lessened or even cease to exist, have recently become the focus of much discussion and debate. The reason for this emerging debate is twofold: the recent occurrence of pandemic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and H1N1, and the emergence of highly resistant strains of infectious pathogens such as multi and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). Health care providers have been asked to place themselves at risk to an extent many did not foresee when they chose to enter their profession, and many have done so under difficult conditions, often without adequate supplies and support. The present article explores the ethical obligations as well as the reciprocal rights of health care providers who are caring for patients with TB, with a particular focus on drug-resistant strains of the bacterium.

Following the JBI (formerly Joanna Briggs Institute) scoping review framework, we conducted searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science using key search terms: ""health education,"" ""health behavior,"" ""health promotion,"" ""health practice"" AND ""decolonization"" or ""decolonial."" We also conducted targeted searches of key journals to ensure review completeness. For selected articles, we examined the article content, focal population, country context and health condition(s). We assessed for the definition of decolonization (if provided), descriptions of decolonial processes used (if stated), and the application of the decolonial processes (e.g., for research, intervention, or critique, etc.). Characteristics of decolonial processes were grouped by those that were similarly described leading to the generation of common themes of reflection, action, and planning. Our review suggests that no clear norms exist in conceptualizing the definitions and processes of decolonization in the reviewed literature. A small proportion of the articles articulate decolonial processes in manners that are consistent, cohesive and attentive to the goals of decolonization. We believe that this review will encourage public health practitioners to consider meaningful approaches to challenging colonizing structures and engage with community partners to advance the visions of social justice and health equity.","Narasimhan, Subasri; Chandanabhumma, P Paul",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,https://doi.org/10.1177/10901981211010095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080471/,68
130754,"Experimental Solubility, Thermodynamic/Computational Validations, and GastroPlus-Based In Silico Prediction for Subcutaneous Delivery of Rifampicin.",2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widespread since late December 2019, with several symptoms related to the upper and lower respiratory system. However, its cardiac manifestations are less frequently studied. We aimed to analyze the available COVID-19 data on acute cardiac injury, using troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. METHODS We performed a systematic review on Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases until March 25, 2020. Relevant records reporting the incidence of acute cardiac injury as well as troponin and BNP levels were collected from published peer-reviewed articles with further analysis according to the clinical status of the patients (severe, non-severe, and death). RESULTS Eleven records of 1394 individuals were included. The mean age of patients with acute cardiac injury was 56.6 ± 33.4 years (males: 54.3%). The incidence of acute cardiac injury was 15% (95% CI: 11, 20%). Further analysis revealed that dead or severe patients had significantly higher percentages of myocardial injury, compared to non-severe ones (peer-reviewed: 44%, 95% CI: 16, 74% vs. 24%, 95% CI: 15, 34% vs. 5%, 95% CI: 1, 12%, respectively). Mean total troponin was 10.23 pg/mL (95% CI: 5.98, 14.47), while 13% (95% CI: 8%, 18%) of patients had elevated levels. Mean BNP was 216.74 pg/mL (95% CI: 3.27, 430.20). CONCLUSION Acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients is more frequent than what was expected at the beginning of the outbreak. Meanwhile, further studies are needed to investigate the utility of cardiac biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic tools for long-term cardiac complications of this infection.","Vakhshoori, Mehrbod; Heidarpour, Maryam; Shafie, Davood; Taheri, Marzieh; Rezaei, Nima; Sarrafzadegan, Nizal",Archives of Iranian medicine,https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2020.107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33220700/,68

131413,Control of cellular adhesiveness in hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel through varying degrees of phenol moiety crosslinking.,2020-06-30,"Many viruses induce type I interferon responses by activating cytoplasmic RNA sensors, including the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Although two members of the RLR family, RIG-I and MDA5, have been implicated in host control of virus infection, the relative role of each RLR in restricting pathogenesis in vivo remains unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that MAVS, the adaptor central to RLR signaling, is required to trigger innate immune defenses and program adaptive immune responses, which together restrict West Nile virus (WNV) infection in vivo. In this study, we examined the specific contribution of MDA5 in controlling WNV in animals. MDA5(-/-) mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility, as characterized by reduced survival and elevated viral burden in the central nervous system (CNS) at late times after infection, even though small effects on systemic type I interferon response or viral replication were observed in peripheral tissues. Intracranial inoculation studies and infection experiments with primary neurons ex vivo revealed that an absence of MDA5 did not impact viral infection in neurons directly. Rather, subtle defects were observed in CNS-specific CD8(+) T cells in MDA5(-/-) mice. Adoptive transfer into recipient MDA5(+/+) mice established that a non-cell-autonomous deficiency of MDA5 was associated with functional defects in CD8(+) T cells, which resulted in a failure to clear WNV efficiently from CNS tissues. Our studies suggest that MDA5 in the immune priming environment shapes optimal CD8(+) T cell activation and subsequent clearance of WNV from the CNS.","Lazear, Helen M; Pinto, Amelia K; Ramos, Hilario J; Vick, Sarah C; Shrestha, Bimmi; Suthar, Mehul S; Gale, Michael; Diamond, Michael S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01403-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23966390/,68

Methods We performed a retrospective review of sedation service records of 138 intellectually disabled patients (51, mental retardation; 36, autism; 30, brain lesion, 12 genetic diseases, 9 dementia) aged over 15 years and weighing over 30 kg. These patients had received propofol via target-controlled infusion in the special care dental clinic of Seoul National University Dental Hospital from May 2008 to September 2018 for restorative treatment (112), minor surgery (13), prosthodontics (7), periodontics treatment (5), and implant (1). Results For all groups, the duration of dental treatments was 43 ± 18 minutes, total sedation time was 73 ± 23 minutes, and total BIS values was 57 ± 12. The propofol maintenance dosage values for each group were: mental retardation, 3 ± 0.5 (2-4) µg/ml; autism, 3.1 ± 0.7 (2-5) µg/ml; brain lesion, 2.8 ± 0.7 (1.5-5) µg/ml; genetic disease, 2.9 ± 0.9 (1-4) µg/ml; and dementia 2.3 ± 0.7 (1-3.4) µg/ml. Conclusions The dementia group needed a lower dosage to reach a safe, effective propofol effect-site concentration than the other groups. Since there were no complications, deep sedation is a great alternative to general anesthesia for dental treatment of intellectually disabled patients.","Salinas Salmeron, Keyling S; Kim, Hyun Jeong; Seo, Kwang-Suk",Journal of dental anesthesia and pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.17245/jdapm.2019.19.4.217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501780/,68

132315,Recent Advances and Perspectives on the Polymer Electrolytes for Sodium/Potassium-Ion Batteries.,2021-05-28,"3D printing has been widely used to rapidly manufacture a variety of solid dosage forms on-demand, without sacrificing precision. This study used extrusion-based 3D printing to prepare single-layered, tri-layered, and core-in-shell poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) films carrying paclitaxel and rapamycin in combination or lidocaine alone. Each layer was composed of either low molecular weight (MW) PLGA or high MW PLGA. In vitro drug release kinetics of paclitaxel, rapamycin, and lidocaine for PLGA films were assessed and compared with PLGA-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-PLGA hydrogel discs. Regardless of the structure of PLGA film, paclitaxel (half-time: 54-63 days) was released faster than when compared with rapamycin (half-time: 74-80 days). In contrast, single-layered PLGA-PEG-PLGA discs released rapamycin (half-time 5.7 h) at a more rapid rate than paclitaxel (half-time: 7.3 h). Single-layered PLGA-PEG-PLGA discs enabled a faster drug release than PLGA films, noting that the disc matrices dissolve in water in 24 h. Similarly, lidocaine incorporated in PLGA films (half-time: 13-36 days) exhibited slower release patterns than that in PLGA-PEG-PLGA discs (half-time: 2.6 h). In vitro drug release patterns were explained using molecular models that simulate drug-polymer interactions. Analysis of models suggested that drug-polymer interactions, location of each drug in the polymeric matrix, and solubility of drugs in water were major factors that determine drug release behaviors from the polymeric films and discs.","Serris, Ioannis; Serris, Panagiotis; Frey, Kathleen M; Cho, Hyunah",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-020-01790-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888114/,68
132677,Extended Intervals after Neoadjuvant Therapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer: The Key to Improved Tumor Response and Potential Organ Preservation.,2015,"Early reports of potential treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have raised concerns related to pharmaceutical distribution. Despite the lack of high-quality evidence, the mere hope of effectiveness of potential treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine, has led to surges in demand for these products, and many pharmacists are already informally reporting shortages through social channels. As manufacturers and wholesale distributors struggle to fulfill orders for drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, short-term price increases may seem reasonable in a free market when demand increases. However, any price increases by manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and pharmacies might be seen as exploitive gouging of consumers during a declared emergency. In addition to concerns of price gouging, increases in prescription drug utilization during the pandemic may lead to increases in spending for all payers as members may be treated for COVID-19. This article explores pharmaceutical supply chain and drug pricing nuances that may cause problems for payers and pharmacies as the country battles this global pandemic.

METHODS Patients visiting a urology clinic were surveyed regarding potential follow-up telemedicine visits. A follow-up survey was performed during the COVID-19 pandemic to evaluate changing interest. RESULTS Our pre-COVID study population consisted of 498 patients, speaking 17 primary languages; primarily, the population had MediCal or no insurance coverage (56.8%). Most had the capability to take part in telemedicine video calls (73.1%), though significantly fewer had the confidence (45.9%) or interest (51%). There was a distinct drop in capability, confidence, and interest with increasing age but not with preferred language. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we noted increased interest in non-traditional visits (n=100), with 79% stating they would repeat a non-in-person visit. CONCLUSION Increasing interest in non-traditional visits during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests patient interest and confidence may be malleable.","Josipovic, Andin; Reese, Jeffrey; Cantarero, Erin C; Elliott, Christopher S",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,https://doi.org/10.1353/hpu.2021.0079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120992/,68

The current study was conducted to assess the socio-behavioural impact of COVID-19 among the general population across India between the first and the second wave of pandemic. METHODS A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 15th March -25th March 2021 using a pre-validated validated questionnaire upon the general population using e-survey, telephonic and face-to-face interview. The participants were recruited from the different regions of India by the purposive and snowball sampling technique following the principle of maximum diversity. Appropriate statistical tests were applied to study the association between the various sociodemographic variables and different behaviours. RESULTS A total of 1079 responses were analysed for the study. Almost half of the participants feared contracting the COVID-19 infection. Overall, female participants, elderly people (more than 60 years of age) and urban dwellers reported a greater fear in the survey. More than half of the participants (53.39%) reported significant difficulties due to home confinement. People have become more inclined to adopt healthy lifestyles.

Methods A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC, and Cochrane Central Database. The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome that comprised of mortality and severe COVID-19. Results A total of 4448 patients were obtained from 16 studies. Cerebrovascular disease was associated with increased poor composite outcome (RR 2.04 [1.43, 2.91], p<0.001; I2: 77%). Subgroup analysis revealed that cerebrovascular disease was associated with mortality (RR 2.38 [1.92, 2.96], p<0.001; I2: 0%) and was borderline significant for severe COVID-19 (RR 1.88 [1.00, 3.51], p=0.05; I2: 87%).

DNA sequence polymorphisms representing alternate alleles at gRNA target sites may confer a drive-resistant phenotype in individuals carrying them. Modeling predicts that, for observed levels of SGV at potential target sites and observed rates of de novo DRA formation, population modification strategies are uniquely resilient to DRAs. We conclude that gene drives can succeed when fitness costs incurred by drive-carrying mosquitoes are low enough to prevent strong positive selection for DRAs produced de novo or as part of the SGV and that population modification strategies are less prone to failure due to drive resistance.","Lanzaro, Gregory C; Sánchez C, Hector M; Collier, Travis C; Marshall, John M; James, Anthony A","BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.202000282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151435/,68

METHODS Asbestos fiber concentration in the area surrounding the AC plant was estimated so that the female mesothelioma death number predicted by a mathematical model was the same as the observed excess death number. We used the estimated asbestos fiber concentration to predict the excess mesothelioma deaths from 1970 to 2049. RESULTS In a grid just south of the AC plant, the fiber concentration was estimated to be more than 3 f/ml for K(M) (asbestos potency factor for mesothelioma) of 7.75 x 10(-9). An uncertainty factor of five yields a K(M) range 1.55 x 10(-9) to 38.8 x 10(-9); these in turn correspond to fiber concentrations of 15 and 0.6 f/ml. For K(M) = 7.75 x 10(-9), grid units with higher fiber concentrations than 0.01 f/ml were estimated to extend 4.1 km (95% CI: 3.8-4.4 km) south-southwest of the plant. Over the 80-year study period (1970 to 2049), we predicted that the exposure under study will cause 346 excess mesothelioma deaths with range of 296 to 382 deaths.

137246,Development of synthetic antigen vaccines for COVID-19.,2021-10-06,"RATIONALE Controversy exists over the optimal dose of intravenous (i.v.) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and degree of blood pressure (BP) control in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS). Asian studies suggest low-dose (0·6 mg/kg) is more efficacious than standard-dose (0·9 mg/kg) i.v. rt-PA, and guidelines recommend reducing systolic BP to <185 mmHg before and <180 mmHg after use of i.v. rt-PA, despite observational studies indicating better outcomes at much lower (<140 mmHg) systolic BP levels in this patient group. AIMS The study aims to assess in thrombolysis-eligible AIS patients whether: (i) low-dose (0·6 mg/kg body weight; maximum 60 mg) i.v. rt-PA has non-inferior efficacy and lower risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH) compared to standard-dose (0·9 mg/kg body weight; maximum 90 mg) i.v. rt-PA; and (ii) early intensive BP lowering (systolic target 130-140 mmHg) has superior efficacy and lower risk of any ICH compared to guideline-recommended BP control (systolic target < 180 mmHg). DESIGN The ENhanced Control of Hypertension And Thrombolysis strokE stuDy (ENCHANTED) trial is an independent,2 × 2 quasi-factorial, active-comparison, prospective, randomized, open blinded endpoint (PROBE), clinical trial that is evaluating Arm [A] 'rt-PA dose' and/or Arm [B] 'BP control', using central Internet randomization and data collection in patients fulfilling local criteria for thrombolysis and clinician uncertainty over the study treatments. The treatment arms will be analyzed separately. STUDY OUTCOMES The primary study outcome in both trial Arms is death or disability according to the modified Rankin scale (mRS, scores 2-6) assessed at 90 days. Secondary outcomes include sICH, any ICH, a shift ('improvement') in function across mRS scores, separately on death and disability, early neurological deterioration, recurrent major vascular events, health-related quality of life, length of hospital stay, need for permanent residential care, and health care costs. RESULTS Following launch of the trial in February 2012, the study has recruited more than 2500 patients across a global network of approximately 100 sites in 15 countries. The required sample sizes are 3300 for Arm [A] and 2300 for Arm [B], which will provide >90% power to detect non-inferiority of low-dose i.v. rt-PA and superiority of intensive BP lowering on the primary clinical outcome, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Low-dose i.v. rt-PA and early intensive BP lowering could provide more affordable and safer use of thrombolysis treatment for patients with AIS worldwide.","Huang, Yining; Sharma, Vijay K; Robinson, Thompson; Lindley, Richard I; Chen, Xiaoying; Kim, Jong Sung; Lavados, Pablo; Olavarría, Verónica; Arima, Hisatomi; Fuentes, Sully; Nguyen, Huy Thang; Lee, Tsong-Hai; Parsons, Mark W; Levi, Christopher; Demchuk, Andrew M; Bath, Philip M W; Broderick, Joseph P; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Martins, Sheila; Pontes-Neto, Octavio M; Silva, Federico; Pandian, Jeyaraj; Ricci, Stefano; Stapf, Christian; Woodward, Mark; Wang, Jiguang; Chalmers, John; Anderson, Craig S",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijs.12486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25832995/,68

Methods A single-centre, single-blinded, two-arm randomised controlled trial is planned at Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology (AFIC), Pakistan. The duration was two years, that is from January 2019 till December 2020. A total of 160 participants were recruited and randomly allocated to the control group or the intervention group. Intervention is a mobile health augmented cardiac rehabilitation (MCard), a medically supervised cardiac rehabilitation program for 23-24 weeks. The phase one includes individual counselling during the hospital stay and in phase two includes communication of standardised messages related to healthy lifestyle modification through a specifically designed software. Results This clinical trial results will give insight into the impact of MCard in improving the health outcomes (HRQoL, clinical and behavioural) of participants. If proven to be effective, this technology can be scaled up and implemented in other cardiac centres in the country. It utilises fewer human resources and can be delivered at a lower cost. Conclusion The study protocol will be giving evidence either MCard can contribute to improving the HRQoL, clinical and behavioural outcomes of post-ACS patients following hospital discharge.

Physicians have an important role to play in the fight against climate change through the practice of sustainable healthcare. This involves maintaining the current and future quality of healthcare through balancing environmental, social and financial constraints. To this end, integrating these skills into medical education is crucial. A large number of medical schools have already embedded planetary health and sustainability theory into their curriculum, however, there is no formal sustainability curriculum in postgraduate education and training. This is vital for enabling clinicians to translate sustainability theory taught at undergraduate level into clinical practice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was performed on 15 normal kidneys sampled from eight unembalmed cadavers. Kidneys with the surrounding perirenal fat tissue were removed en bloc with the abdominal segment of the aorta. The renal artery was injected with acrylic and radiopaque resins, with the specimen suspended in water. CT examination of the injected kidneys was performed to analyse the branches located deeply. After imaging acquisition, the specimens were treated with sodium hydroxide for removal of the parenchyma to obtain vascular casts. RESULTS Ten casts (66.6%) showed the classic subdivision of the main artery into single posterior and anterior branches. With regard to the distribution of the segmental or second-order arteries, only two casts (13%) showed a pattern similar to that described by Graves, characterized by four segmental (second-order) branches coming from the anterior renal artery (apical, superior, middle and inferior). In the remaining 13 kidneys (87%) a different arterial vascular network was detected. In 10 casts (80%) a single renal segment was vascularized by two or more different branches coming from an artery leading to another segment (multiple vascularization). Multiple vascularization was observed in three (20%) apical segments, five (33%) superior segments, six (40%) middle segments, seven (47%) inferior segments and two (13%) posterior segments. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that in the human kidneys the arterial vasculature is frequently different from that described by Graves. Moreover, in a significant percentage of cases, a single renal segment receives two or more branches that originate from an artery leading to another segment.","Macchi, Veronica; Crestani, Alessandro; Porzionato, Andrea; Sfriso, Maria Martina; Morra, Aldo; Rossanese, Marta; Novara, Giacomo; De Caro, Raffaele; Ficarra, Vincenzo",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.13788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28117559/,68

139111,Editorial for January.,2021-01-20,"As the expanding obese population grows older, their successful immunologic aging will be critical to enhancing the health span. Obesity increases risk of infections and cancer, suggesting adverse effects on immune surveillance. Here, we report that obesity compromises the mechanisms regulating T-cell generation by inducing premature thymic involution. Diet-induced obesity reduced thymocyte counts and significantly increased apoptosis of developing T-cell populations. Obesity accelerated the age-related reduction of T-cell receptor (TCR) excision circle bearing peripheral lymphocytes, an index of recently generated T cells from thymus. Consistent with reduced thymopoiesis, dietary obesity led to reduction in peripheral naive T cells with increased frequency of effector-memory cells. Defects in thymopoiesis in obese mice were related with decrease in the lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (Lin-Sca1+Kit+ Flt3+) as well as common lymphoid progenitor (Lin-Sca1+CD117(lo)CD127+) pools. The TCR spectratyping analysis showed that obesity compromised V-beta TCR repertoire diversity. Furthermore, the obesity induced by melanocortin 4 receptor deficiency also constricted the T-cell repertoire diversity, recapitulating the thymic defects observed with diet-induced obesity. In middle-aged humans, progressive adiposity with or without type 2 diabetes also compromised thymic output. Collectively, these findings establish that obesity constricts T-cell diversity by accelerating age-related thymic involution.","Yang, Hyunwon; Youm, Yun-Hee; Vandanmagsar, Bolormaa; Rood, Jennifer; Kumar, K Ganesh; Butler, Andrew A; Dixit, Vishwa Deep",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2009-03-213595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19721009/,68

139757,An Isolated Unilateral Pontomedullary Lesion Due to An Intracranial Dural Arteriovenous Fistula Mimicking A Brain Tumor - Case and Review.,2019,"UNLABELLED Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) establishes lifelong latent infections in the sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglia (TG), wherein it retains the capacity to reactivate. The interferon (IFN)-driven antiviral response is critical for the control of HSV-1 acute replication. We therefore sought to further investigate this response in TG neurons cultured from adult mice deficient in a variety of IFN signaling components. Parallel experiments were also performed in fibroblasts isolated concurrently. We showed that HSV-1 replication was comparable in wild-type (WT) and IFN signaling-deficient neurons and fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, a similar pattern was observed for the IFN-sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Despite these findings, TG neurons responded to IFN-β pretreatment with STAT1 nuclear localization and restricted replication of both VSV and an HSV-1 strain deficient in γ34.5, while wild-type HSV-1 replication was unaffected. This was in contrast to fibroblasts in which all viruses were restricted by the addition of IFN-β. Taken together, these data show that adult TG neurons can mount an effective antiviral response only if provided with an exogenous source of IFN-β, and HSV-1 combats this response through γ34.5. These results further our understanding of the antiviral response of neurons and highlight the importance of paracrine IFN-β signaling in establishing an antiviral state. IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a ubiquitous virus that establishes a lifelong latent infection in neurons. Reactivation from latency can cause cold sores, blindness, and death from encephalitis. Humans with deficiencies in innate immunity have significant problems controlling HSV infections. In this study, we therefore sought to elucidate the role of neuronal innate immunity in the control of viral infection. Using neurons isolated from mice, we found that the intrinsic capacity of neurons to restrict virus replication was unaffected by the presence or absence of innate immunity. In contrast, neurons were able to mount a robust antiviral response when provided with beta interferon, a molecule that strongly stimulates innate immunity, and that HSV-1 can combat this response through the γ34.5 viral gene. Our results have important implications for understanding how the nervous system defends itself against virus infections.","Rosato, Pamela C; Leib, David A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01462-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24942587/,68

This initiative is a group process that attempts to bring Advance Care Planning (ACP) into the public domain. It encourages participants to consider what matters to them in their living along with their hopes, preferences, and wishes for their final years and end-of-life care. An inductive, interpretive, and naturalistic approach allowed the researcher to study these phenomena in their natural setting i.e., the community. This qualitative study used 5 focus groups with 17 people and employed thematic data analysis to identify key themes. All participants in the HLD speak from a personal perspective irrespective of any professional background. It transpired that 16 respondents worked in health and social care, which subsequently became noteworthy in the findings. Three key themes were identified: (a) feeling emotionally safe enough to have such sensitive conversations is vital; (b) participating in the HLD process increases the confidence of those participants who worked in health and social care, to undertake ACP conversations and (c) planning ahead is a complex, staged process rather than a single record-making event. The Covid-19 pandemic crisis reinforced the need to upstream ACP initiatives such as the HLD, as the norm for everyone, since all of us will one day die. It is recommended that the HLD be incorporated within ACP training given that the experiential nature of it and the use of groups was reported to build confidence in facilitating ACP conversations. A virtual HLD process needs to be developed to adapt to restrictions on gatherings due to Covid 19.","Mc Kenna, Deirdre; O'Shea, Johanna; Tanner, Liz",Journal of social work in end-of-life & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1080/15524256.2020.1858471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308045/,68

Material and Methods A retrospective chart review of all patients (n = 135) who underwent apical prolapse repair from February 2009 to December 2012 performed in a collaborative manner by a Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgeon and a Urogynecologist. Demographic data (age, body mass index [BMI], race, gravidity, parity) and surgical information (estimated blood loss, operative time, intraoperative complications, readmission and reoperation rates, presence of postoperative infection) were collected. Results The majority of patients were postmenopausal (58.91%), multiparous (mean parity = 2.49) and overweight (mean BMI = 27.71). Nearly 20% had previous prolapse surgery. The most common surgical procedure was laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LSH) with sacrocervicopexy (59.26%), and the most common vaginal repair was of the posterior compartment (78.68%). The median operative time was 149 minutes (82-302), and the estimated blood loss was 100 mL (10-530). Five intra-operative complications, five readmissions and four reoperations were noted. Performance of a concomitant hysterectomy did not affect surgical or anatomical outcomes.

140765,Cover Picture and Issue Information.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND Surgical videos are now being used for performance review and educational purposes; however, broad use is still limited due to time constraints. To make video review more efficient, we implemented Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to detect surgical workflow and technical approaches. METHODS Participants (N = 200) performed a simulated open bowel repair. The operation included two major phases: (1) Injury Identification and (2) Suture Repair. Accordingly, a phase detection algorithm (MobileNetV2+GRU) was implemented to automatically detect the two phases using video data. In addition, participants were noted to use three different technical approaches when running the bowel: (1) use of both hands, (2) use of one hand and one tool, or (3) use of two tools. To discern the three technical approaches, an object detection (YOLOv3) algorithm was implemented to recognize objects that were commonly used during the Injury Identification phase (hands versus tools). RESULTS The phase detection algorithm achieved high precision (recall) when segmenting the two phases: Injury Identification (86 ± 9% [81 ± 12%]) and Suture Repair (81 ± 6% [81 ± 16%]). When evaluating three technical approaches in running the bowel, the object detection algorithm achieved high average precisions (Hands [99.32%] and Tools [94.47%]). The three technical approaches showed no difference in execution time (Kruskal-Wallis Test: P= 0.062) or injury identification (not missing an injury) (Chi-squared: P= 0.998). CONCLUSIONS The AI algorithms showed high precision when segmenting surgical workflow and identifying technical approaches. Automation of these techniques for surgical video databases has great potential to facilitate efficient performance review.","Mohamadipanah, Hossein; Kearse, LaDonna; Witt, Anna; Wise, Brett; Yang, Su; Goll, Cassidi; Pugh, Carla",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399354/,68

We aimed to assess the predictive factors of molecular analysis feasibility (MAF) from samples of peripheral nonSq-NSCLC obtained by radial endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscopy (r-EBUS) and 1.5 mm microbiopsy forceps. METHODS We reviewed data from consecutive peripheral lung nodules sampled with r-EBUS between January 2012 and July 2014 at a single French University Hospital. nonSq-NSCLC were systematically analysed for EGFR, KRAS, ALK, HER2, PI3K and BRAF throughout the study, and c-MET and ROS1 alterations for the last 10 months. RESULTS Of 111 nonSq-NSCLC diagnosed by r-EBUS (113 procedures, mean nodule diameter 28 ± 15 mm), 88 were analysed for EGFR and ALK, 87 for KRAS, 86 for HER2, PI3K and BRAF and 14 for c-MET. Forty-one mutations were identified (23 KRAS, 10 EGFR, 2 BRAF, 1 HER2 and 5 ALK rearrangements). Four c-MET overexpressions were noted. MAF rose from 67% for the first 57 procedures to 89% for the last 56 procedures (P = 0.02) likely due to a higher number of biopsies performed (2 ± 1 vs 3 ± 2, P = 0.005). Upper or middle lobe location (OR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.38, P = 0.03), and at least three biopsies (OR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40, P = 0.02) were predictive factors of MAF. Percentage of tumour cells, size of lesion and distance to the pleura did not correlate with MAF. CONCLUSION Multi-gene molecular analysis could be performed in nearly 80% of paraffin-embedded biopsies or smear specimens sampled by r-EBUS assisted bronchoscopy of peripheral tumoral lung nodules.","Guisier, Florian; Salaün, Mathieu; Lachkar, Samy; Lamy, Aude; Piton, Nicolas; Obstoy, Bérengère; Sabourin, Jean-Christophe; Thiberville, Luc",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.12737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099101/,68

METHOD We echo calls to enrol patients, including children, into trials but note children recruited to date have been additions to adult studies. Few were recruited during the initial pandemic despite the emergence of PIMS-TS/MIS-C, which surely demanding paediatric-specific research. RESULT Must children be proscribed treatments effective in adults until child-specific data emerges, even in a pandemic? Will appropriately powered dedicated trials ever determine specific child-COVID-19 treatment pathways? Is the protracted time frame to assemble such data acceptable to children with severe COVID-19 today? Such factors are relevant in considering whether children should have access to compassionate, innovative, pandemic-disease treatment. CONCLUSION We argue that children should be permitted, indeed have a right, to access innovative treatments early in any future pandemic, following an individual best interests consideration.

141742,"A food-responsive switch modulates TFEB and autophagy, and determines susceptibility to coxsackievirus infection and pancreatitis.",2020-02-04,"INTRODUCTION Fluid overload is associated with a poor prognosis in the critically ill patients, especially at the time of weaning from mechanical ventilation as it may promote weaning failure from cardiac origin. Some data suggest that early administration of diuretics would shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation. However, this strategy may expose patients to a higher risk of haemodynamic and metabolic complications. Currently, there is no recommendation for the use of diuretics during weaning and there is an equipoise on the timing of their initiation in this context. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing two strategies of fluid removal during weaning in 13 French intensive care units (ICU). The preventive strategy is initiated systematically when the fluid balance or weight change is positive and the patients have criteria for clinical stability; the curative strategy is initiated only in case of weaning failure documented as of cardiac origin. Four hundred and ten patients will be randomised with a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation, defined as the number of days between randomisation and successful extubation (alive without reintubation nor tracheostomy within the 7 days after extubation) at day 28. Secondary outcomes include daily and cumulated fluid balance, metabolic and haemodynamic complications, ventilator-associated pneumonia, weaning complications, number of ventilator-free days, total duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in ICU and mortality in ICU, in hospital and, at day 28. A subgroup analysis for the primary outcome is planned in patients with kidney injury (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes class 2 or more) at the time of randomisation.

However, Cu is also a potentially toxic metal, especially to unicellular microbes that are in direct contact with their environment. Since 400 BCE, Cu toxicity has been leveraged for its antimicrobial properties and even today, Cu based materials are being explored as effective antimicrobials against human pathogens spanning bacteria, fungi, and viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 agent of the 2019-2020 pandemic. Given that Cu has the double-edged property of being both highly toxic and an essential micronutrient, it plays an active and complicated role at the host-pathogen interface. Humans have evolved methods of incorporating Cu into innate and adaptive immune processes and both sides of the penny (Cu toxicity and Cu as a nutrient) are employed. Here we review the evolution of Cu in biology and its multi-faceted roles in infectious disease, from the viewpoints of the microbial pathogens as well as the animal hosts they infect.","Culbertson, Edward M; Culotta, Valeria C",Seminars in cell & developmental biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423931/,68

Objectives To identify the distribution of patients with phthisis bulbi and determine the status of their fellow eyes at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Methods We analysed data retrospectively retrieved from medical records of patients diagnosed with phthisis bulbi at initial clinic visit from January 2008 to December 2017. Information abstracted included biodata, laterality of phthisical eye, duration and aetiology of phthisis bulbi, visual acuity, and morbidities present in fellow eyes. Results Seventy-nine patients presented with unilateral phthisis bulbi. The mean age was 51±21.2 years and forty (50.6%) were males. The commonest aetiologies of phthisis bulbi were trauma 37 (46.8%), infection 17 (21.5%) and uveitis/inflammation 11 (13.9%). Seventy (88.6%) patients had morbidities in their fellow eye such as glaucoma 26 (32.9%), refractive errors 23 (29.1%) and cataract 22 (27.9%). Forty (50.6%) patients were either visually impaired or blind in their fellow eye (p=0.001). Conclusion The commonest cause of phthisis bulbi was trauma. Approximately nine out of ten patients had ocular morbidities in their fellow eye. A thorough follow-up of patients with phthisis bulbi is recommended.","Adewara, Bolajoko A; Badmus, Sarat A; Olugbade, Olukemi T; Ezeanosike, Edak; Adegbehingbe, Bernice O",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.54; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394326/,68

We studied 37 asymptomatic individuals in the Wanzhou District who were diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections but without any relevant clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 d and during hospitalization. Asymptomatic individuals were admitted to the government-designated Wanzhou People's Hospital for centralized isolation in accordance with policy1. The median duration of viral shedding in the asymptomatic group was 19 d (interquartile range (IQR), 15-26 d). The asymptomatic group had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than the symptomatic group (log-rank P = 0.028). The virus-specific IgG levels in the asymptomatic group (median S/CO, 3.4; IQR, 1.6-10.7) were significantly lower (P = 0.005) relative to the symptomatic group (median S/CO, 20.5; IQR, 5.8-38.2) in the acute phase. Of asymptomatic individuals, 93.3% (28/30) and 81.1% (30/37) had reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels, respectively, during the early convalescent phase, as compared to 96.8% (30/31) and 62.2% (23/37) of symptomatic patients. Forty percent of asymptomatic individuals became seronegative and 12.9% of the symptomatic group became negative for IgG in the early convalescent phase. In addition, asymptomatic individuals exhibited lower levels of 18 pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest that asymptomatic individuals had a weaker immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels in the early convalescent phase might have implications for immunity strategy and serological surveys.","Long, Quan-Xin; Tang, Xiao-Jun; Shi, Qiu-Lin; Li, Qin; Deng, Hai-Jun; Yuan, Jun; Hu, Jie-Li; Xu, Wei; Zhang, Yong; Lv, Fa-Jin; Su, Kun; Zhang, Fan; Gong, Jiang; Wu, Bo; Liu, Xia-Mao; Li, Jin-Jing; Qiu, Jing-Fu; Chen, Juan; Huang, Ai-Long",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0965-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32555424/,68

To better understand factors influencing efficacy, we reviewed randomized trials specifically among obese and overweight pregnant women. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis of 32 studies with a pooled population of 5,869 overweight or obese pregnant women. Random effects models were fit to compute the weighted mean difference (WMD) in GWG between groups across studies. Subgroup analyses were conducted to compare intervention efficacy in overweight vs. obese pregnant women, and interventions delivered by prenatal care providers (PCPs) vs. non-PCPs during pregnancy. Moderator analyses ensured. RESULTS Nine (28%) of 32 studies reported significant reductions in GWG in response to intervention. Of these, six (66%) of nine were delivered by PCPs. Overall, the WMD in GWG was -1.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.55, -0.86) kg. However, interventions delivered by PCPs yielded a significantly greater reduction in GWG compared to interventions delivered by non-PCPs (WMD = -3.88 kg; 95% CI: -7.01, -0.75 vs. -0.80 kg; 95% CI: -1.32, -0.28; p for difference = 0.005). CONCLUSION When PCPs counsel nutrition and physical activity, obese and overweight pregnant women have greater success meeting GWG targets and may be more motivated to modify their behaviour than with other modes of intervention deliveries.","Yeo, SeonAe; Walker, Jennifer S; Caughey, Melissa C; Ferraro, Amanda M; Asafu-Adjei, Josephine K",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28177566/,68

143165,Two-dimensional materials for next-generation computing technologies.,2020-07-01,"Background and Objectives: The harmonization of recovery of consciousness and muscular function is important in emergence from anesthesia. Even if muscular function is recovered, tracheal extubation without adequate recovery of consciousness may increase the risk of respiratory complications. In particular, upper airway obstruction is one of the common respiratory complications and can sometimes be fatal. However, the association between the timing of sugammadex administration and the upper airway obstruction that can occur during awakening from anesthesia has rarely been studied. Materials and Methods: The medical records of 456 patients who had surgery under general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA) at the Haeundae Paik Hospital between October 2017 and July 2018 and who received intravenous sugammadex to reverse rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade were analyzed. The correlations between bispectral index (BIS) and minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) at the time of sugammadex administration, the incidence of complications, and the time to tracheal extubation were analyzed to investigate how different timings of sugammadex administration affected upper airway obstruction after tracheal extubation. Conclusions: The effect of BIS and the duration from anesthetic discontinuation to sugammadex administration on upper airway obstruction was not statistically significant. However, the odds ratio of complication rates with MAC < 0.3 compared with MAC ≥ 0.3 was 0.40 (95% confidence interval 0.20 to 0.81, p = 0.011), showing a statistically significant increase in risk with MAC ≥ 0.3 for upper airway obstruction.","Kang, Eunsu; Lee, Byeong Cheol; Park, Jae Hong; Lee, Sang Eun; Kim, Se Hun; Oh, Daeseok; Choi, Dae Yun; Ko, Myoung Jin",Medicina,https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57020088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494155/,68

The authors describe their experience of the first reported single-port laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy in an 88-year-old lady with early antral gastric adenocarcinoma. METHOD Single-port laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy with D1α lymphadenectomy was successfully performed using a transumbilical multichannel single port. Straight and flexible tipped laparoscopes were used to obtain off-axis views of the operative field. A flexible tipped stapler and curved instruments were used to reconstruct the Polya-type gastrojejunostomy. The procedure was performed without compromising standard, oncological principles. RESULTS Specimen histology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma infiltrating the submucosa. Proximal and distal resection margins were tumor free. Furthermore, 41 tumor-free lymph nodes were harvested. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 6. CONCLUSIONS Single-port gastrectomy for cancer is technically and oncologically feasible when performed by experienced minimally invasive surgical oncologists with extensive experience of benign single-port laparoscopic procedures. The advantages to the patient in terms of cosmesis and shorter hospital stay are clear. However, further studies are required to assess this technique when treating gastric and other malignancies.","Ozdemir, Baris A; Thomas, Rhys L; Soon, Yuen",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350611400759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21398339/,68

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 1999 and 2015 38 patients (21 female; 17 male; Age: 17 - 92; Average 54.3 years) underwent an extraction of intravascular dislocated foreign bodies, which were not lost during a radiological intervention. The extracted material included 29 port catheters, 3 tips of tunneled dialysis catheters, 2 stents, 2 guide wires, 1 CVC tip and 1 AS occluder device. Various catheters for repositioning and extraction were used. The access was transarterial as well as transvenous. Technical success was defined as complete removal of the foreign body. RESULTS The technical success rate was 92.1 % (35 of 38). In 17 patients an additional catheter was necessary to reposition the foreign body in order to make it accessible for the extraction catheter. In one case a stent was relocated and remodeled within the patient and was not extracted. In another case we experienced a dislocation of a small fragment of the port catheter into the distal parts of the pulmonary artery, which couldn't be extracted. A guide wire could not be extracted as it was already adhered with the vessel wall. Peri-interventional complications were not documented. CONCLUSION The percutaneous extraction of dislocated intravascular foreign bodies is technically successful and poor of complications. Interventional therapy can avoid surgical removal. KEY POINTS • The percutaneous extraction of dislocated intravascular foreign bodies is technically successful and safe.• In most cases surgical removal can be avoided.• The gooseneck-snare catheter was mainly used for the extraction of intravascular foreign bodies.

DATA SOURCES A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library electronic databases from inception through June 2020 was performed. There were no language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION The PRISMA strategy was followed. Included studies discuss USH patients who underwent CI regardless of age, nationality, or clinical subtype. All included studies report post-implantation functional, cognitive, or quality of life outcomes. Only reviews were excluded. RESULTS Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. USH patients experienced improvements in PTA and speech perception and expression outcomes after CI, as well as improvements in phonological memory and quality of life measures. Overall, patients implanted at younger ages outperformed older patients in audiological testing. Similarly, patients with prolonged auditory deprivation had relatively poor performance outcomes in sentence recognition and speech detection following CI. CONCLUSIONS Most USH patients benefit from CI. USH patients who undergo CI at younger ages generally achieve better hearing, speech, and cognitive outcomes. CI at older ages can still prove beneficial if appropriate auditory amplification is started at the right time. Further research is warranted to fill the gap in understanding regarding the gene mutations underlying the pathophysiology of USH that have favorable CI outcomes as well as the optimal time to perform CI.","Davies, Camron; Bergman, Jenna; Misztal, Carly; Ramchandran, Renuka; Mittal, Jeenu; Bulut, Erdogan; Shah, Viraj; Mittal, Rahul; Eshraghi, Adrien A",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10132915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209904/,68

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between December 2007 and August 2015, 49 patients with 65 previously histological typed HCC were treated in a total of 61 sessions. Tumours were subdivided into central (>3 cm from the capsule) (n = 22) and peripheral (<3 cm from the capsule) (n = 43). Imaging follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment, then annually. Mean follow-up period was 18 months (range 1-55). Location of the lesion, age, sex, and underlying disease of the patients was analyzed and related with efficacy. RESULTS Technical success was obtained in all cases. Residual disease was registered in 21 lesions (32.3 %): 13 were peripheral and 8 were central. Twelve of them were retreated with percutaneous MWA. Local recurrence was recorded in 8 lesions (12.3 %): 5 were retreated with MWA. No significant difference in terms of effectiveness was observed in lesions located in a central position and those situated in the peripheral position. Age, sex, and underlying disease not influenced results. Only one major complication was observed. The rate of minor complications was 24.5 %. Mortality at 30 days was 0 %. CONCLUSIONS Our results encourage the role of MWA in the treatment of small HCC. More numerous series and randomized studies are necessary to state the role of MWA and to select cases in which MWA may be more effective and safer than RFA.","Ierardi, Anna Maria; Giorlando, Francesca; Piacentino, Filippo; Fontana, Federico; Novario, Raffaele; Angileri, Salvatore Alessio; Duka, Ejona; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",La Radiologia medica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-016-0694-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27744607/,68
144223,Sialic acids as link to Japanese scientists.,2016,"BACKGROUND Although preliminary research has evidenced negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population, little research has been carried out examining the interplay among the broader dimensions and correlates of individual distress. Via network analysis, the current study investigated the pathways that underlie some components of psychological distress and their changes over time (during and post COVID-19-related lockdown). METHODS 1,129 adult participants (79.1% women) completed a two-wave online survey during and after the lockdown, and reported on variables such as depression, anxiety, stress, fear of COVID, intolerance of uncertainty, emotion regulation and social support. The networks were estimated via Gaussian Graphical Models and their temporal changes were compared through the centrality measures. RESULTS Depression, stress, anxiety and fear of COVID formed a spatially contiguous pattern, which remained unchanged in both the two waves. After the lockdown, the fear of COVID node reduced its strength in the network, whereas inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty and emotion suppression were associated with depression. Emotion regulation was connected to depression, but not to stress and anxiety during both waves. Perceived emotional support had few connections to the other nodes. LIMITATIONS Only 32.7% of participants provided complete responses for both waves. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on adults. In the context of the network approach, depressive symptoms had the highest strength and their associations to other dimensions of individual distress may be key factors in understanding the influence of exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health.","Di Blasi, Maria; Gullo, Salvatore; Mancinelli, Elisa; Freda, Maria Francesca; Esposito, Giovanna; Gelo, Omar Carlo Gioacchino; Lagetto, Gloria; Giordano, Cecilia; Mazzeschi, Claudia; Pazzagli, Chiara; Salcuni, Silvia; Lo Coco, Gianluca",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33582428/,68

To assess the ecological risk of azoxystrobin in real soil environments, we performed a study on the toxic effects of azoxystrobin on earthworms (Eisenia fetida) in three different natural soils (fluvo-aquic soil, black soil and red clay soil) and an artificial soil. Acute toxicity of azoxystrobin was determined by filter paper test and soil test. Accordingly, exposure concentrations of chronic toxicity were set at 0, 0.1, 1.0 and 2.5 mg kg-1. For chronic toxicity test, reactive oxygen species, activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase), detoxifying enzyme (glutathione transferase), level of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) and level of oxygen damage of DNA (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine) in earthworms were determined on the 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 42nd and 56th days after treatment. Both acute and chronic toxic results showed azoxystrobin exhibit higher toxicity in natural soil than in artificial soil, indicating that traditional artificial soil testing method underestimate ecotoxicity of azoxystrobin in a real agricultural environment on the earthworm population. Combining with the analysis of soil physicochemical properties, the present experiment provided scientific guidance for rational application of azoxystrobin in agricultural production systems.","Xu, Yaqi; Li, Bing; Hou, Kaixuan; Du, Zhongkun; Allen, Samuel C; Zhu, Lusheng; Li, Wenxiu; Zhu, Lei; Wang, Jinhua; Wang, Jun",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400946/,68

However, the actual role of this novel technique remains to be determined. The present article reviews evidence and examines updates of robotic laparoendoscopic single-site partial nephrectomy outcomes reported in more contemporary studies. A comprehensive online systematic search of PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses criteria recommendations was carried out in January 2014, identifying data from 2008 to 2014 regarding robotic laparoendoscopic single-site partial nephrectomy. The majority of medical evidence to date is based on case reports or retrospective studies. Current studies show that robotic laparoendoscopic single-site partial nephrectomy is a feasible procedure carried out in an acceptable length of operative time, and resulting in a desirable cosmetic outcome and less postoperative pain. However, comparable studies show that robotic laparoendoscopic single-site partial nephrectomy is inferior to the conventional approach, especially with regard to warm ischemia time. Furthermore, the numerous limitations that exist with the utilization of the current commercial single-site devices make robotic laparoendoscopic single-site PN more challenging and more complicated for surgeons compared with conventional procedures. Further significant improvements, along with more studies, are required in order to develop the ideal robotic laparoendoscopic single-site robotic platform and overcome the current limitations. For the time being, robotic laparoendoscopic single-site partial nephrectomy procedures could be applicable in patients with low tumor size and complexity, and should not be routinely applied in all cases.","Komninos, Christos; Tuliao, Patrick; Rha, Koon Ho",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/iju.12558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25047133/,68

In this paper, we examine the potential effect of the rise of robotic technology on health. Using the variation in the initial distribution of industrial employment in US cities and the difference in robot adoption across industries over time to predict robot exposure at the local labor market, we find evidence that higher penetration of industrial robots in the local economy is positively related to the health of the low-skilled population. A 10% increase in robots per 1000 workers is associated with an approximately 10% reduction in the share of low-skilled individuals reporting poor health. Further analysis suggests that the reallocation of tasks partly explains this finding. A 10% increase in robots per 1000 workers is associated with an approximately 1.5% reduction in physical tasks supplied by low-skilled workers.","Gunadi, Christian; Ryu, Hanbyul",Health economics,https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046963/,68

These studies are extensively influenced by anticancer therapy, as miRNAs interfere with the therapy's efficacy in prostate cancer (PCa). OBJECTIVES In this article, we summarise the available data on the influence of radical prostatectomy (RP) and biochemical recurrence on miRNA expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS Molecular targets of these miRNAs, as well as the reciprocal relations between different miRNAs and their targets, were studied using the DIANA, STRING, and TransmiR databases. Special attention was dedicated to the mechanisms of PCa development, miRNA, and associated genes as tumour development mediators. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Combined analysis of the databases and available literature indicates that expression of four miRNAs that are associated with prostate cancer relapse and alter their expression after RP, combined with genes that closely interact with selected miRNAs, have high potential for the prediction of PCa relapse after RP. PCa tissues and biofluids, both immediately after RP for diagnostics/prognostics and in long-term (relapse) monitoring, may be used as sources of these miRNAs.

For the patient who undergoes tracheostomy for failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, however, the insertion of a tube that occupies a large amount of space within the trachea can delay subsequent efforts to liberate him from the ventilator. With an aim to promote more timely rehabilitation of ventilated patients, London Ontario's University Hospital has been inserting the Bivona TTS, a single lumen tube with an elastic cuff, during tracheostomy. This allows caregivers to better exploit the benefits of a functional upper airway early during the weaning process, which may reduce complications associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation. We urge clinical studies to determine how the choice of initial tracheostomy tube can affect rehabilitation strategies and important patient outcomes.","McCracken, John; Leasa, David",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc9306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21144013/,68

However, its effect on procedural and clinical outcomes remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To retrospectively evaluate the procedural and clinical outcomes after the catheter ablation of unstable VT with and without pLVAD support. METHODS Sixty-eight consecutive unstable, scar-mediated endocardial and/or epicardial VT ablation procedures performed in 63 patients were evaluated. During VT mapping and ablation, hemodynamic support was provided by intravenous inotropes with a pLVAD (n = 34) or without a pLVAD (control; n = 34). RESULTS Baseline patient characteristics were similar. VT was sustained longer with a pLVAD (27.4 ± 18.7 minutes) than without a pLVAD (5.3 ± 3.6 minutes) (P < .001). A higher number of VTs were terminated during ablation with a pLVAD (1.2 ± 0.9 per procedure) than without a pLVAD (0.4 ± 0.6 per procedure) (P < .001). Total radiofrequency ablation time was shorter with a pLVAD (53 ± 30 minutes) than without a pLVAD (68 ± 33 minutes) (P = .022), but with similar procedural success rates (71% for both pLVAD and control groups; P = 1.000). Although during 19 ± 12 months of follow-up VT recurrence did not differ between pLVAD (26%) and control (41%) groups (P = .305), the composite end point of 30-day rehospitalization, redo-VT ablation, recurrent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapies, and 3-month mortality was lower with a pLVAD (12%) than without a pLVAD (35%) (P = .043). CONCLUSION In this nonrandomized retrospective study, catheter ablation of unstable VT supported by a pLVAD was associated with shorter ablation times and reduced hospital length of stay. While pLVAD support did not affect VT recurrence, it was associated with a lower composite end point of 30-day rehospitalization, redo-VT ablation, recurrent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapies, and 3-month mortality.","Aryana, Arash; Gearoid O'Neill, P; Gregory, David; Scotti, Dennis; Bailey, Sean; Brunton, Scott; Chang, Michael; d'Avila, André",Heart rhythm,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.04.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732372/,68

BACKGROUND 70-90% of surgeons who regularly perform LS report musculoskeletal symptoms, mainly in neck and shoulders. Data regarding the potential ergonomic benefits of RALS in a clinical setting is very limited. METHODS Twelve surgeons with advanced experience in both LS and RALS each performed 2 hysterectomies on the same day. LS was performed standing, RALS sitting, the latter allowing forearm and head support. Bipolar surface electromyogram (EMG) was recorded from several muscles and was expressed relative to EMG during maximum contractions (%EMGmax). Gaps per minute plus static (p0.1), mean (p0.5), and peak (p0.9) muscle activation were calculated. Perceived exertion was rated before and just after each surgery. RESULTS Neck muscle activity (p0.1 4.7 vs. 3.0%EMGmax, p0.5 7.4 vs. 5.3%EMGmax, p0.9 11.6 vs. 8.2%EMGmax, all P < 0.05) and static shoulder muscle activity (p0.1 5.7 vs. 2.8%EMGmax, P < 0.05) were higher for LS than for RALS. Both a higher level of gaps during RALS and a lower rating of perceived exertion, also for the legs, after RALS supported these observations. However, low back muscle activity was higher for RALS. CONCLUSIONS RALS is significantly less physically demanding than LS, and also feels less strenuous for the surgeons. However, for both types of surgeries, there still is room for improvement of working conditions. To further optimize these, we suggest a scheme to regularly observe and advise the surgeons.","Dalsgaard, Torur; Jensen, Morten D; Hartwell, Dorthe; Mosgaard, Berit J; Jørgensen, Annemette; Jensen, Bente R",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000002845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29923873/,68

It is important that compliance with the principles of GLP continues to be maintained. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic lockdowns in various countries, including India, have been sudden and over an extended duration. Although every GLP laboratory has Standard Operating Procedure for disaster management, the sudden lockdown due to COVID-19 created specific emergency procedures related to this situation such as travel bans, safe distancing, and work from home notifications. Good Laboratory Practice compliances in the context of animal experimentation during and post lockdown period need effective managerial responses that are not just flexible and innovative but can ensure they are well-calibrated to the challenges of business continuity and maintenance of health directives. On-the-ground realities suggest there may still be practical challenges to compliance, and guidelines may not always be complied with. This article discusses the issues that may be encountered due to COVID-19 that could potentially impact the GLP status of a study and suggests ways to manage them so as to minimize or prevent infection with COVID-19.

145767,Tuning the Topological Landscape of DNA-Cyclodextrin Nanocomplexes by Molecular Design.,2020-07-25,"Dityrosine is the product of oxidation that has been linked to a number of serious pathological conditions. Evidence indicates that high amounts of dityrosine exist in oxidized milk powders and some milk related foodstuffs, further reducing the nutritional value of oxidized proteins. Therefore, we hypothesize that some receptors related to special diseases would be targets for dityrosine. However, the mechanisms of the interaction of dityrosine with probable targets are still unknown. In the present work, an inverse virtual screening approach was performed to screen possible novel targets for dityrosine. Molecular docking studies were performed on a panel of targets extracted from the potential drug target database (PDTD) to optimize and validate the screening results. Firstly, two different conformations cis- and trans- were found for dityrosine during minimization. Moreover, Tubulin (αT) (-11.0 kcal/mol) was identified as a target for cis-dityrosine (CDT), targets including αT (-11.2 kcal/mol) and thyroid hormone receptor beta-1 (-10.7 kcal/mol) presented high binding affinities for trans-dityrosine (TDT). Furthermore, in order to provide binding complexes with higher precision, the three docked systems were further refined by performing thermo dynamic simulations. A series of techniques for searching for the most stable binding pose and the calculation of binding free energy are elaborately provided in this work. The major interactions between these targets and dityrosine were hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding. The application of inverse virtual screening method may facilitate the prediction of unknown targets for known ligands, and direct future experimental assays.","Wang, Fangfang; Yang, Wei; Hu, Xiaojun",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20010115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30597963/,68

This study was conducted retrospectively to investigate the detailed sinonasal manifestations and dynamic profile of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in COVID-19 patients longitudinally. METHODS This retrospective study included 11 consecutive patients. The prevalence, timing and severity of sinonasal manifestations were analyzed. Oropharyngeal, nasal, sputum and stool specimens were collected to detect RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 over COVID-19 period. RESULTS Among the 11 patients, 6 (54.5%) were female, and the median age was 51 (IQR, 36-62) years. Seven patients (63.6%) experienced sinonasal symptoms, with 6 (54.5%) exhibiting sinonasal symptoms on the onset day. Seven patients (63.6%) demonstrated nasal obstruction, 5 (45.5%) had rhinorrhea, and 4 (36.4%) exhibited olfactory dysfunction. All six patients with sinonasal symptoms on the onset day had non-severe infections. Most patients (85.7%) with sinonasal symptoms had non-severe infections. Sinonasal symptoms commonly appeared early. The positive RT-PCR rate for SARS-CoV-2 in various specimens was highest in the first week (73.3%), then gradually decreased over the disease course, but 3 patients (27.3%) had experienced a long-lasting fluctuated positive RT-PCR results since 29 days of illness in both groups, especially for two patients with airway comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS Sinonasal symptoms were more prevalent in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 and usually appeared early. In addition, regular nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered for COVID-19 patients with certain airway comorbidities.","Jia, Xiaoqing; Shao, Shan; Ren, Hong; Xu, Yuan; Zhao, Jinming; Zhao, Yan; Wang, Yue; Bao, Shiping; Yan, Junping; Wang, Xiangdong; Zhang, Luo",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-2493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33832289/,68
145874,Treatment of Hospital wastewater with submerged aerobic fixed film reactor coupled with tube-settler.,2021-08-10,"Recently, complete replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in tissue culture was established using the JFH1 isolate. To analyze determinants of HCV genome packaging and virion assembly, we developed a system that supports particle production based on trans-packaging of subgenomic viral RNAs. Using JFH1 helper viruses, we show that subgenomic JFH1 replicons lacking the entire core to NS2 coding region are efficiently encapsidated into infectious virus-like particles. Similarly, chimeric helper viruses with heterologous structural proteins trans-package subgenomic JFH1 replicons. Like authentic cell culture-produced HCV (HCVcc) particles, these trans-complemented HCV particles (HCV(TCP)) penetrate target cells in a CD81 receptor-dependent fashion. Since HCV(TCP) production was limited by competition between the helper and subgenomic RNA and to avoid contamination of HCV(TCP) stocks with helper viruses, we created HCV packaging cells. These cells encapsidate various HCV replicons with high efficiency, reaching infectivity titers up to 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses 50 per milliliter. The produced particles display a buoyant density comparable to HCVcc particles and can be propagated in the packaging cell line but support only a single-round infection in naïve cells. Together, this work demonstrates that subgenomic HCV replicons are assembly competent, thus excluding cis-acting RNA elements in the core-to-NS2 genomic region essential for RNA packaging. The experimental system described here should be helpful to decipher the mechanisms of HCV assembly and to identify RNA elements and viral proteins involved in particle formation. Similar to other vector systems of plus-strand RNA viruses, HCV(TCP) may prove valuable for gene delivery or vaccination approaches.","Steinmann, Eike; Brohm, Christiane; Kallis, Stephanie; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Pietschmann, Thomas",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00118-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18480457/,68
145980,The neurogenic bladder and incontinent urinary diversion.,2010,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair using an underlay mesh frequently requires suture fixation across the abdominal wall, which results in significant postoperative pain. This study investigates the utility of a novel mesh fixation technique to reduce the strangulation force on the abdominal wall. METHODS Multiple 2-cm(2) pieces of polyester mesh (Parietex Composite, Covidien) were placed as an underlay against a porcine abdominal wall. Fixation was accomplished using either the standard 0-polyglyconate or the 0-polyglyconate barbed anchor suture designed to hold in tissue without the need to tie a knot (V-Loc 180; Covidien). Suture fixation began with a stab wound incision in the skin. A suture-passing device then was used to pass the suture across the abdominal wall and through the mesh. The suture passer was removed and reintroduced through the same stab wound incision but at a different fascial entry point 1.5 cm away. The tail of the suture was grasped and pulled up through both the mesh and the abdominal wall, creating a full-thickness U-stitch. One tail of the suture was attached to a tensiometer, and the strangulation force on the abdominal wall was measured while the suture was tied (standard) or looped (barbed). To compare pullout force, the tensiometer was attached to either the mesh or the suture, and traction was applied until material failure or suture pull through. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Comparisons were performed using Student's t-test. RESULTS Eight pieces of mesh were placed for each suture. The average force required to secure the barbed suture (0.59 ± 0.08 kg) was significantly less than the force needed to secure the standard suture (2.17 ± 0.58 kg) (P < 0.0001). Table 1 compares the suture pullout forces with the mesh failure forces. Although the pullout force for the standard suture is significantly greater than for the barbed suture, both sutures have a pullout strength significantly greater than the mesh failure force. Table 1 Suture fixation forces for standard and barbed sutures Suture fixation force (kg) Standard suture 2.17 ± 0.58 Barbed suture 0.59 ± 0.08 P < 0.0001 CONCLUSIONS A barbed anchor suture used to secure mesh to the abdominal wall requires nearly 75% less strangulation force than a standard monofilament suture while still providing significantly greater pullout force than that required for the mesh to tear and fail. This method of mesh fixation should result in less postoperative pain and warrants a clinical trial.","Lyons, Calvin; Joseph, Rohan; Salas, Nilson; Reardon, Patrick R; Bass, Barbara L; Dunkin, Brian J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2014-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22083327/,68

The 36-item Short-Form Health Survey was used to examine the health-related quality of life of the participants. The severity of dysmenorrhoea was assessed using a 10-point visual analog scale. RESULTS Girls suffering from dysmenorrhoea reported high pain prevalence and intensity. However, the majority of girls with dysmenorrhoea did not seek medical advice (93.2%) or self-medicate (82%). The role-physical, bodily pain, general health and social functioning domain scores of girls with dysmenorrhoea were significantly lower than those without dysmenorrhoea. Moreover, girls with severe dysmenorrhoea had a significantly lower quality of life in the bodily pain domain than those with mild and moderate forms of condition. CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that dysmenorrhoea is highly prevalent among adolescent girls in Hong Kong.

This fact remains true despite extraordinary scientific advances in prevention, treatment, and care-advances that have been led, to a substantial degree, by US-supported science and researchers. In this watershed year of 2021 and in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that the USA will not meet the stated goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, particularly those goals relating to reductions in new infections, decreases in morbidity, and reductions in HIV stigma. The six papers in the Lancet Series on HIV in the USA have each examined the underlying causes of these challenges and laid out paths forward for an invigorated, sustained, and more equitable response to the US HIV epidemic than has been seen to date.

147255,Implementing Digital Dentistry into Your Esthetic Dental Practice.,2020-10-01,"A variety of pulmonary and systemic insults promote an inflammatory response causing increased vascular permeability, leading to the development of acute lung injury (ALI), a condition necessitating hospitalization and intensive care, or the more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a disease with a high mortality rate. Further, COVID-19 pandemic-associated ARDS is now a major cause of mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis of ALI is explained by injury to both the vascular endothelium and the alveolar epithelium. The disruption of the lung endothelial and epithelial barriers occurs in response to both systemic and local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Studies that evaluate the association of genetic polymorphisms with disease risk did not yield many potential therapeutic targets to treat and revert lung injury. This failure is probably due in part to the phenotypic complexity of ALI/ARDS, and genetic predisposition may be obscured by the multiple environmental and behavioral risk factors. In the last decade, new research has uncovered novel epigenetic mechanisms that control ALI/ARDS pathogenesis, including histone modifications and DNA methylation. Enzyme inhibitors such as DNMTi and HDACi may offer new alternative strategies to prevent or reverse the vascular damage that occurs during lung injury. This review will focus on the latest findings on the molecular mechanisms of vascular damage in ALI/ARDS, the genetic factors that might contribute to the susceptibility for developing this disease, and the epigenetic changes observed in humans, as well as in experimental models of ALI/ADRS.","Bossardi Ramos, Ramon; Adam, Alejandro Pablo",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68748-9_6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34019265/,68

Historically, clinicians and researchers have always been interested in quantifying and characterizing those effects through recordings of surface brain electrical activity, namely electroencephalography (EEG). Over decades of research, the complex signal has been dissected to extract its core substance, with significant advances in the interpretation of the information it may contain. Methodological, engineering, statistical, mathematical, and computer progress now furnishes advanced tools that not only allow quantification of the effects of anesthesia, but also shed light on some aspects of anesthetic mechanisms. In this article, we will review how advanced EEG serves the anesthesiologist in that respect, but will not review other intraoperative utilities that have no direct relationship with consciousness, such as monitoring of brain and spinal cord integrity. We will start with a reminder of anesthestic effects on raw EEG and its time and frequency domain components, as well as a summary of the EEG analysis techniques of use for the anesthesiologist. This will introduce the description of the use of EEG to assess the depth of the hypnotic and anti-nociceptive components of anesthesia, and its clinical utility. The last part will describe the use of EEG for the understanding of mechanisms of anesthesia-induced alteration of consciousness. We will see how, eventually in association with transcranial magnetic stimulation, it allows exploring functional cerebral networks during anesthesia. We will also see how EEG recordings during anesthesia, and their sophisticated analysis, may help corroborate current theories of mental content generation.","Marchant, Nicolas; Sanders, Robert; Sleigh, Jamie; Vanhaudenhuyse, Audrey; Bruno, Marie-Aurélie; Brichant, Jean François; Laureys, Steven; Bonhomme, Vincent",Clinical EEG and neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1177/1550059413509801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24415399/,68

148071,Anillin: The First Proofreading-like Scaffold?,2020-07-31,"OBJECTIVES Facial attractiveness is thought to reflect an individual's biological condition. This seems to be largely explained by the relationship between facial appearance and body adiposity, a trait that affects various aspects of body homeostasis, including fertility and immunity. The aim of this study was to test if, a part of adipose tissue amount, also levels of hormones secreted by adipose tissue are reflected in women's appearance, focusing on the two most abundant adipokines. Due to the opposing effects of adiponectin and leptin on health, we hypothesized that leptin negatively and adiponectin positively correlate with women's attractiveness. METHODS The study sample included 174 young, healthy women (Mage = 28.50, SDage = 2.38). Serum leptin and adiponectin levels were measured. Estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and BMI levels were controlled in the analyses. Face photographs were taken and facial attractiveness ratings, assessed by men, were gathered in online questionnaires. RESULTS Perceived facial attractiveness correlated negatively with leptin level and leptin/adiponectin ratio, but did not correlate with adiponectin level. The results were similar, when controlled for E2, T, and BMI. Adipokines levels did not mediate or moderate the relationship between facial attractiveness and BMI. CONCLUSIONS The results showed that perceived facial attractiveness is predicted by adipose-derived hormones detrimental for health, like leptin, but is not related with beneficial hormones, such as adiponectin. However, the levels of these two adipokines do not impact the relationship between perceived facial attractiveness and adiposity, and thus do not explain the relationship between facial attractiveness, body adiposity, and biological condition.","Żelaźniewicz, Agnieszka; Nowak, Judyta; Studzińska, Ida; Pawłowski, Bogusław",American journal of physical anthropology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.24114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735054/,68
148661,Computed tomographic features of lesions detected in horses with tarsal lameness.,2014,"PURPOSE Training methods that require maximal intensity efforts against light and heavy resistance are commonly used for athletic development. Typically, these sessions are separated by at least 48 h recovery on the assumption that such efforts elicit marked fatigue of the central nervous system (CNS), but this posit has not been well studied. The aim of the study was to assess the etiology and recovery of fatigue after heavy-resistance (strength), jump, and sprint training methods. METHODS Ten male athletes completed three training sessions requiring maximal efforts that varied in their loading characteristics: (i) heavy-resistance exercise (10 × 5 back squats at 80% one-repetition maximum [1RM]) (STR), (ii) jumping exercise (10 × 5 jump squats) (JUMP), and (iii) maximal sprinting (15 × 30 m) (SPR). Preparticipants, postparticipants, and 24-, 48-, and 72-h postparticipants completed a battery of tests to measure neuromuscular function using electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve, and single- and paired-pulse magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex, with evoked responses recorded from the knee extensors. Fatigue was self-reported at each time point using a visual analog scale. RESULTS Each intervention elicited fatigue that resolved by 48 (JUMP) and 72 h (STR and SPR). Decrements in muscle function (reductions in the potentiated quadriceps twitch force) persisted for 48 h after all exercise. Reductions in voluntary activation were present for 24 h after JUMP and SPRINT, and 48 h after STR. No other differences in CNS function were observed as a consequence of training.

We clarified the hemodynamics of the reconstructed gastric tube with indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence. METHODS In 20 patients undergoing gastric tube reconstruction during esophagectomy, we evaluated blood flow in the gastric tube with ICG fluorescence imaging. We divided the patients into two groups according to the quality of blood flow to the gastric tube-""good"" (n = 9) and ""sparse or absent"" (n = 11)-based on visual assessment of the anastomosis of the right and left gastroepiploic vessels. We measured the time from initial enhancement of the root of the right gastroepiploic artery until enhancement of the most cranial branch of the left gastroepiploic artery and tip of the gastric tube. RESULTS The gastric tube was divisible into three zones according to the dominant arteries present in the greater curvature under ICG fluorescence. The left gastroepiploic artery was enhanced in a direction opposite that of physiological blood flow in all cases. The median period from initial enhancement of the root of the right gastroepiploic artery to the most cranial branch of the left gastroepiploic artery until perfusion up to the tip of the gastric tube did not differ significantly between the ""good"" and the ""sparse or absent"" groups (P = 0.24, 0.68) CONCLUSIONS: It is essential to preserve the whole vessel arcade of the greater curvature to achieve good blood perfusion in the gastric tube. The ICG fluorescence method has potential usefulness for evaluation of blood flow in the gastric tube.","Kumagai, Youichi; Ishiguro, Toru; Haga, Norihiro; Kuwabara, Koki; Kawano, Tatsuyuki; Ishida, Hideyuki",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-013-2237-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24196170/,68

We evaluated a distance learning program's effectiveness for reducing outpatient antibiotic prescribing for ARTI visits. METHODS In this stepped-wedge clinical trial run from November 2015 to June 2018, we randomly assigned 19 pediatric practices belonging to the Pediatric Research in Office Settings Network or the NorthShore University HealthSystem to 4 wedges. Visits for acute otitis media, bronchitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and upper respiratory infection for children 6 months to <11 years old without recent antibiotic use were included. Clinicians received the intervention as 3 program modules containing online tutorials and webinars on evidence-based communication strategies and antibiotic prescribing, booster video vignettes, and individualized antibiotic prescribing feedback reports over 11 months. The primary outcome was overall antibiotic prescribing rates for all ARTI visits. Mixed-effects logistic regression compared prescribing rates during each program module and a postintervention period to a baseline control period. Odds ratios were converted to adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) for interpretability. RESULTS Among 72 723 ARTI visits by 29 762 patients, intention-to-treat analyses revealed a 7% decrease in the probability of antibiotic prescribing for ARTI overall between the baseline and postintervention periods (aRR 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-0.96). Second-line antibiotic prescribing decreased for streptococcal pharyngitis (aRR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50-0.87) and sinusitis (aRR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44-0.77) but not for acute otitis media (aRR 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83-1.03). Any antibiotic prescribing decreased for viral ARTIs (aRR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.51-0.70).

METHOD Medical records, laboratory results and radiologic findings of 52 cancer patients with COVID-19 were collected, clinical characteristics and outcomes were summarized. RESULTS A total of 52 cancer patients with COVID-19 were included. Median age of 52 cancer patients with COVID-19 was 63 years (34-98). 33(63.5%) patients were mild and 19(36.5%) were severe/critical. Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (10, 19.2%). The common symptoms were as follows: fever (25%), dry cough (17.3%), chest distress (11.5%) and fatigue (9.6%).There were 33(63.5%) patients had comorbidities, the most common symptom was hypertension (17, 51.5%). 26(78.8%) patients developed pneumonia on admission. Lymphocytes (0.6×109 /L) decreased in both mild and severe/critical patients. Median levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein(CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) were 2.8 mg/L, 70.5 mg/L, 0.3 ng/mL, and 318 U/L respectively, which increased significantly in severe/critical patients compared to the mild patients. Interleukin 6(IL-6) (12.6 pg/ml) increased in both mild and severe/critical patients, there was a significant difference between them. Complications were observed in 29(55.8%) patients, such as liver injury (19, 36.5%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (9, 17.3%), sepsis (8, 15.4%), myocardial injury (8, 15.4%), renal insufficiency (4, 7.7%), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (3, 5.8%).11(21.2%) cancer patients died.

At STAIR VIII, consensus recommendations were developed for clinical trial strategies to demonstrate the benefit of endovascular reperfusion therapies for acute ischemic stroke. SUMMARY OF REVIEW Prospects for success with forthcoming endovascular trials are robust, because new neurothrombectomy devices have superior reperfusion efficacy compared with earlier-generation interventions. Specific recommendations are provided for trial designs in 3 populations: (1) patients undergoing intravenous fibrinolysis, (2) early patients ineligible for or having failed intravenous fibrinolysis, and (3) wake-up and other late-presenting patients. Among intravenous fibrinolysis-eligible patients, key principles are that CT or MRI confirmation of target arterial occlusions should precede randomization; endovascular intervention should be pursued with the greatest rapidity possible; and combined intravenous and neurothrombectomy therapy is more promising than neurothrombectomy alone. Among patients ineligible for or having failed intravenous fibrinolysis, scientific equipoise was affirmed and the need to randomize all eligible patients emphasized. Vessel imaging to confirm occlusion is mandatory, and infarct core and penumbral imaging is desirable in later time windows. Additional STAIR VIII recommendations include approaches to test multiple devices in a single trial, utility weighting of disability end points, and adaptive designs to delineate time and tissue injury thresholds at which benefits from intervention no longer accrue. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular research priorities in acute ischemic stroke are to perform trials testing new, highly effective neuro thrombectomy devices rapidly deployed in patients confirmed to have target vessel occlusions.","Saver, Jeffrey L; Jovin, Tudor G; Smith, Wade S; Albers, Gregory W; Baron, Jean-Claude; Boltze, Johannes; Broderick, Joseph P; Davis, Lisa A; Demchuk, Andrew M; DeSena, Salvatore; Fiehler, Jens; Gorelick, Philip B; Hacke, Werner; Holt, Bill; Jahan, Reza; Jing, Hui; Khatri, Pooja; Kidwell, Chelsea S; Lees, Kennedy R; Lev, Michael H; Liebeskind, David S; Luby, Marie; Lyden, Patrick; Megerian, J Thomas; Mocco, J; Muir, Keith W; Rowley, Howard A; Ruedy, Richard M; Savitz, Sean I; Sipelis, Vitas J; Shimp, Samuel K; Wechsler, Lawrence R; Wintermark, Max; Wu, Ona; Yavagal, Dileep R; Yoo, Albert J",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.113.002769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24193797/,68

RAE is well tolerated with few complications, particularly if the time interval from embolization to surgery is reduced to less than 48 hours. Review of the literature suggests that RAE is also extremely effective for palliation of symptoms in the setting of nonoperative advanced stage renal cell carcinoma. In addition, this technique plays a large role in the management of angiomyolipomas that are symptomatic or at risk of spontaneous rupture. To date, RAE has not been evaluated in a randomized controlled setting, which has contributed to its underutilization.

With this study, we aimed to summarize available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of DOAC vs. VKA in real-life VKA-experienced atrial fibrillation patients. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library systematically for English-language studies indexed any time before October 2018. We included studies of VKA-experienced atrial fibrillation patients initiating DOAC therapy, with continued VKA therapy as comparator. Outcomes included arterial thromboembolism and bleeding. When appropriate, meta-analysis was performed by calculating pooled, weighted, adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Eight cohort studies comparing VKA-experienced DOAC (dabigatran or rivaroxaban) users with continued VKA users were included. When comparing DOAC to VKA, an increased risk of ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction was found for dabigatran (pooled aHR of 1.61 (95% CI 1.19-2.19, I2 =65%) and 1.29 (95% CI 1.10-1.52, I2 =0%)), respectively), but not for rivaroxaban. Use of dabigatran in VKA-experienced users was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (pooled aHR 1.63 (95% CI 1.36-1.94, I2 =30%)), but a decreased risk of intracranial bleeding (pooled aHR 0.45 (95% CI 0.32-0.64, I2 =0%)). In conclusion, use of dabigatran in prior VKA users in clinical practice was associated with a slightly increased risk of arterial thromboembolism and gastrointestinal bleeding, but a decreased risk of intracranial bleeding. Importantly, observational studies of real-life VKA-experienced oral anticoagulant users may be confounded by the reason for switching. This article is protected by copyright.

Vaccination strategies against rotavirus and coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) infections are reviewed. These vaccination principles are applicable against emerging enteric infections such as PEDV. Maternal vaccines to induce lactogenic immunity, and their transmission to suckling neonates via colostrum and milk, are critical for early passive protection. Subsequently, in weaned animals, oral vaccines incorporating novel mucosal adjuvants (e.g., vitamin A, probiotics) may provide active protection when maternal immunity wanes.

METHODS MEDLINE (via PubMed), LILACS (via BVS) and Cochrane/CENTRAL virtual databases were searched for studies dated before 2017. We identified prospective and retrospective studies, including observational, cohort, single-blinded and multicenter studies, comparing VCE and DBE for the diagnosis of OGIB, and data of all the vascular sources of bleeding were collected. All patients were subjected to the same gold standard method. Relevant data were then extracted from each included study using a standardized extraction form. We calculated study variables (sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy) and performed a meta-analysis using Meta-Disc software. RESULTS In the per-patient analysis, 17 studies (1477 lesions) were included. We identified 3150 exams (1722 VCE and 1428 DBE) in 2043 patients and identified 2248 sources of bleeding, 1467 of which were from vascular lesions. Of these lesions, 864 (58.5%) were diagnosed by VCE, and 613 (41.5%) were diagnosed by DBE. The pretest probability for bleeding of vascular origin was 54.34%. The sensitivity of DBE was 84% (95%CI: 0.82-0.86; heterogeneity: 78.00%), and the specificity was 92% (95%CI: 0.89-0.94; heterogeneity: 92.0%). For DBE, the positive likelihood ratio was 11.29 (95%CI: 4.83-26.40; heterogeneity: 91.6%), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.20 (95%CI: 0.15-0.27; heterogeneity: 67.3%). Performing DBE after CE increased the diagnostic yield of vascular lesion by 7%, from 83% to 90%.

This randomized trial compares SILC against four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with post-operative pain as the primary endpoint. METHODS Hundred patients were randomized to either SILC (n = 50) or LC (n = 50). Exclusion criteria were (1) Acute cholecystitis; (2) ASA 3 or above; (3) Bleeding disorders; and (4) Previous open upper abdominal surgery. Patients and post-operative assessors were blinded to the procedure performed. The site and severity of pain were compared at 4 h, 24 h, 14 days and 6 months post-procedure using the visual analog scale; non-inferiority was assumed when the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the difference was above -1 and superiority when p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS The study arms were demographically similar. At 24 h post-procedure, SILC was associated with less pain at extra-umbilical sites (rest: p = 0.004; movement: p = 0.008). Pain data were inconclusive at 24 h at the umbilical site on movement; SILC was otherwise non-inferior for pain at all other points. Operating duration was longer in SILC (79.46 vs 58.88 min, p = 0.003). 8% of patients in each arm suffered complications (p = 1.000). Re-intervention rates, analgesic use, return to function, and patient satisfaction did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS SILC has improved short-term pain outcomes compared to LC and is not inferior in both short-term and long-term pain outcomes.

The safety and suitability of SPLS for colon cancer has not been widely proved. We aimed at validating the safety, efficacy, and short-term quality of life (QOL) of SPLS compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) in patients with colon cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between June 2010 and April 2011, a total of 62 patients with pathology-proven colon cancer were randomly allocated to two groups: SPLS and CLS. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS In total, there were 62 patients (35 men and 27 women) with a mean age of 63.0 years (range, 38-82). The baseline characteristics of the patients and tumor factors were well balanced between two groups. The operation time and estimated blood loss were similar, whereas intraoperative complications only occurred in three patients, all of whom were in the SPLS group. Conversion to CLS or open surgery occurred in 6 (19.4%) patients of the SPLS group. The number of harvested lymph nodes and length of proximal and distal resection margins were not statistically different between two groups. Postoperative complications and recovery of bowel function were similar in both groups, but fatal postoperative complication occurred in one case in the SPLS group. The QOL between two groups was identical in all domains until postoperative 12 months. CONCLUSIONS SPLS for colon cancer is feasible and can be performed by following oncologic principles.

To discuss the concept of Planetary Health in the context of Europe, a conference entitled: ""Europe That Protects: Safeguarding Our Planet, Safeguarding Our Health"" was held in Helsinki in December 2019. The conference participants concluded with a need for action to support Planetary Health during the 2020s. The Helsinki Declaration emphasizes the urgency to act as scientific evidence shows that human activities are causing climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation, overuse of natural resources and pollution. They threaten the health and safety of human kind. Global, regional, national, local and individual initiatives are called for and multidisciplinary and multisectorial actions and measures are needed. A framework for an action plan is suggested that can be modified for local needs. Accordingly, a shift from fragmented approaches to policy and practice towards systematic actions will promote human health and health of the planet. Systems thinking will feed into conserving nature and biodiversity, and into halting climate change. The Planetary Health paradigm ‒ the health of human civilization and the state of natural systems on which it depends ‒ must become the driver for all policies.","Halonen, Jaana I; Erhola, Marina; Furman, Eeva; Haahtela, Tari; Jousilahti, Pekka; Barouki, Robert; Bergman, Åke; Billo, Nils E; Fuller, Richard; Haines, Andrew; Kogevinas, Manolis; Kolossa-Gehring, Marike; Krauze, Kinga; Lanki, Timo; Vicente, Joana Lobo; Messerli, Peter; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark; Paloniemi, Riikka; Peters, Annette; Posch, Karl-Heinz; Timonen, Pekka; Vermeulen, Roel; Virtanen, Suvi M; Bousquet, Jean; Antó, Josep M",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307082/,68

For this purpose, a model adopting a life cycle inventory approach was developed to integrate solid waste and wastewater management processes under a single framework and test scenarios for a waste with high organic food content typical of developing economies. For such a waste composition, the results show that a FWD policy can reduce emissions by nearly ∼42% depending on market penetration, fraction of food waste ground, as well as solid waste and wastewater management schemes, including potential energy recovery. In comparison to baseline, equivalent economic gains can reach ∼28% when environmental externalities including sludge management and emissions variations are considered. The sensitivity analyses on processes with a wide range in costs showed an equivalent economic impact thus emphasizing the viability of a FWD policy although the variation in the cost of sludge management exhibited a significant impact on savings.","Maalouf, Amani; El-Fadel, Mutasem",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28803764/,68

Previous studies revealed that epicardial fat thickness (EFT) correlates with OSA severity. Interestingly, female patients display a stronger EFT-OSA correlation than males. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between EFT and different clinical characteristics in pre- and post-menopausal women diagnosed with OSA. METHODS Patients diagnosed with OSA were divided into pre/early peri-menopausal (Group 1) and post/late peri-menopausal (Group 2) according to the menopause status. EFT was obtained from parasternal long-axis echocardiographic images. We also collected general clinical characteristics of patients involved in this study, and performed spearman correlation analysis to explore the correlations between EFT and the general clinical characteristics. We further applied Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis to explore the predictors for EFT in both groups. RESULTS A total number of 23 and 59 patients were enrolled in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively. EFT in Group 2 was significantly higher than that of Group 1. In both groups, EFT was positively correlated with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), percentage of total sleep time when blood oxygen saturation was less than 90% (T90), oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and glucose; while EFT was negatively correlated with mean and lowest SaO2 (oxygen saturation) levels. However, EFT was positively correlated with total cholesterol (TC) only in Group 1 and body mass index (BMI) only in Group2, respectively. Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis showed that AHI was independently associated with EFT in Group 1. However, both AHI and BMI were independent predictors of EFT in Group 2. CONCLUSION EFT was notably correlated with menopausal status in women with OSA. AHI was the independent predictor of EFT in women with OSA. BMI was the independent predictor of EFT in post/late peri-menopausal women with OSA.","Zhang, Yong; Wang, Jian; Shui, Wen; Zhang, Zhenxia; Li, Juan; Ma, Jin",BMC women's health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-021-01384-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34116655/,68

It has infected millions of people worldwide. The trajectory of this disease continues to progress in some areas of the United States and worldwide. The Institute for Health Metrics now predicts a resurgence of infections in the fall of 2020. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 includes an inflammatory phase with either resolution or the potential to accelerate to a cytokine storm, characterized by high interleukin (IL)-6 and other inflammatory markers. COVID-19 is a condition without a gold-standard treatment. The US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir in severe cases of COVID-19, which shortened the recovery time in hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infection in one study. Although several vaccine trials are underway, no vaccines are available for primary prevention of COVID-19 at this time. Dietary supplement sales have dramatically risen during the COVID-19 pandemic despite depressed economic conditions. Commonly used immune-modulating dietary supplements, including vitamin D, ascorbic acid, zinc, and melatonin, are reviewed in this manuscript highlighting biological plausibility for salutary benefit against COVID-19.

Amidst the dilemma of a breakthrough in vaccine development, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was looked upon as a prospective repurposed candidate. It has confronted numerous controversies in the past few months as a chemoprophylactic and treatment option for COVID-19. Recently, it has been withdrawn by the World Health Organization for its use in an ongoing pandemic. However, its benefit/risk ratio regarding its use in COVID-19 disease remains poorly justified. An extensive literature search was done using Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, www.cdc.gov, www.fda.gov, and who.int.Areas covered: It is an attempt to unravel the toxicity vexations of HCQ along with the pharmaceutical perspectives in the current scenario. This will be followed by brief discussions on new advances in drug delivery approaches and computational modelling (PBPK and PD modelling) overtures. Multipronged combination approaches for enhanced synergism with antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents, and immuno-boosting effects, have also been discussed.Expert opinion: Harnessing the multipronged pharmaceutical perspectives will optimistically help the researchers, scientists, biotech, and pharmaceutical companies to bring new horizons in the safe and efficacious utilization of HCQ alone or in combination with remdesivir and immunomodulatory molecules like bovine lactoferrin in a fight against COVID-19. These different combinational therapies with free forms or nanomedicine based targeted approaches can act synergistically to boost host immunity and stop SARS-CoV-2 replication and invasion to impede the infection.","Jain, Ankit; Prajapati, Shiv Kumar; Tripathi, Madhavi; Raichur, Ashok M; Kanwar, Jagat R",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17512433.2021.1909473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769888/,68
156408,A hybrid pipeline for reconstruction and analysis of viral genomes at multi-organ level.,2020-08-01,"During the COVID-19 pandemic associated with high incidence, transmissibility, and mortality, this chapter focuses on three phases of the disease: initial exposure, initiation of the immune response to the agent, and finally, an inflammatory/autoimmune-like presentation with pulmonary, neurological, and renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation which occurs in a small proportion of the patients. The elegant demonstration of the site of interaction between the spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of COVID-19, and the ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) 2 receptor of cells distributed throughout the body has enabled research efforts to develop pharmacological and immune countermeasures to the viral phase of the disease. This chapter rapidly reviews the molecular and structural organization of SARS-CoV-2 and its interaction with ACE2. It is followed by a discussion over the role of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in recognition of the virus. The importance of rapid compartmentation of the viral genome into the target cells as opposed to the binding constant of the virus for the ACE receptor is discussed. Host factors affecting the immune response to the virus are examined, and the subsequent inflammatory dysregulation enabling the cytokine storm leading to system organ failure is described. Finally, the similarities of the clinical effects of the murine hepatitis virus-JHM (a coronavirus) on multi-organ systems (liver, brain, clotting cascade) as described by Perlman and colleagues permit insights regarding the role of the interaction between the host and the virus in developing the clinical presentation of the inflammatory/autoimmune disorders that occur in multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and more interestingly, during the third phase of COVID-19.","Kornguth, Steven E; Hawley, Robert J",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973189/,68
156517,Epidemiology. Does viral diversity matter?,2009,"The influenza A virus (IAV) M2 protein is a multifunctional protein with critical roles in virion entry, assembly, and budding. M2 is targeted to the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells, and the interaction of the viral proteins M2, M1, HA, and NA near glycolipid rafts in the apical plasma membrane is hypothesized to coordinate the assembly of infectious virus particles. To determine the role of M2 protein apical targeting in IAV replication, a panel of M2 proteins with basolateral plasma membrane (M2-Baso) or endoplasmic reticulum (M2-ER) targeting sequences was generated. MDCK II cells stably expressing M2-Baso, but not M2-ER, complemented the replication of M2-stop viruses. However, in primary human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, viruses encoding M2-Baso and M2-ER replicated to negligible titers compared to those of wild-type virus. M2-Baso replication was negatively correlated with cell polarization. These results demonstrate that M2 apical targeting is essential for IAV replication: targeting M2 to the ER results in a strong, cell type-independent inhibition of virus replication, and targeting M2 to the basolateral membrane has greater effects in hNECs than in MDCK cells.IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus assembly and particle release occur at the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells. The integral membrane proteins encoded by the virus, HA, NA, and M2, are all targeted to the apical membrane and believed to recruit the other structural proteins to sites of virus assembly. By targeting M2 to the basolateral or endoplasmic reticulum membranes, influenza A virus replication was significantly reduced. Basolateral targeting of M2 reduced the infectious virus titers with minimal effects on virus particle release, while targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum resulted in reduced infectious and total virus particle release. Therefore, altering the expression and the intracellular targeting of M2 has major effects on virus replication.","Wohlgemuth, Nicholas; Lane, Andrew P; Pekosz, Andrew",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01425-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30158290/,68

Folding-defective polypeptides are selected for degradation by processes collectively defined as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Enhanced ERAD activity may interfere with protein biogenesis by inappropriately targeting not-yet-native protein folding intermediates for disposal. The regulation of ERAD is therefore crucial to maintain cellular proteostasis. At steady-state, select ERAD regulators are constitutively removed from the ER in a series of processes collectively defined as ERAD tuning. This sets the ERAD activity at levels that do not interfere with completion of ongoing folding programs. Our latest work highlights a crucial, autophagy-independent role of nonlipidated LC3 (LC3-I) as part of a membrane-bound receptor that insures the vesicle-mediated clearance of at least two ERAD regulators from the ER, EDEM1 and OS9. This pathway is hijacked by coronaviruses (CoV), and silencing of LC3 substantially inhibits viral replication.","Bernasconi, Riccardo; Noack, Julia; Molinari, Maurizio",Autophagy,https://doi.org/10.4161/auto.21229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22895348/,68

One technique described in the literature deploys a Neuroform stent into the neck of the aneurysm in the shape of a waffle-cone, thereby acting as a scaffold for the coil mass. This case series presents four patients with large wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms treated with the closed-cell Enterprise stent using the waffle-cone technique. CASE DESCRIPTION Four patients (59 ± 18 years of age) with large wide-necked arterial bifurcation aneurysms (three basilar apex and one MCA bifurcation) were treated with the waffle-cone technique using the Enterprise stent as a supporting device for stent-assisted coil embolization. Three of the patients presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (Hunt-Hess 2-3; Fisher Grade 3-4). There was no procedural morbidity or mortality associated with treatment itself. One aneurysm was completely obliterated, and three had small residual necks. One patient developed an area of PCA infarct and visual field cut one month after the procedure and required recoiling of the residual neck. The flared ends of the Enterprise stent remodeled the aneurysm neck by conforming to the shape of the neck without any technical difficulty, resulting in a stable scaffold holding the coils into the aneurysm. CONCLUSION The closed cell construction, flexibility, and flared ends of the Enterprise stent allow it to conform to the waffle-cone configuration and provide a stable scaffold for coil embolization of large wide-necked arterial bifurcation aneurysms. We have had excellent initial results using the Enterprise stent with the waffle-cone technique. However, this technique is higher risk than standard treatment methods and therefore should be reserved for large wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms where Y stenting is needed, but not possible, and surgical clip ligation is not an option.","Padalino, David J; Singla, Amit; Jacobsen, Walter; Deshaies, Eric M",Surgical neurology international,https://doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.106268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23493649/,68

While WHO mentioned only chronic respiratory diseases, not specifically asthma as a risk factor for severe illness. There has been asthma prevalence discrepancy in studies of COVID-19 across the world. OBJECTIVE This meta-analysis aims to investigate the association between asthma and composite poor outcome in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS We conducted a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase database. We included all original research articles with adult COVID-19 patients > 18 years old and had information related to asthma as a risk factor. Studies with outcomes consisting of mortality, severe COVID-19, use of mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and hospital admission were included in this study. The outcomes of interest were divided into severe COVID-19, mortality and other poor outcomes. RESULTS Eleven studies were included in meta-analysis with a total of 6,046 patients. Asthma was not associated with composite poor outcomes with OR = 0.92 (95%CI 0.71-1.19, p = 0.61, and I2 = 8.49%).

The Zephyr-E was used by 15 stock people to euthanize 150 compromised pigs from 4 farrowing and nursery units from commercial farms and 2 research stations. Brainstem reflexes, convulsions, and heartbeat were used to assess insensibility, time of brain death, and cardiac arrest following Zephyr-E application. Skull fracture displacement (FD) was quantified from computed tomography (CT) scans (n = 24), macroscopic scoring was used to assess brain hemorrhage and skull fracture severity (n = 150), and microscopic scoring was used to assess subdural hemorrhage (SDH) and parenchymal hemorrhage within specific brain regions that are responsible for consciousness and vital function (n = 32). The Zephyr-E caused immediate, sustained insensibility until death in 98.6% of pigs. On average, clonic convulsions (CC) ceased in 82.2 s (± 3.4 SE), brain death was achieved in 144.9 s (± 5.4 SE), and cardiac arrest occurred in 226.5 s (± 8.7 SE). Time of brain death and cardiac arrest differed significantly among stock people (P = 0.0225 and P = 0.0369). Age was positively related to the duration of CC (P = 0.0092), time of brain death (P = 0.0025), and cardiac arrest (P = 0.0068) with shorter durations seen in younger pigs. Average FD was 8.3 mm (± 1.0 SE). Macroscopic scores were significantly different among weight classes for subcutaneous (P = 0.0402) and subdural-ventral (P = 0.0037) hemorrhage with the lowest severity hemorrhage found in the 9-kg weight category. Microscopic scores differed among brain sections (P = 0.0070) for SDH with lower scores found in the brainstem compared to the cerebral cortex and midbrain. Parenchymal hemorrhage differed among brain sections (P = 0.0052) and weight categories (P = 0.0128) with the lowest scores in the midbrain and brainstem and the 7- and 9-kg weight categories. The Zephyr-E was highly effective for the euthanasia of pigs up to 9 kg (49 d) based on immediate insensibility sustained until death. Postmortem results confirmed that severe skull fracture and widespread brain hemorrhage were caused by the Zephyr-E nonpenetrating captive bolt.","Casey-Trott, T M; Millman, S T; Turner, P V; Nykamp, S G; Lawlis, P C; Widowski, T M",Journal of animal science,https://doi.org/10.2527/jas.2014-7980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25349360/,68

However, the transumbilical incision may be associated with a high frequency of wound-related complications, including trocar site hernia and infection. Therefore, we developed remote access laparoscopic (REAL) surgery, a new access technique for single-port surgery within the pubic hairline. This study reports on a technique developed at our institution and describes our preliminary results. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE Ten patients with cholecystolithiasis underwent REAL surgery. A single 2.5-cm transverse incision was made medially within the pubic hairline area, and a SILS Port was inserted. A 5-mm flexible endoscope and an articulating grasper or a long laparoscopic grasper were used. Dissection of the gallbladder was achieved with laparoscopic ultrasonic shears just as in the conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All procedures were successfully performed without conversion to conventional laparoscopic technique. There were no postoperative complications, and outpatient evaluation showed a clean scar within the pubic hair area in all patients. DISCUSSION Our early experience shows that REAL surgery is feasible and safe. This novel access technique can preserve the native umbilicus and provides an invisible scar that is concealed within the pubic hair.","Iwashita, Y; Kitano, S; Yasuda, K; Ogawa, T; Ohta, M",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1758-5910.2010.00068.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22776174/,68

However, there are limited performance benchmarks in IAT and there is a scarcity of information on how to structure an effective IAT protocol and its impact on time to treatment. The objective of our study was to detail a standardized IAT protocol, and to assess its influence on time to treatment in ischemic stroke. METHODS This was a retrospective observational study over 4 years at a comprehensive stroke center. A standardized IAT protocol was implemented in June 2013 that included pre-notifying the stroke team before hospital arrival, defining clinician roles, processing tasks in parallel, and standardizing IAT procedures. Three time metrics were examined and reported as median (IQR) minutes: arrival to CT imaging, CT to groin puncture, and puncture to recanalization. We compared these metrics in patients admitted before implementation (January 2012-May 2013) to patients admitted after (June 2013-December 2015) using Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS 380 patients were included. After the protocol was implemented, there were significant reductions in time from arrival to CT (17 (14-21) vs 13 (11-19) min, p<0.001), CT to puncture (46 (30-82) vs 31 (23-54) min, p<0.001), and puncture to recanalization (65 (33-90) vs 37 (22-65) min, p<0.001). 60% of time was saved during puncture to recanalization. Significant reductions in time were observed during both normal working hours and off-hours. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of a standardized protocol resulted in a significant reduction in time to recanalization for patients with an ischemic stroke. A standardized IAT protocol decreases time to recanalization when team roles are clearly defined, tasks are processed in parallel, and procedures are standardized.","Frei, Donald; McGraw, Constance; McCarthy, Kathryn; Whaley, Michelle; Bellon, Richard J; Loy, David; Wagner, Jeff; Orlando, Alessandro; Bar-Or, David",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27811176/,68

Although this therapy eliminates the virus in a substantial proportion of patients, it has numerous side effects and contraindications. Recent approval of telaprevir and boceprevir, targeting the protease residing in nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) of the HCV genome, increased therapy success when given in combination with pegylated IFN and ribavirin, but side effects are more frequent and the management of treatment is complex. This situation will change soon with the introduction of new highly potent direct-acting antivirals. They target, in addition to the NS3 protease, NS5A, which is required for RNA replication and virion assembly and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Moreover, host-cell factors such as cyclophilin A or microRNA-122, essential for HCV replication, have been pursued as therapeutic targets. In this review, the authors briefly summarize the main features of viral and cellular factors involved in HCV replication that are utilized as therapy targets for chronic hepatitis C.","Rupp, Daniel; Bartenschlager, Ralf",Seminars in liver disease,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1371006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782254/,68

Little is known about COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to evaluate the influence of preexisting COPD on the progress and outcomes of COVID-19. Methods This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study. We enrolled 1,048 patients aged 40 years and above, including 50 patients with COPD and 998 patients without COPD, and with COVID-19 confirmed via high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, between December 11, 2019 and February 20, 2020. We collected data of demographics, pathologic test results, radiologic imaging, and treatments. The primary outcomes were composite endpoints determined by admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results Compared with patients who had COVID-19 but not COPD, those with COPD had higher rates of fatigue (56.0% vs. 40.2%), dyspnea (66.0% vs. 26.3%), diarrhea (16.0% vs. 3.6%), and unconsciousness (8.0% vs. 1.7%) and a significantly higher proportion of increased activated partial thromboplastin time (23.5% vs. 5.2%) and D-dimer (65.9% vs. 29.3%), as well as ground-glass opacities (77.6% vs. 60.3%), local patchy shadowing (61.2% vs. 41.4%), and interstitial abnormalities (51.0% vs. 19.8%) on chest computed tomography. Patients with COPD were more likely to develop bacterial or fungal coinfection (20.0% vs. 5.9%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (20.0% vs. 7.3%), septic shock (14.0% vs. 2.3%), or acute renal failure (12.0% vs. 1.3%). Patients with COPD and COVID-19 had a higher risk of reaching the composite endpoints [hazard ratio (HR): 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.40-3.38; P=0.001] or death (HR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.15-4.51; P=0.019), after adjustment. Conclusions In this study, patients with COPD who developed COVID-19 showed a higher risk of admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death.","Wu, Fan; Zhou, Yumin; Wang, Zhongfang; Xie, Min; Shi, Zhe; Tang, Zhiqiang; Li, Xiaohe; Li, Xiaochen; Lei, Chunliang; Li, Yimin; Ni, Zhengyi; Hu, Yu; Liu, Xiaoqing; Yin, Wenguang; Cheng, Linling; Ye, Feng; Peng, Jieqi; Huang, Lingmei; Tian, Jia; Zhang, Lingjuan; Mo, Xiaoneng; Zhang, Ying; Hu, Ke; Jiang, Yongliang; Guan, Weijie; Xiang, Jie; Liu, Yingxia; Peng, Yixiang; Wei, Li; Hu, Yahua; Peng, Peng; Wang, Jianming; Liu, Jiyang; Huang, Wei; Chen, Ruchong; Zhao, Jianping; Li, Shiyue; Zhang, Nuofu; Zhao, Jincun; Zhong, Nanshan; Ran, Pixin",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-1914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32642086/,68
160816,"Trends and Prospects in UiO-66 Metal-Organic Framework for CO2 Capture, Separation, and Conversion.",2021-05-05,"INTRODUCTION On a global scale, bringing together schools and public child psychiatry services is favored to promote the development of early interventions that could improve health trajectories, from prevention to treatment, for children exposed to psychological and psychiatric difficulties. In a public health perspective, contextualizing these practices is essential in order to ensure their sustainability and efficiency. This article sheds light on the stakes of these partnerships and their advantages in responding to the health, social, and economic mark that has been left behind by the crisis accompanying the brutal onset of the Covid-19 epidemic. AIMS Improving the health care management for children with mental health problems or problems of a psychological nature implies taking into account their environment beyond the therapeutic framework. Interventional research, currently underway, is taking place in several sites in France: primary schools, Medical-psychological centers (CMP), and Local Committees on Mental Health (CLSM). The goal is to provide an inventory and an analysis of the partnership and interventional structures that are most efficient, based on the needs and available resources at each site. This research envisages a diversification and a contextualization of the offer of care, with great concern for equity and therapeutic efficacy, starting from school. RESULTS More than simple results, our aim is to make suggestions as to how to better accompany the end of confinement and the months to come. The development of partnerships in regions that are strongly marked by social and economic inequalities is a priority in terms of public health and the direction of local policies. These partnerships would contribute to a global strategy of evaluating the needs and the personalized accompaniment of children. Formalizing the intervention with the interface being the school sector will support the school staff in overcoming the health crisis that is affecting their institution. The steady rise of CLSMs will enhance local coordination and collaboration to help the most psychologically vulnerable children and aid their parents, given their situation, to support the development of their children. CONCLUSION Restoring human and material resources to existing structures, notably in the sector of child psychiatry so that it can accomplish its public service mission seems to be a priority today. Establishing school-CMP-CLSM partnerships can contribute to providing local policy direction in the interest of elaborating individual and collective strategies that can ensure needs-adapted care that is accessible to as many children as possible.","Bonneton, Sandrine; Maillard, Isabelle; Denis, Frédéric; Roelandt, Jean-Luc",Sante publique,https://doi.org/10.3917/spub.205.0531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723959/,68

The history revealed that the ocular signs had started 1 week after the COVID-19.Results: The examination revealed sectoral hyperemia of the temporal region in the bulbar conjunctiva together with marked limitation of right inward gaze. MRI of the orbits demonstrated diffuse fusiform enhancing enlargement of the right lateral rectus and superior rectus. The results of the laboratory tests and examination findings were normal. Systemic corticosteroids were started for the orbital myositis.Conclusions: Although conjunctivitis is the more common ocular disease following COVID-19, the possibility of orbital myositis should be considered in cases with resistance to topical treatment and/or gaze limitation. The possible role of orbital myositis as a trigger for COVID-19 could be explained with an immune-mediated mechanism.","Mangan, Mehmet Serhat; Yildiz, Elvin",Ocular immunology and inflammation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09273948.2021.1887282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797304/,68

163612,Waves and currents decrease the available space in a salmon cage,2021-07-23,"We propose 'Tapestry', a single-round pooled testing method with application to COVID-19 testing using quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) that can result in shorter testing time and conservation of reagents and testing kits, at clinically acceptable false positive or false negative rates. Tapestry combines ideas from compressed sensing and combinatorial group testing to create a new kind of algorithm that is very effective in deconvoluting pooled tests. Unlike Boolean group testing algorithms, the input is a quantitative readout from each test and the output is a list of viral loads for each sample relative to the pool with the highest viral load. For guaranteed recovery of k infected samples out of n &gt;&gt; k being tested, Tapestry needs only O(k log n) tests with high probability, using random binary pooling matrices. However, we propose deterministic binary pooling matrices based on combinatorial design ideas of Kirkman Triple Systems, which balance between good reconstruction properties and matrix sparsity for ease of pooling while requiring fewer tests in practice. This enables large savings using Tapestry at low prevalence rates while maintaining viability at prevalence rates as high as 9.5%. Empirically we find that single-round Tapestry pooling improves over two-round Dorfman pooling by almost a factor of 2 in the number of tests required. We evaluate Tapestry in simulations with synthetic data obtained using a novel noise model for RT-PCR, and validate it in wet lab experiments with oligomers in quantitative RT-PCR assays. Lastly, we describe use-case scenarios for deployment.","Ghosh, S.; Agarwal, R.; Rehan, M.

A search of bibliographic databases (WoS, Scopus, Medline) found numerous studies published in various publications by entering the keywords: COVID-19 OR pandemic AND psychological needs AND mental health AND hardiness. The results of the research indicated that the fear of infecting oneself and loved ones, the consequences of social distancing and the economic consequences of a pandemic could have a significant effect on mental health. The following groups have been identified as particularly vulnerable to pandemic stressors: (a) people who have been in direct or indirect contact with the virus;(b) people with previous psychiatric problems;(c) health professionals and (d) people who constantly follow pandemic news. The consequences of a pandemic threaten basic psychological needs such as physiological needs, the need for safety, and the need for love and intimacy. The most common mental health problems that have been identified since the onset of the pandemic are anxiety, depression, symptoms of post-traumatic stress and substance abuse. In conclusion, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of risk factors that can endanger mental health have been identified, as well as protective factors, such as psychological resilience.","Anticevic, V.",Drustvena Istrazivanja,https://doi.org/10.5559/di.30.2.12,68

The purpose of this systematic review is to identify virtual mindfulness-based interventions for the well-being of young adults aged 15 to 40 years in developed countries and examine the efficacy of these techniques/exercises. Methods This mixed-methods systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines with a registered PROSPERO protocol. With a convergent integrated synthesis approach, IEEE Xplore, PsychInfo, Web of Science and OVID were searched with a predetermined criteria and search strategy employing booleans and filters for peer-reviewed and grey literature. Data screening and extraction were independently performed by two authors, with a third author settling disagreements after reconciliation. Study quality of selected articles was assessed with two independent authors using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Studies were analyzed qualitatively (precluding meta and statistical analysis) due to the heterogeneous study results from diverse study designs in present literature. Results Common mindfulness-based interventions used in the appraised studies included practicing basic mindfulness, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programs, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy programs (MBCT) and the Learning 2 BREATHE (L2B) program. Conclusion Studies implementing mindfulness interventions demonstrated an overall improvement in well-being. Modified versions of these interventions can be implemented in a virtual context, so young adults can improve their well-being through an accessible format.","Xu, J.; Jo, H.; Noorbhai, L.; Patel, A.; Li, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.24.21256035v1?rss=1,68

Objectives: To analyze associated symptoms with fever in a longitudinal follow-up study. Methods: In a longitudinal study over one year, 196 participants recorded three temperature readings daily, one after waking up, one between 12-3 PM, one before sleeping, and filled the symptomatology questionnaire in a thermometry diary. Results: Per protocol analysis was done for febrile participants (n=144). Fatigue (50.3%), warmth (47.3%), headache/head heaviness (47.0%), feeling malaise/general weakness (46.7%), loss of appetite (46.5%), muscle cramps/muscle aches (45.6%), chills/shivering (44.6%), increased sweating (43.0%), nausea (42.5%), irritability (38.9%), increased breathing rate (37.1%), and restlessness/anxiety/palpitations (36.5%) were the symptoms maximally seen during the febrile phase. A higher number of associated symptoms are associated with higher temperature readings. Dehydration suggested the numerically highest temperature values (100.86oF) but seen in few febrile patients. Conclusions: Incorporation of symptom analysis in febrile patients is the need of the hour. Fatigue and warmth are found to be most prevelent symptoms during febrile phase. Associated symptoms can help in predicting the intensity of fever also.","Kapoor, M.; Kumar, N.; Panda, P. K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.03.21261558v1?rss=1,68
167739,Aptamers against viruses: selection strategies and bioanalytical applications,2021,"IntroductionPrevious research shows that subjective well-being during pandemic (SWB-P) is related to sociodemographic variables (de Pedraza et al., 2020) and coping (Rasskazova et al., 2020). We hypothesized that SWB-P depends on specific types of optimism and coping with pandemic situation, namely defensive optimism (belief the coronavirus problem is exaggerated) and constructive optimism (belief that people’s efforts help prevent infection and spread of the virus) which effects are mediated by the effects of destructive and constructive coping.ObjectivesThis study aimed to assess the effects of situation specific optimism and coping on SWB controlling for gender.MethodsThe sample comprised 1403 university students (68% women, M=20.59, SD=3.66). Online survey has been conducted from 10/4/2020 till 25/4/2020. The measures included LOT-R, the scales of defensive and constructive optimism, and the scales of destructive and adaptive coping with pandemic situation (Gordeeva, Sychev, 2020). Well-being was assessed by sum of positive affect minus negative affect (PANAS) and SWLS (Diener et al., 1985).ResultsStructural equation modeling shows that SWB-P is related directly to gender (less well-being in women), dispositional optimism, adaptive coping and destructive coping (negatively). The negative effect of defensive optimism was mediated only by destructive coping (p<0.001), the effects of constructive optimism on well-being was mediated by adaptive and destructive coping (both p<0.01) (χ2 (4)= 8.97;p = 0.06;CFI = 0.996;TLI = 0.978;RMSEA = 0.030;PCLOSE = 0.886).ConclusionsDispositional optimism together with situation-specific defensive and constructive types of optimism and coping are essential for explaining well-being during Covid-19 lockdown.","Gordeeva, T.; Sychev, O.; Lunkina, M.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1607,68

Combined with mechanisms of aerosolization, airborne transport of enteric microbes and their genetic material is possible in such settings but remains poorly characterized. We detected and quantified enteric pathogen-associated gene targets in aerosol samples near open wastewater canals (OWCs) or impacted surface waters and control sites in La Paz, Bolivia; Kanpur, India; and Atlanta, USA via multiplex qPCR (37 targets) and ddPCR (13 targets). We detected a wide range enteric pathogen-specific targets, some not previously reported in extramural urban aerosols, with more frequent detections of all enteric targets at higher densities in La Paz and Kanpur near OWCs. We report density estimates ranging from non-detects to 4.7 x 102 gc per m3air for targets including ST-ETEC, C. jejuni, EIEC/Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., adenovirus, and Cryptosporidium spp. An estimated 25%, 76%, and 0% of samples containing positive pathogen detects were accompanied by culturable E. coli in La Paz, Kanpur, and Atlanta, respectively, suggesting potential for viability of enteric microbes at the point of sampling.

This in part reflects the viral ability to influence the cytokine secretion and thereby the innate immune system. Especially the viral interference of IFN-I signaling and the subsequent deficiency of innate immune response in the early phase have been associated with rapid virus replication and later excessive immune responses. We propose a mathematical framework to analyze IFN-I signaling and its impact on the interaction motif between virus, NK cells and macrophages. The model recapture divergent dynamics of coronavirus infections including the possibility for elevated secretion of IL-6 and IFN-γ as a consequence of exacerbated macrophage activation. Dysfunction of NK cells recruitment increase disease severity by leading to a higher viral load peak, the possibility for excessive macrophage activation, and an elevated risk of the cytokine storm. Thus the model predicts that delayed IFN-I signaling could lead to pathogenicity in the latter stage of an infection. Reversely, in case of strong NK recruitment from infected cells we predict a possible chronic disease state with moderate and potentially oscillating virus/cytokine levels.","Xu, Xiaochan; Sneppen, Kim",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.02.454730,68

Lockdown was the only possible solution but the impact of lockdowns on economies was devastated. Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) a Covid-19 pandemic economic package of twenty lakh crore rupees was announced by Indian central government on the 12th of May, 2020. The package was released to make the country independent and to primarily empower the poor, labourers, and migrants who were adversely affected by Covid-19. Research Methodology The research paper is of qualitative type and the research methodology has two parts- in the first, the literature has been reviewed regarding the impact of Covid-19 on various sectors globally and in the second part- extracted tweets has been analysed using NVivo and the main parameters- themes, sentiment, word map and word cloud are noted down. Findings The paper extracted various themes under the Atmanirbhar Bharat and the top five themes are related to defence and products. Majority of the tweets are on the positive side as shown by the sentiment analysis. The majority of tweets are from Asia as shown by the word map. Conclusion Lack of beds in hospitals, lack of oxygen supply, and lack of basic facilities for Covid-19 patients have debunk the health system.

These international transfers, organized by the regional health agency and the emergency medical call centers, mainly use flying ambulances belonging to hospitals, army, and civil protection. The support of these patients was provided by a specialized physician-nurse team. The choice of this strategy made it possible to avoid saturation of intensive care units and to make a choice between patients admitted or not in intensive care. Adaptability of health care providers and an organization as close as possible to the field allowed these transfers to be carried out under good conditions.

Objectives: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19. Methods: This cross-sectional study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from health workers in different hospitals using an online questionnaire. Participants were also asked to complete the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). The total scores of these measurement tools were interpreted as follows: PHQ-9 normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe (15-21) depression;ISI normal (0-7), mild (8-14), moderate (15-21), and severe (22-28) insomnia;GAD-7 normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe (15-21) anxiety. Results: A total of 155 health care workers with a mean age of 31.3 ± 25 years [26-45] and a sex-ratio of 0.3 completed the online questionnaire. All participants were directly engaged in diagnosing, treating, or caring for patients with or suspected to have COVID-19. Participants were divided into two groups: 79% medical (61% doctors in training and 18% hospital doctors) and 21% paramedical staff. Twenty-two participants (14.2%) had a chronic disease and 21(13.5%) had a history of depression. Nineteen (12.2%) of the participants were infected with COVID-19, 4 of whom contracted the infection in the hospital (50% during October 2020). A statement to the department of occupational medicine was made in 70% of cases. Ninety-one percent of the participants were fit for treating patients with COVID-19. The mean number of nightshifts in the COVID unit per month was 5.3. The mean number of hours of work in the COVID unit was 5 hours per day, 36 hours per week, and 62 hours per month. An increase in workload compared to the pre-epidemic was noted in 62.9% of cases. Thirteen percent of participants experienced the same anxiety level as the first time of taking care of COVID patients while 65% were rather at ease compared to the first time. Forty-seven percent of participants felt the need for psychological support and 16.7% of whom had consulted a psychiatrist. Participants were diagnosed with depression (9 cases), anxiety (13 cases), and burn-out (3 cases). The prescribed treatment was: antidepressants (5 cases), anxiolytic (10 cases), and psychotherapy (12 cases). Mild depression was detected in 13% of cases, moderate depression in 4% of cases, and severe depression in 2% of cases. Mild insomnia was detected in 41% of cases, moderate insomnia in 14% of cases, and severe insomnia in 9% of cases. As for anxiety, 33% of participants suffered from mild anxiety, 14% moderate anxiety, and 5% severe anxiety. Conclusion: Participants reported experiencing psychological burden and a high rate of anxiety, depression, and insomnia.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) following sepsis portends higher mortality. Overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) is a potential mediator of sepsis and sepsis-induced AKI. BAM15 is a chemical uncoupler that dissipates the mitochondrial proton gradient without generating mtROS, and improves experimental renal ischemic injury. We injected BAM15 into mice at 0 or 6 hours after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) treated with fluids and antibiotics. BAM15 reduced mortality, even when started at 6 hours, when mice were ill, and reduced kidney damage but did not affect other organs. Serial plasma and urinary levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were increased following CLP, and decreased after BAM15 (at 0 and at 6 hours). In vitro BAM15 prevented mtROS overproduction and mtDNA release from septic kidney tubule cells; mtROS generation correlated with mtDNA release. BAM15 also promotes mitochondrial biogenesis signaling. We conclude that BAM15 is an effective preventive and therapeutic candidate in experimental sepsis, and that BAM15 and mtDNA are mechanistically linked via mtROS, which may form a drug-companion diagnostic pair to improve precision medicine approaches to diagnosing and treating clinical sepsis.","Tsuji, Naoko; Tsuji, Takayuki; Yamashita, Tetsushi; Hu, Xuzhen; Yuen, Peter S.T.; Star, Robert A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.06.451287,68
172664,PoSeiDon: a Nextflow pipeline for the detection of evolutionary recombination events and positive selection,2020-05-20,"In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, China. The new virus, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) - a highly pathogenic strain of coronaviruses - was isolated on 7 January 2020 and identified as the cause of the outbreak. The SARS-CoV-2 virus rapidly spread across China and many other countries and lead to an unprecedented public health crisis worldwide. While 80% of infected individuals remain asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms, the remaining 20% experience a rapid progression of the disease and severe/critical clinical condition that could lead to death. In patients with severe/critical phase of COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to disrupt the normal immune response, leading to dysregulation of the immune system function and development of uncontrolled hyperinflammatory processes. Several studies highlight relevant changes occurring both in innate and adaptive immune system. Recent data indicate that a hyperinflammatory syndrome induced by SARS-CoV-2 contributes to the disease severity and mortality. It was demonstrated that patients with severe/critical phase of COVID-19 exhibit lymphopenia, a decrease in number of NK cells, eosinophils and basophils, an increase in inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils, an impaired interferon-α production and activity, no detectable circulating interferon-β, and massive production of proinflammatory cytokines, commonly known as cytokine storm. Many reports suggest that acute respiratory depression syndrome, cardiac dysfunction, hepatic impairment, acute kidney injury, coagulopathies, and multi-organ failure, that are characteristic of severe/critical COVID-19, are not due to direct effects of SARS-CoV-2, but result from the exaggerated cytokine release in response to viral infection. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and immune system dysregulation associated with cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe COVID-19 is imperative to identify novel drug targets and to develop effective vaccines and drugs. In addition, the knowledge on the processes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection opens a door for the development and introduction of predictive diagnostic tests that enable the prognosis of the course and severity of the disease. © 2021 Polish Pharmaceutical Society.

Mulfinger et al. 2020). However, there are no validated questionnaires to measure stress caused by an epidemic such as Covid-19, instead self-constructed questions are used frequently.ObjectivesThe aim was to develop items for the assessment of specific workload in epidemics which can be used to obtain longitudinal data.MethodsA sample of N=8078 persons working in the health care sector in Germany participated in the VOICE, EviPan online survey addressing the burden of Covid-19 pandemic during the 2nd quarter of 2020. We used 15 self-constructed items to examine whether these items can represent Covid-19 specific topics. A total of N=7549 (24% males) had complete data to run a confirmatory factor analysis using SEM procedure in Stata 14.2.ResultsFive factors were identified a priory: Factor (F) 1: Workload due to Covid-19 pandemic (4 items;Cronbachs’ alpha (α))=0.740);F 2: Fear, uncertainty of SarsCoV-2infection (self and others) (3 items;α= 0.741);F 3: Patient safety (3 items;α=0.533;F 4: Perception of protection concepts (2 items;α=0.590);F 5: Dysfunctional coping strategies (3 items;α=0.447).

World Health Organization (WHO) has later announced this outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as pandemic. This has caused huge stress to medical staff. The need for digital connectivity between communities and nations had arisen. Digital revolutionary services like telehealth, telemedicine, eVisit, etc. play a vital role in reducing the risk and fighting the spread of the pandemic. The industry and academia accept 5G as the potential network capable of serving vertical applications of next generation with specific service needs. In order to achieve this dream, the physical network must be separated into several separate functional blocks of various sizes and systems devoted to specific kind of services depending on their needs (a full slice for large eHealth apps, healthcare servers, IoT apps, smart cities and so on).

174147,Automatic generation of ground truth data for the evaluation of clonal grouping methods in B-cell populations,2020-12-01,"Machines can be readily trained to automate medical image interpretation, with the primary goal of replicating human capabilities. Here, we propose an alternative role: using machine learning to discover pragmatic imaging-based biomarkers by interpreting one complex imaging modality via a second, more ubiquitous, lower-cost modality. We applied this strategy to train convolutional neural network models to estimate positron emission tomography (PET)-derived myocardial blood flow (MBF) at rest and with hyperemic stress, and their ratio, coronary flow reserve (CFR), using contemporaneous two-dimensional echocardiography videos as inputs. The resulting parameters, echoAI-restMBF, echoAI-stressMBF, and echoAI-CFR modestly approximated the original values. However, using echocardiograms of 5,393 (derivation) and 5,289 (external validation) patients, we show they sharply stratify individuals according to disease comorbidities and combined with baseline demographics, are strong predictors for heart failure hospitalization (C-statistic derivation: 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.81; validation: 0.81, 0.79-0.82) and acute coronary syndrome (C-statistic derivation: 0.77, 0.73-0.80; validation: 0.75, 0.73-0.78). Using echocardiograms of 3,926 genotyped individuals, we estimate narrow-sense heritability of 9.2%, 20.4% and 6.5%, respectively for echoAI-restMBF, echoAI-stressMBF, and echoAI-CFR. MBF indices show inverse genetic correlation with impedance-derived body mass indices, such as fat-free body mass (e.g., {rho}=-0.43, q=0.05 for echoAI-restMBF) and resolve conflicting historical data regarding body mass index and CFR. In terms of diseases, genetic association with ischemic heart disease is seen most prominently for echoAI-stressMBF ({rho}=-0.37, q=2.4x10-03). We hypothesize that interpreting one imaging modality through another represents a type of ""information bottleneck"", capturing latent features of the original physiologic measurements that have relevance across tissues. Thus, we propose a broader potential role for machine learning algorithms in developing scalable biomarkers that are anchored in known physiology, representative of latent biological factors, and are readily deployable in population health applications.","Goto, S.; Werdich, A.

174381,Fluorescence-Activated Droplet Sorting of Polyethylene Terephthalate-degrading Enzymes,2021-05-30,"Introduction: Guidelines for the Provision of Anaesthesia Services (GPAS) recommend1 there should be separate anaesthetic consultant cover for elective and emergency work in-hours on labour wards which are busy enough to warrant it. Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals (BSUH) NHS Trust has approximately 5000 deliveries per year, split across two obstetric led units at the Royal Sussex County Hospital (RSCH) and Princess Royal Hospital (PRH). Each site has a single obstetric anaesthetic consultant in-hours to oversee elective and emergency work. To ensure a safe service is provided, it is one of the roles of the ’starred’ anaesthetist to provide consultant-level back up to labour ward when workload exceeds the capacity of the duty anaesthetist. Methods: The RCOA Cappuccini tool2 was modified to assess the provision of back-up. Questions included- who was responsible for providing support and how could they be contacted;this contact (or alternative if provided) was tested for availability. Data were collected between 1 December 2020 and 22 January 2021. During the audit period, consultant rotas and clinical responsibilities changed in response to the second wave of COVID. We refer to data from 4 January 2021 as post- surge. Post-surge data assess whether there was an impact on senior anaesthetist availability to provide backup. Results: Data were collected on 62 occasions across the two sites- 41/62 (66%) pre-surge and 21/62 (34%) post-surge. Reasons for non-attendance given included supervision of a trainee in theatre or at an emergency elsewhere. [Formula presented] Discussion: BSUH does not have a separate elective and duty obstetric anaesthetist in-hours, therefore availability of a senior colleague to attend in an emergency is vital. Our Cappuccini test modification has demonstrated that this system is effective [Formula presented]0% of the time. Whilst the COVID pandemic has placed additional strains on the starred anaesthetist role, reconfiguration of rotas has possibly facilitated access to an appropriately senior anaesthetist to provide backup. The increased ability to contact backup at BSUH may be due to carrying of a dedicated DECT phone. The tool has demonstrated that the starred anaesthetist has awareness of their responsibilities and need to be immediately available. Our recommendations are for provision of a DECT phone for the starred consultant on the PRH site and for the starred consultant to relinquish mentoring solo trainees. Modification of the Cappuccini tool has been effective and useful to evaluate the system of consultant backup for labour ward in our institution.","Perera, M.; Elkhawad, A.; Clewley, T.; Baron, S.; Sudan, S.; Medniuk, A.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoa.2021.103054,68

Social isolation of older people with poor physical and mental health is strongly associated with mental health problems and decreased life expectancy. Other research has shown that older people managed to adapt to the changes brought about by the pandemic and have linked this to the concept of resilience. The aim of this research project was to investigate how this applied to residents in care home settings during the first phases of the contact ban in Germany from sociology, developmental psychology and environmental gerontology perspectives, and to gain in-depth understanding of residents' experiences. This paper draws on structured interview data collected from residents in two care homes during early June 2020 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The findings show that their experiences were shaped by three factors: care home settings and the approach of staff to handling the contact ban;biographical sense of resilience;and a hierarchy of life issues. The findings highlight the importance of locally specific response mechanisms in care homes, agency and belonging of residents despite health-related limitations and the importance of a critical (gendered) lens on understanding their experiences. © The Author(s), 2021.

The USD can act as a powerful hedge asset for stocks in regular market periods. Moreover, during the global financial crisis and COVID-19 outbreak, the safe-haven effect of gold becomes stronger for almost all stocks, whereas the USD can serve as a strong safe haven against stock markets of Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore when stock returns are extremely low. In terms of portfolio designing, we find that adding the USD and gold to portfolios improves their hedging effectiveness, and the optimally weighted stock-USD-gold portfolio is the best portfolio strategy, irrespective of referring to return or risk.","Dong, Xiyong Li Changhong Yoon Seong-Min",The North American Journal of Economics and Finance,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.najef.2021.101500,68

To identify confounding factors, features of the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnant and non-pregnant patients of early reproductive age who have no known risk factors and premorbid background. Materials and methods. The study included 163 pregnant women in the third trimester of gestation, 100 non-pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 100 pregnant women who did not get sick. Patients of all groups were comparable in age (18-35 years), social status, parity, body mass index, had no known risk factors for COVID-19;those who got sick were treated simultaneously. Results. Statistically significant associations were revealed between COVID-19 infection in the pregnant and iron deficiency anemia, vegetovascular dystonia, belonging to the Buryat ethnicity, and smoking. Pregnant women with COVID-19 were more likely to have no symptoms (23.3% vs 5%;p<0.001) or had a mild course of the disease (58.9% vs 24%;p<0.001). In non-pregnant patients, the course of infection was more often moderate (61% vs 14.7%;p<0.001) or severe (10% vs 3.1%;p=0.038). Clinical manifestations of new coronavirus infection (NCV) in pregnant women were dominated by anosmia (87.7% vs 40%;p<0.001), drowsiness (68.7% vs 17%;p<0.001), dyspnea, even with a mild lung lesion (68.1% vs 19%;p<0.001), headache (41.7% vs 24%;p=0.006), arthralgia (29.4% vs 16%;p=0.021), while fever above 38 °C (7.4% vs 28%;p<0.001) and cough (38.7% vs 61%;p<0.001) were much less common. With computed tomography, pneumonia in pregnant women was diagnosed several times less often (21.4% vs 87.4%;p<0.001). In the non-pregnant group, there was one death (1% vs 0%;p=0.201) associated with late hospitalization for severe NCI with grade 4 pulmonary involvement as shown on computed tomography. Conclusion. Confounders of COVID-19 in pregnant women who have no known risk factors in the third trimester of gestation are iron deficiency anemia, vegetovascular dystonia, belonging to the Buryat subpopulation, and smoking. In pregnant women, the main clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the exception of loss of smell, were nonspecific and characteristic of the physiological course of late gestation: drowsiness, dyspnea, joint pain. The predominance of mild or asymptomatic forms of infection, the lower incidence of pneumonia, and the absence of deaths in pregnant women suggests a more favorable course of COVID-19 NCI. © 2021 Consilium Medikum.

NMA falls under the umbrella of Self-Organizing Networks (SON) in which 3GPP has identified some challenges and opportunities in load balancing mechanisms for the Radio Access Networks (RANs). In the context of machine learning and load balancing, several studies have focused on maximizing the overall network throughput or the resource block utilization (RBU). In this paper, we propose a novel Clipped Double Q-Learning (CDQL)-based load balancing approach considering resource block utilization, latency and the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI). We compare our proposal with a traditional handover algorithm and a resource block utilization based handover mechanism. Simulation results reveal that our scheme is able to improve throughput, latency, jitter and packet loss ratio in comparison to the baseline algorithms.","Rivera, Pedro Enrique Iturria; Erol-Kantarci, Melike",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04207v1.pdf,68

Experiments already proved that there was a sigmoid functional relationship between virus infection probability and inoculum dose. By means of mathematical simulation of stochastic process, we theoretically demonstrate that there is a sigmoid function relationship between them. At the same time, our model found three factors that influence the severity of infection symptoms, those are virus toxicity, virus invasion dose and host immunity respectively. Therefore, the mortality rate cannot directly reflect the change of virus toxicity, but is the result of the comprehensive action of these three factors. Protective measures such as masks can effectively reduce the severity of infection while reducing the probability of infection. Based on the sigmoid function relationship between virus infection probability and initial virus invasion dose, we deduce that for highly infectious viruses, such as SARS-COV-2, the evolution of its toxicity is closely related to the host population density, and its toxicity will first increase and then decrease with the increase of host population density. That is to say, on the basis of extremely low host population density, increasing population density is beneficial to the development of virus towards strong toxicity. However, this trend is not sustainable, and there is a turning point of population density. Beyond this turning point, increasing population density will be beneficial to the development of virus towards weak toxicity. This theory can well explain the differences of mortality in Covid-19 in different countries. Countries with high population density and extremely low population density often correspond to lower mortality, while countries with population density in the range of 20-100/km2 often have higher mortality. At the same time, we propose that social distance and masks can effectively accelerate the evolution of virus towards low toxicity, so we should not give up simple and effective protection measures while emphasizing vaccination.","Xu, Z.; Zhang, H.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.21259811v1?rss=1,68

In railway passenger transport, real-name train ticket check can effectively track the propagation path of the pandemic, which is of most significance for spread prevention of COVID-19. In this study, the evaluation index system of real-name check of ticket in trains was first established, in which 22 indexes in 4 levels were included, and their weights were determined by the Method of Kantiray Weighting. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation model of real-name system check was proposed, in which normalized work of different indexes was done, and key factors affecting the evaluation were founded. Finally, typical data of 8 trains check were collected, and from the evaluation analysis, we can find out that most factors affecting results of real-name ticket check are attendant management, train organization level, train service, and real-name ticket check proportion, based on which corresponding countermeasures and suggestions are given oriented to short-, medium-, and long-distance trains, respectively, all of which can reduce the risk of pandemic propagation in railway system.

In particular, we propose the use of electrotactile feedback to render the interpenetration distance between the user's finger and the virtual content is touched. Our approach consists of modulating the perceived intensity (frequency and pulse width modulation) of the electrotactile stimuli according to the registered interpenetration distance. In a user study (N=21), we assessed the performance of four different interpenetration feedback approaches: electrotactile-only, visual-only, electrotactile and visual, and no interpenetration feedback. First, the results showed that contact precision and accuracy were significantly improved when using interpenetration feedback. Second, and more interestingly, there were no significant differences between visual and electrotactile feedback when the calibration was optimized and the user was familiarized with electrotactile feedback. Taken together, these results suggest that electrotactile feedback could be an efficient replacement of visual feedback for enhancing contact information in virtual reality avoiding the need of active visual focus and the rendering of additional visual artefacts.","Vizcay, Sebastian; Kourtesis, Panagiotis; Argelaguet, Ferran; Pacchierotti, Claudio; Marchal, Maud",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00259v2.pdf,68

As of today, more than two million deaths from more than 210 countries have been confirmed. This disease has modeled a great threat to human mental health, physical health, and forcefully stuck the routine life with psychosocial consequences globally. The COVID-19 disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which leads to acute respiratory distress. The pathogenesis of the disease started from virus entry to the host cell where it controlled the cellular system of the patient directly or indirectly. Population having cardiovascular, immunosuppressive, AIDS, and diabetes-like complications are thought to be very risky for mortality caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The correlation to Noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular disorders and diabetes has led our attention towards the management of these diseases in the corona outbreak. Thus, this review aimed to better understand the threats modeled by the disease COVID-19 to the cardiovascular system, and the medical community should share their experiences promptly. It is concluded that both published research and real-time experiences shared on social media by world experts will act as a valuable tool and will help to learn more about this disease. Several preventive and therapeutic measures including drug therapy are suggested to manage the disease in comorbidities conditions.","Ahmad, V.; Akhtar, S.; Pandey, S. K.; Ahmad, A.; Abuzinadah, M.

184389,Strange days.,2007,"Since December 2019 the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has hit the world, causing the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic. With the emergence and spread of the new infection, there has been unprecedented pressure on health care systems around the world. The time constraints associated with receiving routine care also affected the risk group - cancer patients, as some hospitals were quarantined. Violation of the terms of both systemic drug, radiation and surgical treatment of cancer patients could lead to the progression of the tumor process and lead to the death of the patient. In connection with the current situation, doctors had to quickly change the tactics of managing cancer patients, due to the lack of accurate data on the basis of which it is possible to determine the optimal approach to the use of therapy, they had to make decisions in conditions of lack of data. The article shows an example of the treatment of 113 patients being treated in the department of surgical treatment of bone and soft tissue tumors in National Medical Research Radiological Center of the Ministry of Health of Russia during the first wave of the pandemic from March 30 to July 1, 2020. Surgical treatment was performed in 103 patients. During the period of stay in the hospital, 11 patients showed signs of coronavirus infection. Of these, 10 patients were diagnosed with coronavirus infection in the postoperative period. According to the study, the nosocomial incidence of COVID-19 is 10%. With timely diagnosis and specialized treatment, the survival rate was 100% in the given example. Consequently, if epidemiological measures are observed at all stages of hospitalization, it is possible to carry out planned surgical treatment for patients with primary and secondary lesions of bones and soft tissues. However, the decision to carry out a planned operation during a pandemic should be individual for each patient. © 2021 Consilium Medikum. All rights reserved.","Bukharov, A. V.; Derzhavin, V.

As a direct selling channel, live streaming has become immensely popular and demonstrated unprecedented growth worldwide. Farmers were able to increase their income by selling farm products on live streaming sales platforms, especially after the COVID-19 outbreak. With the support of online payment and smartphone technology, promotion methods are constantly innovated, among which random rewards are widely used on live streaming sales platforms. This study aimed to examine if and how random rewards optimise farmer’s income from live streaming sales. We observed that random rewards have a positive effect on optimising farmers’ income from live streaming sales, which was verified by mathematical proof and numerical analysis. The results show that there is a threshold that provides a normative guide to farmers on whether they should sell at a discounted price in live streaming sales with random rewards. More importantly, we found the mechanism of how random rewards maximise farmer’s income from live streaming sales. This study also provides suggestions of concrete actions for farmers and policy makers.","Peng, Liangjun Lu Gang Pang Kai Yao Qi",Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.106403,68

Often broken and volatile, the decision to trust in people, knowledge and information is a tall order during a pandemic. Optimal information security requires sustainable collaborative resource allocation and collective action in order to achieve a common objective that benefits the collective. In this chapter, I explored whether collective action was possible in a world where significant political, social, and economic differences place global families at odds and in conflict with each other. Based on the past fifteen months, it seems the optimal will be elusive for generations to come. For now, we are in survival mode. In times of stress, individual and group assumptions, knowledge, understanding, and values come into focus to help or hinder progress toward the control of our own lives during a pandemic. Using a case study analysis of more than 250 social and cultural communications within and between global families during the COVID-19 crisis;I highlight specific cross border relationships from a human centered and social experience lens.

186005,Biochemical analysis and application of molecular display technology on Candida albicans for diagnosing and preventing candidiasis.,2013,"Previous nucleotide sequence analysis of RNA segment 7 of influenza B virus indicated that, in addition to the reading frame encoding the 248 amino acid M1 protein, there is a second overlapping reading frame (BM2ORF) of 585 nucleotides that has the coding capacity for 195 amino acids. To search for a polypeptide product derived from BM2ORF, a genetically engineered beta-galactosidase-BM2ORF fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and a polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised to the purified fusion protein. This antiserum was used to identify a polypeptide, designated BM2 protein (Mr approximately equal to 12,000), that is synthesized in influenza B virus-infected cells. To understand the mechanism by which the BM2 protein is generated from influenza B virus RNA segment 7, a mutational analysis of the cloned DNA was performed and the altered DNAs were expressed in eukaryotic cells. The expression patterns of the M1 and BM2 proteins from the altered DNAs indicate that the BM2 protein initiation codon overlaps with the termination codon of the M1 protein in an overlapping translational stop-start pentanucleotide, TAATG, and that the expression of the BM2 protein requires 5'-adjacent termination of M1 synthesis. Our data suggest that a termination-reinitiation scheme is used in translation of a bicistronic mRNA derived from influenza B virus RNA segment 7, and this strategy has some analogy to prokaryotic coupled stop-start translation of tandem cistrons.","Horvath, C M; Williams, M A; Lamb, R A",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC552297/,68

To identify the individual and population-level factors driving rabies virus (RV) transmission in vampire bats, we conducted a longitudinal capture-recapture study in 20 vampire bat colonies spanning four regions of Peru. Serology demonstrated the circulation of RV in vampire bats from all regions in all years. Seroprevalence ranged from 3 to 28 per cent and was highest in juvenile and sub-adult bats. RV exposure was independent of bat colony size, consistent with an absence of population density thresholds for viral invasion and extinction. Culling campaigns implemented during our study failed to reduce seroprevalence and were perhaps counterproductive for disease control owing to the targeted removal of adults, but potentially greater importance of juvenile and sub-adult bats for transmission. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of RV maintenance in vampire bats and highlight the need for ecologically informed approaches to rabies prevention in Latin America.","Streicker, Daniel G; Recuenco, Sergio; Valderrama, William; Gomez Benavides, Jorge; Vargas, Ivan; Pacheco, Víctor; Condori Condori, Rene E; Montgomery, Joel; Rupprecht, Charles E; Rohani, Pejman; Altizer, Sonia",Proceedings.

Inoculation into the vitreous chamber produced significant changes. Immunoperoxidase staining of frozen sections with either monoclonal or polyclonal antiserum revealed coronaviral antigens in the iris, ciliary body, and a few ganglion cells on day 1. The retinal pigment epithelial cells began expressing viral antigen on day 2 and large amounts of antigen were present in these cells on day 3. Viral antigens were detected in all layers of the neural retina by day 6 and were absent after day 7. Infectious virus was recovered from retinas harvested at 5 days. The drop in viral antigen expression was correlated with an elevation in virus-specific antibody; the latter began to rise on day 5 and plateaued after day 8. In hematoxylin and eosin- or periodic acid -Schiff-stained sections of virus-inoculated left eyes, but not mock-inoculated right eyes, lesions spanning all layers of the neural retina were detected by day 3. Subsequently abnormalities in retinal pigment epithelial cells appeared, sometimes around the entire circumference of the retina. Significant retinal abnormalities, notably photoreceptor degeneration, persisted through 6 weeks. These results demonstrate that coronaviruses can cause acute infection of the posterior pole of the eye, resulting in only a mild inflammatory response and long-lasting disease.

A decade later, many researchers have answered the call, with several defining studies examining the social and psychological influences on risk communication. This article reviews risk communication research appearing in the published literature since 1996. Among studies, social trust, the social amplification of risk framework, and the affect heuristic figured prominently. Also common were studies examining the influence of risk in the mass media. Among these were content analyses of media coverage of risk, as well as investigations of possible effects resulting from coverage. The use of mental models was a dominant method for developing risk message content. Other studies examined the use of risk comparisons, narratives, and visuals in the production of risk messages. Research also examined how providing information about a risk's severity, social norms, and efficacy influenced communication behaviors and intentions to follow risk reduction measures.

189771,Viruses in water.,1978,"RNA viruses are notorious for their genetic plasticity and propensity to exploit new host-range opportunities, which can lead to the emergence of human disease epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, AIDS, dengue, and influenza. However, the mechanisms of host-range change involved in most of these viral emergences, particularly the genetic mechanisms of adaptation to new hosts, remain poorly understood. We studied the emergence of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an alphavirus pathogen of people and equines that has had severe health and economic effects in the Americas since the early 20th century. Between epidemics, VEE disappears for periods up to decades, and the viral source of outbreaks has remained enigmatic. Combined with phylogenetic analyses to predict mutations associated with a 1992-1993 epidemic, we used reverse genetic studies to identify an envelope glycoprotein gene mutation that mediated emergence. This mutation allowed an enzootic, equine-avirulent VEEV strain, which circulates among rodents in nearby forests to adapt for equine amplification. RNA viruses including alphaviruses exhibit high mutation frequencies. Therefore, ecological and epidemiological factors probably constrain the frequency of VEE epidemics more than the generation, via mutation, of amplification-competent (high equine viremia) virus strains. These results underscore the ability of RNA viruses to alter their host range, virulence, and epidemic potential via minor genetic changes. VEE also demonstrates the unpredictable risks to human health of anthropogenic changes such as the introduction of equines and humans into habitats that harbor zoonotic RNA viruses.","Anishchenko, Michael; Bowen, Richard A; Paessler, Slobodan; Austgen, Laura; Greene, Ivorlyne P; Weaver, Scott C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16549790/,68

It also evaluated efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treatment of patients and risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 in relation to their co morbid status. Materials and methods In an attempt to provide extensive information pertaining to epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, the present study was undertaken on 522 patients. The patients were COVID-19 confirmed positive by genomic analysis through Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at SMS Medical College and Attached Hospitals, Jaipur. The indoor admitted patient's information inclusive of demographic profile (age, sex, nationality, residence), date of confirmation for positive COVID-19 case, travel/ exposure history, date of recovery/ death, clinical features, co morbidities and treatment plan was recorded. A serial follow-up of recovered patients to evaluate infective period of the disease was also part of the study. Results A total of 522 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 test by RT-PCR at SMS Hospitals, Jaipur were assessed. Among the confirmed cases, most of patients were young adult in the age group with mean age of 35.42 years. 22.41% patients were below 20 years of age, majority of patients (58.80%) were in the age range of 21 to 50 years and only 18.79% patient population was in the age range of above 50 years. Females (39.08%) were affected less than males (60.91%) with an average sex ratio of female: male being 0.64. Out of the total analyzed patients, only 24.32% patients were symptomatic, among them fever (55.90%), cough (52.75%), sore throat (49.60%) and shortness of breath (46.45%) were the most common presenting clinical manifestations while a few patients also had symptoms of headache (26.77%), chest pain (6.29%) and other symptoms (7.87%) like pain abdomen, fatigue, joints pain, altered sensorium etc. Most of symptomatic patients belonging to older age group. An average of 40.40% patient population of above 50 years of age, were symptomatic while none of the patients below 10 years of age were symptomatic. 13.98% patients had some or the other underlying co morbid disease. The most prevalent co morbidity was hypertension (42.46%) followed by Diabetes mellitus (39.72%), Old k-chest (20.54%), COPD/ Bronchial Asthma (16.43%), Coronary artery disease (13.69%), Chronic kidney disease (13.69%) and Valvular heart disease (6.84%) distributed in co morbid patients of COVID-19. 60.27% of patient population with underlying co morbid conditions were more prone to develop symptomatology complex as compared to that observed in patients with no co morbidity (18.42%). 116 patients had recovered with effective treatment till the date of data analysis. Time of recovery was counted from the date of positive report to 1st negative report of oropharyngeal sample by RT-PCR for COVID-19 with an average recovery time of 8.15 days. 23.27% patients recovered within 5 days, while 52.58% patients took about 6-10 days, 23.27% patients took 11-15 days and remaining 0.86% took more than 16 days to recover. In the present study 15 patients had died till analysis of data, among the deceased, 73.33% were above 50 year of age with a male preponderance (66.6%). Interestingly, all deceased (100%) had presented with clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and all had underlying multiple co morbid conditions. Majority of patients had early mortality after admission to hospital with two third death account in initial three days. Asymptomatic patients (cases) treated with HCQ recovered early (average recovery time =5.4 days) compared to asymptomatic patients who did not receive any treatment (control group) and had longer recovery time (average recovery time =7.6 days). Conclusion The varied spectra of COVID-19 mostly affects young adult age group (third to fifth decades of life). Interestingly, early age group was also affected in significant proportion when compared with similar data from other countries. It was observed that male population seemed to be was more prone to getting infected. Majority of COVID-19 positive patients (nearly three-fourth) were asymptomatic (mostly in young age range) at the time of diagnosis, which poses a major challenge for health care workers. Fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath were major symptoms that could be detected in such COVID-19 patients. Symptomatic clinical manifestations were more common in old age population. Infectivity was higher in patients that had underlying co morbid disease, especially in patients with multiple co morbid conditions. Symptomatic presentation of COVID-19 was observed to be higher in patients with co morbid disease. Average recovery time from COVID-19 was 8 days with effective treatment. Mortality in COVID-19 was higher in old age population, male gender, symptomatic and co morbid patients as compared to other similarly matched group. Most of mortality was noted within first few days of admission, suggestive of early mortality due to the primary disease process. Treatment with HCQ had early recovery without effectively influencing the overall mortality.","Bhandari, Sudhir; Singh, Ajeet; Sharma, Raman; Rankawat, Govind; Banerjee, S; Gupta, Vishal; Dube, Amitabh; Kakkar, Shivankan; Sharma, Shrikant; Keswani, Prakash; Agrawal, Abhishek; Tak, Amit; Nawal, C L",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32610873/,68

METHODS 124 health care workers with recovered SARS from four hospitals in Guangzhou were examined with MR imaging of the lower extremity including bilateral hips and knees. In 124 health care workers, 38 cases have not treated with steroid, while 86 cases have treated with varied dosage. The imaging protocol was consisted of screening and full examination. Coronal T1-weighted imaging and short tau inversion recovery sequence were defined as the screening examination. The full examination was defined as images from the screening examination plus three additional imaging sequences: transverse and coronal T2-weighted imaging and short tau inversion recovery sequence. RESULTS In 86 health care workers, 5 cases were found positive in the lower extremity. Osteonecrosis was found in 3 cases. One was involved in bilateral femoral head, and another was unilateral femoral head, and the remaining one was bilateral femoral heads and unilateral femoral condyle and tibial condyle. Bilateral femoral and tibial marrow edema were found in one case. Femoral infarction with significant calcification occurred in one health care worker. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the presence of avascular abnormalities was related with maximum daily dosage. CONCLUSION Osteonecrosis definitely exists in the minority of health care workers with recovered SARS in Guangzhou, who had treated with steroid. The maximum daily dosage of steroid may significantly influence on the occurrence of avascular abnormalities.","Shen, Jun; Liang, Bi-ling; Zeng, Qing-si; Chen, Jian-yu; Liu, Qing-yu; Chen, Rong-chang; Zhong, Nan-shan",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15631780/,68

As a result of the fastidious growth requirements of these agents, most of the knowledge concerning the clinical syndromes associated with them has come from chajlenge studies in volunteers and seroepidemiologic investigations. Coronaviruses have been shown to be associated with a substantial number of adult respiratory illnesses especially during certain periods when rhinovirus infections are infrequent. Progress in propagating coronaviruses and in detecting coronavirus infections has been achieved recently: viruses similar to 229E were successfully recovered in human embryonic intestine cell cultures from patients with upper respiratory tract illnesses; 30C strains (B814, LP and EVS) were recovered in L132 cell cultures from infectious nasal washings; OC43(and OC38) viruses which were originally recovered in OC and later adapted to grow in suckling mice were not only shown to directly hemagglutinate various erythrocytes but were also adapted to grow in MK cell cultures; OC43 virus was also found to induce hemadsorption of rat and mouse erythrocytes in certain cell cultures; and a coronavirus strain was detected by immune electron microscopy. Coronaviruses are also associated with certain diseases in animals.","Kapikian, A Z",Developments in biological standardization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1092577/,68
194691,Molecular evolution meets the genomics revolution.,2003,"Pradimicin A (PRM-A), an antifungal nonpeptidic benzonaphtacenequinone antibiotic, is a low-molecular-weight (molecular weight, 838) carbohydrate binding agent (CBA) endowed with a selective inhibitory activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It invariably inhibits representative virus strains of a variety of HIV-1 clades with X4 and R5 tropisms at nontoxic concentrations. Time-of-addition studies revealed that PRM-A acts as a true virus entry inhibitor. PRM-A specifically interacts with HIV-1 gp120 and efficiently prevents virus transmission in cocultures of HUT-78/HIV-1 and Sup T1 cells. Upon prolonged exposure of HIV-1-infected CEM cell cultures, PRM-A drug pressure selects for mutant HIV-1 strains containing N-glycosylation site deletions in gp120 but not gp41. A relatively long exposure time to PRM-A is required before drug-resistant virus strains emerge. PRM-A has a high genetic barrier, since more than five N-glycosylation site deletions in gp120 are required to afford moderate drug resistance. Such mutated virus strains keep full sensitivity to the other known clinically used anti-HIV drugs. PRM-A represents the first prototype compound of a nonpeptidic CBA lead and, together with peptide-based lectins, belongs to a conceptually novel type of potential therapeutics for which drug pressure results in the selection of glycan deletions in the HIV gp120 envelope.","Balzarini, Jan; Van Laethem, Kristel; Daelemans, Dirk; Hatse, Sigrid; Bugatti, Antonella; Rusnati, Marco; Igarashi, Yasuhiro; Oki, Toshikazu; Schols, Dominique",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17050611/,68

It was shown to contain eight polypeptides, seven of which were glycosylated. They had apparent mol. wt. of 180,000 (GP 180), 130,0000 (GP 130), 120,000 (GP 120) 76,000 (GP 76), 64,000 (VP 64), 54,000 (GP 54), 32,000 (GP 32) and 31,000 (GP 31). Electrophoresis of virus samples dissociated under varying conditions showed that GP 54 and GP 120 could be interpreted as larger products of GP 31 and GP 32 and of GP 76, respectively. GP 76 also appeared as a dimer with a mol. wt. of 140,000 (GP 140) in the absence of beta-mercaptoethanol. Subviral particles, obtained by treatment with bromelain, banded at a slightly lower density than the intact virus and lacked surface projections. Analysis of these particles indicated that GP 180, GP 130 and GP 76 are associated with the virus projections. A small part of GP 31 and GP 32 also appeared to protrude from the lipid envelope since 20% of each molecule was sensitive to digestion. Two glycoproteins, GP 130 and GP 76, were solubilized with the detergent Triton X-100 and separated by rate zonal centrifugation. According to its activity-in indirect haemagglutination tests, GP 76 was considered to be a monovalent haemagglutinin subunit.","Callebaut, P E; Pensaert, M B",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7381432/,68

We aimed to survey genetic counselor members of the Wisconsin Genetic Counselors Association (WIGCA) to determine if the supply and demand was met within the state and where access to services can improve. METHODS An email invitation was sent to all genetic counselor members of the WIGCA with a link to a confidential online survey. Survey questions addressed the workforce composition, elements that impact services, and professional satisfaction of practicing genetic counselors. RESULTS The Wisconsin workforce currently has half of the projected need for full-time DPC genetic counselors. One-third of genetic counselors reported changing from direct to non-direct patient care positions. In-person services are concentrated within Milwaukee and Madison. Appointment wait times are decreased when patients meet with a genetic counselor only, and half of the genetic counselors reported moderate to high stress levels. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION A shortage of DPC genetic counselors in Wisconsin is confirmed due to the total full-time effort in direct patient care. Data provided here can be used to identify targets for increasing the number of DPC genetic counselors, maximizing time spent on patient care, and improving access.","Dawson, Carlee; Syverson, Erin; Chelius, Thomas H; Linn, Sarah; Reiser, Catherine; Stuewe, Kate; Zoran, Sara; Geurts, Jennifer L",WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33091282/,68

The objective of the study was to investigate how surgical wards in Poland are managing during rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic. M e t h o d s: An anonymous, online survey was designed and distributed to surgeons and surgery residents working in surgical departments during pandemic. Responders were divided into two groups: Group 1 (responders working in a ""COVID-19-dedicated"" hospital) and Group 2 (responders working in other hospitals). Results: Overall, 323 responders were included in the study group, 30.03% of which were female. Medical staff deficits were reported by 21.15% responders from Group 1 and 29.52% responders from Group 2 (p = 0.003). The mean number of elective surgeries performed weekly prior to the pandemic in Group 1 was 40.37 ± 46.31 and during the pandemic was 13.98 ± 37.49 (p < 0.001). In Group 2, the mean number of elective surgeries performed weekly before the start of the pandemic was 26.85 ± 23.52 and after the start of the pandemic, it was 7.65 ± 13.49 (p <0.001). There were significantly higher reported levels of preparedness in Group 1 in terms of: theoretical training of the staff, equipping the staff and adapting the operating theater to safely perform procedures on patients with COVID-19. Overall, 62.23% of responders presume being infected with SARS-CoV-2. C o n c l u s i o n s: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had a significantly negative impact on surgical wards. Despite the preparations, the number of responders who presume being infected with SARS-CoV-2 during present crisis is high.","Stefura, Tomasz; Rymarowicz, Justyna; Wysocki, Michał; Szeliga, Jacek; Wallner, Grzegorz; Pędziwiatr, Michał; Nowakowski, Michał; Major, Piotr",Folia medica Cracoviensia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33582744/,68
196769,Effect of vaccinations with recombinant fusion proteins on Ancylostoma caninum habitat selection in the canine intestine.,2002,"This study highlighted the effect of Carbendazim on the testicular micro and intermediate filaments adult male African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). Previous studies related to carbendazim toxicity in fish have been limited to mortality patterns and degree of sensitivity across species. Literature on actual pathology in fish is scanty. The fish were exposed to a pre-determined sub-lethal concentration (1.4 mg/L) of Carbendazim for seven and fourteen days, 10 fish were sedated by cold shock, and sacrificed on days seven and 14. Another untreated group (control) were sacrificed at the same periods. The testes were harvested and weighed. Testicular actin microfilament, cytokeratin, desmin and vimentin intermediate filaments were determined using standard immunohistochemistry protocols. Variations in the intensity and pattern of immuno-expression of the testicular actin, cytokeratin, desmin and vimentin were significant in a phase dependent manner with day 14 being more pronounced. Immunohistochemical features of degenerated and necrotic germinal and Sertoli cells in the treated group, with loss of wire-mesh network which supported the mature germinal cells in the testicular lumen were also observed. A sub-lethal dose of carbendazim exposure for either seven or 14 days, induced deliterous changes in the testicular micro- and intermediate filaments, of the African catfish. This portends a reduction in the male reproductive potentials of the exposed species and resultant negative impact on production.","Aina, Oluwasanmi Olayinka; Ozegbe, Peter Chuka; Adeyemo, Olanike Kudirat",Nigerian journal of physiological sciences : official publication of the Physiological Society of Nigeria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084614/,68

PARTICIPANTS 1397 Hong Kong residents between 18 and 60 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Perceptions and behaviours to SARS and its prevention. RESULTS Most of the respondents believed that SARS could be transmitted via direct body contact and droplets. About half of respondents believed that SARS was curable, which increased in the initial phase and decreased in the second phase. Perceived chance of infection was low (9%) but fear of infection in public places was high (48%). Perceived efficacy of hygiene measures (wearing a mask: 82%, hand washing: 93%, and home disinfection: 75%) remained high in both phases and the perceived efficacy of avoiding crowded place, and using public transportation, etc, increased initially and decreased in the second phase. In parallel, use of the three hygiene measures increased significantly in the first phase and remained high for wearing a mask and washing hands in the second phase. Percentages of people avoiding crowded place and public transportation significantly increased initially and decreased in the second phase. CONCLUSION SARS related perceptions and behaviours evolved rapidly during the epidemic and Hong Kong residents quickly adopted appropriate SARS prevention measures.

The results showed that: all of the serum were SARS-IgG antibody-positive the first year after recovery, the titer of most serum remained at high levels at the 2ed and 3rd year post infection. The Ab titers significantly declined at 4th year post infection. The IgG Ab was almost undetectable after 5 years post infection. In conclusion, SARS-CoV IgG Ab can be maintained for more than 3 years post infection, however, the titer of IgG Ab has declined markedly 4 years later. These data provide a useful reference for diagnosis and control of SARS infection, the evaluation of immune response and vaccine efficacy.","Wang, Hui-Juan; Zhang, Ling-Lin; Tan, Wen-Jie; Zhou, Wei-Min; Yan, Wei-Zheng; Peng, Kun; Ruan, Li",Bing du xue bao = Chinese journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20836383/,68

The 3 viruses (PEDV, TGEV, and porcine GAR) are major agents in viral enteric diseases of piglets. As the clinical signs of these diseases are similar, including watery diarrhea, differential detection is required for etiologic diagnosis. A mixture of 3 pairs of published primers was used for amplification of viral nucleic acids, yielding 3 different amplicons with sizes of 859 bp, 651 bp, and 309 bp for TGEV, PEDV, and porcine GAR, respectively. A total of 157 specimens (78 fecal and 79 intestinal samples) from piglets with acute gastroenteritis were collected in Korea between January 2004 and May 2005. They were tested for the presence of 3 viruses by multiplex RT-PCR. Coinfections with PEDV and porcine GAR were identified in 16 farms (43.2%). PEDV, porcine GAR, and TGEV infection were 26.3%, 13.2%, and 2.7% respectively. The relative sensitivity and specificity of multiplex RT-PCR were evaluated, with results suggesting that this assay is equal in quality to conventional single-agent RT-PCR assays (sensitivity:100%, 92.9%, 100% for TGEV, PEDV, GARs; specificity: 100% for all 3 viruses). This multiplex RT-PCR is a simple assay and may be a potentially useful for rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective etiological diagnostic tool for acute viral gastroenteritis in piglets.","Song, Dae S; Kang, Bo K; Oh, Jin S; Ha, Gun W; Yang, Jeong S; Moon, Hyoung J; Jang, Yong-Suk; Park, Bong K","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16789718/,68

We aimed to analyse the course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases living in a district of Lombardy with a high prevalence of COVID-19. Methods: We did a single-centre observational study at the Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST) Spedali Civili of Brescia, Italy. We collected data from patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases enrolled in our outpatient clinic to identify confirmed or possible cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were collected through a survey that was administered via telephone or in the outpatient clinic by rheumatologists. We also did a case-control study of all patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were admitted to the ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia during the study period. Cases were matched by age, sex, and month of hospital admission to at least two controls admitted to the same hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia during the study period. Findings: Between Feb 24 and May 1, 2020, we collected data from 1525 patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases: 117 (8%) presented with symptoms that were compatible with COVID-19. 65 patients had a swab confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas 52 presented with a spectrum of symptoms indicative of COVID-19 but were not swab tested. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were older than those with suspected COVID-19 (median age 68 [IQR 55-76] years vs 57 [49-67] years; p=0·0010) and more likely to have arterial hypertension (33 [51%] vs 14 [27%] patients; odds ratio [OR] 2·8 [95% CI 1·3-6·1]; p=0·031) and obesity (11 [17%] vs 1 [2%]; OR 11·0 [1·3-83·4]; p=0·0059). We found no differences in rheumatological disease or background therapy between confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. 47 (72%) of the 65 patients with confirmed COVID-19 developed pneumonia that required admission to hospital. 12 (10%) deaths occurred among the 117 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (ten in those with confirmed COVID-19 and two in those with suspected COVID-19). Deceased patients with confirmed COVID-19 were older than survivors (median age 78·8 years [IQR 75·3-81·3] vs 65·5 years [53·3-74·0]; p=0·0002). We observed no differences in sex, comorbidities, or therapies between the deceased patients and survivors. The case-control study comprised 26 patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases and COVID-19 pneumonia and 62 matched controls. We found no significant differences between cases and controls in duration of COVID-19 symptoms before admission, duration of stay in hospital, or the local chest X-ray scoring system. Glucocorticoids were used for severe respiratory manifestations related to lung involvement in 17 (65%) of 26 cases and tocilizumab in six (23%) of 26; thrombotic events occurred in four (15%) of 26 cases. Four (15%) of 26 cases and six (10%) of 62 controls died during the study period. Interpretation: In this cohort of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in a geographical region with a high prevalence of COVID-19, a poor outcome from COVID-19 seems to be associated with older age and the presence of comorbidities rather than the type of rheumatic disease or the degree of pharmacological immunosuppression.

208459,Ethics and execution of developing a 2nd wave COVID vaccine - Our interim phase I/II VSV-SARS-CoV2 vaccine experience,2021,"BACKGROUND: Nutritional derangements are common hallmarks of pancreatic cancer (PC). Their early detection and management are usually overlooked in routine practice. This study aimed to explore preoperative nutritional status and its prognostic value in patients undergoing surgery for PC. METHODS: Data from 73 patients who underwent surgery for PC from November 2015 to January 2018 at the General and Pancreatic Surgery Unit, The Pancreas Institute, University Hospital of Verona Hospital, Verona, Italy, were retrospectively evaluated. The Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS)-2002 was used to evaluate the preoperative nutritional risk. Body composition was assessed using bioimpedance vectorial analysis (BIVA) on the day prior to surgery. The effect of clinical, pathological, and nutritional characteristics on overall survival (OS) was investigated using a Cox and logistic regression model. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Most patients (80.8%) were at preoperative risk of malnutrition (NRS-2002 &#8805; 3) despite a mean BMI of 24.1 kg/m2(± 4.3). Twenty-four patients (32.9%) received neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery. Preoperative NRS-2002 was significantly higher in this subset of patients (p = 0.026), with a significant difference by chemotherapy regimens (in favor of FOLFIRINOX, p = 0.035). In a multivariate analysis, the only independent prognostic factor for OS was the NRS-2002 score (HR 5.24, p = 0.013). Particularly, the likelihood of 2-year survival was higher in NRS < 3 (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis confirms that preoperative malnutrition has a detrimental impact on OS in PC patients undergoing radical surgery for PC. Careful preoperative nutritional evaluation of PC patients should be mandatory, especially in those who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy.","Trestini, Ilaria; Paiella, Salvatore; Sandini, Marta; Sperduti, Isabella; Elio, Giovanni; Pollini, Tommaso; Melisi, Davide; Auriemma, Alessandra; Soldà, Caterina; Bonaiuto, Clelia; Tregnago, Daniela; Avancini, Alice; Secchettin, Erica; Bonamini, Deborah; Lanza, Massimo; Pilotto, Sara; Malleo, Giuseppe; Salvia, Roberto; Bovo, Chiara; Gianotti, Luca; Bassi, Claudio; Milella, Michele",Ann. surg. oncol,,68

210027,Ordering of adsorbed rigid rods mediated by the Boussinesq interaction on a soft substrate,2020-07-19,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A growing body of evidence suggests that obesity and increased visceral adiposity are strongly and independently linked to adverse outcomes and death due to COVID-19. This review summarizes current epidemiologic data, highlights pathogenetic mechanisms on the association between excess body weight and COVID-19, compares data from previous pandemics, discusses why COVID-19 challenges the ""obesity paradox,"" and presents implications in prevention and treatment as well as future perspectives. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from meta-analyses based on recent observational studies have indicated that obesity increases the risks of infection from SARS-CoV-2, severe infection and hospitalization, admission to the ICU and need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and the risk of mortality, particularly in severe obesity. The risks of IMV and mortality associated with obesity are accentuated in younger individuals (age &#8804; 50 years old). The meta-inflammation in obesity intersects with and exacerbates underlying pathogenetic mechanisms in COVID-19 through the following mechanisms and factors: (i) impaired innate and adaptive immune responses; (ii) chronic inflammation and oxidative stress; (iii) endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and aberrant activation of the complement; (iv) overactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; (v) overexpression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in the adipose tissue; (vi) associated cardiometabolic comorbidities; (vii) vitamin D deficiency; (viii) gut dysbiosis; and (ix) mechanical and psychological issues. Mechanistic and large epidemiologic studies using big data sources with omics data exploring genetic determinants of risk and disease severity as well as large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to shed light on the pathways connecting chronic subclinical inflammation/meta-inflammation with adverse COVID-19 outcomes and establish the ideal preventive and therapeutic approaches for patients with obesity.","Dalamaga, Maria; Christodoulatos, Gerasimos Socrates; Karampela, Irene; Vallianou, Natalia; Apovian, Caroline M",Curr. obes. rep,,68

Because the epidemic started later in Turkey than other European countries, it has the least number of deaths according to the current data. Outbreak management in COVID-19 is of great importance for public safety and public health. For this reason, prediction models can decide the precautionary warning to control the spread of the disease. Therefore, this study aims to develop a forecasting model, considering statistical data for Turkey. Box-Jenkins Methods (ARIMA), Brown's Exponential Smoothing model and RNN-LSTM are employed. ARIMA was selected with the lowest AIC values (12.0342, -2.51411, 12.0253, 3.67729, -4.24405, and 3.66077) as the best fit for the number of total case, the growth rate of total cases, the number of new cases, the number of total death, the growth rate of total deaths and the number of new deaths, respectively. The forecast values of the number of each indicator are stable over time. In the near future, it will not show an increasing trend in the number of cases for Turkey. In addition, the pandemic will become a steady state and an increase in mortality rates will not be expected between 17-31 May. ARIMA models can be used in fresh outbreak situations to ensure health and safety. It is vital to make quick and accurate decisions on the precautions for epidemic preparedness and management, so corrective and preventive actions can be updated considering obtained values.","Guleryuz, Didem",,,68

This paper briefly outlines why and how pandemics may expose uneven socio-economic geographies of vulnerability and risk, and also be thought of in relation to environmental and non-human challenges to our geopolitical map of territorial nation-states and sovereignties. In relation to Southeast Asia we argue that preexisting and ongoing political-economy linkages are shaping key responses to COVID-19. In particular, we consider the geopolitical and geoeconomic reasoning of Cambodia and Myanmar, and their relations with China.

Vitamin C (Vit C), Vitamin E (Vit E), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Melatonin (MT) increase the intracellular content of GSH, kidnap free radicals and protect DNA, proteins in the cytosol and lipids in cell membranes. Pentoxifylline (Px) has anti-inflammatory activities. Here we evaluate the effect of Vit C, Vit E, NAC, and MT plus Px in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe pneumonia. 110 patients of either sex were included. They were divided into five groups with 22 patients each. Group 1 received Vit C+Px, group 2 Vit E+Px, group 3 NAC+Px, group 4 MT+Px, and group 5 only Px. Oxidative stress (OS) markers such as lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and nitrites (NO2 -) were evaluated in plasma. The antioxidant therapy improved the survival scores including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), the Acute Physiology and chronic Health Evaluation II (Apache II), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), the Critical Illness Risk Score, Launched during COVID-19 crisis (COVIDGRAM) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). We found that LPO was elevated (p&#8804;0.04) and TAC (p&#8804;0.03), NO2 - (p&#8804;0.04) and inflammation markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6, p&#8804;0.01) C reactive protein (CRP, p&#8804;0.01) and procalcitonin (PCT, p&#8804;0.05) were diminished in COVID-19 patients upon admission to the hospital. The different antioxidants reversed this alteration at the end of the treatment. The treatment with antioxidant supplements such as Vit C, E, NAC, and MT plus Px could decelerate the aggressive and lethal development of COVID-19. Antioxidant therapy can be effective in this pandemia since it improves the survival scores including SOFA, Apache II, SAPS II, COVIDGRAM, GCS by lowering the LPO, IL-6, CRP, PCT and increasing systemic TAC and NO2 -.","Chavarria, Adrián Palacios; Vázquez, Rafael Ricardo Valdez; Cherit, José Guillermo Domínguez; Bello, Héctor Herrera; Suastegui, Humberto Castillejos; Moreno-Castañeda, Lidia; Alanís Estrada, Gabriela; Hernández, Fabián; González-Marcos, Omar; Saucedo-Orozco, Huitzilihuitl; Pech, Linaloe Manzano; Márquez, Ricardo; Guarner-Lans, Verónica; Torres, Israel Pérez; Soto, Maria Elena",,,68

A few also added new shared streets for citizens to recreate. This large and unprecedented change in the ability of residents to use green space provides an important case for assessing how emergency planning processes might differentially impact minority groups. Methods Using the case of park closures and shared streets expansion in Denver, Colorado in March and April of 2020, this analysis evaluates how walking time and density of use at parks changed for different minority and income groups based on estimating park visits for residential blocks. Results The analysis demonstrates that minority and low income groups were not disproportionately impacted by initial closures. Shared streets provide net decreases across the city in terms of travel time and density for recreational space usage, though there is some indication benefits were not equally distributed. Conclusion The result emphasizes the importance of modern planning efforts and community engagement in ensuring equitable urban resilience while highlighting the potential for shared streets to provide more recreational accessibility if they can be equitably located.","Scott, Ryan P.",Journal of Transport &amp; Health,,68

Unfortunately, studies have shown that the most common postoperative complication is surgical wound infection (SWI). We investigated the prevalence of SWI in breast cancer patients and identified the factors predictive of its development. The study was conducted at the breast cancer centre in Singapore. A retrospective case-control review of medical records was used. During the 2013 to 2016 study period, there were 657 postsurgical breast cancer patients with only 105 records eligible for the study. The sample consisted of one to four case:control (21:84), matched according to their age at the time of their surgery. Patients presenting with SWI were grouped into cases, while those without SWI were grouped into the controls. Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to identify risk factors associated with SWI. Regression analysis of predictive variables from the univariate analyses was included. These variables were type of breast surgery, implants, comorbidities, previous surgery, previous chemotherapy, surgical drains, seroma, blood transfusion, surgeon department, and length of stay. The prevalence of SWI was 9%. Demographic, clinical, and comorbidities were not associated with SWI. However, multivariate analysis found that ""surgeon department,"" ""discharged with surgical drains,"" and ""postoperative seroma"" were predictive of SWI. Monitoring SWI is indispensable to minimise burdens on individuals and institutions. Health care professionals should identify high-risk patients based on the identified predictive variables.

Many newly reported cases of COVID-19 during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose different risks to community spread. We have developed an ""easy-to-use"" mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the cumulative number of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproduction number R0 = 2.92 and incubation period &#964; = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through an intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and global spread of COVID-19 in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.","Hossain, M Pear; Junus, Alvin; Zhu, Xiaolin; Jia, Pengfei; Wen, Tzai-Hung; Pfeiffer, Dirk; Yuan, Hsiang-Yu",Epidemics,,68

239309,Reengineering biocatalysts: Computational redesign of chondroitinase ABC improves efficacy and stability,2020,"On 21 February 2020, a violent COVID-19 outbreak, which was initially concentrated in Lombardy before infecting some surrounding regions exploded in Italy. Shortly after, on 9 March, the Italian Government imposed severe restrictions on its citizens, including a ban on traveling to other parts of the country. No travel, no virus spread. Many regions, such as those in southern Italy, were spared. Then, in June 2020, under pressure for the economy to reopen, many lockdown measures were relaxed, including the ban on interregional travel. As a result, the virus traveled for hundreds of kilometers, from north to south, with the effect that areas without infections, receiving visitors from infected areas, became infected. This resulted in a sharp increase in the number of infected people; i.e., the daily count of new positive cases, when comparing measurements from the beginning of July to those from at the middle of September, rose significantly in almost all the Italian regions. Upon confirmation of the effect of Italian domestic tourism on the virus spread, three computational models of increasing complexity (linear, negative binomial regression, and cognitive) have been compared in this study, with the aim of identifying the one that better correlates the relationship between Italian tourist flows during the summer of 2020 and the resurgence of COVID-19 cases across the country. Results show that the cognitive model has more potential than the others, yet has relevant limitations. The models should be considered as a relevant starting point for the study of this phenomenon, even if there is still room to further develop them up to a point where they become able to capture all the various and complex spread patterns of this disease.","Casini, Luca; Roccetti, Marco",Sensors (Basel),,68

METHODS: The internal and external attributes affecting the vaccination rollout identifed by reviewing the scientific literature, government guidelines, and press statements, along with media reports, were categorized into the SWOT matrix. RESULTS: The existing immunization program, indigenous vaccine production, setting up of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19, updated guidelines, and training followed by dry runs were identified as strengths. The weaknesses identified in the program were knowledge gap about vaccines, apprehensions, lack of temperature loggers and vaccine vial monitors, space contraints in health care set up, demand supply gap, and digital divide. The experience of conducting the general elections, intersectoral coordination forged during the pandemic response, Information Technology platform, and vaccine eagerness present opportunities to strengthen the program. The emergence of virus variants, commercial interests, laxity in COVID-19 appropriate behavior, and receding wave of the pandemic can pose significant threats to the implementation of the vaccination campaign. CONCLUSION: The study identified factors that can aid designing effective measures and countermeasures for the COVID-19 vaccination rollout. This SWOT analysis is relevant to low- and middle-income countries planning to implement the COVID-19 vaccination in the near future.","Sharma, Priyanka; Pardeshi, Geeta",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,68

243302,Phonon softening and higher-order anharmonic effect in the superconducting topological insulator SrxBi2Se3,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the largest public health emergency in recent times. A significant number of patients develop a severe form of COVID-19 characterized by coagulopathy, organ failure, and elevated mortality. In addition, an unusually high frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) has been found in patients with COVID-19. These clinical and serological manifestations closely resemble those seen in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), especially in its catastrophic form, suggesting a role of aPLs in immune-associated coagulopathy. However, government bodies such as the American Society of Hematology have spoken out against the systematic search for aPLs in patients with COVID-19. In an attempt to bridge the gap on this hot topic, we conducted a comprehensive review of currently available cohort studies and case series systematically evaluating aPLs in COVID-19 patients. In this Perspective, we seek to identify both the frequency and the type of aPLs found in patients with COVID-19, as well as the potential association of these aPLs with vascular thrombosis and other distinctive characteristics of COVID-19. Furthermore, we investigated whether there is evidence that allows us to define the occurrence of aPLs in COVID-19 as an epiphenomenon, as has been observed in other systemic viral infections, or as antibodies against self-antigens bearing hallmarks that suggest a pathogenic role in immune-mediated thrombosis. Defining whether aPLs represent an epiphenomenon or they are actually involved in hemostatic abnormalities of COVID-19 is crucial both for uncovering novel mechanisms of immune-mediated thrombosis and for identifying potential prognostic biomarkers in this devastating disease.","Castillo-Martínez, Diana; Torres, Zaira; Amezcua-Guerra, Luis M; Pineda, Carlos",Clin. rheumatol,,68
245707,A Simple Model Setup Using Spray‐Drying Principles and Fluorescent Silica Nanoparticles to Evaluate the Efficiency of Facemask Materials in Terms of Virus Particle Retention,2021,"We present a circularity transition index based on open data principles and circularity of energy, material, and information. The aim of the Circular City Index is to provide data and a succinct measurement of the attributes related to municipalities performances that can support the definition of green policies at national and local level. We have identified a set of key performance indicators, defined at municipality level, measuring factors that, directly and indirectly, could influence circularity and green transition, with a focus on the green new deal vision embraced by the European Union. The CCI is tested on a open dataset that collects data covering 100% of the Italian municipalities (7,904). Our results show that the computation of the CCI on a large sample leads to a normal distribution of the index, suggesting disparities both under the territorial point of view and under the point of view of city size. Results provide useful information to practitioner, policy maker and experts from academia alike, to define effective tools able to underpin a careful planning of investments supported by the national recovery and resilience plan recently issued by the Italian government. This may be particularly useful to enhance enabling factors of the green transition that may differ across territories, helping policymakers to promote a smooth and fair transition by fostering the preparedness of municipalities in addressing the challenge.","Muscillo, Alessio; Re, Simona; Gambacorta, Sergio; Ferrara, Giuseppe; Tagliafierro, Nicola; Borello, Emiliano; Rubino, Alessandro; Facchini, Angelo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10832v1.pdf,68

On 14 March 2020, a state of emergency was declared in Spain in a bid to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The aim of our study is to analyse the impact on emergency medicine attendance after the national lockdown, as well as the clinical presentation and the management of patients with suspected COVID-19 in the Paediatric Emergency Department. Patients and methods: This retrospective observational study included children and adolescents under the age of 18, attended in our Paediatric Emergency Department during the period March 14 to April 17, 2020. Results: A total of 1,666 patients were attended during the study period, 65.4% less than in the same period of 2019. Just over half (51.2%) were males, and mean age was 5.4 years. In triage, 39.9% were high priority levels, 6.5% more than 2019. Most frequent reasons for consultation at the Paediatric Emergency Department were fever (26.5%), respiratory symptoms (16.1%), and trauma (15.2%). A total of 218 patients (13%) received a diagnosis of possible COVID-19, with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in 18.4%, and 23.8% (52/218) were hospitalised. At discharge, 44% (96/218) were diagnosed with lower, and 33.9% (74/218) with upper respiratory infection. Conclusions: During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the demand for urgent paediatric care decreased, with the proportion of cases with high priority triage levels increasing. Most of the patients with suspected or microbiological confirmation of COVID-19 had mild respiratory symptoms.","Molina Gutiérrez, Miguel Ángel; Ruiz Domínguez, José Antonio; Bueno Barriocanal, Marta; de Miguel Lavisier, Begoña; López López, Rosario; Martín Sánchez, Julia; de Ceano-Vivas la Calle, María",,,68

Articles were obtained through PubMed searches in each cancer subtype using the following terms: delay to surgery, time to surgery, outcomes, and survival. Results: Delays in surgery &gt; 4 weeks in breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, T1 pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and pediatric osteosarcoma, negatively impacted survival. Studies on hepatocellular cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma (Stage I) demonstrated reduced survival with delays &gt; 3 months.

It is unknown whether the coincidence of DKA noted in adult patients with type 2 diabetes is an issue for youth during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective single-center medical record review was conducted in a large, urban children's hospital of pediatric subjects presenting with new-onset type 2 diabetes between March and August of 2018 to 2020. RESULTS: The proportion of subjects presenting with new-onset type 2 diabetes in DKA dramatically increased in 2020 (9% in 2018, 3% in 2019, and 20% in 2020, P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: In 2020, youth with new-onset type 2 diabetes had a greater incidence of DKA at presentation than previously observed.

SARS-CoV-2 is known to use its spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface as a first step in the infection process. As for other coronaviruses, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 next undergoes endocytosis, but whether or not this is required for infectivity, and the precise endocytic mechanism used are unknown. Using purified spike glycoprotein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein, a common model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, we now demonstrate that following engagement with the plasma membrane, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid, clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This suggests that transfer of viral RNA to the cell cytosol occurs from the lumen of the endosomal system. Importantly, we further demonstrate that knockdown of clathrin-heavy chain, which blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis, reduces viral infectivity. These discoveries reveal that SARS-CoV-2 uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis to gain access into cells and suggests that this process is a key aspect of virus infectivity.","Bayati, Armin; Kumar, Rahul; Francis, Vincent; McPherson, Peter S",J Biol Chem,,68

Evidence suggests that ILA may precede the development of interstitial lung diseases and may evolve to progressive fibrosis. Identifying biomarkers of this subclinical status is relevant for early diagnosis and to predict outcome. We aimed to identify circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) associated to ILA in a cohort of respiratory asymptomatic subjects older than 60 years. We identified 81 subjects with ILA from our Lung-Aging Program in Mexico City (n = 826). We randomly selected 112 subjects without ILA (Ctrl) from the same cohort. Using polymerase chain reaction PCR-Array technology (24 ILA and 24 Ctrl, screening cohort) and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (57 ILA and 88 Ctr, independent validation cohort) we identified seven up-regulated miRNAs in serum of ILA compared to Ctrl (miR-193a-5p, p < 0.0001; miR-502-3p, p < 0.0001; miR-200c-3p, p = 0.003; miR-16-5p, p = 0.003; miR-21-5p, p = 0.002; miR-126-3p, p = 0.004 and miR-34a-5p, p < 0.005).

266281,Viral misdirection,2020,"The optimal allocation of vaccines to population subgroups over time is a challenging health care management problem. In the context of a pandemic, the interaction between vaccination policies adopted by multiple agents and the cooperation (or lack thereof) creates a complex environment that affects the global transmission dynamics of the disease. In this study, we take the perspective of decision-making agents that aim to minimize the size of their susceptible populations and must allocate vaccine under limited supply. We assume that vaccine efficiency rates are unknown to agents and we propose an optimization policy based on Thompson sampling to learn mean vaccine efficiency rates over time. Furthermore, we develop a budget-balanced resource sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among agents. We apply the proposed framework to the COVID-19 pandemic. We use a raster model of the world where agents represent the main countries worldwide and interact in a global mobility network to generate multiple problem instances. Our numerical results show that the proposed vaccine allocation policy achieves a larger reduction in the number of susceptible individuals, infections and deaths globally compared to a population-based policy. In addition, we show that, under a fixed global vaccine allocation budget, most countries can reduce their national number of infections and deaths by sharing their budget with countries with which they have a relatively high mobility exchange. The proposed framework can be used to improve policy-making in health care management by national and global health authorities.","Rey, David; Hammad, Ahmed W; Saberi, Meead",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10004v1.pdf,68

However, the use of PPE has not been universal mainly due to the perception of discomfort and associated stress and fatigue. This study was done to understand the pattern of PPE use by cancer surgeons during the pandemic and the associated discomfort, stress, and fatigue with its use. The survey, consisting of 29 questions, was circulated widely across the country by email and chat groups among cancer surgeons. The study was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2020/08/027050). We received a total of 342 evaluable responses that could be included for analysis. All the respondents used appropriate PPE in different combinations. N-95 mask and the face shield were the two components of the PPE that gave rise to a lot of discomforts. Fogging (of face shields) (p < 0.001,OR 3.61), dryness of mouth (p < 0.001,OR 3.35), and breathing difficulty/feeling of suffocation (p = 0.034,OR 1.68) contributed to the stress, whereas headache (p < 0.001,OR 11.34) and breathing difficulty/feeling of suffocation (p < 0.001,OR 4.24) contributed to the fatigue associated with PPE use the most.

268892,A General Multipatch Model of Ebola Dynamics,2021,"BACKGROUND: To combat social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions due to COVID-19, Canadian communities began a Facebook social media movement, #Caremongering, to support vulnerable individuals in their communities. Little research has examined the spread and use of #Caremongering to address community health and social needs. OBJECTIVES: We examined the rate at which #Caremongering grew across Canada, the main ways the groups were used, and differences in use by membership size and activity. METHODS: We searched Facebook Groups using the term ""Caremongering"" combined with the names of the largest population centres in every province and territory in Canada. We extracted available Facebook analytics on all the groups found, restricted to public groups that operated in English. We further conducted a content analysis of themes from postings in 30 groups using purposive sampling. Posted content was qualitatively analyzed to determine consistent themes across the groups and between those with smaller and larger member numbers. RESULTS: The search of Facebook groups across 185 cities yielded 130 unique groups, including groups from all 13 provinces and territories in Canada. Total membership across all groups as of May 4, 2020 was 194,879. The vast majority were formed within days of the global pandemic announcement, two months prior. There were four major themes identified: personal protective equipment, offer, need, and information. Few differences were found between how large and small groups were being used. CONCLUSIONS: The #Caremongering Facebook groups spread across the entire nation in a matter of days, engaging hundreds of thousands of Canadians. Social media appears to be a useful tool for spreading community-led solutions to address health and social needs.","Seow, Hsien; McMillan, Kayla; Civak, Margaret; Bainbridge, Daryl; van der Wal, Alison; Haanstra, Christa; Goldhar, Jodeme; Winemaker, Samantha",PLoS One,,68

A number of patients with COVID-19 develop neurological manifestations, such as stroke, encephalopathy and seizures. In order to determine the relationship between COVID-19 and seizure disorders, a review of case series from 1 December 2019 to 7 July 2020 from seven hospitals in Thailand, which adequately detailed seizure occurrence or neurological manifestations, was carried out. Focus was placed on relationship of seizure/epilepsy and risk of COVID-19 infection, possible epileptogenic effects of the viral infection and management plans for control of seizures. Prevalence of acute symptomatic seizures among COVID-19 patients was 0.57%, indicating epilepsy patients in general were not more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Issues on adverse interactions between antiepileptic drugs and antivirals, limited access to investigative diagnostic procedures, eg electroencephalography, CSF fluid and neuroimaging were of concern. In conclusion, prevalence of seizure in individuals with COVID-19 is low, but suitable plans for seizure management, antiepileptic medication-withdrawal seizures in patients with epilepsy during COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of appropriate telemedicine systems should be addressed.","Sithinamsuwan, P.; Apiwattanakul, M.; Wongsinin, T.; Sukajintanakarn, D.; Luangdilok, P.; Suttha, P.; Treepong, C.; Suwanrit, S.; Udommongkol, C.; Kirdlarp, S.; Poonphol, S.; Tunlayadechanont, S.; Boonyapisit, K.; Visudtibhan, A.",Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health,,68

Focusing on Charli D’Amelio, this essay argues that the increasing visibility of TikTok and rising celebrity of D’Amelio during the Coronavirus crisis continues and intensifies the longer history of young female celebrity culture, and obscures the dangers and impacts faced by girls around the world who are situated outside of the ideals embodied in TikTok stars like D’Amelio.","Kennedy, Melanie",Eur.

Optimal control of COVID-19 depends on directing resources and health messaging to mitigation efforts that are most likely to prevent transmission, but the relative importance of such measures has been disputed. Objective: To assess the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in the community that likely occur from persons without symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical model assessed the relative amount of transmission from presymptomatic, never symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals across a range of scenarios in which the proportion of transmission from people who never develop symptoms (ie, remain asymptomatic) and the infectious period were varied according to published best estimates. For all estimates, data from a meta-analysis was used to set the incubation period at a median of 5 days. The infectious period duration was maintained at 10 days, and peak infectiousness was varied between 3 and 7 days (-2 and +2 days relative to the median incubation period). The overall proportion of SARS-CoV-2 was varied between 0% and 70% to assess a wide range of possible proportions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from presymptomatic, never symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals. Results: The baseline assumptions for the model were that peak infectiousness occurred at the median of symptom onset and that 30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms and are 75% as infectious as those who do develop symptoms. Combined, these baseline assumptions imply that persons with infection who never develop symptoms may account for approximately 24% of all transmission. In this base case, 59% of all transmission came from asymptomatic transmission, comprising 35% from presymptomatic individuals and 24% from individuals who never develop symptoms. Under a broad range of values for each of these assumptions, at least 50% of new SARS-CoV-2 infections was estimated to have originated from exposure to individuals with infection but without symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance: In this decision analytical model of multiple scenarios of proportions of asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 and infectious periods, transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated to account for more than half of all transmissions. In addition to identification and isolation of persons with symptomatic COVID-19, effective control of spread will require reducing the risk of transmission from people with infection who do not have symptoms. These findings suggest that measures such as wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, and strategic testing of people who are not ill will be foundational to slowing the spread of COVID-19 until safe and effective vaccines are available and widely used.","Johansson, Michael A; Quandelacy, Talia M; Kada, Sarah; Prasad, Pragati Venkata; Steele, Molly; Brooks, John T; Slayton, Rachel B; Biggerstaff, Matthew; Butler, Jay C",JAMA Netw Open,,68
283380,Treasure from garden: bioactive compounds of buckwheat,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we review the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and its relationship with oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation. Furthermore, we analyze the potential role of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies to prevent severe complications. OS has a potential key role in the COVID-19 pathogenesis by triggering the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB). While exposure to many pro-oxidants usually induces nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor2 (NRF2) activation and upregulation of antioxidant related elements expression, respiratory viral infections often inhibit NRF2 and/or activate NF-kB pathways, resulting in inflammation and oxidative injury. Hence, the use of radical scavengers like N-acetylcysteine and vitamin C, as well as of steroids and inflammasome inhibitors, has been proposed. The NRF2 pathway has been shown to be suppressed in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients. Pharmacological NRF2 inducers have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, the inflammatory response, and transmembrane protease serine 2 activation, which for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor. Thus, NRF2 activation may represent a potential path out of the woods in COVID-19 pandemic.","Fratta Pasini, Anna M; Stranieri, Chiara; Cominacini, Luciano; Mozzini, Chiara",,,68

The disease spread rapidly throughout the country. Some of the cases were asymptomatic, some had mild to severe symptoms, and some of them died. Transplant patients are highly at risk due to long-term immunosuppressive therapy, and precise treatment approaches are needed to not only cure the disease but also protect graft function. Case Presentation: This study reports two kidney transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, both of whom showed respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. High cyclosporine and tacrolimus trough levels were observed despite initial dose reduction. After a treatment program containing reduced immunosuppressant dose and the addition of pulsatile hydrocortisone, these patients recovered effectively. We also discuss the importance of drug-drug interactions related to COVID-19 treatment protocol medications, especially with immunosuppressants in these patients. Conclusion: In conclusion, frequent monitoring of the trough levels of calcineurin and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors during hospitalization is recommended. It helps to determine the ideal treatment and prevent serious clinical toxicity.","Khamas, S. S.; Ramezanzadeh, E.; Jafari, A.",Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal,,68

This study aimed to assess whether guideline-driven antimicrobial prescribing for CAP can be improved using an intervention bundle. Secondary measures assessed were hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, duration of intravenous antibiotics and total antibiotics, improved uptake of appropriate investigations, and documentation of CURB-65 score. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of hospitalised CAP patients from August-September 2018 was compared with a post-intervention prospective cohort from May-June 2019. The intervention bundle included a mobile audience response system, promotion of the antimicrobial app, development of a physical card with local guidelines, and incorporating CURB-65 into the unscheduled admission proforma. Local guidelines are in keeping with British Thoracic Society CAP guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 69 adult patients (aged >18 years) were included in the study (37 retrospective, 32 prospective). Overall compliance with local CAP guidelines improved from 21.6% to 62.5% (P < 0.001). No difference in initial intravenous antibiotic duration was seen (median 4 days vs. 4 days; P = 0.70) and total antibiotic duration was significantly shorter in the post-intervention group (median 9 days vs. 7 days; P = 0.01). No difference in LOS or mortality was seen between the groups. Documentation of CURB-65 improved from 5.4% to 46.9% (P < 0.001). Uptake of streptococcal urinary antigen testing improved from 18.9% to 40.6% (P = 0.024).

An in-depth investigation of the amino acid substitutions in the genomic signature of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is highly essential for understanding its host adaptation and infection biology. A total of 9587 SARS-CoV-2 structural protein sequences collected from 49 different countries are used to characterize protein-wise variants, substitution patterns (type and location), and major substitution changes. The majority of the substitutions are distinct, mostly in a particular location, and lead to a change in an amino acid's biochemical properties. In terms of mutational changes, envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins are relatively more stable than nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins. Several co-occurrence substitutions are observed, particularly in S and N proteins. Substitution specific to active sub-domains reveals that heptapeptide repeat, fusion peptides, transmembrane in S protein, and N-terminal and C-terminal domains in the N protein are remarkably mutated. We also observe a few deleterious mutations in the above domains. The overall study on non-synonymous mutation in structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 at the start of the pandemic indicates a diversity amongst virus sequences.","Das, Jayanta Kumar; Roy, Swarup",Genome,,68

Due to the recent explosion of heterogeneous multimodal data sources generated in the biomedical domain, and an industry shift toward a systems biology approach, knowledge graphs have emerged as attractive methods of data storage and hypothesis generation. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the author summarizes the applications of knowledge graphs in drug discovery. They evaluate their utility; differentiating between academic exercises in graph theory, and useful tools to derive novel insights, highlighting target identification and drug repurposing as two areas showing particular promise. They provide a case study on COVID-19, summarizing the research that used knowledge graphs to identify repurposable drug candidates. They describe the dangers of degree and literature bias, and discuss mitigation strategies. EXPERT OPINION: Whilst knowledge graphs and graph-based machine learning have certainly shown promise, they remain relatively immature technologies. Many popular link prediction algorithms fail to address strong biases in biomedical data, and only highlight biological associations, failing to model causal relationships in complex dynamic biological systems.

The throat swabs, sputum, and stool samples from 57 hospitalized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers, among 170 returning healthy travelers were tested using reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction. SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies were detected via serum chemiluminescence assay. Sequential results showed higher viral RNA loads in the throat, sputum, and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptom onset among severely ill COVID-19 patients. Shorter viral habitation time (1-8 days) was observed in the oropharyngeal site and intestinal tract of asymptomatic carriers. The IgG and IgM response rates were 19/37 (51.4%) and 23/37 (62.6%) among the 29 confirmed patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers, respectively, within 66 days from symptom or detection onset. The median duration between symptom onset and positive IgG and IgM results was 30 (n=23; interquartile range [IQR]=20-66) and 23 (n=19; IQR=12-28) days, respectively. Of 170 returning healthy-travelers to China, 4.7% were asymptomatic carriers (8/170) within 2 weeks, and the IgG and IgM positivity rate was 12.8% (12/94). IgM/IgG-positivity confirmed 3 suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, despite negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Compared with other respiratory viral infectious diseases, COVID-19 has fewer asymptomatic carriers, lower antibody response rates, and a longer antibody production duration in recovered patients and the contacted healthy population.

In response, the U.S. Surgeon General, the American College of Srugeons, and other surgical professional societies recommended postponing elective surgical procedures and proceeding cautiously with cancer procedures that may require significant hospital resources and expose vulnerable patients to the virus. These challenges have particularly distressing for women with a gynecologic cancer diagnosis and their providers. Currently, circumstances vary greatly by region and by hospital, depending on COVID-19 prevalence, case mix, hospital type, and available resources. Therefore, COVID-19-related modifications to surgical practice guidelines must be individualized. Special consideration is necessary to evaluate the appropriateness of procedural interventions, recognizing the significant resources and personnel they require. Additionally, the pandemic may occur in waves, with patient demand for surgery ebbing and flowing accordingly. Hospitals, cancer centers and providers must prepare themselves to meet this demand.

Thus, the current report examined whether cyberbullying processes and frequency are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared US adult participant data from six months before the start of the pandemic (July 2019; n = 181) to data collected in the middle of the pandemic (May, 2020; n = 173) to determine if there are any significant differences in anonymity perceptions, belief in the irrelevance of muscularity for online bullying (BIMOB), cyberbullying attitudes, and cyberbullying perpetration. Results showed that there were significant increases in BIMOB, cyberbullying attitudes, and cyberbullying perpetration during the pandemic, but no significant change for anonymity perceptions. Further, the relationships between several variables germane to cyberbullying perpetration prediction were stronger during the pandemic than before. Overall, these findings add to our understanding of the behavioral impact the COVID-19 pandemic has on US adults.","Barlett, Christopher P; Simmers, Matthew M; Roth, Brendan; Gentile, Douglas",J Soc Psychol,,68

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 98 patients (males: females, 43:55, mean year, 49±12 years) with confirmed COVID-19 at Jianghan fangcang shelter hospital admitted between Feb 05, 2020, and Feb 09, 2020, who had initial chest CTs at our hospital. Radiographic features and CT scores were analyzed. Results: A total of 267 CT scans of 98 patients were evaluated. Our study showed a high median total CT score of 7 within the first week from symptom onset, peaked in the 2nd week at 10, followed by persistently high levels of CT score with 9.5, 7 and 7 for the week 3, 4, and >4, respectively, and a prolonged median disease course (30 days, the median interval between the onset of initial symptoms and discharge). Ground-glass opacity (GGO) (58%, 41/71) was the earliest and most frequent finding in week 1. Consolidation (26%, 14/53) and mixed pattern (40%, 21/53) were predominant patterns in 2nd week. GGO and reticular were the main patterns of later phase CT scans in patients with relatively advanced diseases who had longer illness duration (&#8805;4 weeks). Among the 94 CT abnormalities obtained within 3 days from the twice RT-PCR test turned negative, the mixed pattern was mainly presented in patients with disease duration of 2-3 weeks, for GGO and reticular were common during the whole course. Conclusion: Discharged patients from fangcang shelter hospital demonstrated a high extent of lung abnormalities on CT within the first week from symptom onset, peaked at 2nd week, followed by persistence of high levels and a prolonged median disease course. GGO was the predominant pattern in week 1, consolidation and mixed pattern in 2nd week, whereas GGO and reticular patterns in later stages (&#8805;4 weeks).","Guo, Tingting; Liu, Xiaoming; Xu, Cihao; Wang, Jiazheng; Yang, Lian; Shi, Heshui; Dai, Meng",Int J Med Sci,,68

310486,Researchers are betting that AI and automation can cut drug discovery from five years to six months: Automating antivirals,2020,"Secretion is an energy consuming process that plays a relevant role in cell communication and adaptation to the environment. Among others, endocrine cells producing hormones, immune cells producing cytokines or antibodies, neurons releasing neurotransmitters at synapsis, and more recently acknowledged, senescent cells synthesizing and secreting multiple cytokines, growth factors and proteases, require energy to successfully accomplish the different stages of the secretion process. Calcium ions (Ca2+) act as second messengers regulating secretion in many of these cases. In this setting, mitochondria appear as key players providing ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, buffering Ca2+ concentrations and acting as structural platforms. These tasks also require the concerted actions of the mitochondrial dynamics machinery. These proteins mediate mitochondrial fusion and fission, and are also required for transport and tethering of mitochondria to cellular organelles where the different steps of the secretion process take place. Herein we present a brief overview of mitochondrial energy metabolism, mitochondrial dynamics, and the different steps of the secretion processes, along with evidence of the interaction between these pathways. We also analyze the role of mitochondria in secretion by different cell types in physiological and pathological settings.","Martínez, Jennyfer; Marmisolle, Inés; Tarallo, Doménica; Quijano, Celia",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,68

311747,The Role of Al3+ -Based Aqueous Electrolytes in the Charge Storage Mechanism of MnOx Cathodes,2021,"BACKGROUND: Surface decontamination of hospital environments is essential to ensure the safety of health professionals and patients. This process is usually performed through active chemicals substances with high toxicity, and new decontamination technologies that do not leave residues have been currently used, such as UV-C light. Thus, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a portable UV-C light device on the viability of standard pathogenic strains and other microorganisms isolated from different surfaces of a public health hospital. METHODS: In vitro decontamination was performed by applying Biosept Home© UV-C to Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica and Candida albicans. In real conditions, the application was made on different surfaces of a hospital. The device used in the experiment haa a 254 nm UV-C light and a radiation intensity of 45.6 mW/cm2 over a distance of 1 cm from the surfaces. The light dose was 0.912 J/cm2 for 20 s of application in both conditions (in vitro and hospital). RESULTS: After in vitro decontamination with UV-C light no bacterial growth was observed, demonstrating 100 % of bacterial inactivation under the conditions tested. Additionally, there was a reduction of approximately 4 logs for the yeast C. albicans. In all hospital surfaces, the number of colonies of microorganisms was significantly reduced after the procedure. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Biosept Home© UV-C is efficient and constitutes a promosing intervention for disinfection protocols in hospitals and clinics.","Santos, Tamires Dos; de Castro, Lívia Furquim",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,,68

METHODS: The ABO blood type of 9 pedigree members were determined by serological methods. Exons 6 and 7 of the ABO gene were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. The patient and her father were also subjected to clone sequencing analysis. RESULTS: Serological tests demonstrated that the proband and her younger brother had an ABw subtype, whilst her father and two daughters had Bw subtype. Clone sequencing found that the exon 7 of the ABO gene of the proband had a T>C substitution at position 695, which was identified as a BW.11 allele compared with the reference sequence B.01. This BW.11 allele was also identified in the proband's father, brother and two daughters. Due to allelic competition, the A/BW.11 and BW.11/O alleles demonstrated significantly different phenotypes. CONCLUSION: The c.695T>C substitution of the ABO gene may lead to allelic competition in the Bw11 subtype. Combined molecular and serological methods is helpful for precise blood grouping.","Feng, Chenchen; Ren, Weichao; Cheng, Daosheng; Gao, Jingyan; Chen, Jianyong; Li, Weichao; Xiao, Jianyu; Liu, Taixiang; Huang, Chengyin; Chen, Qing",Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,,68

However, gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 are increasingly being recognized and drawn significant attention. We report an atypical case of acute pancreatitis in a patient with SARSCoV2 infection. CT scan of the abdomen showed findings suggestive of acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis with a CT severity index was 3. HRCT chest revealed multifocal ground glass opacities in both lungs with a CORADS score of 5. Later, nasal swab for COVID RT-PCR tested positive. The patient was treated symptomatically with fluid replacement, optimization of electrolyte balance and oxygen supplementation. She had an uneventful recovery with gradual resolution of her abdominal and pulmonary symptoms. COVID-19 pathogenesis is believed to be mediated by the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor over the cell surface. ACE-2, which acts as a receptor for viral entry into host cells are highly expressed in pancreatic cells. All the reported cases of COVID-19 pancreatitis so far are known cases of COVID 19 pneumonia, developed acute pancreatitis or pancreatic injury in due course or during recovery of the illness. Ours is the first case to present with features of acute pancreatitis without any pulmonary symptoms, who turned out to be positive for COVID 19 during workup.

In 2016, the UK EU referendum and the US Presidential election were both marked by social media misinformation campaigns, which have subsequently reduced trust in democratic processes. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the acceptance of fake news has been shown to pose a threat to public health. Research on how to combat the false acceptance of fake news is still in its infancy. However, recent studies have started to focus on the psychological factors which might make some individuals less likely to fall for fake news. Here, we adopt that approach to assess whether individuals who show high levels of 'emotional intelligence' (EQ) are less likely to fall for fake news items. That is, are individuals who are better able to disregard the emotionally charged content of such items, better equipped to assess the veracity of the information. Using a sample of UK participants, an established measure of EQ and a novel fake news detection task, we report a significant positive relationship between individual differences in emotional intelligence and fake news detection ability. We also report a similar effect for higher levels of educational attainment, and we report some exploratory qualitative fake news judgement data. Our findings are discussed in terms of their applicability to practical short term (i.e. current Facebook user data) and medium term (i.e. emotional intelligence training) interventions which could enhance fake news detection.","Preston, Stephanie; Anderson, Anthony; Robertson, David J; Shephard, Mark P; Huhe, Narisong",PLoS One,,68
320769,Magnetic Nanomaterials in Microfluidic Sensors for Virus Detection: A Review,2021,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients frequently develop cardiopulmonary system complications such as acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the mechanism by which TBI causes ALI/ARDS is not fully understood. Here, we used a severe TBI model to examine the effects of a low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin, on inflammasome activation and lung injury damage. We investigated whether enoxaparin inhibits ALI and inflammasome signaling protein expression in the brain and lungs after TBI in mice. C57/BL6 mice were subjected to severe TBI and were treated with vehicle or 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin 30 min after injury. Lung and brain tissue were collected 24 h post-TBI and were analyzed by immunoblotting for expression of the inflammasome proteins, caspase-1 and interleukin (IL)-1ß. In addition, lung tissue was collected for histological analysis to determine ALI scoring and neutrophil and macrophage infiltration post-injury. Our data show that severe TBI induces increased expression of inflammasome proteins caspase-1 and IL-1ß in the brain and lungs of mice after injury. Treatment with enoxaparin attenuated inflammasome expression in the brain and lungs 24 h after injury. Enoxaparin significantly decreased ALI score as well as neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in lungs at 24 h after injury. This study demonstrates that enoxaparin attenuates ALI and inhibits inflammasome expression in the brain and lungs after TBI. These findings support the hypothesis that inhibition of the neural-respiratory inflammasome axis that is activated after TBI may have therapeutic potential.","Kerr, Nadine A; de Rivero Vaccari, Juan Pablo; Weaver, Cailey; Dietrich, W Dalton; Ahmed, Tahir; Keane, Robert W",J. neurotrama,,68

Methods: Web of Science, SCOPUS, and MEDLINE- databases were searched for original studies concerning the effect of COVID-19 on mortality of pregnant and postpartum women published by July 10, 2020. Meta-analyses of proportions were used to combine data and report pooled proportions. Results: 117 studies with a total of 11758 pregnant women were included. The age ranged between 15 and 48 years. Most subjects were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the third trimester. Disease severity was not reported in 1125 subjects. Maternal mortality was 1.3%. In 100% of fatal cases with adequate data, fever alone or with cough was one of the presenting symptoms. Also, dyspnea (58.3%) and myalgia (50%) were the most common symptoms. Sore throat (8.3%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea) (8.3%) were rare. The rate of comorbidities was 20% among COVID-19 deaths. The majority of COVID-19-infected women who died had cesarean section (58.3%), 25% had a vaginal delivery, and 16.7% of patients were not full term. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection in pregnant women was associated with higher rates (and pooled proportions) of cesarean section and mortality. Because new data are continuously being generated and published, the findings of this study can be complete and updated with new researches. The results of this study can guide and improve prenatal counseling of COVID-19-infected pregnant women.","Karimi, Leila; Makvandi, Somayeh; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",J Pregnancy,,68

Here we report that North American deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection following intranasal exposure to a human isolate, resulting in viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract with little or no signs of disease. Further, shed infectious virus is detectable in nasal washes, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs, and viral RNA is detectable in feces and occasionally urine. We further show that deer mice are capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to naïve deer mice through direct contact. The extent to which these observations may translate to wild deer mouse populations remains unclear, and the risk of reverse zoonosis and/or the potential for the establishment of Peromyscus rodents as a North American reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown.","Griffin, Bryan D; Chan, Mable; Tailor, Nikesh; Mendoza, Emelissa J; Leung, Anders; Warner, Bryce M; Duggan, Ana T; Moffat, Estella; He, Shihua; Garnett, Lauren; Tran, Kaylie N; Banadyga, Logan; Albietz, Alixandra; Tierney, Kevin; Audet, Jonathan; Bello, Alexander; Vendramelli, Robert; Boese, Amrit S; Fernando, Lisa; Lindsay, L Robbin; Jardine, Claire M; Wood, Heidi; Poliquin, Guillaume; Strong, James E; Drebot, Michael; Safronetz, David; Embury-Hyatt, Carissa; Kobasa, Darwyn",Nat Commun,,68

Therefore, the COVID-19 confirmed deaths underestimate the influence of the pandemic on society; instead, the measure of 'excess deaths' is a more objective and comparable way to assess the scale of the epidemic and formulate lessons. One common practical issue in analysing the impact of COVID-19 is to determine the 'pre-COVID-19' period and the 'post-COVID-19' period.

Although currently with a rather low mortality rate, the virus spread rapidly over the world using the modern world's traffic highways. The coronavirus (CoV) family members were responsible for several deadly outbreaks and epidemics during the last decade. Not only governments but also the scientific community reacted promptly to the outbreak, and information is shared quickly. For example, the genetic fingerprint was shared, and the 3D structure of key proteins was rapidly solved, which can be used for the discovery of potential treatments. An overview is given on the current knowledge of the spread, disease course, and molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2. We discuss potential treatment developments in the context of recent outbreaks, drug repurposing, and development timelines.Challenges and opportunities: • The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has changed our world in just half a year: a large number of people have died from the virus-induced pneumonia COVID-19, and the global economy is at an unprecedented low with unknown near- and long-term consequences. • The coronavirus pandemic needs a two-pronged approach: a short-term solution to find a drug to treat the massive number of seriously ill patients, and long-term development of preventive and curative drugs for future corona outbreaks. • De novo drug discovery takes years to move from idea and/or pre-clinic to market release and is not a short-term solution for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Drug repurposing is perhaps the only short-term solution, and vaccination is a middle-term solution.This perspective covers the chemistry and biology of SARS-CoV-2 and potential pharmacological interventions of the coronavirus pandemic, including discussion of the different drug modalities such as vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies, small-molecule drugs, or natural medicines (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]). The most likely scenario for a short-term solution of the COVID-19 crisis is the multiple drug repurposing approaches currently being pursued.","Dömling, Alexander; Gao, Li",Chem,,68

331074,Squalene-based multidrug nanoparticles for improved mitigation of uncontrolled inflammation in rodents,2020,"Viral receptors are the cell surface proteins that are hijacked by viruses to initialize their infections. Viral receptors are subject to two conflicting directional forces, namely, negative selection due to functional constraints and positive selection due to host-virus arms races. It remains largely obscure whether negative pleiotropy limits the rate of adaptation in viral receptors. Here, we perform evolutionary analyses of 96 viral receptor genes in primates and find that 41 out of 96 viral receptors experienced adaptive evolution. Many positively selected residues in viral receptors are located at the virus-receptor interfaces. Compared with control proteins, viral receptors exhibit significantly elevated rate of adaptation. Further analyses of genetic polymorphisms in human populations reveal signals of positive selection and balancing selection for 53 and 5 viral receptors, respectively. Moreover, we find that 49 viral receptors experienced different selection pressures in different human populations, indicating that viruses represent an important driver of local adaptation in humans. Our findings suggest that diverse viruses, many of which have not been known to infect nonhuman primates, have maintained antagonistic associations with primates for millions of years, and the host-virus conflicts drive accelerated adaptive evolution in viral receptors.IMPORTANCE Viruses hijack cellular proteins, termed viral receptors, to assist their entry into host cells. While viral receptors experience negative selection to maintain their normal functions, they also undergo positive selection due to an everlasting evolutionary arms race between viruses and hosts. A complete picture on how viral receptors evolve under two conflicting forces is still lacking. In this study, we systematically analyzed the evolution of 96 viral receptors in primates and human populations. We found around half of viral receptors underwent adaptive evolution and exhibit significantly elevated rates of adaptation compared to control genes in primates. We also found signals of past natural selection for 58 viral receptors in human populations. Interestingly, 49 viral receptors experienced different selection pressures in different human populations, indicating that viruses represent an important driver of local adaptation in humans. Our results suggest that host-virus arms races drive accelerated adaptive evolution in viral receptors.","Wang, Wenqiang; Zhao, Huayao; Han, Guan-Zhu",J. virol,,68

336708,Ultrametric analogues of Ulam stability of groups,2021-05-02,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) profoundly influences T-cell immunity. The counts of total T cells and T-cell subsets, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, are decreased in patients with COVID-19. Also, the function of these cells becomes less effective as the expression of immune inhibitory receptors, such as Tim3 and PD-1, increases over time during the disease. Kinetic analyses show that the T-cell profile changes dynamically, so does the COVID-19 stages. As COVID-19 continues to deteriorate and progresses to severe/critical condition, the lymphocyte count steadily decreases. Therefore, the ability of COVID-19 to escape the immune system might lie in its power to profoundly diminish T-cell effective function, which is necessary for the establishment of a robust antiviral immunity. Also, COVID-19 is associated with increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages, and as the disease progresses from a mild form to a severe/critical condition, the macrophage population becomes denser. Monitoring the expression of cytokines associated with macrophage activation, mainly interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, indicates that the course of COVID-19 consists of two stages and the transition between disease stages occurs by the end of the first week after onset of symptoms. At the initial stage, the immune military recognizes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as nonself and thus fires macrophages at the lungs against the virus. The first flame can control disease progression effectively. However, a trained immunocompetent system would maintain the fire of macrophages over an extended time. It lies in its immune memory in tissue-resident macrophages, especially alveolar macrophages, making a professionally trained immune system more likely to be feared by COVID-19 than an untrained immune system. In this manner, the trained immunocompetent system commits such a failure that causes the lungs to come down rapidly. The fact that younger age groups, including neonates and children, are less susceptible to COVID-19 than older age groups reflects that the natural affinities of the immune system that has not been trained thoroughly would be standard in combatting against COVID-19 whereas the higher affinities of the trained immune system for rapid activation of immune responses might raise faults - the lungs come down.","Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,68

Three hundred fifty-four blood samples longitudinally obtained from 81 IgG-seroconverting progressed coronavirus disease 2019 (CoVID-19) patients were quantified for spike 1 (S1), S2, and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific IgM, IgA, IgG, and total Ig antibodies using a microarray, 11 different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)/chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs), and 1 rapid test by seven manufacturers. The assays' specificity was assessed in 130 non-CoVID-19 pneumonia patients. Using the microarray, NCP-specific IgA and IgG antibodies continuously displayed higher detection rates during acute CoVID-19 than S1- and S2-specific ones. S1-specific IgG antibodies, however, reached higher peak values. Until the 26th day post-symptom onset, all patients developed IgG responses against S1, S2, and NCP. Although detection rates by ELISAs/CLIAs generally resembled those of the microarray, corresponding to the target antigen, sensitivities and specificities varied among all tests. Notably, patients with more severe CoVID-19 displayed higher IgG and IgA levels, but this difference was mainly observed with S1-specific immunoassays. In patients with high SARS-CoV-2 levels in the lower respiratory tract, we observed high detection rates of IgG and total Ig immunoassays with a particular rise of S1-specific IgG antibodies when viral concentrations in the tracheal aspirate subsequently declined over time. In summary, our study demonstrates that differences in sensitivity among commercial immunoassays during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are only partly related to the target antigen. Importantly, our data indicate that NCP-specific IgA and IgG antibodies are detected earlier, while higher S1-specific IgA antibody levels occur in severely ill patients.","Semmler, Georg; Traugott, Marianna Theresia; Graninger, Marianne; Hoepler, Wolfgang; Seitz, Tamara; Kelani, Hasan; Karolyi, Mario; Pawelka, Erich; Aragón de La Cruz, Sara; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth; Aberle, Stephan Walter; Stiasny, Karin; Zoufaly, Alexander; Aberle, Judith Helene; Weseslindtner, Lukas",J. clin. microbiol,,68

338446,Why we triage,2020,"The Mapocho River's upper basin (Chilean Central Andes) was studied as a proxy of a high-mountainous hydrothermally-altered (HMHA) system comprised by three sub-basins developed over very different rocks and submitted to different anthropic pressure: 1) a natural acid rock drainage (i.e., Yerba Loca), 2) a creek with mining activity in its headwaters and hydrochemically classified as non-affected by acid mine drainage (i.e., San Francisco), and 3) a low metal concentration creek (i.e., Molina). In general terms, the geochemical composition of the clastic sediments was consistent with the geochemistry inferred from the mineralogical study. However, sediments with a smaller grain size showed higher concentrations than the bigger grain size counterparts for elements such as Fe, S, Cu and As. This behavior was particularly evident in the Yerba Loca basin and it was attributed to the seasonal appearance of Fe- and Al-rich precipitates as constituents of the finer sediments. Different methodologies for the calculation of geochemical backgrounds (Tukey's inner fence, TIF; Median + 2*Median Absolute Deviation, MAD; and 95th percentile) were tested. Results suggest that the 95th percentile-method was the most appropriate for this type of mountainous systems. Using the selected methodology, three different geochemical backgrounds were calculated: 1) Yerba Loca basin, 2) Molina basin, and 3) Mapocho Upper basin. When the generated background levels were compared with the Consensus-Based (CB) Sediment Quality Guidelines; Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, Ni and As showed background values that were consistently higher than the values set by the CB Threshold Effect Concentration and, even higher than the CB Probable Effect Concentration for Fe (MUBBackground: 6.78 wt% vs CB PEC: 4.00 wt%; and Cu (MUBBacground: 3387 mg kg-1 vs CB PEC: 149 mg kg-1). The present study clearly states the paramount importance of having a solid geochemical background before any attempt of a sediment risk assessment is made at HMHA regions.","Correa-Burrows, José P; Navarrete-Calvo, Álvaro; Valenzuela-Díaz, Martín J; Zapata-Aguiló, Valeria A; Montserrat, Santiago; Navarro-Valdivia, Leonardo; McPhee, James; Caraballo, Manuel A",Sci Total Environ,,68

Methods: 9,386 UK Biobank study participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16th 2020 to June 29th 2020 were analyzed. A forward model building approach was used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Analyses were stratified by age due to a significant first-order interaction between age and HWC. Results: Approximately 17% (n = 1,577) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. BMI category had a linear association with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among participants <65 years (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17). For participants &#8805;65 years, only obesity class II (RR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.10-1.74) had a significantly greater risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 than those who were underweight/normal weight.

Conclusion: The associations of BMI and HWC with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 differed by age. Notably, HWC was associated with testing positive in those &#8805;65 years, but not those who were younger, independent of BMI.

344352,Sustainable preparation of gold nanoparticles via green chemistry approach for biogenic applications,2020,"Preface/Introduction With great pleasure, we would like to present to you the scholarly selected articles presented in the Regional Conference in Civil Engineering and Sustainable Development Goals in Higher Education Institutions 2020 (RCCE 2020), held between 23 rd and 24 th January 2021 conducted virtually via Whova Virtual Conference Platform in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia. This conference was sponsored by ASEAN Universiti Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network (AUN/SEED-NET) under the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Technical Cooperation Project. RCCE 2020 strategized to combine the transformation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) implementation in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) based on the requirements of United Nation for the year 2030 as well as to support the specific agenda in “The World in 2050” (TWI 2050). This aspiration was the global research and fact-based knowledge in transforming the indicated SDGs in a better way. Therefore, all the keynotes/ invited/ guest speakers explained their roles and contribution to the society, with SDGs related to R&D, innovation, technology and knowledge-transfer. Most of the issues and challenges were connected to the environmental application thereby strengthening the interaction between HEIs, Industry, Government and Community. As the world is still bound to the COVID-19 pandemic, travelling was restricted. For this, different parallel sessions were conducted virtually focusing on the theme “Localizing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Engineering with Look East Policy Partnership”. Participants around this region did not only share similar issues or problems faced but also forged strong partnership among the ASEAN countries to come out with viable solutions fitting this region. In line with the international publication requirements, manuscripts from sessions related to engineering field including structural, environmental, material science, green technology, geotechnical, transportation, water resources and wastewater were rigorously reviewed. We hope that the collection of accepted manuscript will provide insights to many academicians, researchers and specialist of particular field.

In this issue's Ethics Rounds, we present 2 cases that highlight 2 different sorts of ethical issues. One is focused on the decisions that have to be made when the surge of patients with respiratory failure overwhelm ICUs. The other is focused on the psychological issues that arise for parents who are caring for a dying child when infection-control policies limit the number of visitors. Both of these situations raise challenges for caregivers who are trying to be honest, to deal with their own moral distress, and to provide compassionate palliative care.","Evans, Amanda M; Jonas, Monique; Lantos, John",Pediatrics,,68

347553,The fungal collaboration gradient dominates the root economics space in plants,2020,"Introduction The objective of this cross-sectional study was to describe the main symptoms associated with COVID-19, and their diagnostic characteristics, to aid in the clinical diagnosis. Methods An analysis of all patients diagnosed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between April and May 2020 in Argentina was conducted. The data includes clinical and demographic information from all subjects at the time of presentation (n=67318, where 12% were positive for SARS-CoV-2). The study population was divided into four age groups: pediatric (0-17 years), young adults (18-44 years), adults (4564 years), and elderly (65-103 years). Multivariate logistic regression was used to measure the association of all symptoms and to create a diagnostic model based on symptoms. Results Symptoms associated with COVID-19 were anosmia, dysgeusia, headache, low-grade fever, odynophagia, and malaise. However, the presentation of these symptoms was different between the different age groups. In turn, at the time of presentation, the symptoms associated with respiratory problems (chest pain, abdominal pain, and dyspnea) had a negative association with COVID-19 or did not present statistical relevance. On the other hand, the model based on 16 symptoms, age and sex, presented a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 46%. Conclusions There were significant differences between the different age groups. Additionally, there were interactions between different symptoms that were highly associated with COVID-19. Finally, our findings showed that a regression model based on multiple factors (age, sex, interaction between symptoms) can be used as an accessory diagnostic method or a rapid screening of suspected COVID-19 cases.","Fleitas, Pedro E.; Paz, Jorge A.; Simoy, Mario I.; Vargas, Carlos Cimino Rubén O.; Królewiecki, Alejandro J.; Aparicio, Juan P.",Germs,,68

A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients screened for syphilis through universal screening in a large, urban emergency department from June 2019 to June 2020. During the early pandemic (April through June 2020), screening rates remained similar, but the rate of presumed active infection increased from 1.2% to 1.8% (prevalence ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-2.00; P < 0.01), with significant increases among adolescents and women. Only 19.2% of patients with presumed active infection presented for STI-related complaints. Universal screening represents a valuable tool for achieving syphilis control within high-prevalence communities.","Stanford, Kimberly A; Almirol, Ellen; Schneider, John; Hazra, Aniruddha",Sex Transm Dis,,68
355634,"Superhydrophobic, photo-sterilize, and reusable mask based on graphene nanosheet-embedded carbon (GNEC) film",2020,"We investigate the containment of epidemic spreading in networks from a normative point of view. We consider a susceptible/infected model in which agents can invest in order to reduce the contagiousness of network links. In this setting, we study the relationships between social efficiency, individual behaviours and network structure. First, we exhibit an upper bound on the Price of Anarchy and prove that the level of inefficiency can scale up to linearly with the number of agents. Second, we prove that policies of uniform reduction of interactions satisfy some optimality conditions in a vast range of networks. In setting where no central authority can enforce such stringent policies, we consider as a type of second-best policy the shift from a local to a global game by allowing agents to subsidise investments in contagiousness reduction in the global rather than in the local network. We then characterise the scope for Pareto improvement opened by such policies through a notion of Price of Autarky, measuring the ratio between social welfare at a global and a local equilibrium. Overall, our results show that individual behaviours can be extremely inefficient in the face of epidemic propagation but that policy can take advantage of the network structure to design efficient containment policies.","Bouveret, Geraldine; Mandel, Antoine",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07580v1.pdf,68

355638,Advanced Platinum-Based Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for Fuel Cells,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat presenting health, economic, and social challenges that continue to escalate. Metapopulation epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. What's more, variation of intracounty environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different regions. To address this issue, we develop a human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behaviors. This modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and business foot traffic, race and ethnicity, and age structure are then investigated. The results reveal that, in a college town (Dane County), the most important heterogeneity is age structure, while, in a large city area (Milwaukee County), racial and ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent. Scenario studies further indicate a strong response of the spread rate to various reopening policies, which suggests that policy makers may need to take these heterogeneities into account very carefully when designing policies for mitigating the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and reopening.","Hou, Xiao; Gao, Song; Li, Qin; Kang, Yuhao; Chen, Nan; Chen, Kaiping; Rao, Jinmeng; Ellenberg, Jordan S; Patz, Jonathan A",Proc.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading rapidly across the world, and there are still many unknowns about COVID-19. There is an urgent need for scientists around the world to work together to model the virus, study how the virus has changed and will change over time, understand how it spreads, and study transmission after vaccination. COVID-ARC can also prepare scientists for future pandemics by putting the infrastructure in place to enable researchers to aggregate data and perform analyses quickly in the event of an emergency. We have developed a platform of networked and centralized web-accessible data archives to store multimodal data related to COVID-19 and make them broadly available and accessible to the world-wide scientific community to expedite research in this area. COVID-ARC provides tools for researchers to visualize and analyze various types of data as well as a website with tools for training, announcements, virtual information sessions, and a knowledgebase wherein researchers post questions and receive answers from the community.","Duncan, D.",Communications in Information and Systems,,68

365547,"Pandemics, Vaccines and Corporate Earnings",2020,"Social Networks' omnipresence and ease of use has revolutionized the generation and distribution of information in today's world. However, easy access to information does not equal an increased level of public knowledge. Unlike traditional media channels, social networks also facilitate faster and wider spread of disinformation and misinformation. Viral spread of false information has serious implications on the behaviors, attitudes and beliefs of the public, and ultimately can seriously endanger the democratic processes. Limiting false information's negative impact through early detection and control of extensive spread presents the main challenge facing researchers today. In this survey paper, we extensively analyze a wide range of different solutions for the early detection of fake news in the existing literature. More precisely, we examine Machine Learning (ML) models for the identification and classification of fake news, online fake news detection competitions, statistical outputs as well as the advantages and disadvantages of some of the available data sets. Finally, we evaluate the online web browsing tools available for detecting and mitigating fake news and present some open research challenges.","Khan, Tanveer; Michalas, Antonis; Akhunzada, Adnan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10671v1.pdf,68

375020,Cellular decoys distract coronavirus,2020,"As winter is knocking the door, the risk of respiratory tract infection is increasing at present scenario due to no prophylaxis of Covid-19. So, no one is safe until everyone is safe. Worldwide researchers are looking for the vaccine to remove the need for social distancing, mask-wearing and social gathering. A vaccine is like many other outcomes if the vaccine would be available; we cannot say about the effectiveness of the vaccine. Several drugs are testing to save the people life from pandemic; azithromycin is one of them. This work is a review article with the updated findings of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19. The option of azithromycin with regards to COVID-19 is justified by its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-fibrotic effects and their pharmacokinetic properties, leading to effective concentrations in the target tissue. Azithromycin tends to be an effective candidate for SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibition that block the initial stage of the viral life cycle. Clinical trials at a preliminary scale and final stage show the significant results of azithromycin in supportive care therapy. Azithromycin was an early candidate for the medication of Covid-19 with or without hydroxychloroquine. It is exercised mostly as an outpatient antibiotic in COVID-19. In summing-up, any primary anti-viral and antibiotic treatment is not the only possibility of fighting COVID-19 pharmacologically. It will be an injustice with them who require broader spectrum antibiotic if we do not exercise azithromycin to them. So significant research priority is needed to determine whether azithromycin is useful in the treatment of COVID-19.","Wahab, Shadma; Ahmad, Md Faruque; Hussain, Arshad; Usmani, Shazia; Shoaib, Ambreen; Ahmad, Wasim",Mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry (Online),,68
380813,Influence of temperature and CO2 on plasma-membrane permeability to CO2 and HCO3 - in the marine haptophytes Emiliania huxleyi and Calcidiscus leptoporus (Prymnesiophyceae),2020,"BACKGROUND: The cellular immune system is of pivotal importance with regard to the response to severe infections. Monocytes/macrophages are considered key immune cells in infections and downregulation of the surface expression of monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR) within the major histocompatibility complex class II reflects a state of immunosuppression, also referred to as injury-associated immunosuppression. As the role of immunosuppression in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently unclear, we seek to explore the level of mHLA-DR expression in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In a preliminary prospective monocentric observational study, 16 COVID-19-positive patients (75% male, median age: 68 [interquartile range 59-75]) requiring hospitalization were included. The median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score in 9 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute respiratory failure was 30 (interquartile range 25-32). Standardized quantitative assessment of HLA-DR on monocytes (cluster of differentiation 14+ cells) was performed using calibrated flow cytometry at baseline (ICU/hospital admission) and at days 3 and 5 after ICU admission. Baseline data were compared to hospitalized noncritically ill COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: While normal mHLA-DR expression was observed in all hospitalized noncritically ill patients (n = 7), 89% (8 of 9) critically ill patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory failure showed signs of downregulation of mHLA-DR at ICU admission. mHLA-DR expression at admission was significantly lower in critically ill patients (median, [quartiles]: 9280 antibodies/cell [6114, 16,567]) as compared to the noncritically ill patients (30,900 antibodies/cell [26,777, 52,251]), with a median difference of 21,508 antibodies/cell (95% confidence interval [CI], 14,118-42,971), P = .002. Reduced mHLA-DR expression was observed to persist until day 5 after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: When compared to noncritically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease showed reduced mHLA-DR expression on circulating CD14+ monocytes at ICU admission, indicating a dysfunctional immune response. This immunosuppressive (monocytic) phenotype remained unchanged over the ensuing days after ICU admission. Strategies aiming for immunomodulation in this population of critically ill patients should be guided by an immune-monitoring program in an effort to determine who might benefit best from a given immunological intervention.","Spinetti, Thibaud; Hirzel, Cedric; Fux, Michaela; Walti, Laura N; Schober, Patrick; Stueber, Frank; Luedi, Markus M; Schefold, Joerg C",Anesth Analg,,68
381046,Mesoscale coordination constructs,2020,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) still remains a challenge, especially with mutations in the Dynein Arm Heavy Chain 11 (DNAH11) gene. Classical diagnostic measures like Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) are not applicable for mutations in the DNAH11 gene since ultrastructural defects of the ciliary apparatus are absent. Novel mutations encoding for PCD appear all the time with considerable variation in the clinical picture, making it necessary to update data bases and guidelines for PCD diagnostics. METHODS: In this study we examined two unrelated, Finnish families with symptoms of PCD applying the clinical scoring system: Primary ciliary dyskinesia Rule (PICADAR), high speed video microscopy analysis (HSVMA) for ciliary movement, a commercially available gene panel analysis and nasal Nitric Oxide (nNO) measurements if applicable. RESULTS: Two, likely pathogenic variants in the DNAH11 gene (c.2341G > A, p. (Glu781Lys) ja c.7645 + 5G > A) were detected. In the first family, compound heterozygous mutations led to disease manifestation in two of 4 children, which showed a similar phenotype of cilia beating pattern but marked differences in disease severity. In the second family, all three children were homozygotes for the c.2341G > A p.(Glu781Lys) mutation and showed a similar degree of disease severity. However, the phenotype of cilia beating pattern was different ranging from stiff, static cilia to a hyperkinetic movement in one of these children. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we describe two Finnish families with PCD, revealing two novel mutations in the DNAH11 gene which show considerable variety in the clinical and beating cilia phenotype. The results of this study show the clinician that PCD can be much milder than generally expected and diagnosis demands a combination of measures which are only successful in experienced hands. Chronic and repeatedly treated wet cough should raise suspicion of PCD, referring the patient for further diagnostics to a specialised PCD centre.","Schultz, Rüdiger; Elenius, Varpu; Lukkarinen, Heikki; Saarela, Tanja",BMC Med Genet,,68

381405,Performance evaluation of stool dna methylation tests in colorectal cancer screening,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The role of school closure in mitigating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission has been questioned. In our medical centre, during a 9-week national lockdown, an alternative school was opened for health-care workers' (HCW) children with a small number of children per class and strict symptom surveillance. After lockdown was lifted we screened children and their parents for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serology. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of HCW parents and their children after one teacher contracted COVID-19 following exposure at home and 53 children were exposed, isolated and tested by RT-PCR. We compared families with children attending the alternative school with families whose children who remained at home during the 9-week lockdown. Epidemiological and medical data were collected using a short questionnaire; nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, and blood was collected for SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG titres. RESULTS: A total of 435 children attended the Sheba alternative school. Among the 53 children exposed to the infected teacher, none tested positive by RT-PCR. Of these, 18 children-parent pairs were tested for serology and all were negative. A total of 106/435 (24%) children and their 78 parents were recruited for the cross-sectional study; 70 attended the Sheba school and 36 did not. Approximately 16% of children in either group reported symptoms (11/70 in the school group and 6/36 in the 'stay home' group), but SARS-CoV-2 was not detected by PCR in any, and previous exposure, as determined by serological tests, was low and not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: In an alternative school for children of HCWs, active during COVID-19 national outbreak, we found no evidence of increased infection compared with children that stayed home.","Kriger, Or; Lustig, Yaniv; Cohen, Carmit; Amit, Sharon; Biber, Asaf; Barkai, Galia; Talmi, Liron; Gefen-Halevi, Shiraz; Mechnik, Bella; Regev-Yochay, Gili",Clin. microbiol. infect,,68
382229,The challenges of small animal veterinary anaesthesia in 2020,2020,"BACKGROUND: We report the first case of a patient who suffered transient focal neurological deficit mimicking stroke following CoronaVac vaccination. However, instead of an ischemic stroke, motor aura was suspected. CASE PRESENTATIONS: A 24 year-old Thai female presented with left hemiparesis fifteen minutes after receiving CoronaVac. She also had numbness of her left arm and legs, flashing lights, and headaches. On physical examination, her BMI was 32.8. Her vital signs were normal. She had moderate left hemiparesis (MRC grade III), numbness on her left face, arms, and legs. Her weakness continued for 5 days. A brain CT scan was done showing no evidence of acute infarction. Acute treatment with aspirin was given. MRI in conjunction with MRA was performed in which no restricted diffusion was seen. A SPECT was performed to evaluate the function of the brain showing significant hypoperfusion of the right hemisphere. The patient gradually improved and was discharged. DISCUSSIONS: In this study, we present the first case of stroke mimic after CoronaVac vaccination. After negative imaging studies had been performed repeatedly, we reach a conclusion that stroke is unlikely to be the cause. Presumably, this phenomenon could possibly have abnormal functional imaging study. Therefore, we believed that it might be due to cortical spreading depression, like migraine aura, which we had conducted a literature review.","Rattanawong, Wanakorn; Akaratanawat, Wasan; Tepmongkol, Supatporn; Chutinet, Aurauma; Tantivatana, Jarturon; Suwanwela, Nijasri Charnnarong",J Headache Pain,,68
382900,Self-powered user-interactive electronic skin for programmable touch operation platform,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is a real possibility of successive COVID-19-epidemic waves with devastating consequences. In this context, it has become mandatory to design age-selective measures aimed at achieving an optimal balance between protecting public health and maintaining a viable economic activity. METHODS: We programmed a Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed (SEIR) model in order to introduce epidemiologically relevant age classes into the outbreak-dynamics analysis. The model was fitted to the official death toll and calculated age distribution of deaths in Wuhan using a constrained linear least-squares algorithm. Subsequently, we used synthetic location-specific and age-structured contact matrices to quantify the effect of age-selective interventions both on mortality and on economic activity in Wuhan. For this purpose, we simulated four different scenarios ranging from an absence of measures to age-selective interventions with stronger physical-distancing measures for older individuals. RESULTS: An age-selective strategy could reduce the death toll by >30% compared with the non-selective measures applied during Wuhan's lockdown for the same workforce. Moreover, an alternative age-selective strategy could allow a 5-fold increase in the population working on site without a detrimental impact on the death toll compared with the Wuhan scenario. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that age-selective-distancing measures focused on the older population could have achieved a better balance between COVID-19 mortality and economic activity during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. However, the implications of this need to be interpreted along with considerations of the practical feasibility and potential wider benefits and drawbacks of such a strategy.","Ortega-Quijano, Daniel; Ortega-Quijano, Noe",Int. j. epidemiol,,68

MSCs have inherent immunomodulatory characteristics, trophic activity, high invitro self-renewal ability, and can be readily engineered to enhance their immunomodulatory functions. MSCs affect the functions of most immune effector cells via direct contact with immune cells and local microenvironmental factors. Previous studies have confirmed that the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs are mainly communicated via MSC-secreted cytokines; however, apoptotic and metabolically inactivated MSCs have more recently been shown to possess immunomodulatory potential, in which regulatory T cells and monocytes play a key role. We review the immunomodulatory aspects of naïve and engineered MSCs, and discuss strategies for increasing the potential of successfully using MSCs in clinical settings.","Song, Na; Scholtemeijer, Martijn; Shah, Khalid",Trends pharmacol. sci,,68

Federal, state, and local governments spend $93 billion annually on public health in the US, but most of this spending is at the state level. Thus, shoring up gaps in public health preparedness and response requires an understanding of state spending. We present state spending trends in eight categories of public health activity from 2008 through 2018. We obtained data from the Census Bureau for all states except California and coded the data by public health category. Although overall national health expenditures grew by 4.3 percent in this period, state governmental public health spending saw no statistically significant growth between 2008 and 2018 except in injury prevention. Moreover, state spending levels on public health were not restored after cuts experienced during the Great Recession, leaving states ill equipped to respond to COVID-19 and other emerging health needs.","Alfonso, Y Natalia; Leider, Jonathon P; Resnick, Beth; McCullough, J Mac; Bishai, David",Health Aff (Millwood),,68

We aimed to review clinical evidence regarding the potential toxicity of psychiatric medications in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A systematic search for all types of empirical studies and reviews in a broad set of electronic databases and trial registries was conducted up to the 15th of August 2020. RESULTS: We identified 3 case series and 4 single-case reports on the occurrence of toxicity induced by various psychotropic drugs (lithium, n = 2; clozapine, n = 5; risperidone n = 2; haloperidol n = 1; duloxetine, n = 1). In addition, we provide a new case report on the possible precipitation of valproic acid-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy. In most cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection may have precipitated drug toxicity/side effects. The management of toxicity did not diverge from the usually applied principles in the absence of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the limited available evidence and the recent genomic diversity and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2, it is currently not possible to derive evidence-based recommendations for the use of psychotropic drugs in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, we provide some guidance based on the reviewed literature. At the current state of knowledge, there is no contraindication for any psychotropic drug. Caution is warranted regarding the dosing and, in particular, the monitoring of clozapine, lithium and valproate.","Sabe, Michel; Dorsaz, Orianne; Huguelet, Philippe; Kaiser, Stefan",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,,68

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were reviewed. CT findings were classified as follows: Type A; patchy ground glass attenuation (GGA) with/without air-space consolidation, Type B; non-segmental GGA with/without air-space consolidation in both the central and peripheral lung portions especially with subpleural spare, and Type C; non-segmental GGA with/without air-space consolidation predominantly distributed in the peripheral lung portion without subpleural spare. We analyzed CT patterns and clinical factors associated with RF, including age categories. RESULTS: The number of patients with Type A, B and C was 31 (37%), 24 (28%) and 30 (35%), respectively. Type C and hypertension were independently associated with RF. On comparing between Types B and C, the frequency of traction bronchiectasis was higher in Type C than in Type B (P < 0.001). The ratio of Type C in patients &#8805; 65 years old (66%) was higher than in patients < 40 years old (P < 0.001) and 40-49 years old (P = 0.001).

401495,The Meaning of an End: N-Terminal Acetyltransferase NAA50 Controls Plant Growth and Stress Responses,2020,"PURPOSE: This article reviews the efficacy and safety of revefenacin, the first once-daily, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, when delivered via a standard jet nebulizer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). SUMMARY: Revefenacin 175 µg is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with moderate to very severe COPD. Preclinical studies showed that revefenacin is a potent and selective antagonist with similar affinity for the different subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1-M5). Furthermore, prevention of methacholine- and acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstrictive effects was dose dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours, demonstrating a long duration of action. In phase 2 and 3 trials, treatment with revefenacin was demonstrated to result in statistical improvements in pulmonary function (&#8805;100 mL, P < 0.05) vs placebo, including among patients with markers of more severe disease and those who received concomitant long-acting ß-agonists or long-acting ß-agonists together with inhaled corticosteroids. Revefenacin was also demonstrated to have efficacy similar to that of tiotropium. The clinical trial findings indicated no significant difference between revefenacin and tiotropium with regard to rates of adverse events. Overall, revefenacin was well tolerated, with COPD worsening/exacerbation, dyspnea, headache, and cough among the most common adverse events noted in the clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Revefenacin treatment delivered via nebulization led to improvements in lung function in patients with COPD. It was also generally well tolerated, with no major safety concerns. Revefenacin provides a viable treatment option for patients with COPD and may be a suitable alternative for those with conditions that may impair proper use of traditional handheld inhalers.","Hvisdas, Christopher",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,68
401833,Colour appearance in immersive three-dimensional virtual environments,2021,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are innate immune cells that acquire the capacity to suppress adaptive immune responses. In the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), MDSCs (in the donor graft and in the recipient, after allo-HSCT) might mediate immune suppression through multiple mechanisms. However, it remains unclear how MDSCs can be distinguished from their normal myeloid counterparts in the hematopoietic stem cell donor graft and during immune reconstitution after allo-HSCT in the recipient. Our ability to understand their exact role in allo-HSCT is limited by the absence of a specific gene signature or surface markers for identifying MDSCs among myeloid cells and by their plasticity in different microenvironments. According to various studies, MDSCs might induce transplant tolerance and control graft vs. host disease (GVHD), but their impact on the graft vs. tumor effect (GVT) is not fully understood. In fact, we know that MDSCs commonly expand in patients with cancer, and they are thought to promote hematological malignancy progression. However, little is known about whether depleting them might be an effective strategy for enhancing GVT effects. Here, we review data published over the past 40 years on allo-HSCT to delineate the different MDSC subsets, and their abilities to induce transplant tolerance and preserve the GVT effect. This review will provide a basis for determining whether one MDSC subset might be proposed as the most appropriate candidate for cellular therapies, due to its ability to modulate GVHD.","D039,; Aveni, Maud; Notarantonio, Anne B; Bertrand, Allan; Boulangé, Laura; Pochon, Cécile; Rubio, Marie T",Front Immunol,,68

As a result of rapid spread, it turned into a pandemic announced by WHO on March 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is an etiological factor of a new disease called COVID-19. The virus is transmitted mainly through the droplet route. In most cases, it causes mild symptoms such as fever, dry cough, weakness, and muscle pain; less common symptoms include sore throat, runny nose, diarrhea, and chills. However, among people with impaired immunity and comorbidities, as well as among older people, it leads to lifethreatening complications in the form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and septic shock. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic in humans and easily spreading coronavirus after the virus of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 and virus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. This review summarizes current information on the emergence, origin, diversity, and common characteristics, as well as the epidemiology of the above three highly contagious coronaviruses.","Zeidler, Agnieszka; Karpinski, Tomasz M.",Jundishapur J.

METHODS: An online survey of patients in quarantine. Questions targeted the conditions of quarantine, sleep related behaviours and exposure to factors known to affect sleep and circadian rhythms (light exposure and sport). RESULTS: In all, 1777 participants were included: 77% women and 72% aged 25-54 years. Quarantine conditions were most frequently in couples with children (36%) and in a house with a garden (51%). Forty-seven percent of participants reported a decrease in sleep quality during quarantine. Factors associated with a reduction in sleep quality by logistic regression were sleep reduction (OR 15.52 P<0.001), going to bed later (OR 1.72 P<0.001), getting up earlier (2.18 P=0.01), an increase in sleep-wake irregularity (OR 2.29 P<0.001), reduced exposure to daylight (OR 1.46 P=0.01) and increased screen use in the evenings (OR 1.33 P=0.04). CONCLUSION: Sleep quality tended to reduce during quarantine and this was associated with changes in sleep behaviours and light exposure, especially in the evening. In order to optimise sleep during quarantine, regular sleep and wake times, at least 1hour exposure to daylight and a reduction of screen use in the evenings are suggested.","Hartley, S; Colas des Francs, C; Aussert, F; Martinot, C; Dagneaux, S; Londe, V; Waldron, L; Royant-Parola, S",Encephale,,68

415491,Bankruptcy and the Coronavirus: Part II,2020,"Purpose: Health care workers are susceptible to contracting infection with COVID-19 by aerosol transmission. This is a risk while examining and/or treating an un-sedated neonate in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening and treatment. But screening for neonates for ROP and treating with laser, when required, should not be delayed to avoid the blindness. We describe a cost-effective method of containing aerosols generated during such a procedure in an un-sedated baby. Methods: An acrylic transparent containment box was prepared to accommodate an average-sized infant. The box had four walls and a roof. The floor was open to place the container box over the baby. The walls have two types of openings, large ones to allow passage of hands to examine the baby, small ones to enable passage of oxygen tubing when required. A simulation was created to examine the impact of aerosol spray on examining healthcare personnel. Results: The cost of the acrylic box was negligible. It could be assembled locally with available acrylic sheets and craftsmen. It was not difficult to examine the baby inside the box, and the simulation demonstrated that it protected the health personnel from the aerosol contamination. Conclusion: The described method is likely to increase healthcare personnel's confidence not to delay or deny ROP screening and laser treatment and save the babies from blindness.","Nayak, Sameera; Reddy, Y P; Behera, Shashwat; Adish, T S; Satyanarayana, D",Indian J Ophthalmol,,68

418342,Antiviral activity of fermented foods and their probiotics bacteria towards respiratory and alimentary tracts viruses,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases was on an increasing trend, including in Malaysia. The Malaysian Ministry of Health had implemented a range of measures, such as the use of masks and social distancing, to reduce the risk of transmission. Traditionally, newborns are evaluated for neonatal jaundice using visual assessment, a capillary heel prick and serum bilirubin (SB) sampling in primary health-care clinics. This approach requires the physical presence of both parents and their newborns in the primary health-care clinics, causing crowding and increasing the risk of COVID-19 infections. To alleviate crowding, we implemented the transcutaneous bilirubin drive-through (DT) service, which is an established, non-invasive, painless and rapid method to determine the bilirubin levels. Throughout the screening, both parents and baby will be confined to their car. A total of 1842 babies were screened in our DT setting from April to July 2020. Of the total babies, 298 (16.1%) required venesection for SB measurement and 85 required admission for phototherapy. None with severe jaundice were missed since the implementation of this service. The average test duration per neonate was less than 5 min, while conventional venous bilirubin laboratory testing required an average of 1.5 h per neonate. The cost of the SB laboratory test and consumables was approximately USD 5 per test, with an estimated cost savings of USD 7720. DT screening may be introduced in health-care settings to reduce crowding and eliminate the need of painful blood sampling in newborns.","Chua, Bee-Sim; Song, Li-Herng; Chang, Chee-Tao; Lim, Xin-Jie; Nachiappan, Jeyaseelan",J. paediatr. child health,,68

In this work we conduct a scientometric analysis of COVID-19 research, paying particular attention to the nature of collaboration that this pandemic has fostered among different disciplines. Increased multidisciplinary collaboration has been shown to produce greater scientific impact, albeit with higher co-ordination costs. As such, we consider a collection of over 166,000 COVID-19-related articles to assess the scale and diversity of collaboration in COVID-19 research, which we compare to non-COVID-19 controls before and during the pandemic. We show that COVID-19 research teams are not only significantly smaller than their non-COVID-19 counterparts, but they are also more diverse. Furthermore, we find that COVID-19 research has increased the multidisciplinarity of authors across most scientific fields of study, indicating that COVID-19 has helped to remove some of the barriers that usually exist between disparate disciplines. Finally, we highlight a number of interesting areas of multidisciplinary research during COVID-19, and propose methodologies for visualising the nature of multidisciplinary collaboration, which may have application beyond this pandemic.","Cunningham, Eoghan; Smyth, Barry; Greene, Derek",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13370v1.pdf,68

The results emphasize the importance of diminishing the inter-group infections in the effort of substantial flattening/delaying of the epi(demiologic) curve with concomitant mitigation of disastrous economy and social consequences. To exemplify, splitting a population into m (say, 5 or 10) noninteracting groups while keeping intra-group interaction unchanged yields a stretched epidemiological curve having the maximum number of daily infections reduced and postponed in time by the same factor m (5 or 10). More generally, the study suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS- CoV- 2 virus spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling between them. This strategy can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure reorganization of activity at different levels in big logistic units (e.g., large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, schools, (seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdown, the proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more bearable level than distancing everyone from anyone. The declaration for the first time in Europe that COVID-19 epidemic ended in the two-million population Slovenia may be taken as support for the strategy proposed here.","Bâldea, Ioan",Adv Theory Simul,,68

435841,Polydiacetylene‐Based Biosensors for the Detection of Viruses and Related Biomolecules,2020,"A novel strain of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has been recently identified as an infectious disease affecting the respiratory system of humans This disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that was identified in Chinese patients having severe pneumonia and flu-like symptoms COVID-19 is a contagious disease that spreads rapidly via droplet particles arising through sneezing and coughing action of an infected person The reports of asymptomatic carriers changed the scenario of symptom based-diagnosis in COVID-19 and intensified the need for proper diagnosis of the majority of the population to combat the rapid transmission of virus The diagnosis of positive cases is necessary to ensure prompt care to affected people and also to curb further spread of infection in the population Collecting samples at the right time and from the exact anatomical site is crucial for proper molecular diagnosis After the complete genome sequence was available, China formulated RT-PCR as a primary diagnostic procedure for detecting SARS-CoV-2 Many in-house and commercial diagnostic kits have been developed or are under development that have a potential to lower the burden of diagnosis on the primary diagnostic techniques like RT-PCR Serological based diagnosis is another broad category of testing that can detect different serum antibodies like IgG, IgM, and IgA in an infected patient PCR-based diagnostic procedures that are commonly used for pathogen detection need sophisticated machines and assistance of a technical expert Despite their reliable accuracy, they are not cost-effective tests, which a common man can afford, so it becomes imperative to look for other diagnostic approaches, which could be cost effective, rapid, and sensitive with consistent accuracy To make such diagnostics available to the common man, many techniques can be exploited among, which are Point of Care (POC), also known as bed side testing, which is developing as a portable and promising tool in pathogen diagnosis Other lateral flow assay (LFA)-based techniques like SHERLOCK, CRISPR-Cas12a (AIOD-CRISPR), and FNCAS9 editor-limited uniform detection assay (FELUDA), etc have shown promising results in rapid detection of pathogens Diagnosis holds a critical importance in the pandemic situation when there is no potential drug for the pathogen available in the market This review sums up the different diagnostic approaches designed or proposed to combat the crisis of widespread diagnosis due to the sudden outbreak of a novel pathogen, SARS-CoV-2 in 2019","Islam, K.

Employing the spillover index approach of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012); as well as developing a DCC-FIGARCH conditional correlation framework and using estimated spillover indices built on a generalised vector autoregressive framework in which forecast-error variance decompositions are invariant to the variable ordering, we examine the sectoral transmission mechanisms of volatility shocks and contagion throughout the energy sector. Among several results, we find positive and economically meaningful spillovers from falling oil prices to both renewable energy and coal markets. However, this result is only found for the narrow portion of our sample surrounding the negative WTI event. We interpret our results being directly attributed to a sharp drop in global oil, gas and coal demand, rather than because of a sudden increase in oil supply. While investors observed the US fracking industry losing market share to coal, they also viewed renewables as more reliable mechanism to generate long-term, stable and low-cost supply.","Corbet, Shaen; Goodell, John W; Günay, Samet",Energy Econ,,68

443773,Coronaviruses: There and back again,2020,"BACKGROUND: To date, much of the research on individual difference correlates of coronavirus guideline adherence is cross-sectional, leaving prospective associations between these factors unaddressed. Additionally, investigations of prospective predictors of mask-wearing, COVID-19 symptoms, and viral testing remain wanting. PURPOSE: The present study examined prospective relations between demographic factors, personality traits, social cognitions and guideline adherence, mask-wearing, symptoms, and viral testing in a U.S. sample (N = 500) during the initial surge of COVID-19 deaths in the United State between late March and early May 2020. METHODS: Guided by a disposition-belief-motivation framework, correlational analyses, and path models tested associations among baseline personality traits, guideline adherence social cognitions, health beliefs, guideline adherence and follow-up guideline adherence, mask-wearing, symptom counts, and 30-day viral testing. RESULTS: Modeling results showed greater baseline agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were associated with more frequent baseline guideline adherence. More liberal political beliefs, greater guideline adherence intentions, and more frequent guideline adherence at baseline predicted more frequent mask-wearing at follow-up. Sex (female), lower perceived health, and greater neuroticism at baseline predicted greater symptom counts at follow-up. Reports of viral testing were quite low (1.80%), yet were consistent with concurrent national reporting and limited availability of testing. CONCLUSIONS: Results show how inconsistencies and politicization of health policy communication were concomitant with the effects of individual-level political beliefs on mask-wearing during the initial surge. The results further clarify how personality traits related to social responsibility (i.e., agreeableness, conscientiousness) are associated with following new norms for prescribed behaviors and how symptom reporting can be as much a marker of perceived health as emotional stability.","Milad, Elizabeth; Bogg, Tim",Ann. behav. med,,68

450094,Band structure of twisted bilayer graphene on hexagonal boron nitride,2020-05-15,"Objective: To investigate the prevalence and changes of events of COVID-19 disease by trending in Bangladesh. Methods: In this study, the daily time series data for nine weeks was used. The daily cases, case fatality rate (CFR), recovery-death-ratio (RDR) and percent changes (PC) associated with COVID-19 disease were used for prevalence and trending. Result: It is found that 68% males and 32% females patients were infected, among them 21 to 30 (26%) was the most and below 10 (3%) was the least infected age group until May 09. The approximate number of days for the infection, recovery and deaths to be doubled are 10, 5 and 18 respectively in Bangladesh as of May 09, 2020. The CFR of Bangladesh is found 1.55% which is less than the CFRs of the world (6.89%), Europe (9.17%), America (5.61%), Africa (3.26%) and South-East Asia (3.52%) as of May 09, 2020. The daily RDR exhibited a downward trend from April 04, 2020 to April 25, 2020 then showed an upward trend until May 09, 2020. Conclusion: The downward trending of the CFR indicates the death rate is low compared to diagnosis. The upward trend of the RDR indicates the recovery caused by COVID-19 is fast compared to deaths over time in Bangladesh. The downward trending of the PC indicates the cases percent of COVID-19 disease is reducing relative to three days prior cases.","Muyeed, Abdul; Siddiqi, Md. Nure Alam; Tawabunnahar, Most",J.

Indeed, many studies have quantified the epidemic growth rate using time-series of reported cases during the early phase of the outbreak to estimate the basic reproduction number, R0. Using daily time series of COVID-19 incidence, we illustrate how epidemic curves of reported cases may not always reflect the true epidemic growth rate due to changes in testing rates, which could be influenced by limited diagnostic testing capacity during the early epidemic phase.","Omori, Ryosuke; Mizumoto, Kenji; Chowell, Gerardo",Int J Infect Dis,,68

Clinically, advanced age and cardiovascular comorbidities are the most important risk factors. Objective: To determine whether clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), an age-associated condition with excess cardiovascular risk defined as the presence of an expanded, mutated somatic blood cell clone in persons without other hematological abnormalities, may be associated with an inflammatory gene expression sensitizing monocytes to aggravated immune responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This hypothesis-generating diagnostic study examined a cohort of patients with severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis or chronic postinfarction heart failure, as well as age-matched healthy control participants. Single-cell RNA sequencing and analyses of circulating peripheral monocytes was done between 2017 and 2019 to assess the transcriptome of circulating monocytes. Exposures: Severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis or chronic postinfarction heart failure. Main Outcomes and Measures: CHIP-driver sequence variations in monocytes with a proinflammatory signature of genes involved in cytokine release syndrome. Results: The study included 8 patients with severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis, 6 with chronic postinfarction heart failure, and 3 healthy control participants. Their mean age was 75.7 (range, 54-89) years, and 6 were women. Mean CHIP-driver gene variant allele frequency was 4.2% (range, 2.5%-6.9%) for DNMT3A and 14.3% (range, 2.6%-37.4%) for TET2. Participants with DNMT3A or TET2 CHIP-driver sequence variations displayed increased expression of interleukin 1ß (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 1.6217 normalized Unique Molecular Identifiers [nUMI]; DNMT3A, 5.3956 nUMI; P < .001; TET2, 10.8216 nUMI; P < .001), the interleukin 6 receptor (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 0.5386 nUMI; DNMT3A, 0.9162 nUMI; P < .001;TET2, 0.5738 nUMI; P < .001), as well as the NLRP3 inflammasome complex (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 0.4797 nUMI; DNMT3A, 0.9961 nUMI; P < .001; TET2, 1.2189 nUMI; P < .001), plus upregulation of CD163 (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 0.5239 nUMI; DNMT3A, 1.4722 nUMI; P < .001; TET2, 1.0684 nUMI; P < .001), a cellular receptor capable of mediating infection, macrophage activation syndrome, and other genes involved in cytokine response syndrome. Gene ontology term analyses of regulated genes revealed that the most significantly upregulated genes encode for leukocyte-activation and interleukin-signaling pathways in monocytes of individuals with DNMT3A (myeloid leukocyte activation: log[Q value], -50.1986; log P value, -54.5177; regulation of cytokine production: log[Q value], -21.0264; log P value, -24.1993; signaling by interleukins: log[Q value], -18.0710: log P value, -21.1597) or TET2 CHIP-driver sequence variations (immune response: log[Q value], -36.3673; log P value, -40.6864; regulation of cytokine production: log[Q value], -13.1733; log P value, -16.3463; signaling by interleukins: log[Q value], -12.6547: log P value, -15.7977). Conclusions and Relevance: Monocytes of individuals who carry CHIP-driver sequence variations and have cardiovascular disease appear to be primed for excessive inflammatory responses. Further studies are warranted to address potential adverse outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with CHIP-driver sequence variations.","Abplanalp, Wesley Tyler; Mas-Peiro, Silvia; Cremer, Sebastian; John, David; Dimmeler, Stefanie; Zeiher, Andreas M",JAMA cardiol.

464122,Engineered antibodies to combat viral threats,2020,"Introduction. The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020 is testing economic resilience and surge capacity of healthcare providers worldwide. At the time of writing, positive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains the only method for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. Rapid upscaling of national SARS-CoV-2 genome testing presented challenges: (1) Unpredictable supply chains of reagents and kits for virus inactivation, RNA extraction and PCR-detection of viral genomes. (2) Rapid time to result of <24 h is required in order to facilitate timely infection control measures.Hypothesis. Extraction-free sample processing would impact commercially available SARS-CoV-2 genome detection methods.Aim. We evaluated whether alternative commercially available kits provided sensitivity and accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 genome detection comparable to those used by regional National Healthcare Services (NHS).Methodology. We tested several detection methods and tested whether detection was altered by heat inactivation, an approach for rapid one-step viral inactivation and RNA extraction without chemicals or kits.Results. Using purified RNA, we found the CerTest VIASURE kit to be comparable to the Altona RealStar system currently in use, and further showed that both diagnostic kits performed similarly in the BioRad CFX96 and Roche LightCycler 480 II machines. Additionally, both kits were comparable to a third alternative using a combination of Quantabio qScript one-step Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) mix and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-accredited N1 and N2 primer/probes when looking specifically at borderline samples. Importantly, when using the kits in an extraction-free protocol, following heat inactivation, we saw differing results, with the combined Quantabio-CDC assay showing superior accuracy and sensitivity. In particular, detection using the CDC N2 probe following the extraction-free protocol was highly correlated to results generated with the same probe following RNA extraction and reported clinically (n=127; R2=0.9259).Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that sample treatment can greatly affect the downstream performance of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits, with varying impact depending on the kit. We also showed that one-step heat-inactivation methods could reduce time from swab receipt to outcome of test result. Combined, these findings present alternatives to the protocols in use and can serve to alleviate any arising supply-chain issues at different points in the workflow, whilst accelerating testing, and reducing cost and environmental impact.","Thompson, Jamie L; Downie Ruiz Velasco, Angela; Cardall, Alice; Tarbox, Rebecca; Richardson, Jaineeta; Clarke, Gemma; Lister, Michelle; Howson-Wells, Hannah C; Fleming, Vicki M; Khakh, Manjinder; Sloan, Tim; Duckworth, Nichola; Walsh, Sarah; Denning, Chris; McClure, C Patrick; Benest, Andrew V; Seedhouse, Claire H",J. medical microbiol,,68

As is known, bioavailability of a drug and, hence, its pharmacological efficacy depend on its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which may be altered by drug interactions. This paper discusses the interactions of gepants and lasmiditan with, i.a., serotonergic drugs, CYP3A4 inhibitors, and inducers or breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors. In the case of monoclonal antibodies, the issue of pharmacodynamic interactions related to the modulation of the immune system functions was addressed. It also focuses on the effect of monoclonal antibodies on expression of class Fc gamma receptors (FcÎ³R).","Szkutnik-Fiedler, Danuta",,,68

469192,Refreshing the biologic pipeline 2020,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has becoming a public health issue since March 2020 considering that more than 30 million people were found to be infected worldwide. Particularly, recent evidences suggested that men may be considered as at higher risk of poor prognosis or death once the infection occurred and concerns surfaced in regard of the risk of a possible testicular injury due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Several data support the existence of a bivalent role of testosterone (T) in driving poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. On one hand, this is attributable to the fact that T may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells by means of an enhanced expression of transmembrane serine-protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). At the same time, younger man with normal testicular function compared to women of similar age are prone to develop a blunted immune response against SARS-CoV-2, being exposed to less viral clearance and more viral shedding and systemic spread of the disease. Conversely, low levels of serum T observed in hypogonadal men predispose them to a greater background systemic inflammation, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and immune system dysfunction, hence driving harmful consequences once SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred. Finally, SARS-CoV-2, as a systemic disease, may also affect testicles with possible concerns for current and future testicular efficiency. Preliminary data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 genome is not normally found in gonads and gametes, therefore sex transmission could be excluded as a possible way to spread the COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Most data support a role of T as a bivalent risk factor for poor prognosis (high/normal in younger; lower in elderly) in COVID-19. However, the impact of medical treatment aimed to modify T homeostasis for improving the prognosis of affected patients is unknown in this clinical setting. In addition, testicular damage may be a harmful consequence of the infection even in case it occurred asymptomatically but no long-term evidences are currently available to confirm and quantify this phenomenon. Different authors excluded the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in sperm and oocytes, thus limiting worries about both a potential sexual and gamete-to-embryos transmission of COVID-19. Despite these evidence, long-term and well-designed studies are needed to clarify these issues.","Lisco, Giuseppe; Giagulli, Vito A; De Pergola, Giovanni; De Tullio, Anna; Guastamacchia, Edoardo; Triggiani, Vincenzo",Endocr. metab. immune disord. drug targets,,68
469406,A case of COVID-19 immediately after liver transplantation: Not only bad news,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The effects of presbyphonia are compounded by the decline in respiratory function that occurs with age. Commonly recommended exercises to optimize the use of respiratory muscles during speech, such as diaphragmatic breathing, are unlikely to be intensive enough to induce respiratory changes and impact vocal function. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of adding a targeted intervention, respiratory muscle strength training, to voice exercises in a sample of patients with presbyphonia. METHODS/DESIGN: In this prospective, randomized-controlled trial, 12 participants received either (1) vocal function exercises (VFE), (2) VFE combined with inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST), or (3) VFE combined with expiratory muscle strength training (EMST). Data collected prior to and following 4 weekly intervention sessions included respiratory measures (pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength) and voice measures (videostroboscopy, acoustic, auditory-perceptual, aerodynamic, and self-assessment measures). RESULTS: Participants who received IMST improved their voice quality during connected speech (smoothed cepstral peak prominence and ratings of overall voice quality) and their scores on the three self-assessment questionnaires with large to very large within-group effect sizes (|d| = 0.82-1.61). In addition, participants in the IMST group reduced their subglottal pressure with a large effect size (d = -0.92). Participants who received EMST improved their maximum expiratory strength and smoothed cepstral peak prominence with large effect sizes (d = 0.80 and 0.99, respectively) but had limited improvements in other outcomes. Participants who received only VFE decreased their amount of vocal fold bowing, improved their voice quality on a sustained vowel (amplitude perturbation quotient), and improved their Glottal Function Index score with large effect sizes (|d| = 0.74-1.00). CONCLUSION: Preliminary data indicate that adding IMST to voice exercises may lead to the greatest benefits in patients with presbyphonia by promoting improved subglottal pressure control as well as increasing air available for phonation, resulting in improved self-assessment outcomes.","Desjardins, Maude; Halstead, Lucinda; Simpson, Annie; Flume, Patrick; Bonilha, Heather Shaw",J. voice,,68

Previous studies have shown that the Roma are more likely to experience unjust treatment in health services than the general population. This study examines the association between perceived unjust treatment in healthcare and self-assessed unmet need for primary care provided by general practitioners (GPs) and nurses among the Finnish Roma. The data from the Finnish Roma Wellbeing Study (Roosa), conducted in 2017-2018, were used. Snowball sampling was used in recruiting study participants (n = 365, 61% women). Logistic regression was used to test the association between perceived unjust treatment and unmet need for primary care. Confounders used were gender, age, marital status, education, employment, and self-rated health. Those who had experienced unjust treatment in healthcare were more likely to report unmet need for care provided by GPs (odds ratios (OR) = 6.44; p < 0.001) and nurses (OR = 11.18; p < 0.001) than those who felt that they had been treated justly. This association remained after adjustments for the confounders. Bidirectional guidance between the Roma and service providers should be improved and the Roma communities involved in service development using participatory methods.","Lämsä, Riikka; Castaneda, Anu E; Weiste, Anneli; Laalo, Marianne; Koponen, Päivikki; Kuusio, Hannamaria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,68

We aim to review the pathophysiology of anosmia related to viral upper respiratory infections and the prognostic implications.

476574,Single-objective light sheet microscopy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Onalespib is a novel heat shock protein 90 inhibitor (HSP90i). Previous preclinical and clinical studies with HSP90i have demonstrated activity in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study sought to determine the safety and tolerability of onalespib plus erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the combination in epidermal growth factor receptor exon 20 insertion (EGFRex20ins) NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Standard 3+3 dose escalation was followed by a phase II expansion in EGFRex20ins. The phase II component targeted a response rate of 25% versus a background rate of 5%. Prospective next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 70 cancer-related genes, including EGFR, via plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was performed. Toxicity was graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4, and response was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1. RESULTS: Eleven patients were treated (nine dose escalation, two dose expansion). Two dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in dose level (DL) 0 and zero in DL -1 (minus). In 10 EGFRex20ins patients, no responses were observed, median progression-free survival was 5.4 months (95% confidence interval, 0.9-5.7), and the disease control rate (DCR) was 40% (median, 3.5 months). EGFRex20ins was detected in nine of 10 ctDNA samples at baseline; on-treatment ctDNA clearance was not observed. Grade 3 diarrhea was the predominant toxicity in 45% of patients. The recommended phase II dose is DL -1 (minus): erlotinib 150 mg orally every morning and onalespib 120 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. CONCLUSION: Overlapping toxicities of erlotinib and onalespib, mainly diarrhea, limited the tolerability of this combination, and limited clinical activity was observed, so the trial was closed early. Plasma EGFRex20ins ctDNA was detected in the majority of patients; failure to clear ctDNA was consistent with lack of tumor response (NCT02535338).","Riess, Jonathan W; Reckamp, Karen L; Frankel, Paul; Longmate, Jeffrey; Kelly, Karen A; Gandara, David R; Weipert, Caroline M; Raymond, Victoria M; Keer, Harold N; Mack, Philip C; Newman, Edward M; Lara, Primo N",Clin. lung cancer,,68
477651,Refocusing on Relevance: Personalization in NLG,2021-09-10,"Silk fibroin is a protein with a unique combination of properties and is widely studied for biomedical applications. The extraction of fibroin (degumming) from the silk filament impacts the properties of the outcoming material. The degumming can be conducted with different procedures. Among them, the most used and studied procedure in the research field is the alkali degumming with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). In this study, by the use of a statistical method, namely, design of experiment (DOE), we characterized the Na2CO3 degumming, taking into consideration the main process factors involved and changing them within a selected range of values. We considered the process temperature and time, the salt concentration, and the number of baths used, testing the impact of these variables on the fibroin properties by building empirical models. These models not only took into consideration the direct effect of the process factors but also their combined effect, which are not conventionally detectable with other methods. The weight loss and the amount of sericin removed in the process were determined and used as a measure of the effectiveness of the process. The secondary structure, the molecular weight, the diameter of fibers, and their morphology and mechanical properties were studied with the intent to correlate the macroscopical properties with the structural changes. We report, for the first time, the possibility to effectively remove all sericin from the silk fibroin using Na2CO3, using a process that requires less salt, water, and energy, in comparison with the standard alkali protocol, making this technique overall more environmentally sustainable; in addition, we have demonstrated the possibility to tune the material properties by varying the degumming conditions and even to optimize them with empirical statistically based equations that allow one to directly set the optimal process parameters. The major effect on the macroscopical properties (such as the ultimate strength and Young's modulus) has been proved to be correlated with the removal of sericin instead of the microstructural variations. Finally, a ready-to-use table with a set of optimized degumming procedures to maximize or minimize the studied properties was provided.","Bucciarelli, Alessio; Greco, Gabriele; Corridori, Ilaria; Pugno, Nicola M; Motta, Antonella",,,68
477708,mRNA vaccines take on immune tolerance,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major global public health concern. The mortality rate for critically ill patients is up to 60%, and, thus, reducing the disease severity and case mortality is a top priority. Currently, cytokine storms are considered as the major cause of critical illness and death due to COVID-19. After a systematical review of the literature, we propose that cross-reactive antibodies associated with antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may actually be the cause of cytokine storms. It would be more difficult to develop vaccines for highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) if ADE characteristics are taken into consideration. Therefore, it is urgent to find an effective way to prevent the occurrence of severe illness as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 specific drugs or vaccines are still in development. If the activation of memory B cells can be selectively inhibited in high-risk patients at an early stage of COVID-19 to reduce the production of cross-reactive antibodies against the virus, we speculate that ADE can be circumvented and severe symptoms can be prevented. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors satisfy such needs and it is recommended to conduct clinical trials for mTOR inhibitors in preventing the severity of COVID-19.","Zheng, Yunfeng; Li, Renfeng; Liu, Shunai",J. med. virol,,68

483263,Pool patents to get COVID vaccines and drugs to all,2021,"Covid-19 is particularly mild with children, and its severity escalates with age. Several theories have been proposed to explain these facts. In particular, it was proposed that the lower expression of the viral receptor ACE2 in children protects them from severe Covid. However, other works suggested an inverse relationship between ACE2 expression and disease severity. Here we try to reconcile seemingly contradicting observations noting that ACE2 is not monotonically related with age but it reaches a maximum at a young age that depends on the cell type and then decreases. This pattern is consistent with most existing data from humans and rodents and it is expected to be more marked for ACE2 cell protein than for mRNA because of the increase with age of the protease TACE/ADAM17 that sheds ACE2 from the cell membrane to the serum. The negative relation between ACE2 level and Covid-19 severity at old age is not paradoxical but it is consistent with a mathematical model of virus propagation that predicts that higher viral receptor does not necessarily favour virus propagation and it can even slow it down. More importantly, ACE2 is known to protect organs from chronic and acute inflammation, which are worsened by low ACE2 levels. Here we propose that ACE2 contributes essentially to reverse the inflammatory process by downregulating the pro-inflammatory peptides of the angiotensin and bradykinin system, and that failure to revert the inflammation triggered by SARS-COV-2 may underlie both severe CoViD-19 infection and its many post-infection manifestations, including the multi-inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C). Within this view, lower severity in children despite lower ACE2 expression may be consistent with their higher expression of the alternative angiotensin II receptor ATR2 and in general of the anti-inflammatory arm of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) at young age.","Bastolla, Ugo; Chambers, Patrick; Abia, David; Garc'ia-Bermejo, Maria-Laura; Fresno, Manuel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13210v1.pdf,68

485775,Structure Functions and Parton Densities: a Session Summary,2021-08-22,"BACKGROUND: Globally, COVID-19 is an emerging health problem. As the spread of COVID-19 infection continues worldwide, measures to protect frontline doctors have been in the spotlight on international biosecurity discussions especially in countries with weak health system and infrastructure. AIM: The study was aimed at describing the drivers, barriers, benefits and perceived dangers of utilization of COVID-19 biosecurity protective items at the point of care among frontline doctors in non-COVID-19 hospitals in Abia State. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on 220 frontline doctors in Abia State. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaire that elicited information on utilization of COVID-19 biosecurity items (face masks, face shields, hand sanitizers, disinfectant sprays, hand gloves). The drivers, barriers, benefits, and perceived dangers of utilization of biosecurity items were also studied. Utilization was assessed in the preceding 7 days and graded using utilization ordinal scoring system of 0-4 as follows: Always=4 points;most times=3 points;occasional=2 points, rarely=1 point and never=0 point. Those that scored 1 and above were graded as users while 0 score was graded as non-user. RESULTS: The study participants were aged 24-68 years (mean=32+/-8.4 years). There were 162(73.6%) males. All the respondents (100%) had used at least one of the biosecurity protective items in the previous 7 days. The most commonly used biosecurity items were face masks (100%) and hand-gloves (100%). Others included hand sanitizers (90.0%), face shields (55.5%) and disinfectant sprays (43.2%). The most common driver was availability of biosecurity items (100.0%). The commonest barrier was physical discomfort and fatigue (100.0%). The commonest benefits were self-protection from contracting COVID-19 (100.0%) and prevention of transmission to patients, colleagues and significant others (100.0%). The most commonly perceived dangers were suffocation (87.7%) and skin irritation (76.4%) for face masks and hand sanitizers respectively. CONCLUSION: The most commonly used biosecurity items were face masks and hand gloves while the least utilized was disinfectant sprays. The commonest driver was availability of biosecurity protective items. The most common barrier was physical discomfort and fatigue while the predominant benefits were protection from contracting COVID-19 and transmission to patients, colleagues, and significant others. The most commonly perceived dangers were suffocation and skin irritation for face masks and hand sanitizers respectively.","Iloh, G. U.; Obi, I. V.; Akodu, B. A.",West African Journal of Medicine,,68
487402,A basal-bolus insulin regimen integrated microneedle patch for intraday postprandial glucose control,2020,"Genomes of tens of thousands of SARS-CoV2 isolates have been sequenced across the world and the total number of changes (predominantly single base substitutions) in these isolates exceeds ten thousand. We compared the mutational spectrum in the new SARS-CoV-2 mutation dataset with the previously published mutation spectrum in hypermutated genomes of rubella-another positive single stranded (ss) RNA virus. Each of the rubella virus isolates arose by accumulation of hundreds of mutations during propagation in a single subject, while SARS-CoV-2 mutation spectrum represents a collection events in multiple virus isolates from individuals across the world. We found a clear similarity between the spectra of single base substitutions in rubella and in SARS-CoV-2, with C to U as well as A to G and U to C being the most prominent in plus strand genomic RNA of each virus. Of those, U to C changes universally showed preference for loops versus stems in predicted RNA secondary structure. Similarly, to what was previously reported for rubella virus, C to U changes showed enrichment in the uCn motif, which suggested a subclass of APOBEC cytidine deaminase being a source of these substitutions. We also found enrichment of several other trinucleotide-centered mutation motifs only in SARS-CoV-2-likely indicative of a mutation process characteristic to this virus. Altogether, the results of this analysis suggest that the mutation mechanisms that lead to hypermutation of the rubella vaccine virus in a rare pathological condition may also operate in the background of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently propagating in the human population.","Klimczak, Leszek J; Randall, Thomas A; Saini, Natalie; Li, Jian-Liang; Gordenin, Dmitry A",PLoS One,,68

491597,Molding free-space light with guided wave-driven metasurfaces,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To identify characteristics that predict 30-day mortality among patients critically ill with coronavirus disease 2019 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: A total of 258 adult critical care units. PATIENTS: A total of 10,362 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 with a start of critical care between March 1, 2020, and June 22, 2020, of whom 9,990 were eligible (excluding patients with a duration of critical care less than 24 hr or missing core variables). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome measure was time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care. Of 9,990 eligible patients (median age 60 yr, 70% male), 6,027 died within 30 days of the start of critical care. As of July 22, 2020, 189 patients were still receiving critical care and a further 446 were still in acute hospital. Data were missing for between 0.1% and 7.2% of patients across prognostic factors. We imputed missing data ten-fold, using fully conditional specification and continuous variables were modeled using restricted cubic splines. Associations between the candidate prognostic factors and time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care were determined after adjustment for multiple variables with Cox proportional hazards modeling. Significant associations were identified for age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, prior dependency, immunocompromise, lowest systolic blood pressure, highest heart rate, highest respiratory rate, PaO2/FIO2 ratio (and interaction with mechanical ventilation), highest blood lactate concentration, highest serum urea, and lowest platelet count over the first 24 hours of critical care.

CONCLUSIONS: We identified patient characteristics that predict an increased likelihood of death within 30 days of the start of critical care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019. These findings may support development of a prediction model for benchmarking critical care providers.","Ferrando-Vivas, Paloma; Doidge, James; Thomas, Karen; Gould, Doug W; Mouncey, Paul; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Young, J Duncan; Rowan, Kathryn M; Harrison, David A",Crit. care med,,68

497568,Bioactive lipids in antiviral immunity,2021,"In this article the authors review the current-day definition of professionalism through the lens of the two ongoing pandemics: COVID-19 and racism. The pandemics have led to contemporary practice-related questions, such as: does professionalism entail that health care providers (HCP) be compelled to treat patients without PPE or if patients refuse to wear masks? And what role do HCP play in society when confronted with glaring health disparities and police brutality? The authors propose using care ethics as a theory to view professionalism, as it takes into account broadly encompassing relationships between HCP and society, history and context. Professionalism viewed through a care ethics lens would require professionalism definitions to be expanded to allow for interventions, i.e., not just refrain from doing harm but actively interfere or take action if wrong is being witnessed. Principles related to the primacy of patient welfare need to be re-addressed to prevent systematic self-sacrifice which results in harm to HCP and burnout. Mature care should be a characteristic of professionalism ensuring that HCP care for the sick but be practically wise, highlighting the importance of balancing too little and too much care for self and others. Professionalism needs to be viewed as a bi-directional relational exchange, with society demonstrating solidarity with those providing care. Additionally, given the scale of health disparities, simply stating that HCP need to work towards social justice oversimplifies the problem. Professionalism needs to encompass incorporating critical action and critical pedagogy into health care training and the health care profession to demonstrate solidarity with those impacted by racism.","Zaidi, Zareen; Razack, Saleem; Kumagai, Arno K",Perspectives on medical education,,68

Many EDs have leveraged telehealth to innovatively respond to these challenges. This review describes the landscape of telehealth initiatives in emergency care that have been described during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature using PubMed, supplemented by a review of the gray literature (ie, non-peer reviewed), with input from subject matter experts to identify telehealth initiatives in emergency care during coronavirus disease 2019. We categorized types of telehealth use based on purpose and user characteristics. Results: We included 27 papers from our review of the medical literature and another 8 sources from gray literature review. The vast majority of studies (32/35) were descriptive in nature, with the additional inclusion of 2 cohort studies and one randomized clinical trial. There were 5 categories of ED telehealth use during the pandemic: (1) pre-ED evaluation and screening, (2) within ED (including as a means of limiting staff and patient exposure and facilitating consultation with specialists), (3) post-ED discharge monitoring and treatment, (4) educating trainees and health care workers, and (5) coordinating resources and patient care. Conclusion: Telehealth has been used in a variety of manners during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, enabling innovation in emergency care delivery. The findings from this study can be used by institutions to consider how telehealth may address challenges in emergency care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and beyond. Because few studies included cost data and given the variability in institutional resources, how organizations implement telehealth programs will likely vary. Future work should further explore barriers and facilitators of innovation, and the impact on care delivery and patient outcomes.","Jaffe, T. A.; Hayden, E.; Uscher-Pines, L.; Sousa, J.; Schwamm, L.

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) is, to this day, the preferred methodology for viral RNA detection, even if not without problems. To overcome some of the limitations still existing for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids in various applications, the use of one-step reverse transcription-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) has been established. The purpose of this study was, then, to evaluate the efficacy of ddPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs, optimizing the detection of low-viral load-burdened samples. Methods: The RT-ddPCR workflow was validated for sensitivity, specificity, linearity, reproducibility, and precision using samples from 90 COVID-19-infected patients referred to the Department of Laboratory Medicine of the University Hospital of Udine (Italy). Results: The present study shows that RT-ddPCR allows the detection of as low as 10.3 copies of a SARS-COV-2 E-gene per sample with a higher level of accuracy and precision, especially at low concentration. Conclusion: During the postpeak phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is essential to rely on a highly robust molecular biology method to identify infected subjects, whether they have symptoms or not, in order to prepare appropriate containment measures.","Mio, Catia; Cifù, Adriana; Marzinotto, Stefania; Marcon, Barbara; Pipan, Corrado; Damante, Giuseppe; Curcio, Francesco",Dis Markers,,68

509250,"In Nano, Volume 14, Issue 5",2020,"Based in an interdisciplinary review of the literature on COVID-19 and recent outbreaks, this paper uses pandemics as a lens to examine the socio-ecological resilience of human settlements. This narrative literature review applies the conceptual framework for resilience developed for complex systems to identify five planning and policy issues critical to disease emergence, transmission, and outbreak. First, since urban settlements and activities facilitate pathogen transmission between species, reducing 'shocks' like zoonotic diseases and climate change requires not just prioritizing urbanization patterns and land use in urban policies for environmental health, but also animal rearing practices and biodiversity maintenance. Second, since disease transmission is linked to not just contact rate but also host susceptibility, reducing vulnerability by improving equity in access to essential infrastructures like housing, water, sanitation, healthy food, green/public spaces, healthcare—that impact human health directly and indirectly—is critical. In its absence, curbing disease transmission requires focusing on contact rate suppression, but doing so brings human activity to a halt, decimating the economy and livelihoods. Third, the persistence of many pathogens or their vectors in environmental media suggests that built environment & public health professionals must address maintenance of environmental quality at various scales. Fourth, there is a need for redundancy, be it in commodity supply chains (like PPE, food) or data management for say, monitoring & enforcement of home quarantines during a pandemic. Fifth, while it is crucial to have a centralized response for healthcare, decentralized infrastructure management has been critical during this outbreak: including participatory governance structures to recruit civil society in data collection and self-reporting, reliance on and quick development of mutual aid groups to distribute food and other essential supplies, localized approaches to repurposing infrastructures to create safe public spaces. This application of resilience thinking also evokes the need to study cities as social-ecological systems.","Syal, Shruti",Journal of Urban Management,,68

In addition, a comparison and ordered logit model are constructed to demonstrate the changes and effects of COVID-19. The results suggest that more citizens in Wuhan city will buy fresh food online and the cost and frequency are also increased. The experience of online shopping for fresh food during the lock-down days has promoted more online shopping. The factors, such as frequency of online shopping before the COVID-19 outbreak, frequency of online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic, and age, have a negative effect on the proportion of online shopping after the lock-down days, while the proportion of online shopping before the COVID-19 outbreak, the proportion of online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic, and travel time of in-store shopping before the COVID-19 outbreak have a positive effect.

The accurate, sensitive, and high-throughput detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in municipal wastewater is critical for WBE. Here, we present a novel approach based on multiplexed amplicon-based sequencing, namely the ATOPlex platform, for detecting SARS-CoV-2. The ATOPlex platform is capable of quantifying SARS-CoV-2 RNA at concentrations that are at least 1 order of magnitude lower than the detection limit of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Robust and accurate phylogenetic placement can be done at viral concentrations 4 times lower than the detection limit of RT-qPCR. We further found that the solid fraction in wastewater harbors a considerable amount of viral RNA, highlighting the need to extract viral RNA from the solid and liquid fractions of wastewater.

590376,Engineering a stable CHO cell line for the expression of a MERS-coronavirus vaccine antigen,2018-03-27,"Abstract A role for viral encoded genome-linked (VPg) proteins in translation has often been suggested because of their covalent attachment to the 5′ end of the viral RNA, reminiscent of the cap structure normally present on most eukaryotic mRNAs. We tested the effect of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) VPgPro on translation of reporter RNAs in in vitro translation systems. The presence of VPgPro in either wheat germ extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems lead to inhibition of translation. The inhibition did not appear to be mediated by the interaction of VPg with the eIF(iso)4E translation initiation factor since a VPg mutant that does not interact with eIF(iso)4E still inhibited translation. Monitoring the fate of RNAs revealed that they were degraded as a result of addition of TuMV VPgPro or of Norwalk virus (NV) VPg protein. The RNA degradation was not the result of translation being arrested and was heat labile and partially EDTA sensitive. The capacity of TuMV VPgPro and of (NV) VPg to degrade RNA suggests that these proteins have a ribonucleolytic activity which may contribute to the host RNA translation shutoff associated with many virus infections.","Cotton, Sophie; Dufresne, Philippe J.; Thivierge, Karine; Ide, Christine; Fortin, Marc G.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16647732/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206001838; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206001838,68

In this paper, we aim at evaluating the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the relative containment measures, have had on a real-life sample of patients suffering from substance use disorders (SUDs) and/or behavioral addictions. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was filled out by 153 addicted patients, both outpatients and residential inpatients, recruited across Italy and highly representative of the current Italian population suffering from addictions. Psychopathological burden (anxiety and depressive symptomatology, somatization, irritability, and post-traumatic symptoms), quality of life, and craving changes in daily habits were assessed. RESULTS: In our sample, we found moderate rates of depression (22.9%), anxiety (30.1%), irritability (31.6%), and post-traumatic stress (5.4%) symptoms. Psychopathological burden was globally higher among residential patients. Reported levels of craving were generally low. DISCUSSION: This study is the first attempt to collect Italian data regarding the effects of the rigid quarantine period, during the COVID-19 pandemic, on patients suffering from a SUD and/or behavioral addictions. The presence of a moderate psychopathological burden correlated to poor quality of life and low craving scores represented the main outcomes.

593219,Occurrence of severe gastroenteritis in pups after canine parvovirus vaccine administration: A clinical and laboratory diagnostic dilemma,2007-01-26,"Human societies are structured by what we refer to as ‘institutions’, which are socially created and culturally inherited proscriptions on behaviour that define roles and set expectations about social interactions. The study of institutions in several social science fields has provided many important insights that have not been fully appreciated in the evolutionary human sciences. However, such research has often lacked a shared understanding of general processes of change that shape institutional diversity across space and time. We argue that evolutionary theory can provide a useful framework for synthesizing information from different disciplines to address issues such as how and why institutions change over time, how institutional rules co-evolve with other culturally inherited traits, and the role that ecological factors might play in shaping institutional diversity. We argue that we can gain important insights by applying cultural evolutionary thinking to the study of institutions, but that we also need to expand and adapt our approaches to better handle the ways that institutions work, and how they might change over time. In this paper, we illustrate our approach by describing macro-scale empirical comparative analyses that demonstrate how evolutionary theory can be used to generate and test hypotheses about the processes that have shaped some of the major patterns we see in institutional diversity over time and across the world today. We then go on to discuss how we might usefully develop micro-scale models of institutional change by adapting concepts from game theory and agent-based modelling. We end by considering current challenges and areas for future research, and the potential implications for other areas of study and real-world applications.

595616,Field evaluation of a Mycoplasma bovis bacterin in young dairy calves,2009-05-11,"COVID-19 is one of the biggest challenges that human beings have faced recently. Many researchers have proposed different prediction methods for establishing a virus transmission model and predicting the trend of COVID-19. Among them, the methods based on artificial intelligence are currently the most interesting and widely used. However, only using artificial intelligence methods for prediction cannot capture the time change pattern of the transmission of infectious diseases. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a COVID-19 prediction model based on time-dependent SIRVD by using deep learning. This model combines deep learning technology with the mathematical model of infectious diseases, and forecasts the parameters in the mathematical model of infectious diseases by fusing deep learning models such as LSTM and other time prediction methods. In the current situation of mass vaccination, we analyzed COVID-19 data from January 15, 2021, to May 27, 2021 in seven countries – India, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy. The experimental results show that the prediction model not only has a 50% improvement in single-day predictions compared to pure deep learning methods, but also can be adapted to short- and medium-term predictions, which makes the overall prediction more interpretable and robust.","Liao, Zhifang; Lan, Peng; Fan, Xiaoping; Kelly, Benjamin; Innes, Aidan; Liao, Zhining",Comput Biol Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521006624?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34563855/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521006624,68

597133,Individual sequences in large sets of gene sequences may be distinguished efficiently by combinations of shared sub-sequences,2005-04-08,"Viruses are ubiquitous in the environment. While many impart no deleterious effects on their hosts, several are major pathogens. This risk of pathogenicity, alongside the fact that many viruses can rapidly mutate highlights the need for suitable, rapid diagnostic measures. This review provides a critical analysis of widely used methods and examines their advantages and limitations. Currently, nucleic-acid detection and immunoassay methods are among the most popular means for quickly identifying viral infection directly from source. Nucleic acid-based detection generally offers high sensitivity, but can be time-consuming, costly, and require trained staff. The use of isothermal-based amplification systems for detection could aid in the reduction of results turnaround and equipment-associated costs, making them appealing for point-of-use applications, or when high volume/fast turnaround testing is required. Alternatively, immunoassays offer robustness and reduced costs. Furthermore, some immunoassay formats, such as those using lateral-flow technology, can generate results very rapidly. However, immunoassays typically cannot achieve comparable sensitivity to nucleic acid-based detection methods. Alongside these methods, the application of next-generation sequencing can provide highly specific results. In addition, the ability to sequence large numbers of viral genomes would provide researchers with enhanced information and assist in tracing infections.","Cassedy, A.; Parle-McDermott, A.; O’Kennedy, R.",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33959631/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.637559,68
599090,A numerical method to determine the steady state distribution of passive contaminant in generic ventilation systems,2011-08-15,"BACKGROUND: Having psychologically safe teams can improve learning, creativity and performance within organisations. Within a healthcare context, psychological safety supports patient safety by enabling engagement in quality improvement and encouraging staff to speak up about errors. Despite the low levels of psychological safety in healthcare teams and the important role it plays in supporting patient safety, there is a dearth of research on interventions that can be used to improve psychological safety or its related constructs. This review synthesises the content, theoretical underpinnings and outcomes of interventions which have targeted psychological safety, speaking up, and voice behaviour within a healthcare setting. It aims to identify successful interventions and inform the development of more effective interventions. METHODS: A key word search strategy was developed and used to search electronic databases (PsycINFO, ABI/Inform, Academic search complete and PubMed) and grey literature databases (OpenGrey, OCLC WorldCat, Espace). Covidence, an online specialised systematic review website, was used to screen records. Data extraction, quality appraisal and narrative synthesis were conducted on identified papers. RESULTS: Fourteen interventions were reviewed. These interventions fell into five categories. Educational interventions used simulation, video presentations, case studies and workshops while interventions which did not include an educational component used holistic facilitation, forum play and action research meetings. Mixed results were found for the efficacy or effectiveness of these interventions. While some interventions showed improvement in outcomes related to psychological safety, speaking up and voice, this was not consistently demonstrated across interventions. Included interventions' ability to demonstrate improvements in these outcomes were limited by a lack of objective outcome measures and the ability of educational interventions alone to change deeply rooted speaking up behaviours. CONCLUSION: To improve our understanding of the efficacy or effectiveness of interventions targeting psychological safety, speaking up and voice behaviour, longitudinal and multifaceted interventions are needed. In order to understand whether these interventions are successful, more objective measures should be developed. It is recommended that future research involves end users in the design phase of interventions, target both group and organisational levels, ensure visible leader support and work across and within interdisciplinary teams.

This paper was designed to investigate whether, and to what extent, the consumption of soft drinks and the prevalence of obesity are linked through feedback effects. METHODS: An ecological study design and a simultaneous equation model were used to investigate the existence of a vicious cycle between the consumption of soft drinks and the prevalence of obesity. The analysis was based on a longitudinal dataset covering per capita sales of soft drinks, the age-standardised prevalence rate of obesity and several demographic and socio-economic control variables in a sample of 98 countries worldwide for the period 2005–2019. RESULTS: Using a Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression model with fixed effects, we documented a self-reinforcing process that links consumption and obesity. Changes in the spread of obesity were associated with changes in soft drink consumption: a one-unit increase in the age-adjusted prevalence rate of obesity increased consumption by about 2.39 l per person per year. Similarly, as the consumption of soft drinks rose, so did the prevalence of obesity: the age-adjusted rate of obesity increased by 0.07% for every additional litre consumed per capita. Computing the impact multipliers, we found that the outcome of a one-unit decrease in the average price of soft drinks was twofold: a) the prevalence of obesity increased by around 0.17%; and b) consumption increased by around 2.40 l per person, the sum of the increase directly caused by the price reduction (2 l) and the increase due to the interplay between consumption and obesity (0.4 l). CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified a feedback loop between unhealthy habits (i.e. the consumption of soft drinks) and health outcomes (i.e. the prevalence of obesity). This interplay amplifies the impact of any exogenous changes in the determinants of consumption and obesity. These feedback effects should be considered and exploited in planning effective strategies to tackle the burden of obesity and the global epidemic of non-​communicable diseases.

Methodology A retrospective data analysis was conducted over a 60-day period for patients who visited the Emergency Department of a community hospital. A group of COVID-19-positive patients who received bamlanivimab was compared with another group of COVID-19 patients with similar characteristics, demographics, and disease severity who did not receive the infusion. Data for 30-day hospitalization rates were analyzed using odds ratio for various individual comorbidities. Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze chronic kidney disease (CKD) and mortality. Logistic regression analysis and subsequent odds ratio estimates were used to adjust for demographics and comorbidities and evaluate for the association of bamlanivimab infusion with 30-day hospitalization rates. Results A total of 144 patients were included in the bamlanivimab group and 140 patients in the non-bamlanivimab group of COVID-19 patients. When analyzed by comorbidity using odds ratio analysis, 10.3% of diabetic patients, 6.1% of obese patients, 8% of hypertensive patients, and none of the patients with CKD required hospitalization at 30 days from the initial visit in the bamlanivimab group in contrast to 35.2% of diabetic patients, 38.1% of obese patients, 33.9% of hypertensive patients, and 63.6% of patients with CKD in the non-bamlanivimab group. Logistic regression analysis with odds ratio estimates showed that when adjusted for demographics and various comorbidities, bamlanivimab infusion was associated with decreased hospitalization (p < 0.001; confidence interval [CI] = 0.017-0.135). However, using logistic regression and taking all variables into account, among the evaluated comorbidities, only hypertension was found to be individually associated with decreased hospitalization (p = 0.0174; CI = 0.140-0.827) along with younger age (p = 0.0023; CI = 1.017-1.080) and female gender (p = 0.0077; CI = 0.212-0.789). We could not establish mortality benefit in the subgroups.

Data was collected as a part of a retrospective study on a cohort of COVID-19 positive patients across Mount Sinai Health System from March 28, 2020 to April 26, 2020. Descriptive, comparative, and regression analyses were applied to examine differences between patients with and without cancer in demographic and clinical characteristics and COVID-19 mortality and whether cancer status predicts COVID-19 mortality controlling for these covariates using SAS 9.4. Results showed that, of 4641 patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 5.1% (N=236) had cancer. The median age of the total sample was 58 years (Q1-Q3: 41–71); 55.3% were male, 19.2% were current/former smokers, 6.1% were obese. The most commonly reported comorbidities were hypertension (22.6%) and diabetes (16.0%). Overall, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 8.3%. Examining differences between COVID-19 patients with and without cancer revealed significant differences (p<0.05) in COVID-19 mortality, hospitalization rates, age, gender, race, smoking status, obesity, and comorbidity indicators (e.g., diabetes) with cancer patients more likely to be older, male, black, obese, smokers, and with existing comorbidities. Controlling for these clinical, demographic, and behavioral characteristics, results of logistic regression analyses showed significant effects of older age and male gender on COVID-19 mortality (p<0.05). While cancer patients with COVID-19 were more likely to experience worse COVID-19 outcomes, these associations might be related to common cancer and COVID-19 vulnerability factors such as older age and gender. The coexistence of these vulnerability age and gender factors in both cancer and COVID-19 populations emphasizes the need for better understanding of their implications for cancer and COVID-19 disparities, both diseases prevention efforts, policies, and clinical management.","Mohamed, Nihal E.; Benn, Emma KT.; Astha, Varuna; Shah, Qainat N.; Gharib, Yasmine; Kata, Holden E.; Honore-Goltz, Heather; Dovey, Zachary; Kyprianou, Natasha; Tewari, Ashutosh K.",J Cancer Biol,https://doi.org/10.46439/cancerbiology.2.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34447972/,68

The extremely rapid international spread of the disease with significant morbidity and mortality made finding possible therapeutic interventions a global priority. While approved specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking, a large number of existing drugs are being explored as a possible treatment for COVID-19 infected patients. Recent publications have re-examined the use of Chloroquine (CQ) and/or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential therapeutic option for these patients. In an attempt to explore the evidence that supports their use in COVID-19 patients, we comprehensively reviewed the previous studies which used CQ or HCQ as an antiviral treatment. Both CQ and HCQ demonstrated promising in vitro results, however, such data have not yet been translated into meaningful in vivo studies. While few clinical trials have suggested some beneficial effects of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 patients, most of the reported data are still preliminary. Given the current uncertainty, it is worth being mindful of the potential risks and strictly rational the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients until further high quality randomized clinical trials are available to clarify their role in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.","Hashem, Anwar M.; Alghamdi, Badrah S.; Algaissi, Abdullah A.; Alshehri, Fahad S.; Bukhari, Abdullah; Alfaleh, Mohamed A.; Memish, Ziad A.",Travel Med Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101735; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893920302143; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920302143?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387694/,68
601441,Plant-Based Vaccines: The Way Ahead?,2020-12-22,"The COVID-19 outbreak in Serbia was followed by strict restrictions that negatively affected the economy, particularly small size companies. The complete lockdown and the prohibition of certain services have led to an unstable employment situation. Only several studies investigated the job insecurity and its consequences during COVID-19 pandemic, and some of them highlight the fear of COVID-19 as a significant moderator of mental health. Other studies emphasize the huge effect that intolerance of uncertainty could have in explaining distress, especially during pandemic. In addition, intolerance of uncertainty was considered as a possible moderator of the relationship between the objective and subjective job threat, as well their consequences for mental health. This study aimed to examine the presence of job insecurity and work related distress in Serbia during the first wave of COVID-19. We wanted to measure the effect of the job insecurity on experienced work distress, as well the moderation potential of the intolerance of uncertainty as an individual-level and the fear of coronavirus as a situation-dependent variable. Five hundred and twenty five employed participants took part in an online study during the first wave of coronavirus infection in Serbia. To measure job insecurity, we used Perception of job insecurity scale (PJIS), while distress was assessed with Distress scale from 4DSQ. Fear of COVID-19 was measured on three items. The intolerance of uncertainty was measured by the IUS-11 scale. The results showed that 30.4% of the participants consider their employment as moderately or highly insecure, and 15.1% thought they can lose their jobs. 63.4% of participants expressed increased levels of distress. The moderation analysis revealed that the effect of job insecurity on distress can be moderated by interaction of intolerance of uncertainty and COVID-related fear. In general, distress scores were increasing with increasing job insecurity, intolerance of uncertainty and fear of COVID-19. This pattern is not observed only when fear and intolerance of uncertainty were both low, when job instability could not influence distress. This study also showed that emotional appraisal of the job threat had higher impact on distress than the perceived threat, that shed the light on the importance of considering general resilience capabilities as a protective factor in the work environment in the time of crisis.","Blanuša, Jelena; Barzut, Vesna; Knežević, Jasmina",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177703/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647972,68

Between March 28(th) and July 14(th), international air traffic was interrupted and local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was brought under control, with only 62 cases recorded. The main challenge for reopening the air border without requiring travelers to quarantine on arrival was to limit the risk of re-introducing SARS-CoV-2. Specific measures were implemented, including the obligation for all travelers to have a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 carried out within 3 days before departure, and to perform another RT-PCR testing 4 days after arrival. Because of limitation in available medical staff, travelers were provided a kit allowing self-collection of oral and nasal swabs. In addition to increase our testing capacity, self-collected samples from up to 10 travelers were pooled before RNA extraction and RT-PCR testing. When a pool tested positive, RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed on each individual sample. We report here the results of COVID-19 surveillance (COV-CHECK PORINETIA) conducted between July 15(th), 2020, and February 15(th), 2021, in travelers using self-collection and pooling approaches. We tested 5,982 pools comprising 59,490 individual samples, and detected 273 (0.46%) travelers positive for SARS-CoV-2. A mean difference of 1.17 Ct (CI 95% 0.93–1.41) was found between positive individual samples and pools (N = 50), probably related to the volume of samples used for RNA extraction (200 μL versus 50 μL, respectively). Retrospective testing of positive samples self-collected from October 20(th), 2020, using variants-specific amplification kit and spike gene sequencing, found at least 6 residents infected by the Alpha variant.

However, data on pre-existing disparities in telemedicine utilization is currently lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study: (1) the prevalence of outpatient telemedicine visits before the COVID-19 pandemic by patient subgroups based on age, comorbidity burden, residence rurality, and median household income; and (2) associated diagnosis categories. RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study. SUBJECT: Commercial claims data from the Truven MarketScan database (2014−2018) representing n=846,461,609 outpatient visits. MEASURES: We studied characteristics and utilization of outpatient telemedicine services before the COVID-19 pandemic by patient subgroups based on age, comorbidity burden, residence rurality, and median household income. Disparities were assessed in unadjusted and adjusted (regression) analyses. RESULTS: With overall telemedicine uptake of 0.12% (n=1,018,092/846,461,609 outpatient visits) we found that pre-COVID-19 disparities in telemedicine use became more pronounced over time with lower use in patients who were older, had more comorbidities, were in rural areas, and had lower median household incomes (all trends and effect estimates P<0.001).

603244,The effect of meloxicam on neonatal dairy calves: Immunoglobulin G uptake and preweaning performance,2020-10-09,"Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia (BNP) is a new emerging disease observed since 2007 in Germany and neighbouring countries. The syndrome affects newborn calves and is characterized by pancytopenia, severe bleeding and high lethality. So far, a causative role of infectious or toxic agents has been ruled out. Instead, the syndrome is induced after ingestion of colostrum, the first milk that supplies the calf with maternal antibodies. In analogy to similar diseases in humans it has therefore been postulated that BNP is caused by alloreactive, maternal antibodies. There is a striking association between BNP and a previous vaccination of the respective dams with a particular vaccine against Bovine Virus Diarrhoea (BVD). This association has led to a suspension of the marketing authorisation for the vaccine, by the European Commission. The current study investigates the role of this vaccine in the pathogenesis of BNP. By flow cytometry we were able to demonstrate that sera of BNP dams (dams that gave birth to a BNP calf) harbour alloreactive antibodies binding to surface antigens on bovine leukocytes. A significantly weaker alloreactivity was observed with sera of non-BNP dams that have been vaccinated with the same vaccine but delivered healthy calves. No binding was seen with non-BVD-vaccinated control cows and animals that were vaccinated with other inactivated BVD vaccines so far not associated with BNP. The binding is functionally relevant, because opsonization of bovine leukocytes with alloantibodies led to an elevated cytophagocytosis by bovine macrophages. To test whether the vaccine induces alloreactive antibodies two strategies were employed: Guinea pigs were vaccinated with a panel of commercially available BVD-vaccines. Only the incriminated vaccine induced antibodies binding surface antigens on bovine leukocytes. Additionally, two calves were repeatedly vaccinated with the suspected vaccine and the development of alloreactivity was monitored. In dependence of the number of booster immunizations the induction of alloreactive antibodies could be observed. Finally, by affinity purification we were able to directly demonstrate that BNP associated alloantibodies cross react with the bovine kidney cell line used for vaccine production. Together this provides strong evidence that this particular BVD vaccine has the potential to induce BNP associated alloantibodies.","Bastian, Max; Holsteg, Mark; Hanke-Robinson, Heidrun; Duchow, Karin; Cussler, Klaus",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21605614/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.05.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11007213; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11007213,68
603493,Antiviral activity of fermented foods and their probiotics bacteria towards respiratory and alimentary tracts viruses,2021-04-11,"In the last few decades, there is an increasing emergence and re-emergence of viruses, such as West Nile virus, Enterovirus 71 and henipaviruses that cause epidemic viral encephalitis and other central nervous system (CNS) manifestations. The mortality and morbidity associated with these outbreaks are significant and frequently severe. While aspects of epidemiology, basic virology, etc., may be known, the pathology and pathogenesis are often less so, partly due to a lack of interest among pathologists or because many of these infections are considered “third world” diseases. In the study of epidemic viral encephalitis, the pathologist’s role in unravelling the pathology and pathogenesis is critical. The novel henipavirus infection is a good example. The newly created genus Henipavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae consists of two viruses, viz., Hendra virus and Nipah virus. These two viruses emerged in Australia and Asia, respectively, to cause severe encephalitides in humans and animals. Studies show that the pathological features of the acute encephalitis caused by henipaviruses are similar and a unique dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis-induced microinfarction and parenchymal cell infection in the CNS (mainly neurons) and other organs causes severe tissue damage. Both viruses can cause relapsing encephalitis months and years after the acute infection due to a true recurrent infection as evidenced by the presence of virus in infected cells. Future emerging viral encephalitides will no doubt continue to pose considerable challenges to the neuropathologist, and as the West Nile virus outbreak demonstrates, even economically advanced nations are not spared.","Wong, Kum Thong",Acta Neuropathol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-010-0720-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20652579/,68

The WHO Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Surveillance and Quality Assessment Collaborating Centres Network conducted a survey to assess the effects of COVID-19 on AMR surveillance, prevention and control. METHODS: From October to December 2020, WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) national focal points completed a questionnaire, including Likert scales and open-ended questions. Data were descriptively analysed, income/regional differences were assessed and free-text questions were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Seventy-three countries across income levels participated. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 67% reported limited ability to work with AMR partnerships; decreases in funding were frequently reported by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs; P < 0.01). Reduced availability of nursing, medical and public health staff for AMR was reported by 71%, 69% and 64%, respectively, whereas 67% reported stable cleaning staff availability. The majority (58%) reported reduced reagents/consumables, particularly LMICs (P < 0.01). Decreased numbers of cultures, elective procedures, chronically ill admissions and outpatients and increased ICU admissions reported could bias AMR data. Reported overall infection prevention and control (IPC) improvement could decrease AMR rates, whereas increases in selected inappropriate IPC practices and antimicrobial prescribing could increase rates. Most did not yet have complete data on changing AMR rates due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first survey to explore the global impact of COVID-19 on AMR among GLASS countries. Responses highlight important actions to help ensure that AMR remains a global health priority, including engaging with GLASS to facilitate reliable AMR surveillance data, seizing the opportunity to develop more sustainable IPC programmes, promoting integrated antibiotic stewardship guidance, leveraging increased laboratory capabilities and other system-strengthening efforts.","Tomczyk, Sara; Taylor, Angelina; Brown, Allison; de Kraker, Marlieke E A; El-Saed, Aiman; Alshamrani, Majid; Hendriksen, Rene S; Jacob, Megan; Löfmark, Sonja; Perovic, Olga; Shetty, Nandini; Sievert, Dawn; Smith, Rachel; Stelling, John; Thakur, Siddhartha; Vietor, Ann Christin; Eckmanns, Tim",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkab300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473285/,68

METHODS: An observational, longitudinal study of <65‐year‐old patients with febrile ILI at five medical centers was conducted from 2009 to 2014. Nasopharyngeal specimens obtained at enrollment were first tested by single‐reaction PCR for adenovirus, then further evaluated by a multiplex PCR assay for other respiratory viral pathogens. Symptoms over a 28‐day period were collected. RESULTS: We enrolled 1536 individuals, among whom 43 (2·8%) were positive for adenovirus. The median age of cases was 3·4 years (range: 4 months to 41 years). Three were hospitalized. Species and serotype information was available for 33 (76·7%) cases. Species C (n = 21) was the most common, followed by B3 (n = 9) and one each of E4a, D46, and A. Species C infections were more frequent in children (P < 0·01). Half of the cases were positive for at least one other respiratory viral pathogen. Symptoms were generally mild and most commonly included cough (90%), fatigue (79%), rhinorrhea (74%), loss of appetite (71%), and sore throat (64%). Children with non‐C adenovirus infection were more likely to report sore throat (P = 0·05) and hoarseness (P = 0·06) than those with species C infection. CONCLUSIONS: Adenovirus is frequently detected with other respiratory viruses. Persons with non‐C adenovirus infections reported more severe symptoms, suggesting there may be species‐specific differences in virulence and/or host response to infection.","Koren, Michael A.; Arnold, John C.; Fairchok, Mary P.; Lalani, Tahaniyat; Danaher, Patrick J.; Schofield, Christina M.; Rajnik, Michael; Hansen, Erin A.; Mor, Deepika; Chen, Wei‐Ju; Ridoré, Michelande; Burgess, Timothy H.; Millar, Eugene V.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12392; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27062998/,68

METHODS: A total of 753 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the West Campus of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 22, 2020 to May 7, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were extracted from the electronic medical records of Wuhan Union Hospital and were exhaustively analyzed using R (version 3.6.1). RESULTS: A total of 493 severe and 228 critical cases out of 753 COVID-19 cases were considered in this study. Among the critical cases, the death rate was 79.4%, and age was a risk factor for death. Compared to the severe disease group, the critical disease group had higher white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts and a decreased lymphocyte count at admission. Compared to early death cases (death within 1 week after admission), a more prolonged course of the disease was associated with a higher risk of hypoproteinemia, liver injury, thrombocytopenia, anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), coagulation disorders, acute kidney injury (AKI), and infection. Higher creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were related to early death events, but univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed only LDH as an independent predictor of early death. Notably, anticoagulation therapy was associated with an improved prognosis of critical cases in this cohort. CONCLUSION: Our results showed large differences between patients with severe and critical COVID-19. During the course of COVID-19 in the critical disease group, the incidence of hypoproteinemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorders increased significantly, which highlighted the importance of medical care in the first week after admission. LDH could act as an independent predictor of early death in critical cases, and anticoagulation therapy was correlated with an improved prognosis of patients with critical COVID-19.

Infectious prion proteins are causative agents of many mammalian TSEs, including scrapie (in sheep), chronic wasting disease (in deer and elk), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; in cattle), and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD; in humans). BSE, better known as mad cow disease, is among the many recently discovered zoonotic diseases. BSE cases were first reported in the United Kingdom in 1986. Variant CJD (vCJD) is a disease that was first detected in 1996, which affects humans and is linked to the BSE epidemic in cattle. vCJD is presumed to be caused by consumption of contaminated meat and other food products derived from affected cattle. The BSE epidemic peaked in 1992 and decreased thereafter; this decline is continuing sharply owing to intensive surveillance and screening programs in the Western world. However, there are still new outbreaks and/or progression of prion diseases, including atypical BSE, and iatrogenic CJD and vCJD via organ transplantation and blood transfusion. This paper summarizes studies on prions, particularly on prion molecular mechanisms, BSE, vCJD, and diagnostic procedures. Risk perception and communication policies of the European Union for the prevention of prion diseases are also addressed to provide recommendations for appropriate government policies in Korea.","Lee, Jeongmin; Kim, Su Yeon; Hwang, Kyu Jam; Ju, Young Ran; Woo, Hee-Jong",Osong Public Health Res Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24159531/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrp.2012.12.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221090991200104X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221090991200104X,68

Fats are one of the most important elements in maintaining normal body structure and different methods are used to determine its total amount and distribution. The amount and distribution of abdominal white adipose tissue, and especially the visceral type, provides important parameters in the development assessment of central obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes and other chronic non-infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the amount of visceral adipose tissue in adults who are overweight and then estimate the probability of developing insulin resistance (IR) in those with higher amounts of visceral adipose tissue. Based on a comparison of the amount of visceral adipose tissue and the frequency of IR, evaluate the clinical significance of a routine procedure for body structure assessment in relation to the amount of visceral adipose tissue. METHODS: Subjects were adults of both sexes aged 20 to 77 years, who were patients in two family medicine clinics. Including criteria for the study were: increased body weight (BMI≥25) and normal blood glucose values (4.0 – 5.4 mmol/L). All subjects underwent anthropometric measurements (BMI, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio) and body structure assessment with bioelectrical impedance. According to the values for the amount of visceral adipose tissue (below and above 110 cm(2)), the subjects were divided into two groups. All subjects underwent an IR test. We used the HOMA 1 value of 2 as a cut off for the risk of chronic non- infectious diseases in non-diabetic population. RESULTS: The study included 80 patients. 14 patients did not complete the study, so the total number of subjects was 66 (39 women and 27 men). 36 subjects had elevated values of visceral adipose tissue (over 110 cm(2)). In this group, the presence of IR was registered in 30 patients or 81%. In the control group with a normal amount of visceral adipose tissue, IR was registered in 10 subjects or 33%, which is a statistically significant difference. CONCLUSION: Increased amount of visceral adipose tissue in overweight patients significantly affects the occurrence of IR. For the patients with an increased amount of visceral adipose tissue, it is necessary to introduce intensive preventive measures to stop the development of diabetes and other complications as a result of IR presence.","Salihefendic, Dzenita; Zildzic, Muharem; Masic, Izet",Med Arch,https://doi.org/10.5455/medarh.2020.74.439-446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33603268/,68

Here, we analyse data sampled in a large-scale manner from 379,875 people in the United Kingdom (UK) during 2020 to identify population variables associated with mood and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to investigate self-perceived pandemic impact in relation to those variables. We report that while there are relatively small population-level differences in mood assessment scores pre- to peak-UK lockdown, the size of the differences is larger for people from specific groups, e.g. older adults and people with lower incomes. Multiple dimensions underlie peoples’ perceptions, both positive and negative, of the pandemic’s impact on daily life. These dimensions explain variance in mental health and can be statistically predicted from age, demographics, home and work circumstances, pre-existing conditions, maladaptive technology use and personality traits (e.g., compulsivity). We conclude that a holistic view, incorporating the broad range of relevant population factors, can better characterise people whose mental health is most at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hampshire, Adam; Hellyer, Peter J.; Soreq, Eyal; Mehta, Mitul A.; Ioannidis, Konstantinos; Trender, William; Grant, Jon E.; Chamberlain, Samuel R.",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24365-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34272365/,68

609144,A genomics-based approach to biodefence preparedness,2004,"Chloroquine and related anti-malarial drugs appear to promote apoptosis in T-cells by suppressing NF-kappa-B, which enhances the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2). Thus, chloroquine has found applications in autoimmune diseases where it apparently facilitates apoptosis of abnormally persistent T-cell clones. The mode of action of chloroquine in prevention of malaria is not known, but it may be to minimize replication of the parasite in the liver cells, which occurs before invasion of the erythrocytes, by facilitating premature apoptosis of the infected host cells. After introduction of chloroquine in the 1950s world-wide for prophylactic use, chloroquine-resistant malaria emerged. Here it is hypothesized that concurrent with emergence of chloroquine-resistant malaria (presumably with enhanced anti-apoptotic capabilities), other intracellular parasites have evolved to enhance their ability to prevent apoptosis in host cells. Two examples of viral diseases that have emerged from areas of high incidence of chloroquine-resistant malaria are AIDS from HIV and SARS from coronavirus. The hypothesis holds that prophylactic exposure to pro-apoptotic chloroquine drugs caused natural selection for strains of viruses and other parasites that have enhanced anti-apoptotic abilities. When transmitted to host organisms that are not under the influence of the pro-apoptotic drug, the new “anti-apoptotic” strains may cause unexpected diseases. In the case of SARS, the coronavirus appears to have accessed a new niche where it proves to be lethal to its host. In the case of AIDS, the HIV (which has had a long-term symbiotic relationship with primates) has run amuck because the infected cells are now substantially more tolerant to the toxins (i.e., resistant to apoptosis) that they secrete than the uninfected bystander cells, which are not unusually resistant to apoptosis. A corollary to the hypothesis is that if the level of resistance to apoptosis in the infected cells were no higher than the level of resistance in the bystander cells, then the infected cells would preferentially kill themselves through apoptosis. It appears that in the case of HIV, the increased resistance to apoptosis is provided by expression of Bcl-2 and suppression of p53. Hence, drugs that suppresses Bcl-2 or restore p53 function might be effective in restoring the parity of resistance to apoptosis between infected and uninfected cells. Currently, an antisense drug targeting Bcl-2 (G3139/Genasense(TM), Genta, Inc.) is in late-stage cancer trials and may be on the market for those indications in months. It would be interesting to try these drugs against various intracellular parasites including HIV. This approach to prevent or eliminate active infections might be particularly attractive against a range of parasites (virus, bacteria, protozoa, fungus) when safe and effective vaccines are not available.","Parris, George E",Med Hypotheses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14975502/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987703003815; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987703003815,68

An Acquity UPLC BEH reverse-phase C18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) was used for chromatographic separation of fedratinib and bosutinib (as internal standard (IS) in our study) under a linear gradient elution of the mobile phase, which was composed of solution A (acetonitrile) and solution B (water with 0.1% formic acid), along with 0.40 ml/min flow rate. The analyte and internal standard were measured with electrospray ion source in positive ion mode on a XEVO TQS triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer. The newly developed UPLC-MS/MS assay displayed enough linearity within the concentration range of 0.5–500 ng/ml for calibration curve. The intra- and inter-day of precision and accuracy were evaluated and validated to meet the requirements for the guidelines of bioanalytical assay. In addition, the findings of matrix effect, recovery, and stability were all within the acceptable limits. The new UPLC-MS/MS method was also successfully applied to characterize the pharmacokinetic changes of fedratinib in rats in the present of different antifungal drugs (such as isavuconazole, posaconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole). It turned out that fluconazole resulted in a prominent inhibitory effect on fedratinib metabolism in rats, followed by treatment with itraconazole and isavuconazole. Therefore, the toxicity of fedratinib should be avoided when the concurrent use of fedratinib with CYP3A4 inhibitors may occur.","Tang, Congrong; Niu, Xiaohui; Shi, Lu; Zhu, Huidan; Lin, Guanyang; Xu, Ren-ai",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33613287/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.626897,68

This is commonly done using before-and-after comparisons in which the infectiousness of pre-intervention cases is compared to that of post-intervention cases and the difference is attributed to intervention impact. In this manuscript, we show how a tendency to preferentially observe large outbreaks can lead to consistent overconfidence in how effective these interventions actually are. We show, in particular, that these inferences are highly susceptible to bias when the pathogen under consideration exhibits moderate-to-high amounts of heterogeneity in infectiousness.

This allows a simple assessment of the outdoor versus indoor risk of contamination to be made in a variety of meteorological situations. It is shown quantitatively that for most cases, the outdoor risk is orders of magnitude less than the indoor risk and that it can become comparable only for extremely specific meteorological and topographical situations.

To slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have introduced mobility restrictions, ordered the temporary closure of businesses, and encouraged social distancing. These policies have directly and indirectly influenced travel behaviour, particularly modal preferences. The purpose of this paper to explore modality profiles for non-mandatory trips and analyze how they have changed in response to the pandemic and pandemic-related public health policies. The data used for this study were collected from web-based surveys conducted in the Greater Toronto Area. Modality profiles were identified through the application of latent class cluster analysis, with six modality profiles being identified for both the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. The results indicate that the importance of public transit has declined during the pandemic, while the roles of private vehicles and active modes have become more prominent. However, individuals’ changes in modal preferences vary based on their pre-pandemic modality profile. In particular, it appears that pre-pandemic transit users with access to a private vehicle have substituted public transit for travel by private vehicle, while those without private vehicle access are continuing to use public transit for non-mandatory trips. Consequently, pandemic-related transportation policies should consider those who do not have access to a private vehicle and aim to help those making non-mandatory trips using transit or active modes comply with local public health guidelines while travelling. The results highlight how the changes in modal preferences that occurred due to the pandemic differ among different segments of the population.","Loa, Patrick; Hossain, Sanjana; Mashrur, Sk.

611390,Longitudinal surveillance of rotavirus A genotypes circulating in a high milk yield dairy cattle herd after the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine,2019-02-18,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The role and function of bacteriophages (phages) in the intestine, its health and microbial homeostasis has been underestimated so far. This interdisciplinary review highlights the effect of dietary compounds on phages and puts this into perspective with putative contributions of phages to gastrointestinal diseases, specifically inflammation, infection, and cancer. The review discusses novel fields of opportunities in this context. These include, but are not limited to, perspectives how a better understanding of modulating the activity of specific phages by particular nutritional components may contribute to reorganizing the microbial network, thus supporting in the combat, or even prevention, of inflammation or even cancer in the gut. ABSTRACT: Natural compounds such as essential oils and tea have been used successfully in naturopathy and folk medicine for hundreds of years. Current research is unveiling the molecular role of their antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Nevertheless, the effect of these compounds on bacteriophages is still poorly understood. The application of bacteriophages against bacteria has gained a particular interest in recent years due to, e.g., the constant rise of antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics, or an increasing awareness of different types of microbiota and their potential contribution to gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory and malignant conditions. Thus, a better knowledge of how dietary products can affect bacteriophages and, in turn, the whole gut microbiome can help maintain healthy homeostasis, reducing the risk of developing diseases such as diverse types of gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or even cancer. The present review summarizes the effect of dietary compounds on the physiology of bacteriophages. In a majority of works, the substance class of polyphenols showed a particular activity against bacteriophages, and the primary mechanism of action involved structural damage of the capsid, inhibiting bacteriophage activity and infectivity. Some further dietary compounds such as caffeine, salt or oregano have been shown to induce or suppress prophages, whereas others, such as the natural sweeter stevia, promoted species-specific phage responses. A better understanding of how dietary compounds could selectively, and specifically, modulate the activity of individual phages opens the possibility to reorganize the microbial network as an additional strategy to support in the combat, or in prevention, of gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammation and cancer.","Marongiu, Luigi; Burkard, Markus; Venturelli, Sascha; Allgayer, Heike",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13092036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33922485/,68

These complications require rehabilitative care. Considering the contagious nature of COVID-19 and the necessity to decrease the volume of health care professionals entering confirmed COVID-19 patient rooms and becoming a potential disease vector, can audiovisual technologies employed by telehealth and telerehabilitation help? CASE DESCRIPTION: This case discusses the Baylor Scott and White Institute for Rehab (BSWIR) Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) department COVID-19 acute care therapy team's creation of a telehealth strategy to provide early rehabilitative intervention without increasing the odds of disease transmission. OUTCOMES: The COVID-19 therapy team created a simple process for identifying and triaging care for patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19. These patients were evaluated and treated by the dedicated team using telehealth strategies. A structured risk-benefit analysis was used to determine when in-room care was indicated. DISCUSSION: Acute care physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology telehealth strategies can add value by mitigating COVID-19–related harm and influencing recovery, while not unnecessarily becoming additional disease vectors consuming personal protective equipment. COVID-19 is not only an aggressive respiratory illness similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome but also highly contagious and a risk for health care providers. Telehealth strategies allow therapists to intervene early, opening the possibility to maximize recovery and prevent harm or decompensation. Telehealth strategies can be more prevention-focused while the patient is experiencing relatively good health with goals to maximize strength and endurance before the disease process evolves to critical illness. As COVID-19 progresses, therapy can help mitigate potential complications associated with prolonged intensive care unit stay and ventilator management.","Exum, Emelia; Hull, Brian L.; Lee, Alan Chong W.; Gumieny, Annie; Villarreal, Christopher; Longnecker, Diane",J Acute Care Phys Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192091/; https://doi.org/10.1097/jat.0000000000000143,68

Methods: This is a cross-sectional observational study that collected data from every ED visit from March through June, 2019 and compared it to the same period in 2020. The main ICD-10 code associated with each visit was organized into 1 of 530 disease categories. The top 20 disease categories for 2019 were compared to 2020 to assess for any statistically significant variation in prevalence.

A similar increase in age is noted when the data is divided into minors in 2019 vs 2020 (6.604 vs 6.939 P<.0002) but adults, 18 or older, show no statistically significant change in age.

There was a similar statistically significant decrease in ESI when the data was divided into minors in 2019 vs 2020 (3.419 vs 3.23 P<.0001) and adults in 2019 vs 2020 (3.044 vs 3.024 P<.002). A Z-Test showed a disproportionate decrease in the percentage of minorities coming to the ED from 2019 to 2020 (37.5% vs 36.6%, P<.0232). ED volume rates dropped by 52% in 2020. When comparing disease distribution for minors in 2019 vs 2020, a Z-Test found a statistically significant disproportionate decrease (P>.05) in the diseases under these categories: other specified upper respiratory infections, viral infection, abdominal pain and other digestive/abdomen signs and symptoms, otitis media, nausea and vomiting, intestinal infection, asthma, respiratory signs and symptoms, acute bronchitis, allergic reactions, skin and subcutaneous tissue infections. When comparing disease distribution for adults in 2019 vs 2020, a Z-Test found a statistically significant disproportionate decrease (P <.05) in diseases under these categories: Other specified upper respiratory infections, viral infection, abdominal pain and other digestive/abdomen signs and symptoms, otitis media, nausea and vomiting, intestinal infection, asthma, acute bronchitis Conclusion: National data shows that ED visits decreased significantly in 2020 compared to previous years with certain diseases or disease categories receiving a disproportionate decrease in prevalence. Data from this study shows a similar pattern of certain disease categories having disproportionate decreases in prevalence combined with increased acuity of patients presenting to the ED. While certain disproportionate decreases can be explained by mask mandates, social distancing, stay-at-home orders, and increased access to telemedicine, the authors of this study worry that fears around contracting SARS-COVID-19 kept patients from receiving needed medical care.","Tayyem, Z.; Wojcik, S.; Andonian, D.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064421006442; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064421006442; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.07.085,68

Although in its infancy, an explosion of research on virus–host interactions has already revealed surprising relationships ranging from strictly parasitic to mutualistic, and some others in between. A clearer picture is emerging as regards to our understanding of the full spectrum of these interactions, even with varying experimental approaches and differing opinions on terminology and data interpretation.","Fermin, Gustavo",Viruses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012811257100005X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012811257100005X,68
614482,Determining the dielectric constant of injection-molded polymer-matrix nanocomposites filled with barium titanate,2020-12-24,"Abstract The outbreak of COVID-19 has now created the largest pandemic and the World health organization (WHO) has declared social distancing as the key precaution to confront such type of infections. Most of the countries have taken protective measures by the nationwide lockdown. The purpose of this study is to understand the effect of lockdown on air pollutants and to analyze pre-monsoon (April and May) cloud-to-ground and inter-cloud lightning activity in relation to air pollutants i.e. suspended Particulate matter (PM10), Nitrogen dioxides (NO2) Sulfur dioxide (SO2), Ozone (O3) and Aerosol concentration (AC) in a polluted tropical urban megacities like Kolkata. After the strict lockdown the pollutants rate has reduced by more than 40% from the pre-lockdown period in the Kolkata megacity. So, decreases of PM10, NO2, SO2, O3 and AC have a greater effect on cloud lightning flashes in the pre-monsoon period. In the previous year (2019), the pre-monsoon average result shows a strong positive relation between the lightning and air pollutants; PM10 (R2 = 0.63), NO2 (R2 = 0.63), SO2 (R2 = 0.76), O3 (R2 = 0.68) and AC (R2 = 0.83). The association was relatively low during the lock-down period (pre-monsoon 2020) and the R2 values were 0.62, 0.60, 0.71, 0.64 and 0.80 respectively. Another thing is that the pre-monsoon (2020) lightning strikes decreased by 49.16% compared to the average of previous years (2010 to 2019). The overall study shows that the reduction of surface pollution in the thunderstorm environment is strongly related to the reduction of lightning activity where PM10 and AC are the key pollutants in the Kolkata megacity.","Chowdhuri, Indrajit; Pal, Subodh Chandra; Saha, Asish; Chakrabortty, Rabin; Ghosh, Manoranjan; Roy, Paramita",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720348506; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720348506?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32771791/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141321,68

614746,Green Synthesis of Copper Nanoparticles Using Cotton,2021-06-08,"Kidney transplant (KT) recipients with COVID-19 are at high risk of poor outcomes because of comorbidities and long-term immunosuppressive therapy (IST). There are little data on the effect of IST reduction and early graft function after COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective study on 45 consecutive KT recipients followed at the University Hospital of Modena who tested positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR analysis. We detailed clinical management and outcomes of these patients. Median age of patients was 56.1 (interquartile range, [IQR] 47.3-61.1) years with a predominance of male (64.4%) and patients of Caucasian origin (91.1%). Kidney transplantation vintage was 10.1 (2.7-16) years, and more than half (55.6%) was on triple IST. Therapeutic management included antimetabolite (62.8%) and calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal (22.2%), and suspension of IST in severely ill patients. Of the 45 patients, 88.9% became symptomatic and 40% required hospitalization. Overall mortality accounted for 17.8% (n=8). There were no differences in outcomes between full- and reduced-dose IST at the end of follow-up. Overall, early graft function after COVID-19 showed a stable and unmodified kidney function in 95% of survivors. Risk factors for death were age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.01-1.39), and years spent on immunosuppression (OR: 1.96; 95% CI: 0.38-10.03-4.9). One patient experienced symptomatic reinfection with COVID-19 after primary infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. COVID-19 impacted the graft and general survival of KT recipients. Short-term graft outcome after COVID-19 was favorable in most survivors. Age and transplantation vintage are independent predictors of death in our patients.","Alfano, G.; Damiano, F.; Fontana, F.; Ferri, C.; Giaroni, F.; Melluso, A.; Montani, M.; Morisi, N.; Plessi, J.; Tei, L.; Giovanella, S.; Ligabue, G.; Mori, G.; Guaraldi, G.; Magistroni, R.; Cappelli, G.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.06.21258414; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.06.21258414v1?rss=1,68

615877,Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia: Is this alloimmune syndrome caused by vaccine-induced alloreactive antibodies?,2011-07-18,"Polypropylene (PP) has poor oxygen barrier properties, therefore it is manufactured in a multi-layer structure with other plastics and metals, and has been widely used as a packaging material in various industries from food and beverage to pharmaceuticals. However, multi-layered packaging materials are generally low in recyclability and cause serious environmental pollution, therefore we have faced the challenge of improving the oxygen barrier performance as a uni-material. In this work, PP/nanoclay nanocomposites were prepared at nanoclay contents ranging from 0.8 to 6.4 wt% by the biaxial stretching method, performed through a sequential stretching method. It was observed that, as the draw ratio increased, the behavior of the agglomerates of the nanoclay located in the PP matrix changed and the nanoclay was dispersed along the second stretching direction. Oxygen barrier properties of PP/nanoclay nanocomposites are clearly improved due to this dispersion effect. As the biaxial stretching ratio and the content of nanoclay increased, the oxygen permeability value of the PP/nanoclay nanocomposite decreased to 43.5 cc·mm/m(2)·day·atm, which was reduced by about 64% compared to PP. Moreover, even when the relative humidity was increased from 0% to 90%, the oxygen permeability values remained almost the same without quality deterioration. Besides these properties, we also found that the mechanical and thermal properties were also improved. The biaxially-stretched PP/nanoclay nanocomposite fabricated in this study is a potential candidate for the replacement of the multi-layered packaging material used in the packaging fields.","Jung, Bich-Nam; Jung, Hyun-Wook; Kang, Dong-Ho; Kim, Gi-Hong; Shim, Jin-Kie",Polymers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13162760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34451298/,68
616141,Wastewater Treatment &Water Reclamation☆,2015-12-31,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In March 2020 to reduce the coronavirus spread in Brazil professional regulatory agencies allowed the telemedicine for distance patients’ monitoring. All peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients from our center previously followed monthly in face-to-face visits were monitored by telephone call appointments since then. In this study, we aimed to investigate and compare the hospitalization rates before and during the telehealth assistance. METHOD: Patients aged 18 years and older in March 2020 were included. We analysed total hospitalization rate and PD-related hospitalization rate (infectious, mechanical dysfunction and hypervolemia) 6-month before (first phase) and 6-month after (second phase) telehealth implementation. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were included (male: 45%; age: 56.9 ± 16.2 years old; PD vintage: 15 (7–26) months; automated PD: 97%; diabetes: 45%). There were 15 hospital admissions in 13 patients (2 patients were admitted twice) during the first phase, resulting in an incident rate (IR)=23 per 1000 patients-month. In the second phase, the numbers increased to 34 admissions (3 due to covid-19) in 30 patients (1 patient admitted twice and another four times), IR=56 per 1000 patients-month. The total hospitalization incident rate ratio (IRR) was 2.43 (CI 95% 1.32 – 4.48). The total PD-related hospitalization increased from 4 (3 hypervolemia, 1 mechanical) to 20 (12 infectious, 3 mechanical; 5 hypervolemia) episodes during telehealth assistance, representing 26% to 59% of total hospitalizations. IRR for PD-related hospitalization was 5.5 (CI 95% 1.8 – 16.4). CONCLUSION: After telehealth implementation, the risk of hospitalization raised significantly, mainly due to PD-relates causes that increased 5.5 times. Potential causes of this finding are lack of proper training for distance monitoring to patients and health care workers, life habits and routine of care modifications and social isolation. More studies are needed to assess the independent impact of telehealth on PD patients outcomes.","Calice-Siva, Viviane; Ferreira, Helen; Sevignani, Gabriela; Vieira, Marcos; Vodianitskaia, Raíssa; Nerbass, Fabiana",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab101.0030,68

Factors associated with morbidity and mortality in preweaned dairy heifer calves,2018-06-21,"PURPOSE: There is limited information on how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed health behaviors among cancer patients. We examined the impact of the pandemic on changes in exercise behaviors and identified characteristics associated with these changes among cancer patients. METHODS: Cancer patients (n = 1,361) completed a survey from August-September 2020 to assess COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in health behaviors and psychosocial factors. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: exercising less, exercising did not change, and exercising more. Patient characteristics were compared by exercise groups. RESULTS: One-third of the patients reported a decreased amount of regular exercise, while 11% reported exercising more during the pandemic. Patients who exercised less were more likely to be unemployed/retired, undergoing active treatment, and had increased pandemic-related alcohol consumption and psychosocial stressors such as loneliness and financial stress (all p < 0.05). In contrast, patients who exercised more were younger, female, full-time employed, did not consume alcohol, and had good health status and more social interactions (all p < 0.05). Patients who were living in rural areas and did not experience changes in daily life, were also more likely not to experience changes in exercise habits (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a significant proportion of cancer patients experienced changes in exercise habits during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Age, sex, employment status, health status, alcohol consumption, and psychosocial factors were associated with changes in exercise behaviors. Providers should monitor for changes in health behaviors, such as exercise, because of their importance in improving cancer survivorship.","Himbert, Caroline; Hathaway, Cassandra A.; Daniels, Bailee; Salas, Karen; Ashworth, Anjelica; Gigic, Biljana; Lin, Tengda; Viskochil, Richard; Kirchhoff, Anne C.; Grossman, Douglas; Ose, Jennifer; Tward, Jonathan; Scaife, Courtney; Figueiredo, Jane C.; Toriola, Adetunji T.; Beck, Anna; Shibata, David; Gonzalez, Brian D.; Matsen, Cindy; Christenson, Cristina; Ma, Debra S.; Colman, Howard; Hunt, Jason P.; Jones, Kevin B.; Lee, Catherine J.; Larson, Mikaela; Onega, Tracy; Akerley, Wallace L.; Li, Christopher I.; Schneider, Martin; Penedo, Frank J.; Siegel, Erin M.; Tworoger, Shelley S.; Ulrich, Cornelia M.; Peoples, Anita R.",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-704646/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580667/,68

We aimed to identify the impact of COVID-19 on the disease pattern of OMFS inpatients and surgeries under general anesthesia in a comparative study. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the admission and operating theater records of OMFS patients from Jan 1 to Aug 31 in 2020 and 2019. The total number of cases, presenting disease patterns, and proportion of essential and non-essential medical services were compared between 2020 and 2019. Results: There were 664 admissions and 356 general anesthesia surgical procedures included in this study. Both admission and surgery numbers were significantly reduced in 2020, compared with 2019 (p = 0.012 and 0.007, respectively). The proportion of malignancy cases increased significantly, whereas that of cleft lip and palate and temporomandibular disorder (TMD) decreased. There was a significant increase in the proportion of essential services compared with non-essential services in 2020 compared with 2019. Conclusion: Our results first reported the epidemiological data of the impact of COVID-19 on OMFS disease pattern in a comparative study. The change of disease pattern and caseload will have a long-term impact on OMFS patient care, education, and training during the pandemic.

METHODS: COVID‐19‐infected patients admitted to the San Paolo University Hospital of Milan that underwent a clinically indicated echocardiographic examination were included in the study. To limit contamination, all measurements were performed offline. Quantitative measurements were obtained by an operator blinded to the clinical data. RESULTS: Among the 49 patients, nonsurvivors (33%) had worse respiratory parameters, index of multiorgan failure, and worse markers of lung involvement. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (as assessed by conventional and 2‐dimensional speckle tracking) was a common finding and a powerful independent predictor of mortality. At the ROC curve analyses, RV free wall longitudinal strain (LS) showed an AUC 0.77 ± 0.08 in predicting death, P = .008, and global RV LS (RV‐GLS) showed an AUC 0.79 ± 0.04, P = .004. This association remained significant after correction for age (OR = 1.16, 95%CI 1.01–1.34, P = .029 for RV free wall LS and OR = 1.20, 95%CI 1.01–1.42, P = .033 for RV‐GLS), for oxygen partial pressure at arterial gas analysis/fraction of inspired oxygen (OR = 1.28, 95%CI 1.04–1.57, P = .021 for RV free wall‐LS and OR = 1.30, 95%CI 1.04–1.62, P = .020 for RV‐GLS) and for the severity of pulmonary involvement measured by a computed tomography lung score (OR = 1.27, 95%CI 1.02–1.19, P = .034 for RV free wall LS and OR = 1.30, 95%CI 1.04–1.63, P = .022 for RV‐GLS).

However, limited data exist on ways in which the Canadian health care system utilizes virtual care during disasters or public health emergencies. AIMS: Due to the need for social distancing and reduction of nonessential ambulatory services during the COVID-19 pandemic, the SickKids Chronic Pain Clinic sought to transition care delivery from in person to virtual. The virtual clinic aimed to reduce risks associated with physical contact and environmental exposure without reducing access to care itself. METHODS: Harnessing of various digital tools including Ontario Telemedicine Network Guestlink, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams. The Chronic Pain Clinic Team worked together to communicate with patients and families, schedule virtual visits, establish remote access to clinical data collection tools, digitize the after-visit summary, and add resources on pain self-management to the clinic’s website. RESULTS: The Chronic Pain Clinic successfully transitioned all clinic appointments (multidisciplinary and individual; 77 appointments) over a 2-week period to virtual care. Virtual clinics did not surpass the usual time taken pre-COVID-19, suggesting that the clinic workflow was readily adaptable to virtual care.

METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional study based on the differential analysis and final outcome obtained in patients whose samples underwent laboratory testing for arboviruses at the Pathology Center of the Adolfo Lutz Institute, in São Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: Of the 1355 adults clinically diagnosed with hemorrhagic fever and/or neuroinvasive disease, the most commonly attributed cause of death and the most common final outcome was dengue fever. Almost half of the samples tested negative on all laboratory tests conducted. CONCLUSION: The failure to identify the causative agent in a great number of cases highlights a gap in the diagnosis of deaths of unknown etiology. Additional immunohistochemical and molecular assessments need to be added to the post-mortem protocol if all laboratory evaluations performed fail to identify a causative agent. While part of our findings may be due to technical issues related to sample fixation, better information availability when making the initial diagnosis is crucial. Including molecular approaches might lead to a significant advancement in diagnostic accuracy.","de Araújo, Leonardo José Tadeu; Gonzalez, Lorenzo Lang; Buss, Lewis Fletcher; Guerra, Juliana Mariotti; Gomez, David Salas; Ferreira, Camila Santos da Silva; Cirqueira, Cinthya Santos; Ghillardi, Fábio; Witkin, Steven S.; Sabino, Ester Cerdeira",Revista de saude publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34190890/; https://doi.org/10.11606/s1518-8787.2021055003068,68

We find that intraday return predictability exists in all the markets, but the patterns of predictability differ for each market, with different half-hour returns, not necessarily the first half-hour returns of the trading day, exhibiting significant predictability for their last half-hour counterparts, depending on the specific market. The intraday return predictability is stronger on days of higher volatility and larger jumps. Substantial economic value can be generated by a market timing strategy which is constructed upon the intraday momentum, in all the markets under study. Possible theoretical explanations for the intraday return predictability are infrequent portfolio rebalancing investors and late-informed investors.","Xu, Yahua; Bouri, Elie; Saeed, Tareq; Wen, Zhuzhu",Resources Policy,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030142072030862X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173420/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101830; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142072030862X,68

Over the years, evidence has also shown their efficacy in the prevention of photoaging, dyspigmentation, DNA damage, and photocarcinogenesis. In the USA, most broad-spectrum sunscreens provide protection against ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and short-wavelength ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation. Evidence suggests that visible light and infrared light may play a role in photoaging and should be considered when choosing a sunscreen. Currently, there is a paucity of US FDA-approved filters that provide protection against long UVA (> 370 nm) and none against visible light. Additionally, various sunscreen additives such as antioxidants and photolyases have also been reported to protect against and possibly reverse signs of photoaging.

Our aim was to evaluate reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values among children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 compared with that of adult subjects. METHODS: Patients (from 2 months to ≤18 years of age and adults) with signs and symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection for less than 7 days were prospectively enrolled in the study from May to November 2020. All participants performed RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection; Ct values of ORF1ab, N and S gene targets and the average of all the 3 probes were used as surrogates of viral load. RESULTS: There were 21 infants (2 months to <2 years), 40 children (≥2 to <12 years), 22 adolescents (≥12 to <18 years) and 293 adults of 376 participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. RT-PCR Ct values from all participants less than 18 years of age, as well as from all childhood subgroups, were not significantly different from adults, comparing ORF1ab, N, S and all the gene targets together (P = 0.453).

Possible causes include the spread of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. To characterize the transmission of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, a susceptible, exposed, symptomatic, asymptomatic, hospitalized, and recovered dynamical model was formulated, and a basic analysis of the model is presented including model positivity, boundedness, and stability around the disease-free equilibrium. It is found that the model is locally and globally stable around the disease-free equilibrium when R(0) < 1. The model parameterized from COVID-19 confirmed cases reported by the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia (MOH) from March 02 till April 14, while some parameters are estimated from the literature.

It is the predominant cause of paediatric acquired heart disease in developed countries. Despite 40 years of research, the aetiology of KD remains unknown and consequently there is no diagnostic test and treatment is non-specific and sub-optimal. The consensus is that KD is due to one or more widely distributed infectious agent(s), which evoke an abnormal immunological response in genetically susceptible individuals. The epidemiology of KD has been extensively investigated in many populations and provides much of the supporting evidence for the consensus regarding etiology. These epidemiological data are reviewed here, in the context of the etiopathogenesis.

630595,Bioactive Lipids and Their Derivatives in Biomedical Applications,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Patients admitted with acute tonsillitis generate a substantial workload for the National Health Service (NHS), placing huge financial pressures on an already overstretched budget. OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: Due to the difficulty of accurate diagnosis and varying practices across the UK, there exist a number of controversial areas and non‐standardised practice. These will be highlighted and tackled within this article. TYPE OF REVIEW AND SEARCH STRATEGY: A literature review, last performed in September 2013, searched PubMed citing variations on the areas of controversies with ‘tonsillitis’, ‘pharyngitis’ and ‘pharyngotonsillitis’ – from 1956 to present with language restrictions. Excluded articles included those regarding sore throat after tonsillectomy and peritonsillar abscess. EVALUATION METHOD: Titles and abstracts were initially screened, and full text of potentially relevant articles obtained. The bibliographies of articles were searched for relevant references. The references were then compiled and reviewed independently by two authors (JB & TB), overseen by the senior author (EK). RESULTS: (i) Diagnosis and investigation: Use of the Centor criteria is inadequate within the secondary care setting. Blood testing is unnecessary in the majority of cases where patients do not require admission, as they are unlikely to change management. (ii) Antibiotics: Antibiotics are likely to be indicated in all those presenting to secondary ENT care, with penicillin being the antibiotic of choice for first‐line therapy. (iii) Corticosteroids: Moderate evidence supports the benefit of steroid administration in this patient cohort, advocating a single dose initially followed by reassessment. (iv) Analgesia: Paracetamol and NSAIDs have good evidence of action. Codeine should be used with caution in the paediatric population. (v) Reduced admission rates and early discharge: There is evidence suggesting that a trial of medical therapy prior to admission is beneficial in reducing rates of admission and length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Management of acute tonsillitis within a secondary care setting largely consists of anecdotal or relatively low‐quality evidence. Thus, much evidence from management comes from expert opinion or practice within a primary care setting. Management across the UK can also vary greatly. An evidence‐based review of best practice has been presented here, but further evidence will be required in the future examining the significance of corticosteroids and antibiotic administration in this patient cohort specifically, ensuring practice is evidence based and clinically relevant.","Bird, J.H.; Biggs, T.C.; King, E.V.",Clin Otolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.12299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25418818/,68

Clarification of the immunopathogenesis of different emerging viral infections can provide a plan for the crisis management and prevention of emerging infections. This perspective article describes how an emerging viral infection evolves from microbial mutation, zoonotic and/or vector-borne transmission that progresses to a fatal infection due to overt viremia, tissue-specific cytotropic damage or/and immunopathology. We classified immunopathogenesis of common emerging viral infections into 4 categories: 1) deficient immunity with disseminated viremia (e.g., Ebola); 2) pneumocytotropism with/without later hyperinflammation (e.g., COVID-19); 3) augmented immunopathology (e.g., Hanta); and 4) antibody-dependent enhancement of infection with altered immunity (e.g., Dengue). A practical guide to early blocking of viral evasion, limiting viral load and identifying the fatal mechanism of an emerging viral infection is provided to prevent and reduce the transmission, and to do rapid diagnoses followed by the early treatment of virus neutralization for reduction of morbidity and mortality of an emerging viral infection such as COVID-19.","Yang, Betsy; Yang, Kuender D.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.690976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335596/,68

In order to better understand the mode of the action of the most active compounds, molecular modeling was used. It confirmed that aminophosphonic portion of the enzyme is bound nearly identically in the case of all the studied compounds, whereas the difference in activity results from the placement of aromatic side chain of an inhibitor.

633380,Three-component synthesis of new unsymmetrical oxindoles via Friedel–Crafts type reaction,2011-05-27,"The interferon (IFN)-γ-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) system directs transcript-selective translational control of functionally-related genes. In myeloid cells, IFN-γ induces formation of a multiprotein GAIT complex that binds structural GAIT elements in the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of multiple inflammation-related mRNAs, including ceruloplasmin and VEGF-A, and represses their translation. The human GAIT complex is a heterotetramer containing glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS), NS1-associated protein 1 (NSAP1), ribosomal protein L13a (L13a), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). A network of IFN-γ-stimulated kinases regulates recruitment and assembly of GAIT complex constituents. Activation of Cdk5, mTORC1, and S6K1 kinases induces EPRS release from its parental multi-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex to join NSAP1 in a “pre-GAIT” complex. Subsequently, the DAPK-ZIPK kinase axis phosphorylates L13a, inducing release from the 60S ribosomal subunit and binding to GAPDH. The subcomplexes join to form the functional GAIT complex. Each constituent has a distinct role in the GAIT system. EPRS binds the GAIT element in target mRNAs, NSAP1 negatively regulates mRNA binding, L13a binds eIF4G to block ribosome recruitment, and GAPDH shields L13a from proteasomal degradation. The GAIT system is susceptible to genetic and condition-specific regulation. An N-terminus EPRS truncate is a dominant-negative inhibitor ensuring a “translational trickle” of target transcripts. Also, hypoxia and oxidatively-modified lipoproteins regulate GAIT activity. Mouse models exhibiting absent or genetically-modified GAIT complex constituents are beginning to elucidate the physiological role of the GAIT system, particularly in the resolution of chronic inflammation. Finally, GAIT-like systems in proto-chordates suggests an evolutionarily conserved role of the pathway in innate immunity.","Arif, Abul; Yao, Peng; Terenzi, Fulvia; Jia, Jie; Ray, Partho Sarothi; Fox, Paul L.",Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA,https://doi.org/10.1002/wrna.1441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29152905/,68
633605,Veterinary Experiences can Inform One Health Strategies for Animal Coronaviruses,2021-09-20,"Abstract Here we review the evolving story of the coronavirus endoribonuclease (EndoU). Coronavirus EndoU is encoded within the sequence of nonstructural protein (nsp) 15, which was initially identified as a component of the viral replication complex. Biochemical and structural studies revealed the enzymatic nature of nsp15/EndoU, which was postulated to be essential for the unique replication cycle of viruses in the order Nidovirales. However, the role of nsp15 in coronavirus replication was enigmatic as EndoU-deficient coronaviruses were viable and replicated to near wild-type virus levels in fibroblast cells. A breakthrough in our understanding of the role of EndoU was revealed in recent studies, which showed that EndoU mediates the evasion of viral double-stranded RNA recognition by host sensors in macrophages. This new discovery of nsp15/EndoU function leads to new opportunities for investigating how a viral EndoU contributes to pathogenesis and exploiting this enzyme for therapeutics and vaccine design against pathogenic coronaviruses.","Deng, Xufang; Baker, Susan C.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29307596/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217304373; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.12.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217304373,68

We tested (i) whether older and younger adults differed in taking coronavirus-related health risks, (ii) whether there are age differences in coronavirus risk, risk attitude and numerical ability and (iii) whether these age differences in coronavirus risk, attitude and numerical ability are related to coronavirus risk-taking. The study was observational, with measures presented to all participants in random order. A sample of 469 participants reported their coronavirus-related risk-taking behaviour, objective risk, risk attitude towards health and safety risks, numerical ability and risk perception. Our findings show that age was significantly related to coronavirus risk-taking, with younger adults taking more risk, and that this was partially mediated by higher numeracy, but not objective risk or risk attitude. Exploratory analyses suggest that risk perception for self and others partially mediated age differences in coronavirus risk-taking. The findings of this study may better our understanding of why age groups differ in their adoption of protective behaviours during a pandemic and contribute to the debate whether age differences in risk-taking occur due to decline in abilities or changes in risk attitude.","Wolfe, Kelly; Sirota, Miroslav; Clarke, Alasdair D.

637662,Spectrum of virucidal activity from ultraviolet to infrared radiation,2020-10-27,"Early diagnosis and assessment of fatal diseases and acute infections on chest X-ray (CXR) imaging may have important therapeutic implications and reduce mortality. In fact, many respiratory diseases have a serious impact on the health and lives of people. However, certain types of infections may include high variations in terms of contrast, size and shape which impose a real challenge on classification process. This paper introduces a new statistical framework to discriminate patients who are either negative or positive for certain kinds of virus and pneumonia. We tackle the current problem via a fully Bayesian approach based on a flexible statistical model named shifted-scaled Dirichlet mixture models (SSDMM). This mixture model is encouraged by its effectiveness and robustness recently obtained in various image processing applications. Unlike frequentist learning methods, our developed Bayesian framework has the advantage of taking into account the uncertainty to accurately estimate the model parameters as well as the ability to solve the problem of overfitting. We investigate here a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimator, which is a computer–driven sampling method, for learning the developed model. The current work shows excellent results when dealing with the challenging problem of biomedical image classification. Indeed, extensive experiments have been carried out on real datasets and the results prove the merits of our Bayesian framework.","Bourouis, Sami; Alharbi, Abdullah; Bouguila, Nizar",J Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34460578/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jimaging7010007,68

The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of insomnia and explore its associations in the general population of Qatar. With almost 100 nationalities, Qatar is one of the most culturally diverse, richest, and fastest developing countries in the Arabian Peninsula. METHODS: A probability sample of community-dwelling adults were surveyed in February of 2019. A total of 1611 respondents completed face-to-face interviews in Arabic or English. Logistic regression modeled associations with insomnia, our dependent variable, as defined by a score of ≤16 on the eight-item Sleep Condition Indicator or according to criteria for insomnia in the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition or DSM-5. RESULTS: Approximately, 5.5% of the sample screened positive for insomnia and the 30-day prevalence of those who met all the DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder was 3.0%. In addition, 2.0% of the sample screened positive for depression and 3.4% for anxiety in the past 2 weeks. Multivariable analysis showed the following were significantly associated with insomnia: Arab ethnicity, young age, unemployment, being married, having less than high school education, fair or poor health, anxiety, and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia prevalence was in the lower range of previously reported DSM-defined estimates from developed Western countries. Our findings highlight the need for raising awareness and improving sleep hygiene in potential risk groups such as younger adults and those of Arab ethnicity, in addition to incorporating insomnia screening in the provision of mental health services.

We created high-resolution maps of DHSs from 733 human biosamples encompassing 438 cell and tissue types and states, and integrated these to delineate and numerically index approximately 3.6 million DHSs within the human genome sequence, providing a common coordinate system for regulatory DNA. Here we show that these maps highly resolve the cis-regulatory compartment of the human genome, which encodes unexpectedly diverse cell- and tissue-selective regulatory programs at very high density. These programs can be captured comprehensively by a simple vocabulary that enables the assignment to each DHS of a regulatory barcode that encapsulates its tissue manifestations, and global annotation of protein-coding and non-coding RNA genes in a manner orthogonal to gene expression. Finally, we show that sharply resolved DHSs markedly enhance the genetic association and heritability signals of diseases and traits. Rather than being confined to a small number of distal elements or promoters, we find that genetic signals converge on congruently regulated sets of DHSs that decorate entire gene bodies. Together, our results create a universal, extensible coordinate system and vocabulary for human regulatory DNA marked by DHSs, and provide a new global perspective on the architecture of human gene regulation.","Meuleman, Wouter; Muratov, Alexander; Rynes, Eric; Halow, Jessica; Lee, Kristen; Bates, Daniel; Diegel, Morgan; Dunn, Douglas; Neri, Fidencio; Teodosiadis, Athanasios; Reynolds, Alex; Haugen, Eric; Nelson, Jemma; Johnson, Audra; Frerker, Mark; Buckley, Michael; Sandstrom, Richard; Vierstra, Jeff; Kaul, Rajinder; Stamatoyannopoulos, John",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32728217/,68

Seasonal synchrony of other infectious diseases is less known. We describe the seasonality and seasonal synchrony of three common childhood infectious diagnoses among three regions in Taiwan. METHODS: A large, nationally representative sample of young children (N = 128 651, age 0–4 years) was used to estimate the monthly incidences of acute respiratory infection, acute intestinal infection, and herpangina and hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in three regions of Taiwan between 2000 and 2005. Seasonality of monthly incidences was indicated by year-on-year intra-class correlations (ICCs). Between-region ICCs were used to describe seasonal synchrony of incidences between regions. RESULTS: We found evidence of seasonality in all three infectious diagnoses (p < 0.05). Seasonal synchrony among the three regions was highest for acute respiratory infection (between-region ICC 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87–0.94), followed by herpangina and HFMD (between-region ICC 0.85, 95% CI 0.80–0.90), and acute intestinal infection (between-region ICC 0.69, 95% CI 0.59–0.79).

Subsequently, polarized entry into and release from both Vero E6 and IECs was analyzed. PEDV entry into polarized cells and pAPN grown on membrane inserts occurs via apical membrane. The progeny virus released into the medium was also quantified which demonstrated that PEDV is preferentially released from the apical membrane. Collectively, our data demonstrate that pAPN, the cellular receptor for PEDV, mediates polarized PEDV infection. These results imply the possibility that PEDV infection may proceed by lateral spread of virus in intestinal epithelial cells.","Cong, Yingying; Li, Xiaoxue; Bai, Yunyun; Lv, Xiaonan; Herrler, Georg; Enjuanes, Luis; Zhou, Xingdong; Qu, Bo; Meng, Fandan; Cong, Chengcheng; Ren, Xiaofeng; Li, Guangxing",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25681796/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268221500032X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.01.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268221500032X,68

However, an unexpected dengue outbreak occurred in 2014 in Japan. Given that autochthonous (domestic) dengue cases had not been reported for the past 70 years in Japan, this outbreak was highly unusual and suggests that several environmental factors might have changed in a way that favors vector mosquitoes in the Northeast Asian region. METHODS: A Climate Risk Factor (CRF) index, as validated in previous work, was constructed using climate and non-climate factors. This CRF index was compared to the number of reported dengue cases in Tokyo, Japan where the outbreak was observed in 2014. In order to identify high-risk areas, the CRF index was further estimated at the 5 km by 5 km resolution and mapped for Japan and South Korea. RESULTS: The high-risk areas determined by the CRF index corresponded well to the provinces where a high number of autochthonous cases were reported during the outbreak in Japan. At the provincial-level, high-risk areas for dengue fever were the Eastern part of Tokyo and Kanakawa, the South-Eastern part of Saitama, and the North-Western part of Chiba. While a relatively small number of high-risk areas were identified in South Korea compared with Japan, the high-risk areas in South Korea include popular tourist destinations where international visitors have been increasing. CONCLUSION: The recent dengue outbreak in Japan may signal that the two adjacent non-dengue-endemic countries are also exposed to the risk of temporal and sporadic behavior of dengue fever. It is critical to understand potential high-risk areas for future outbreaks and to set up appropriate prevention activities at the governmental-level.","Lee, Jung-Seok; Farlow, Andrew",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296193/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7282-3,68

Wuhan is the disaster area, where the number of cases has increased rapidly. However, the current measures of infected patients in Wuhan are still underestimated. ObjectiveTo estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan from several sampled data. The correct estimated infected patients can be helpful for the government to arrange the needed beds in hospital wards to meet the actual needs. DesignWe proposed to use the sampling survey to estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan. The sampling survey is a kind of non-comprehensive survey. It selected some units from all the survey objects to carry out the survey and made the estimation and inference to all the survey objects. Sampling surveys can obtain information that reflects the overall situation, although it is not a comprehensive survey. SettingWe estimated the overall infection rate in Wenzhou city, which has a better data collection system. Simultaneously, another different samples of Wuhan tourists to Singapore will be used to validate the infection rate in Wenzhou city. Combined these two samples, we give the estimation of the number of infected patients in Wuhan and other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province. ParticipantsThe number of people who returned from Wuhan to Wenzhou was selected from the daily notification of the pneumonia epidemic caused by a new coronavirus infection in the city. Exposures for observational studiesThe daily rate of the pneumonia epidemic caused by the new coronavirus infection in Wenzhou City. The numerator is the number of people diagnosed and whether each person diagnosed had a history of living in Wuhan. The denominator is the total number of people returning to Wenzhou from Wuhan. Based on this rate, it is reasonable to predict the number of the infected patients.

648179,Overlapping synthetic peptides as vaccines,2006-09-11,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus is rapidly spreading over the world and puts the health systems of countries under intense pressure. High hospitalization levels due to the pandemic outbreak have caused the intensive care units to work above capacity. PURPOSE: A data envelopment analysis (DEA) based modelling approach was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of regions (i.e. city, country or clinical commissioning groups) against the pandemic outbreak. The objective is to enable related authorities better manage the struggle against the outbreak and put in place the emergency action plans immediately. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: DEA method was used to measure the efficiency scores of countries. Super efficiency DEA method was also applied to countries based on the level of efficiencies they have achieved. Sixteen countries were selected that have been facing with Covid19 pandemic outbreak for at least 5 consecutive weeks after their 100th confirmed case. RESULTS: A total of 80 DEA models were developed, that is, 16 DEA models for each week. The percentage of efficient countries decreased dramatically over time, from 43.75% in the first week to 25% in the fifth week. Unlike most European countries, China and South Korea increased their effectiveness after first week of implementing all the necessary measures. CONCLUSION: This study sheds light into better understanding the effectiveness of policies adopted by countries and their management strategy in dealing with Covid19 pandemic. Our model will enable political leaders to identify inadequate policies as quickly as possible and learn from their peers for more effective decisions.","Ordu, Muhammed; Kirli Akin, Hediye; Demir, Eren",Int J Health Plann Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33934402/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3187,68

The model assumes two types of response to the app notification: the notified individuals quarantine themselves (type-Q response) or they get tested (type-T response). The results reveal some crucial characteristics of the apps. First, type-Q response is successful in achieving containment; however, type-T response has a limited curve-flattening effect. Second, type-Q response performs better than type-T response because it involves quarantine of those who are infected but have not become infectious yet, and the current testing technology cannot detect the virus in these individuals. Third, if the download rate of the apps is extremely high, type-Q response can achieve virus containment with a small number of quarantined people and thereby high efficiency. Finally, given a fixed download rate, increasing the number of tests per day enhances the effectiveness of the apps, although the degree of improved effectiveness is not proportional to the change in the number of tests.","Chiba, Asako",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34469429/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256151,68

Sci. 9/2005,2005-11-22,"Viral infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell hematopoietic transplantation (allo-HSCT). Although most viral infections present with asymptomatic or subclinical manifestations, viruses may result in fatal complications in severe immunocompromised recipients. Reactivation of latent viruses, such as herpesviruses, is frequent during the immunosuppression that occurs with allo-HSCT. Viruses acquired from community, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses, are also important pathogens of post-transplant viral diseases. Currently, molecular diagnostic methods have replaced or supplemented traditional methods, such as viral culture and antigen detection, in diagnosis of viral infections. The utilization of polymerase chain reaction facilitates the early diagnosis. In view of lacking efficacious agents for treatment of viral diseases, prevention of viral infections is extremely valuable. Application of prophylactic strategies including preemptive therapy reduces viral infections and diseases. Adoptive cellular therapy for restoring virus-specific immunity is a promising method in the treatment of viral diseases.","Lin, Ren; Liu, Qifa",J Hematol Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24341630/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-8722-6-94,68

A randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled study was done. Forty COVID-19 patients were included into two groups of nano-curcumin and placebo. The nano-curcumin group received 40 mg of nano-curcumin capsule, four times per day for 2 weeks. Clinical signs and gene expression of TBX21, GATA3, RORC and FOXP3 genes and IFN-Î³, IL-4, IL-17 and TGF-ß cytokines serum levels were measured at time points of 0, 7 and 14 days. Serum levels of IFN-Î³ (p = .52) and IL-17 (p = .11) decreased, while IL-4 (p = .12) and TGF-ß (p = .14) increased in the nano-curcumin group compared with placebo on day 14. Moreover, gene expressions of TBX21 (p = .02) and FOXP3 (p = .005) genes were significantly decreased and increased between nano-curcumin and placebo groups on day 7, respectively. It can be concluded that administration of nano-curcumin in inflammatory phase of COVID-19 can accelerate recovering of the acute inflammatory phase by modulating inflammatory immune responses. Therefore, it is suggested that this supplement in inflammatory diseases, including COVID-19, can be effective in controlling the inflammatory responses.","Hassaniazad, Mehdi; Eftekhar, Ebrahim; Inchehsablagh, Behnaz Rahnama; Kamali, Hossein; Tousi, Abdolali; Jaafari, Mahmoud Reza; Rafat, Milad; Fathalipour, Mohammad; Nikoofal-Sahlabadi, Sara; Gouklani, Hamed; Alizade, Hesam; Nikpoor, Amin Reza",Phytother. res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34541720/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.7294,68

So, we compared antibody results of eight kinds of commercial immunoassays using clinical remnant specimens. METHODS: We compared the results of several immunoassay kits tested on 40 serum samples from 15 confirmed patients and 86 remnant serum samples from clinical laboratory. Eight kinds of IVD kits—four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, two lateral flow rapid immunochromatographic assays, and two chemiluminescent immunoassays with one RUO kit were tested. RESULTS: Among 40 serum samples from 15 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, 35 yielded at least one positive result for detecting antibodies in the combined assessment. There were inconsistent results in 12 (28%) samples by single immunoassay. Forty samples collected in 2019 before the first COVID-19 Korean case showed negative results except for one equivocal result. CONCLUSION: The discrepant results obtained with different immunoassay kits in this study show that serological assessment of SARS-CoV-2 by a single immunoassay requires caution not only in detecting infection but also in assessing immunologic status.","Lee, Sun Min; Kim, In-Suk; Lim, Seungjin; Lee, Su Jin; Kim, Won-Joo; Shin, Kyung-Hwa; Moon, Soo Young; Chang, Chulhun L.",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e64; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33686810/,68

Abnormal hematological findings are thought to have a role in early risk stratification and prognostication of COVID-19 patients. However, the data on hematological abnormalities associated with the disease among Ethiopian COVID-19 patients are limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine the magnitude of hematological abnormalities among COVID-19 patients admitted at Millennium COVID-19 referral treatment center, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 referral treatment center from May to July, 2020. A total of 334 COVID-19 patients were included using convenience sampling. Socio-demographic data and disease severity status of admitted patients were recorded. Three milliliters of venous blood was collected and analyzed by Beckman Coulter DXH-600 automated analyzer to determine complete blood count (CBC). The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23 software. Association of age, sex, and disease severity with hematological abnormalities was analyzed using binary logistic regression. An odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were used to measure the strength of association. P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 334 admitted COVID-19 patients, the majority were males (62.3%) and 69.8% had moderate disease conditions. The overall magnitude of any cytopenia and pancytopenia was 41% and 1.8%, respectively. The magnitude of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia was 24.9%, 21.6%, and 5.4%, respectively. Lymphopenia (72.2%) was the most common hematological abnormality. COVID-19 patients with severe and critical disease were more likely to develop anemia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and combined neutrophilia-lymphopenia than those with moderate disease condition, with a significant association. CONCLUSION: Lymphopenia was the most common hematological abnormality observed among COVID-19 patients. Hematological abnormalities such as anemia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and combined neutrophilia-lymphopenia were significantly associated with disease severity. Monitoring and evaluation of hematological parameters could provide prognostic insight into the management and risk stratification of COVID-19 patients.

Due to insufficient study to examine health behaviours as risk factors of COVID-19 infection, we conducted municipal level spatial analysis to investigate association between health behaviours and COVID-19 incidence. METHODS: We extracted cumulative COVID-19 incidence data from January 20(th) 2020 to February 25(th) 2021, health behaviours, health condition, socio-economic factors, and covariates in municipal level from publicly available dataset. We chose variables, which were standardized, considering multicollinearity (VIF<10). Further, we employed bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model with intrinsic conditional autoregressive (iCAR) and Besag, York and Mollié (BYM) model, and used deviance information criterion (DIC) for final model selection. RESULTS: The mean cumulative COVID-19 incidence per 10,000 population among 229 municipality was 13.73 (Standard deviation=11.43). iCAR model (DIC=2,825.3) outperformed BYM model (DIC=14,009.4). The results of iCAR model highlighted that incidence was associated with dental hygiene practice (incidence risk ratios [IRR]=0.92, 95% Credible Interval [CI]=0.85–1.00), whether tried to be thin (IRR=1.10, 95% CI = 1.00–1.20), proportion of medical personnel (IRR=1.09, 95% CI = 1.01–1.17), and volume of public transportation (IRR=1.19, 95% CI = 1.05–1.35), even after adjusting for various confounding factors.

The main factor known to determine their delivery efficiency is the pKa of the LNP containing an ionizable lipid. Herein, we report a method that can predict the LNP pKa from the structure of the ionizable lipid. We used theoretical, NMR, fluorescent-dye binding, and electrophoretic mobility methods to comprehensively measure protonation of both the ionizable lipid and the formulated LNP. The pKa of the ionizable lipid was 2-3 units higher than the pKa of the LNP primarily due to proton solvation energy differences between the LNP and aqueous medium. We exploited these results to explain a wide range of delivery efficiencies in vitro and in vivo for intramuscular (IM) and intravascular (IV) administration of different ionizable lipids at escalating ionizable lipid-to-mRNA ratios in the LNP. In addition, we determined that more negatively charged LNPs exhibit higher off-target systemic expression of mRNA in the liver following IM administration. This undesirable systemic off-target expression of mRNA-LNP vaccines could be minimized through appropriate design of the ionizable lipid and LNP.","Carrasco, Manuel J.; Alishetty, Suman; Alameh, Mohamad-Gabriel; Said, Hooda; Wright, Lacey; Paige, Mikell; Soliman, Ousamah; Weissman, Drew; Cleveland, Thomas E.; Grishaev, Alexander; Buschmann, Michael D.",Commun Biol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02441-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381159/,68

For both viruses two regions of their genomic RNAs were found to be duplicated and rearranged. The viral genomes contain a small duplicated element (SD) derived from the genomic 5' end far downstream of its original context. This sequence is followed by a larger duplication which encompasses the region coding for the protein p80(LD), a molecular marker for cpBVDV. The SD element codes for the viral protease p20. In the case of the viruses analyzed here the aminoterminus of p80 is generated by autoproteolytic removal of the preceding SD-encoded protease. For one of the cpBVDV isolates a specific fusion protein (p28) could be identified which is composed of p20 and part of p10, another viral protein. Molecular characterization of the respective noncytopathogenic counterpart revealed that duplication and rearrangement of sequences as well as the expression of p28 and p80 are specific for the cytopathogenic virus.","Meyers, Gregor; Tautz, Norbert; Stark, Robert; Brownlie, Joe; Dubovi, Edward J.; Collett, Marc S.; Thiel, Heinz-Jürgen",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1329326/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290199Y; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290199Y,68

The ongoing debate highlights the challenges of the adoption of data-driven innovation. We reflect on how to ensure an appropriate level of protection of individual data and how to maximize public health benefits that can be derived from the collected data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze available COVID-19 contact tracing apps and verify to what extent public health interests and data privacy standards can be fulfilled simultaneously in the process of the adoption of digital health technologies. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed and MEDLINE databases, as well as grey literature, was performed to identify available contact tracing apps. Two checklists were developed to evaluate (1) the apps’ compliance with data privacy standards and (2) their fulfillment of public health interests. Based on both checklists, a scorecard with a selected set of minimum requirements was created with the goal of estimating whether the balance between the objective of data privacy and public health interests can be achieved in order to ensure the broad adoption of digital technologies. RESULTS: Overall, 21 contact tracing apps were reviewed. In total, 11 criteria were defined to assess the usefulness of each digital technology for public health interests. The most frequently installed features related to contact alerting and governmental accountability. The least frequently installed feature was the availability of a system of medical or organizational support. Only 1 app out of 21 (5%) provided a threshold for the population coverage needed for the digital solution to be effective. In total, 12 criteria were used to assess the compliance of contact tracing apps with data privacy regulations. Explicit user consent, voluntary use, and anonymization techniques were among the most frequently fulfilled criteria. The least often implemented criteria were provisions of information about personal data breaches and data gathered from children. The balance between standards of data protection and public health benefits was achieved best by the COVIDSafe app and worst by the Alipay Health Code app. CONCLUSIONS: Contact tracing apps with high levels of compliance with standards of data privacy tend to fulfill public health interests to a limited extent. Simultaneously, digital technologies with a lower level of data privacy protection allow for the collection of more data. Overall, this review shows that a consistent number of apps appear to comply with standards of data privacy, while their usefulness from a public health perspective can still be maximized.","Kolasa, Katarzyna; Mazzi, Francesca; Leszczuk-Czubkowska, Ewa; Zrubka, Zsombor; Péntek, Márta",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://doi.org/10.2196/23250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34033581/,68

METHODS: According to individual patient preference or the organizational decision of the center, patients were assigned to the home‐delivery group or the standard in‐clinic delivery group. In the former case, patients received telephone training on the activation process and use of the communicator. In June 2020, the centers were asked to reply to an ad hoc questionnaire to describe and evaluate their experience in the previous 3 months. RESULTS: RM was activated in 1324 patients: 821 (62%) received the communicator at home and the communicator was activated remotely. Activation required one additional call in 49% of cases, and the median time needed to complete the activation process was 15 min [25th‐75th percentile: 10–20]. 753 (92%) patients were able to complete the correct activation of the system.

The service was generally deemed useful (96% of respondents) in facilitating the activation of RM during the COVID‐19 pandemic and possibly beyond. CONCLUSIONS: Home delivery of the communicator proved to be a successful approach to system activation, and received positive feedback from clinicians. The increased use of a RM protocol will reduce risks for both providers and patients, while maintaining high‐quality care.","Magnocavallo, Michele; Bernardini, Alessia; Mariani, Marco Valerio; Piro, Agostino; Marini, Massimiliano; Nicosia, Antonino; Adduci, Carmen; Rapacciuolo, Antonio; Saporito, Davide; Grossi, Stefano; Santarpia, Giuseppe; Vaccaro, Paola; Rordorf, Roberto; Pentimalli, Francesco; Giunta, Giuseppe; Campari, Monica; Valsecchi, Sergio; Lavalle, Carlo",Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33908052/; https://doi.org/10.1111/pace.14251,68
660849,Pattern transitions in spatial epidemics: Mechanisms and emergent properties,2016-08-09,"Governments around the world have faced the challenge of how to respond to the recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Some have reacted by greatly restricting the freedom of citizens, while others have opted for less drastic policies. In this paper, I draw a parallel with vaccination ethics to conceptualize two distinct approaches to COVID-19 that I call altruistic and lockdown. Given that the individual measures necessary to limit the spread of the virus can in principle be achieved voluntarily as well as through enforcement, the question arises of how much freedom governments ought to give citizens to adopt the required measures. I argue that an altruistic approach is preferable on moral grounds: it preserves important citizen freedoms, avoids a number of potential injustices, and gives people a much-needed sense of meaning in precarious times.","Kraaijeveld, Steven R.",Asian Bioeth Rev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41649-020-00154-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33262838/,68

We hypothesized that pandemic mitigation measures might reduce sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening and/or transmission. METHODS: We used King County, WA STI surveillance and sexual health clinic (SHC) data from January 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. We calculated mean weekly case counts for gonorrhea, primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, male urethral gonorrhea, and early latent (EL) syphilis for 3 periods in 2020: pre-SHSH (January 1–March 23), SHSH (March 24–June 5), and reopening (June 6–July 31). Primary and secondary syphilis and male urethral gonorrhea were used as proxies for sexual behavior, and EL syphilis was used as a proxy for STI screening. We compared SHC visits (2019 vs. 2020) and SHC gonorrhea treatment practices (across 2020 periods). RESULTS: Compared with January to July 2019, from January to July 2020, reported cases of gonorrhea, male urethral gonorrhea, P&S syphilis, and EL syphilis decreased by 9%, 5%, 16%, and 22%, respectively. Mean weekly case counts of gonorrhea, male urethral gonorrhea, and EL syphilis decreased pre-SHSH to SHSH, but all returned to pre-SHSH levels during reopening. Sexual health clinic visits during SHSH were 55% lower in 2020 than in 2019. In the SHC during SHSH, ceftriaxone treatment of gonorrhea decreased, whereas cefixime/cefpodoxime treatment and gonorrhea treatment with no testing increased. CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in reported STIs concurrent with COVID-19 SHSH may reflect a true decline in STI transmission. However, the larger decreases in asymptomatic infections indicate that much of the observed decrease was likely due to decreased screening.","Berzkalns, Anna; Thibault, Christina S.; Barbee, Lindley A.; Golden, Matthew R.; Khosropour, Christine; Kerani, Roxanne P.",Sex Transm Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967230/; https://doi.org/10.1097/olq.0000000000001463,68
662238,Extraordinary curtailment of massive typhus epidemic in the Warsaw Ghetto,2020-07-24,"OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed at exploring the relationship of the viral load of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and investigating the dynamic change of patients' viral load during the conversion from mild COVID-19 to severe COVID-19, so as to clarify the correlation between the viral load and progression of COVID-19. METHODS: This paper included 38 COVID-19 patients admitted to the First Hospital of Jiaxing from January 28, 2020, to March 6, 2020, and they were clinically classified according to the Guidelines on the Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment. According to the instructions of the Nucleic Acid Detection Kit for the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), respiratory tract specimens (throat swabs) were collected from patients for nucleic acid testing. Patients' lymphocyte count and neutrophil count were determined by blood routine examination, and CRP was measured by biochemical test. RESULTS: The results of our study suggested that the cycle threshold (Ct) value of Nucleocapsid protein (N) gene examined by nucleic acid test was markedly positively correlated with lymphocyte count (p = 0.0445, R(2) = 0.1203), but negatively correlated with neutrophil count (p = 0.0446, R(2) = 0.1167) and CRP (p = 0.0393, R(2) = 0.1261), which indicated that patients with a higher viral load tended to have lower lymphocyte count but higher neutrophil count and CRP. Additionally, we detected the dynamic change of Ct value in patients who developed into a severe case, finding that viral load of 3 patients increased before disease progression, whereas this phenomenon was not found in 2 patients with underlying diseases. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly negatively correlated with lymphocyte count, but markedly positively correlated with neutrophil count and CRP. The rise of viral load is very likely to be the key factor leading to the overloading of the body's immune response and resulting in the disease progression into severe disease.","Chen, Wenyu; Xiao, Qinfeng; Fang, Zhixian; Lv, Xiaodong; Yao, Ming; Deng, Min",Comput Math Methods Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34122620/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9926249,68

664144,Not Just Another Scaffolding Protein Family: The Multifaceted MPPs,2020-10-26,"The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein serves multiple functions in viral replication, transcription, and assembly of the viral genome complex. Coronaviruses specifically package genomic RNA into assembled virions, and in SARS-CoV, it is reported that this process is driven by an interaction between the N-protein and a packaging signal encoded within the viral RNA. While recent studies have uncovered the sequence of this packaging signal, little is known about the specific interaction between the N-protein and the packaging signal sequence, and the mechanisms by which this interaction drives viral genome packaging. In this study, we developed a novel in vivo cell-based assay for examining this interaction between the N-protein and packaging signal RNA for SARS-CoV, as well as other viruses within the coronaviridae family. Our results demonstrate that the N-protein specifically recognizes the SARS-CoV packaging signal with greater affinity compared to signals from other coronaviruses or non-coronavirus species. We also use deletion mapping to identify a 151-nt region within the packaging signal sequence that is critical for N-protein-RNA binding, and conversely, we show that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the N protein are necessary for recognizing the packaging RNA. These results describe, for the first time, in vivo evidence for an interaction between the SARS-CoV N-protein and its packaging signal RNA, and demonstrate the feasibility of using this cell-based assay to further probe viral RNA-protein interactions in future studies.","Woo, Jiwon; Lee, Eunice Yoojin; Lee, Mirae; Kim, Taeyeon; Cho, Yong-Eun",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X19318534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594639/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.09.115; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X19318534,68

We call this partiality for compatriots in times of crisis “crisis nationalism”. Vaccine nationalism is one vivid example of crisis nationalism during the COVID-19 pandemic; so is the case of the US government’s purchasing a 3-month supply of the global stock of the antiviral Remdesivir for domestic use. Is crisis nationalism justifiable at all, and, if it is, what are its limits? We examine some plausible arguments for national partiality, and conclude that these arguments support crisis nationalism only within strict limits. The different arguments for partiality, as we will note, arrive at these limits for different reasons. But more generally, so we argue, any defensible crisis nationalism must not entail the violation of human rights or the worsening of people’s deprivation. Moreover, we propose that good faith crisis nationalism ought to be sensitive to the potential moral costs of national partiality during a global crisis and must take extra care to control or offset these costs. Thus, crisis nationalism in the form of vaccine nationalism or the hoarding of global supplies of therapeutics during a global pandemic exceeds the bounds of acceptable partiality.","Beaton, Eilidh; Gadomski, Mike; Manson, Dylan; Tan, Kok-Chor",Ethical Theory Moral Pract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10677-021-10160-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33613085/,68

The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of CBC parameters together with analysis of FLC serum concentration in risk stratification of COVID-19. Materials and methods: CBC was analyzed in 735 COVID ICU, COVID non-ICU, and non-COVID ICU cases. FLC concentration was analyzed in 133 of them. Results: COVID ICU had neutrophils and lymphocytes with the greatest size, granularity, and nucleic acid content. Significant differences in concentrations of κ and λ FLCs were shown between COVID ICU and COVID non-ICU. However, no difference was found in the κ/λ ratio between these groups, and the ratio stayed within the reference value, which indicates the presence of polyclonal FLCs. FLC κ measurement has significant power to distinguish between severe COVID-19 and nonsevere COVID-19 (AUC = 0.7669), with a sensitivity of 86.67% and specificity of 93.33%.

We assess the efficacy of the cordon sanitaire to delay the introduction and onset of local transmission of COVID-19 in other major cities in mainland China. Methods: We estimated the number of infected travellers from Wuhan to other major cities in mainland China from November 2019 to March 2020 using previously estimated COVID-19 prevalence in Wuhan and publicly available mobility data. We focused on Beijing, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen as four representative major cities to identify the potential independent contribution of the cordon sanitaire and holiday travel. To do this, we simulated outbreaks generated by infected arrivals in these destination cities using stochastic branching processes. We also modelled the effect of the cordon sanitaire in combination with reduced transmissibility scenarios representing the effect of local non-pharmaceutical interventions. Findings: In the four cities, given the potentially high prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan between Dec 2019 and early Jan 2020, local transmission may have been seeded as early as 2 - 8 January 2020. By the time the cordon sanitaire was imposed, simulated case counts were likely in the hundreds. The cordon sanitaire alone did not substantially affect the epidemic progression in these cities, although it may have had some effect in smaller cities. Interpretation: Our results indicate that the cordon sanitaire may not have prevented COVID-19 spread in major Chinese cities; local non-pharmaceutical interventions were likely more important for this.","Quilty, Billy J; Diamond, Charlie; Liu, Yang; Gibbs, Hamish; Russell, Timothy W; Jarvis, Christopher I; Prem, Kiesha; Pearson, Carl A B; Clifford, Samuel J; Flasche, Stefan; Klepac, Petra; Eggo, Rosalind M; Jit, Mark",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.16.20067504v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067504,68

Variables associated with changes in self‐perceived breath odour, self‐perceived halitosis and changes in OHHs were assessed through multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Changes in self‐perceived breath odour were reported by 1572 individuals and were associated with smoking, systemic conditions, dry mouth, tongue coating, the period of face mask use and its interaction with prior thinking of having bad breath. Likewise, 645 individuals started to consider having bad breath. This was associated with the interaction between prior family/friends saying they have bad breath and period of face mask use. Changes in OHHs were strongly associated with changes in SPBO and starting to consider having bad breath.

To estimate the burden of the disease with time it is important to undertake a longitudinal seroprevalence study which will also help to understand the stability of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Various studies have been conducted worldwide to assess the antibody stability. However, there is very limited data available from India. Healthcare workers (HCW) are the frontline workforce and more exposed to the COVID-19 infection (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the community. This study was conceptualized with an aim to estimate the seroprevalence in hospital and general population and determine the stability of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCW. Methods: Staff of a tertiary care hospital in Delhi and individuals visiting that hospital were recruited between April to August 2020. Venous blood sample, demographic, clinical, COVID-19 symptoms, and RT-PCR data was collected from all participants. Serological testing was performed using the electro-chemiluminescence based assay developed by Roche Diagnostics, in Cobas Elecsys 411. Seropositive participants were followed- upto 83 days to check for the presence of antibodies. Results: A total of 780 participants were included in this study, which comprised 448 HCW and 332 individuals from the general population. Among the HCW, seroprevalence rates increased from 2.3% in April to 50.6% in July. The cumulative prevalence was 16.5% in HCW and 23.5% (78/332) in the general population with a large number of asymptomatic individuals. Out of 74 seropositive HCWs, 51 were followed-up for the duration of this study. We observed that in all seropositive cases the antibodies were sustained even up to 83 days. Conclusion: The cumulative prevalence of seropositivity was lower in HCWs than the general population. There were a large number of asymptomatic cases and the antibodies developed persisted through the duration of the study.

A Gammacell 220 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd., Ottawa, Canada § § Use of trade names is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by the Public Health Service or by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ) was used to subject 38 viruses grown in either susceptible tissue cultures or embryonated chicken eggs to various doses of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 source. The radiation required to reduce viral infectivity was 0·42 to 3·7 megarads (Mrad). The effect of gamma treatment on the antigenic reactivity of reagents for the complement fixation (CF), hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminadase assays was determined. Influenza antigens inactivated with 1·7 Mrad displayed comparable potency, sensitivity, specificity and stability to those inactivated by standard procedures with beta-propiolactone (BPL). Significant inactivation of influenza N1 and B neuraminidase occurred with >2·4 Mrad radiation at temperatures above 4°C. All 38 viruses were inactivated, and CF or HA antigens were prepared successfully. Antigenic potency remained stable with all antigens for 3 years and with 83% after 5 years storage. Influenza HA antigens evaluated after 9 years of storage demonstrated 86% stability. Gamma radiation is safer than chemical inactivation procedures and is a reliable and effective replacement for BPL in preparing diagnostic reagents.","White, L. A.; Freeman, C. Y.; Hall, H.

Along with briefly discussing IFNs and signalling in this review, we highlighted how different IRDS genes are affected by viruses. On the contrary, different strategies adopted to suppress a set of IRDS genes (STAT1, IRF7, OAS family, and BST2) to induce (chemo- and radiotherapy) sensitivity were deliberated. Significant biological pathways that comprise these genes were classified, along with their frequently associated genes (IFIT1/3, IFITM1, IRF7, ISG15, MX1/2 and OAS1/3/L). Major upstream regulators from the IRDS genes were identified, and different IFN types regulating these genes were outlined. Functional interfaces of IRDS proteins with DNA/RNA/ATP/GTP/NADP biomolecules featured a well-defined pharmacophore model for STAT1/IRF7-dsDNA and OAS1/OAS3/IFIH1-dsRNA complexes, as well as for the genes binding to GDP or NADP+. The Lys amino acid was found commonly interacting with the ATP phosphate group from OAS1/EIF2AK2/IFIH1 genes. Considering the premise that targeting IRDS genes mediated resistance offers an efficient strategy to resensitize tumour cells and enhances the outcome of anti-cancer treatment, this review can add some novel insights to the field.","Padariya, Monikaben; Sznarkowska, Alicja; Kote, Sachin; Gómez-Herranz, Maria; Mikac, Sara; Pilch, Magdalena; Alfaro, Javier; Fahraeus, Robin; Hupp, Ted; Kalathiya, Umesh",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11050622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33922087/,68

668380,Participating in a vaccine trial for COVID-19 in Senegal: trust and information.,2021-07-19,"Insulin injection is currently the main therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) or late stage of severe type 2 diabetes (T2D). Human pancreatic islet transplantation confers a significant improvement in glycemic control and prevents life-threatening severe hypoglycemia in T1D patients. However, the shortage of cadaveric human islets limits their therapeutic potential. In addition, chronic immunosuppression, which is required to avoid rejection of transplanted islets, is associated with severe complications, such as an increased risk of malignancies and infections. Thus, there is a significant need for novel approaches to the large-scale generation of functional human islets protected from autoimmune rejection in order to ensure durable graft acceptance without immunosuppression. An important step in addressing this need is to strengthen our understanding of transplant immune tolerance mechanisms for both graft rejection and autoimmune rejection. Engineering of functional human pancreatic islets that can avoid attacks from host immune cells would provide an alternative safe resource for transplantation therapy. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer a potentially limitless supply of cells because of their self-renewal ability and pluripotency. Therefore, studying immune tolerance induction in hPSC-derived human pancreatic islets will directly contribute toward the goal of generating a functional cure for insulin-dependent diabetes. In this review, we will discuss the current progress in the immune protection of stem cell-derived islet cell therapy for treating diabetes.","Tahbaz, Meghan; Yoshihara, Eiji",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34447354/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2021.716625,68
668487,The evolving world of protein-G-quadruplex recognition: A medicinal chemist’s perspective,2011-04-29,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected health and lifestyle behaviors of people globally. This project aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behavior of individuals in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region during confinement. METHODS: We conducted an online survey in 17 countries (Egypt, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Yemen, Syria, Palestine, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Iraq, and Sudan) from the MENA region on August and September 2020. The questionnaire included self-reported information on lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity, eating habits, smoking, watching television, social media use and sleep before and during the pandemic. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 5896 participants were included in the final analysis and 62.8% were females. The BMI of the participants was 25.4 ± 5.8 kg/m(2). Around 38.4% of the participants stopped practicing any physical activities during the confinement (P < 0.001), and 57.1% reported spending more than 2 h on social media (P < 0.001). There were no significant changes in smoking habits. Also, 30.9% reported an improvement in their eating habits compared with 24.8% reported worsening of their eating habits. Fast-food consumption decreased significantly in 48.8% of the study population. This direct/indirect exposure to COVID-19 was associated with an increased consumption of carbohydrates (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02–1.17; P = 0.01), egg (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.02–1.16; P = 0.01), sugar (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02–1.16; P = 0.02), meat, and poultry (OR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.06–1.20; P < 0.01). There was also associated increase in hours spent on watching television (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.02–1.12; P < 0.01) and social media (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.01–1.18; P = 0.03). However, our results showed a reduction in sleeping hours among those exposed to COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.77–0.94; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in food consumption and sedentary life. Being exposed to COVID-19 by direct infection or through an infected household is a significant predictor of amplifying these changes. Public health interventions are needed to address healthy lifestyle behaviors during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

669875,SIOMMS: Evolution and development,2020-07-24,"The 2015-2016 emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas, and recognition that ZIKV infection during pregnancy can result in birth defects, revealed a need for small animal models to study ZIKV pathogenic mechanisms and evaluate candidate vaccines and antivirals. Mice would be an attractive system for such studies, but ZIKV replicates poorly in laboratory mice because it fails to antagonize murine STAT2 and STING. To address this, most ZIKV pathogenesis studies have used mice with impaired interferon signaling (e.g. Ifnar1−/− or treatment with IFNAR1-blocking antibodies). However, using mice with severe defects in innate antiviral signaling confounds studies of viral pathogenic mechanisms. Collaborative Cross (CC) mice have proven to be a valuable system for developing new mouse pathogenesis models for viral infections that are not well modeled in conventional laboratory mouse lines. To test whether CC mice could provide an immune-competent model for ZIKV pathogenesis, we infected CC lines with ZIKV and assessed weight loss, viremia, and production of neutralizing antibodies. We tested 21 CC lines (CC001, CC002, CC003, CC004, CC005, CC006, CC011, CC012, CC013, CC019, CC024, CC028, CC040, CC041, CC042, CC046, CC051, CC059, CC061, CC068, and CC072, 13 of which have non-functional alleles of the flavivirus restriction factor Oas1b) and 3 ZIKV strains (MR766, H/PF/2013, and a mouse-adapted variant of Dakar 41525). ZIKV infection did not induce weight loss compared to mock-infected controls and accordingly only low levels of viral RNA were detected in serum. Only a subset of mice developed neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV, likely due to overall low levels of infection and viremia. Our results are consistent with other studies demonstrating poor ZIKV infection in interferon-intact mice and suggest that the tested CC lines do not include polymorphic host genes that greatly increase susceptibility to ZIKV infection.","Mattocks, Melissa D.; Plante, Kenneth S.; Fritch, Ethan J.; Baric, Ralph S.; Ferris, Martin T.; Heise, Mark T.; Lazear, Helen M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/695510,68
670021,125 Years of Gynecologic and Obstetric Research.,2021-04-19,"We analyze the price return distributions of currency exchange rates, cryptocurrencies, and contracts for differences (CFDs) representing stock indices, stock shares, and commodities. Based on recent data from the years 2017–2020, we model tails of the return distributions at different time scales by using power-law, stretched exponential, and q-Gaussian functions. We focus on the fitted function parameters and how they change over the years by comparing our results with those from earlier studies and find that, on the time horizons of up to a few minutes, the so-called “inverse-cubic power-law” still constitutes an appropriate global reference. However, we no longer observe the hypothesized universal constant acceleration of the market time flow that was manifested before in an ever faster convergence of empirical return distributions towards the normal distribution. Our results do not exclude such a scenario but, rather, suggest that some other short-term processes related to a current market situation alter market dynamics and may mask this scenario. Real market dynamics is associated with a continuous alternation of different regimes with different statistical properties. An example is the COVID-19 pandemic outburst, which had an enormous yet short-time impact on financial markets. We also point out that two factors—speed of the market time flow and the asset cross-correlation magnitude—while related (the larger the speed, the larger the cross-correlations on a given time scale), act in opposite directions with regard to the return distribution tails, which can affect the expected distribution convergence to the normal distribution.","Wątorek, Marcin; Kwapień, Jarosław; Drożdż, Stanisław",Entropy (Basel),https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06659v1.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356425/; https://doi.org/10.3390/e23070884,68

This study used the state-designed Local Government Unit Disaster Preparedness Journal: Checklist of Minimum Actions for Mayors in assessing the readiness to natural hazards of 92 profiled municipalities in central Philippines inhabited by 2.4 million people. Anchored on the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005–2015, it assessed their preparedness in 4 criteria—systems and structures, policies and plans, building competencies, and equipment and supplies. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences, frequency count, percentage, and weighted mean. The local governments were found highly vulnerable to tropical cyclone and flood while vulnerable to earthquake, drought, and landslide. They were partially prepared regardless of profile, but the coastal, middle-earning, most populated, having the least number of villages, and middle-sized had higher levels of preparedness. Those highly vulnerable to earthquake and forest fire were prepared, yet only partially prepared to flood, storm surge, drought, tropical cyclone, tornado, tsunami and landslide. The diverse attitude of stakeholders, insufficient manpower, and poor database management were the major problems encountered in executing countermeasures. Appointing full-time disaster managers, developing a disaster information management system, massive information drive, organizing village-based volunteers, integrating disaster management into formal education, and mandatory trainings for officials, preparing for a possible major volcanic eruption and crafting a comprehensive plan against emerging emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a 360° preparedness.","Dariagan, Johnny D.; Atando, Ramil B.; Asis, Jay Lord B.",Nat Hazards (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-020-04383-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132533/,68

Pathogenic bacteria (Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh), Pasteurella multocida (Pm), Histophilus somni (Hs), and Mycoplasma bovis) and a range of viruses (bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, bovine viral diarrhea virus and bovine herpesvirus type 1) are associated with this complex. As most of these pathogens can be present in healthy and diseased calves, simple detection of their presence in diseased calves carries low predictive value. In other multi-agent diseases of livestock, quantification of pathogens has added substantially to the predictive value of microbiological diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of two recently developed quantitative PCR (qPCR) kits (Pneumo4B and Pneumo4V) to detect and quantify these bacterial and viral pathogens, respectively. Test efficiencies of the qPCR assays, based on nucleic acid dilution series of target bacteria and viruses, were 93–106% and 91–104%, respectively, with assay detection limits of 10–50 copies of nucleic acids. All 44 strains of target bacteria were correctly identified, with no false positive reactions in 135 strains of non-target bacterial species. Based on standard curves of log(10) CFU versus cycle threshold (Ct) values, quantification was possible over a 5-log range of bacteria. In 92 tracheal aspirate samples, the kappa values for agreement between Pneumo4B and bacterial culture were 0.64-0.84 for Mh, Pm and Hs. In an additional 84 tracheal aspirates, agreement between Pneumo4B or Pneumo 4V and certified diagnostic qPCR assays was moderate (0.57) for M. bovis and high (0.71–0.90) for viral pathogens. Thus Pneumo4 kits specifically detected and quantified the relevant pathogens.","Pansri, P.; Katholm, J.; Krogh, K.M.; Aagaard, A.K.; Schmidt, L.M.B.; Kudirkiene, E.; Larsen, L.E.; Olsen, J.E.",Vet J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023320300022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32113583/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2020.105425; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023320300022,68

Although the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS‐Cov‐2]) nucleic acid real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, these real‐time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false‐negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify a large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point‐of‐care lateral flow immunoassay that can detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS‐CoV‐2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID‐19 patients and 128 negative patients at eight different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM‐IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS‐CoV‐2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories.","Li, Zhengtu; Yi, Yongxiang; Luo, Xiaomei; Xiong, Nian; Liu, Yang; Li, Shaoqiang; Sun, Ruilin; Wang, Yanqun; Hu, Bicheng; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Yongchen; Wang, Jing; Huang, Baofu; Lin, Ye; Yang, Jiasheng; Cai, Wensheng; Wang, Xuefeng; Cheng, Jing; Chen, Zhiqiang; Sun, Kangjun; Pan, Weimin; Zhan, Zhifei; Chen, Liyan; Ye, Feng",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32104917/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25727,68

In Egypt and the Middle East region, there is a lack of data regarding the viral causes of LRTI. In this study, we aimed to identify the relative prevalence of various respiratory viruses that contribute to LRTIs in young children. Although, nucleic acid-based methods have gained importance as a sensitive tool to determine the viral infections, their use is limited because of their prohibitive cost in low-income countries. Therefore, we applied three different laboratory methods, and presented the different virus prevalence patterns detected by each method. METHODS: We collected nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, demographic data and, clinical data from 450 children under five years of age who presented with LRTI at Abou El Reesh hospital in Cairo during a one-year period. To identify the viral causes of the LRTI we used direct fluorescence assay, real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-RT-PCR), and shell vial culture. We tested for eight major respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-nine patients (59.9%) had a viral infection, among which 10.8% had a co-infection with two or more viruses. By all three methods, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most predominant, and parainfluenza virus type 2 (HPIV-2), influenza B virus (FLUBV) were the least predominant. Other viral prevalence patterns differed according to the detection method used. The distribution of various viruses among different age groups and seasonal distribution of the viruses were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: RSV and human adenovirus were the most common respiratory viruses detected by rt-RT-PCR. Co-infections were found to be frequent among children and the vast majority of co-infections were detected by nucleic acid-based detection assays.","Shafik, Caroline F; Mohareb, Emad W; Yassin, Aymen S; Amin, Madgy A; El Kholy, Amani; El-Karaksy, Hanaa; Youssef, Fouad G",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23237512/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-350,68
672938,The Concept of Chemical Generators: On-Site On-Demand Production of Hazardous Reagents in Continuous Flow,2020-06-16,"Phylogenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 as available from publicly available repositories suggests the presence of 3 prevalent groups of viral episomes (super-clades), which are mostly associated with outbreaks in distinct geographic locations (China, USA and Europe). While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral episomes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects, coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS-CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3’ and 5’ UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains. Although this study can not be conclusive, we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen.","Chiara, Matteo; Horner, David S.; Gissi, Carmela; Pesole, Graziano",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.016790,68

The goal of the present study was to define the antiviral effect and therapeutic action of blue light irradiation in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (NCCP43326) or mock inoculum at 50 pfu/well. After blue light irradiation, the inhibitory effect was assessed by qPCR and plaque reduction assay. When Vero cells were irradiated to blue light ranging from 1.6 to 10 J cm-2 , SARS-CoV-2 replication was inhibited by up to 80%. The antiviral effect of blue light irradiation was associated with translation suppression via the phosphorylation of eIF2α by prolonging endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The levels of LC3A/B and Beclin-1, which are key markers of autophagy, and the levels of PERK and PDI for ER stress were highly increased, whereas caspase-3 cleavage was inhibited after blue light irradiation in the later stage of infection. Our data revealed that blue light irradiation exerted antiviral and photo-biogoverning activities by prolonging ER stress and stimulating autophagy progression during viral infection.

We use a novel dataset and models from time-critical social mobilization competitions, voting records, and a high-resolution county-wise friendship network. Our simulations show that a higher degree of polarization impedes the overall spread of mobilization and leads to a highly-heterogeneous impact among states. Our hypothetical compliance campaign to mitigate COVID-19 spread predicts grass-roots mitigation strategies’ success before the dates of actual lockdowns in identically polarized states with more than three times of success rate than oppositely polarized states. Finally, we analyze the coupling of social mobilization leading to unrest and the growth of COVID-19 infections. These findings highlight social mobilization as both a collective precautionary measure and a potential threat to countermeasures, together with a warning message that the emerging polarization can be a significant hurdle of NPIs relying on coordinated action.","Hong, Inho; Rutherford, Alex; Cebrian, Manuel",Appl Netw Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614902/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-021-00356-9,68

Methods Serious bacterial infections (SBI) were defined as culture-positive blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, articular fluid or stool infections, alveolar pneumonia, Brucellosis and Rickettsiosis. Results 431/671 (64.2%) healthy infants and children hospitalized with acute neutropenia were <2 years of age; 176 (40.8%), 167 (38.8%) and 88 (20.4%) patients were aged 0–3, 4–12 and 13–24 months, respectively. There were 19 (4.4%), 53 (12.3%), 140 (32.5%) and 209 (50.8%) patients with ANC count <200, 200–500, 501–1000 and 1001–1500 × 109 cells/L, respectively. Severe neutropenia (<500 ×109/L) was recorded in 72 (16.7%) patients. Fever >380C was present in 208/431 (48.3%) patients. Blood cultures were positive in 10 (2.3%), with Brucella melitensis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter spp. identified in 4, 3 and 2 patients, respectively; 5/10 patients with positive blood cultures were < 3 months of age. Overall, 55/431 (12.7%) and 65/431 (15.1%) patients were diagnosed with SBIs and bacterial infections, respectively. Nasal washings-PCR for respiratory viruses was positive in 139/293 (47.4%) patients tested. An infectious etiology (bacterial and/or viral) was diagnosed in 190/431 (44.1%) patients. Three patients were diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Resolution of neutropenia was achieved in 111/208 (53.4%) evaluable patients (63%, 50.6% and 48% of patients aged 0–3, 4–12 and >12 months, respectively and 56.8%, 53.5% and 52% of patients with severe, moderate and mild neutropenia, respectively). Conclusions Acute neutropenia is common in immunocompetent children < 2 years of age and is frequently associated with viral infections. We showed a substantial involvement of bacterial infections and particularly SBIs in the etiology of acute neutropenia. After a 1-month follow-up, resolution of neutropenia occurred in half of the patients, without association with age subgroups and with neutropenia severity.","Dov, Tschernin; Fruchtman, Yariv; Sergienko, Ruslan; David, Odeya; Leibovitz, Ron; Mazar, Julia; Leibovitz, Eugene",Pediatr Neonatol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1875957220301315; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875957220301315?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847741/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedneo.2020.08.004,68
674838,Growth Performance and Health of Dairy Calves Bedded with Different Types of Materials,2004-11-30,"INTRODUCTION: One of the methods for the biliary tree decompression in the case of Klatskin tumor is transpapillary stenting, which could be completed by stent migration in 4% to 10% of cases. Approximately half of the stent migrations are in the proximal direction. In this study, we reported a rare case of proximal trans-diaphragmatic stent migration to the lower lobe of the right lung with the formation of a biliary-bronchial fistula (BBF). CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old woman was diagnosed with hilar cholangiocarcinoma (type 3B by Bismuth-Corlette) complicated by posthepatic jaundice. To relieve jaundice there were performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic sphincterotomy, endobiliary stent placement (10 Fr, 150 mm). A restenting (11.5 Fr, 130 mm) was performed in 2.5 months due to endobiliary tube occlusion. In the next 2 months, coughing attacks and biliptysis have appeared in the patient. A CT scan showed penetration of the liver, diaphragm, and lower lobe of the right lung with the proximal part of the stent and caused BBF formation. Anti-inflammatory and antibacterial therapy was administrated for 14 days and BBF was closed. Stent retrieval from the right hemithorax and endobiliary restenting was performed in 9 months after primary stenting. During follow-up, appropriate positioning and functioning of the stent were observed. CONCLUSION: BBF formation is a rare complication of endobiliary stenting, which can be successfully treated by anti-inflammatory and antibiotic therapy, followed by transpapillary stent retrieval.","Tsema, Ievgen; Slobodianyk, Viktor; Rahushyn, Dmytro; Myrhorodskiy, Denys; Yurkiv, Oleh; Dinets, Andrii",Clin Med Insights Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1177/11795476211043067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483694/,68
675266,COVID-19 Diagnostic Methods and Detection Techniques: A Review,2021-09-01,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a major alteration in the medical literature including the sepsis discussion. From the outset of the pandemic, various reports have indicated that although there are some unique features pertinent to COVID-19, many of its acute manifestations are similar to sepsis caused by other pathogens. As a consequence, the old definitions now require consideration of this new etiologic agent, namely SARS-CoV-2. Although the pathogenesis of COVID-19 has been not fully explained, the data obtained so far in hospitalized patients has revealed that serum cytokine and chemokine levels are high in severe COVID-19 patients, similar to those found with sepsis. COVID-19, may involve multiple organ systems. In addition to the lungs, the virus has been isolated from blood, urine, faeces, liver and gallbladder. Results from autopsy series in COVID-19 patients have demonstrated a wide range of findings including vascular involvement, congestion, consolidation, and hemorrhage as well as diffuse alveolar damage in lung tissue in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The presence of viral cytopathic-like changes, infiltration of inflammatory cells (mononuclear cells and macrophages), and viral particles in histopathological samples are considered a consequence of both direct viral infection and immune hyperactivation. Thromboembolism and hyper-coagulopathy are other components in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. Although the pathogenesis of hypercoagulability is not fully understood, it has been pointed out that all three components of Virchow?s triad (endothelial injury, stasis, and hypercoagulable state) play a major role in contributing to clot formation in severe COVID-19 infection. In severe COVID-19 cases, laboratory parameters such as hematological findings, coagulation tests, liver function tests, D-dimer, ferritin, and acute phase reactants such as CRP show marked alterations which are suggestive of a cytokine storm. Another key element of COVID-19 pathogenesis in severe cases is its similarity or association with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm has significant clinical and laboratory findings overlapping with HLH. Viral sepsis has some similarities but also some differences when compared to bacterial sepsis. In bacterial sepsis, systemic inflammation affecting multiple organs is more dominant than in COVID-19 sepsis. While bacterial sepsis causes an early and sudden onset clinical deterioration, viral diseases may exhibit a relatively late onset and chronic course. Consideration of severe COVID-19 disease as a sepsis syndrome has relevance and may assist in terms of determining treatments that will modulate the immune response, limit intrinsic damage to tissue and organs, and potentially improve outcome.","Koçak Tufan, Zeliha; Kayaaslan, Bircan; Mer, Mervyn",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34590796/; https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2108-239,68

Although research on perinatal mental health in India has grown in recent years, important evidence gaps remain, especially regarding CMD. Our study aims to improve understanding of CMD among perinatal and non-perinatal women of reproductive age across two settings in India: Bangalore (Karnataka) and Tanda (Himachal Pradesh). METHODS: The study is embedded within the Maternal and Perinatal Health Research Collaboration India (MaatHRI). This mixed-methods observational study comprises three consecutive phases: (i) focus group discussions and individual interviews to explore women’s knowledge and seek feedback on CMD screening tools; (ii) validation of CMD screening tools; and (iii) prospective cohort study to identify CMD incidence, prevalence and risk factors among perinatal and non-perinatal women. Results of the three phases will be analyzed using inductive thematic analysis, psychometric analysis and multivariable regression analysis, respectively. CONCLUSION: Improving understanding, detection and management of CMD among women is key to improving women’s health and promoting gender equality. This study will provide evidence of CMD screening tools for perinatal and non-perinatal women in two diverse Indian settings, produce data on CMD prevalence, incidence and risk factors and enhance understanding of the specific contribution of the perinatal state to CMD.","Fellmeth, G; Kishore, M T; Verma, A; Desai, G; Bharti, O; Kanwar, P; Singh, S; Thippeswamy, H; Chandra, P S; Kurinczuk, J J; Nair, M; Alderdice, F",J Public Health (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34622290/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab162,68

METHODS: This was a mixed‐methods study. Emergency physicians completed a weekly online survey. The primary outcome was physician burnout as measured by the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization items, from the Maslach Burnout Inventory. We captured data on work patterns, aerosolizing procedures, testing and diagnosis of COVID‐19. Each week participants entered free text explaining their experiences and well‐being. RESULTS: There were 468 participants who worked in 143 Canadian hospitals. Burnout levels did not significantly change over time (emotional exhaustion P = 0.632, depersonalization P = 0.155). Three participants were diagnosed with COVID‐19. Being tested for COVID‐19 (odds ratio [OR] 11.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.1–42.5) and the number of shifts worked (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.5 per additional shift) were associated with high emotional exhaustion. Having been tested for COVID‐19 (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.1–17.8) was also associated with high depersonalization. Personal safety, academic and educational work, personal protective equipment, the workforce, patient volumes, work patterns, and work environment had an impact on physician well‐being. A new financial reality and contrasting negative and positive experiences affected participants’ psychological health. CONCLUSION: Emergency physician burnout levels remained stable during the initial 10 weeks of this pandemic. The impact of COVID‐19 on the work environment and personal perceptions and fears about the impact on lifestyle have affected physician well‐being.","de Wit, Kerstin; Mercuri, Mathew; Wallner, Clare; Clayton, Natasha; Archambault, Patrick; Ritchie, Kerri; Gérin‐Lajoie, Caroline; Gray, Sara; Schwartz, Lisa; Chan, Teresa",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32905025/; https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12225,68

Moreover, arenaviruses pose a biodefense threat. No licensed anti-arenavirus vaccines are available, and current anti-arenavirus therapy is limited to the use of ribavirin, which is only partially effective and is associated with anemia and other side effects. Therefore, it is important to develop effective vaccines and better antiviral drugs to combat the dual threats of naturally occurring and intentionally introduced arenavirus infections. The development of arenavirus reverse genetic systems is allowing investigators to conduct a detailed molecular characterization of the viral cis-acting signals and trans-acting factors that control each of the steps of the arenavirus life cycle, including RNA synthesis, packaging and budding. Knowledge derived from these studies is uncovering potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention, as well as facilitating the establishment of assays to identify and characterize candidate antiviral drugs capable of interfering with specific steps of the virus life cycle. Likewise, the ability to generate predetermined specific mutations within the arenavirus genome and analyze their phenotypic expression would significantly contribute to the elucidation of arenavirus-host interactions, including the basis of their ability to cause severe HF. This, in turn, could lead to the development of novel, potent and safe arenavirus vaccines.","de la Torre, Juan C.",Antiviral Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18782590/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354208003665; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2628465?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.08.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354208003665,68

In this work, we have analyzed Chest X-ray (CXR) images for the detection of the coronavirus. The primary agenda of this proposed research study is to leverage the classification performance of the deep learning models using ensemble learning. Many papers have proposed different ensemble learning techniques in this field, some methods using aggregation functions like Weighted Arithmetic Mean (WAM) among others. However, none of these methods take into consideration the decisions that subsets of the classifiers take. In this paper, we have applied Choquet integral for ensemble and propose a novel method for the evaluation of fuzzy measures using Coalition Game Theory, Information Theory, and Lambda fuzzy approximation. Three different sets of Fuzzy Measures are calculated using three different weighting schemes along with information theory and coalition game theory. Using these three sets of fuzzy measures three Choquet Integrals are calculated and their decisions are finally combined.We have created a database by combining several image repositories developed recently.

We aimed at evaluating the association of daily new COVID-19 cases with socio-economic and demographic factors, health vulnerability, resources, and policy response in BRICS countries. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data on the COVID-19 pandemic and other indicators of BRICS countries from February 26, 2020 to April 30, 2021. We compared COVID-19 epidemic in BRICS countries and analyzed related factors by log-linear Generalized Additive Model (GAM) models. RESULTS: In BRICS countries, India had the highest totally of confirmed cases with 18.76 million, followed by Brazil (14.45 million), Russia (4.81 million), and South Africa (1.58 million), while China (0.10 million) had the lowest figure. South Africa had the lowest rate of administered vaccine doses (0.18 million) among BRICS countries as of April 30, 2021. In the GAM model, a 1 unit increase in population density and policy stringency index was associated with a 5.17% and 1.95% growth in daily new COVID-19 cases (P < 0.001), respectively. Exposure–response curves for the effects of policy stringency index on daily new cases showed that there was a rapid surge in number of daily new COVID-19 cases when the index ranged from 0 to 45. The number of infections climbed slowly when the index ranged from 46 to 80, and decreased when the index was above 80 (P < 0.001). In addition, daily new COVID-19 cases (all P < 0.001) were also correlated with life expectancy at birth (-1.61%), extreme poverty (8.95%), human development index (-0.05%), GDP per capita (-0.18%), diabetes prevalence (0.66%), proportion of population aged 60 and above (2.23%), hospital beds per thousand people (-0.08%), proportion of people with access to improved drinking water (-7.40%), prevalence of open defecation (0.69%), and annual tourist/visitor arrivals (0.003%), after controlling other confounders. Different lag structures showed similar results in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Strong policy response is crucial to control the pandemic, such as effective containment and case management. Our findings also highlighted the importance of reducing socio-economic inequalities and strengthening the resilience of health systems to better respond to public health emergencies globally.

The medicinal quality of herbal plants varies with the locations of cultivation, the parts of the herb collected, the season of the herb collected, and the herb processing method. Polysaccharides are major components of the herb plants and their biosynthesis is partly controlled by the genes but mostly influenced by the availability of the nutrition and determined by the various environmental factors. In recent decades, polysaccharides isolated from different kinds of Chinese herbs have received much attention due to their important biological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, radiation protecting, antiviral, hypolipidemic, and immunomodulatory activities. Interestingly, different batches of the same herb can obtain different polysaccharide fractions with subtle differences in molecular weight, monosaccharide compositions, glycosidic linkages, and biological functions. Even with these variations, a large number of bioactive polysaccharides from different kinds of traditional Chinese herbs have been purified, characterized, and reported. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the latest polysaccharide extraction methods and the strategies used for monosaccharide compositional analysis plus polysaccharide structural characterization. Most importantly, the reported chemical characteristics and biological activities of the polysaccharides from the famous traditional Chinese herbs including Astragalus membranaceus, Ginseng, Lycium barbarum, Angelica sinensis, Cordyceps sinensis, and Ophiopogon japonicus will be reviewed and discussed. The published studies provide evidence that polysaccharides from traditional Chinese herbs play an important role in their medical applications, which forms the basis for future research, development, and application of these polysaccharides as functional foods and therapeutics in modern medicine.","Zeng, Pengjiao; Li, Juan; Chen, Yulong; Zhang, Lijuan",Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030757/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2019.03.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877117319300377; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877117319300377,68

This article details a project that brought together five final-year nursing students and two experienced nurses who had all worked as part of the early response to the pandemic. Meeting regularly online, the participants sought to explore the literature on nursing leadership as well as their own clinical experience and personal reflections of leadership during the pandemic. This process, which took place over a period of four months, also enabled the participants to examine their own leadership style. Four themes emerged from the group discussions: learning about and building on the history of nursing, the participants' role in nursing leadership, effective leadership during times of uncertainty and the role of communication in effective leadership.","Gerard Quinn, Barry; McLaughlin, Catherine; Bunting, Anna; McLaughlin, Lynsey; Scales, Susanna; Craig, Stephanie; Copeland, Shannon",Nurs Manag (Harrow),https://doi.org/10.7748/nm.2021.e1984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34002556/,68

686897,The structure of an infectious immature flavivirus redefines viral architecture and maturation,2021-05-14,"Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be associated with mortality and high morbidity worldwide. There is an extensive effort to control infection and disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. This study addressed the hypothesis that angiotensin II type I receptor blocker, Losartan, may restrict pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV-2 by decreasing viral-induced cytopathological changes by blocking angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), thus reducing the affinity of the virus for ACE2, and inhibiting papain-like protease of the virus. Method Losartan inhibitory effect on deubiquitination and deISGylation properties of papain-like protease was investigated using a fluorescence method and gel shift analysis determining its inhibitory effects. The inhibitory effect of Losartan on SARS-CoV-2 cell replication was investigated both when losartan was added to the cell culture 1 hour before (pre-infection group) and 1 hour after (post-infection group) SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells. Results Losartan treatment of Vero E6 cells prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication by 80% and 70% respectively. Losartan was not a strong deubiquitinase and deISGylase inhibitor of PLpro. Conclusion Losartan added pre- and post-infection to the Vero E6 cell culture significantly prevents cell destruction and replication by SARS-CoV2. Losartan has low side-effects, is readily available, and can be produced at high levels globally, all features of a promising drug in treatment of COVID-19 if validated by clinical trials.","Nejat, Reza; Sadr, Ahmad Shahir; Freitas, Brendan T.; Crabtree, Jackelyn; Pegan, Scott D.; Tripp, Ralph A.; Najafi, David J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.27.424507,68

Antiviral drugs can be classified according to their chemical nature (e.g., small-molecules, peptides, biologics) or mechanisms of drug actions against specific viral proteins (e.g., polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, glycoprotein inhibitors). This article provides an overview of antiviral classifications in 10 important human viruses: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), variola virus (human smallpox), varicella zoster virus (VZV), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","Li, Guangdi; Jing, Xixi; Zhang, Pan; De Clercq, Erik",Encyclopedia of Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128145159001260; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128145159001260,68
687239,The relationship between 25(OH) vitamin D levels and COVID-19 onset and disease course in Spanish patients,2021-06-06,"As the key precursors of O(3), anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) have been studied intensively. This paper performed a meta-analysis on the spatial and temporal variations of NMVOCs, their roles in photochemical reactions, and their sources in China, based on published research. The results showed that both non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) in China have higher mixing ratios in the eastern developed cities compared to those in the central and western areas. Alkanes are the most abundant NMHCs species in all reported sites while formaldehyde is the most abundant among the OVOCs. OVOCs have the highest mixing ratios in summer and the lowest in winter, which is opposite to NMHCs. Among all NMVOCs, the top eight species account for 50%–70% of the total ozone formation potential (OFP) with different compositions and contributions in different areas. In devolved regions, OFP-NMHCs are the highest in winter while OFP-OVOCs are the highest in summer. Based on positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and solvent usage in China are the main sources for NMHCs. However, the emission trend analysis showed that solvent usage and industrial emissions will exceed vehicle exhaust and become the two major sources of NMVOCs in near future. Based on the meta-analysis conducted in this work, we believe that the spatio-temporal variations and oxidation mechanisms of atmospheric OVOCs, as well as generating a higher spatial resolution of emission inventories of NMVOCs represent an area for future studies on NMVOCs in China.","Wang, Fanglin; Du, Wei; Lv, Shaojun; Ding, Zhijian; Wang, Gehui",Adv Atmos Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948045/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00376-021-0317-6,68
687822,Functional paper-based materials for diagnostics,2021-03-31,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SAR-CoV-2) has been shown to invade brain tissue. Based on the evolutionary similarity with SARS-CoV, researchers propose that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the olfactory bulb and gastrointestinal (GI) system through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. However, how SARS-CoV-2 causes neurological or GI symptoms is not clear. Many suggested intestinal and neural inflammations, caused by viral invasion, as the most likely reason for the GI and neurological symptoms; however, the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without neurological or GI symptoms indicate that this is not the case. The gut-brain axis could explain the reason for why some with COVID-19 do not have these symptoms. COVID-19 patients mostly show respiratory distress first, then diarrhea, anorexia, stroke, or loss of consciousness comes into view. Obviously, GI invasion is a mechanical process that begins with oral invasion and, therefore, most probably exists before the brain invasion, as indicated in case reports. However, when the GI tract is invaded, the virus may enter the central nervous system through vascular and lymphatic systems or the vagal nerve. SARS-CoV-2 can infect leukocytes and migrate with them into the brain, or the viral particles can be directly transported across the blood-brain barrier to the brain. Also, more recent research has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the peripheral lymphatic vessels connecting with the glymphatic system of the brain. The temporal correlation between neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms suggests the lymph vessels around the GI tract, the vascular system, or the gut-brain axis (enteric nervous system) as the most likely entry route for SARS-CoV-2 to the brain.","Bostancıklıoğlu, Mehmet",Inflamm Bowel Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ibd/izaa131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32440692/,68

Using the native pentapeptidyl-thioester substrates, GrsB PCP-TE catalyzes the dimerization and subsequent formation of the decapeptide lactam gramicidin S. Interestingly, the detection of linear decapeptidyl-SNAC as an enzyme-dependent intermediate supports the iterative mechanism in vivo, in which two pentapeptides, one bound as an ester to the active site serine of the TE domain and the second bound as a thioester to the adjacent pan-PCP, are ligated to a decapeptidyl-pan-PCP that subsequently transferred to the adjacent TE domain and cyclized. Moreover, GrsB PCP-TE can handle different substrates length, leading not only to dimerization, but also to trimerization and the formation of different ring sizes.","Hoyer, Katharina M.; Mahlert, Christoph; Marahiel, Mohamed A.",Chem Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074552106003930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17254948/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074552106003930,68
