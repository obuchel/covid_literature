310,310,310,Accurate noise projection for reduced stochastic epidemic models,13.193974,3.5201192,2009-10-29,"We consider a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model. Through the use of a normal form coordinate transform, we are able to analytically derive the stochastic center manifold along with the associated, reduced set of stochastic evolution equations. The transformation correctly projects both the dynamics and the noise onto the center manifold. Therefore, the solution of this reduced stochastic dynamical system yields excellent agreement, both in amplitude and phase, with the solution of the original stochastic system for a temporal scale that is orders of magnitude longer than the typical relaxation time. This new method allows for improved time series prediction of the number of infectious cases when modeling the spread of disease in a population. Numerical solutions of the fluctuations of the SEIR model are considered in the infinite population limit using a Langevin equation approach, as well as in a finite population simulated as a Markov process.","Forgoston, Eric; Billings, Lora; Schwartz, Ira B.",Chaos,145,1
618,618,618,Prediction of Peptide Reactivity with Human IVIg through a Knowledge-Based Approach,13.021957,3.44498,2011-08-24,"The prediction of antibody-protein (antigen) interactions is very difficult due to the huge variability that characterizes the structure of the antibodies. The region of the antigen bound to the antibodies is called epitope. Experimental data indicate that many antibodies react with a panel of distinct epitopes (positive reaction). The Challenge 1 of DREAM5 aims at understanding whether there exists rules for predicting the reactivity of a peptide/epitope, i.e., its capability to bind to human antibodies. DREAM 5 provided a training set of peptides with experimentally identified high and low reactivities to human antibodies. On the basis of this training set, the participants to the challenge were asked to develop a predictive model of reactivity. A test set was then provided to evaluate the performance of the model implemented so far. We developed a logistic regression model to predict the peptide reactivity, by facing the challenge as a machine learning problem. The initial features have been generated on the basis of the available knowledge and the information reported in the dataset. Our predictive model had the second best performance of the challenge. We also developed a method, based on a clustering approach, able to “in-silico” generate a list of positive and negative new peptide sequences, as requested by the DREAM5 “bonus round” additional challenge. The paper describes the developed model and its results in terms of reactivity prediction, and highlights some open issues concerning the propensity of a peptide to react with human antibodies.","Barbarini, Nicola; Tiengo, Alessandra; Bellazzi, Riccardo",PLoS One,145,11

In this study, we report ten novel compounds found by targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) using virtual screening and core hopping approaches. PPARs have drawn increasing attention for developing novel drugs to treat diabetes due to their unique functions in regulating glucose, lipid, and cholesterol metabolism. The reported compounds are featured with dual functions, and hence belong to the category of dual agonists. Compared with the single PPAR agonists, the dual PPAR agonists, formed by combining the lipid benefit of PPARα agonists (such as fibrates) and the glycemic advantages of the PPARγ agonists (such as thiazolidinediones), are much more powerful in treating diabetes because they can enhance metabolic effects while minimizing the side effects. This was observed in the studies on molecular dynamics simulations, as well as on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, that these novel dual agonists not only possessed the same function as ragaglitazar (an investigational drug developed by Novo Nordisk for treating type 2 diabetes) did in activating PPARα and PPARγ, but they also had more favorable conformation for binding to the two receptors. Moreover, the residues involved in forming the binding pockets of PPARα and PPARγ among the top ten compounds are explicitly presented, and this will be very useful for the in-depth conduction of mutagenesis experiments. It is anticipated that the ten compounds may become potential drug candidates, or at the very least, the findings reported here may stimulate new strategies or provide useful insights for designing new and more powerful dual-agonist drugs for treating type 2 diabetes.","Liu, Lei; Ma, Ying; Wang, Run-Ling; Xu, Wei-Ren; Wang, Shu-Qing; Chou, Kuo-Chen",Drug Des Devel Ther,145,1

Here we introduce and study an adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model wherein the infection and network coevolve with nontrivial probability to close triangles during edge rewiring, leading to substantial reinforcement of network transitivity. This model provides an opportunity to study the role of transitivity in altering the SIS dynamics on a coevolving network. Using numerical simulations and approximate master equations (AMEs), we identify and examine a rich set of dynamical features in the model. In many cases, AMEs including transitivity reinforcement provide accurate predictions of stationary-state disease prevalence and network degree distributions. Furthermore, for some parameter settings, the AMEs accurately trace the temporal evolution of the system. We show that higher transitivity reinforcement in the model leads to lower levels of infective individuals in the population, when closing a triangle is the dominant rewiring mechanism. These methods and results may be useful in developing ideas and modeling strategies for controlling SIS-type epidemics.","Lee, Hsuan-Wei; Malik, Nishant; Shi, Feng; Mucha, Peter J.",,145,1

The failure of patients to resolve the alveolar edema associated with these conditions is a major contributing factor to mortality; hence there is continued interest to understand the mechanisms of alveolar edema fluid clearance. DISCUSSION: The accompanying review by Vadász et al. details our current understanding of the signaling mechanisms and cellular processes that facilitate clearance of edema fluid from the alveolar compartment, and how these signaling processes may be exploited in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. To complement that report this review focuses on how intact organ and animal models and clinical studies have facilitated our understanding of alveolar edema fluid clearance in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, it considers how what we have learned from these animal and organ models and clinical studies has suggested novel therapeutic avenues to pursue.","Morty, Rory E.; Eickelberg, Oliver; Seeger, Werner",Intensive Care Med,145,1

In the movement model, some assumptions are made about its structure and the daily movement is decomposed into four types: neighborhood, intra region, inter region and random. The model is Geographical Information Systems (GIS) based, and uses real data to define its geometry.

Here, we present a detailed analysis of a previously proposed model that combines heterogeneity in the individuals with adaptive rewiring of the network structure in response to a disease. We show that in this model, qualitative changes in the dynamics occur in two phase transitions. In a macroscopic description, one of these corresponds to a local bifurcation, whereas the other one corresponds to a non-local heteroclinic bifurcation. This model thus provides a rare example of a system where a phase transition is caused by a non-local bifurcation, while both micro- and macro-level dynamics are accessible to mathematical analysis. The bifurcation points mark the onset of a behaviour that we call network inoculation. In the respective parameter region, exposure of the system to a pathogen will lead to an outbreak that collapses but leaves the network in a configuration where the disease cannot reinvade, despite every agent returning to the susceptible class. We argue that this behaviour and the associated phase transitions can be expected to occur in a wide class of models of sufficient complexity.","Yang, Hui; Rogers, Tim; Gross, Thilo",Chaos,145,1

Based on the contact process, we study numerically how weak ties influence the predictability of epidemic dynamics. We first investigate the effects of the degree of bridge nodes on the variabilities of both the arrival time and the prevalence of disease, and find out that the bridge node with a small degree can enhance the predictability of epidemic spreading. Once weak ties are settled, the variability of the prevalence will display a complete opposite trend to that of the arrival time, as the distance from the initial seed to the bridge node or the degree of the initial seed increases. More specifically, the further distance and the larger degree of the initial seed can induce the better predictability of the arrival time and the worse predictability of the prevalence. Moreover, we discuss the effects of the number of weak ties on the epidemic variability. As the community strength becomes very strong, which is caused by the decrease of the number of weak ties, the epidemic variability will change dramatically. Compared with the case of the hub seed and the random seed, the bridge seed can result in the worst predictability of the arrival time and the best predictability of the prevalence.","Shu, Panpan; Tang, Ming; Gong, Kai; Liu, Ying",Chaos,145,1

Based on the dynamical characteristics and traditional physical models, we construct several new bidirectional network models of spreading phenomena. By theoretical and numerical analysis of these models, we find that the collective behavior can inhibit spreading behavior, but, conversely, this spreading behavior can accelerate collective behavior. The spread threshold of spreading network is obtained by using the Lyapunov function method. The results show that an effective spreading control method is to enhance the individual awareness to collective behavior. Many real-world complex networks can be thought of in terms of both collective behavior and spreading dynamics and therefore to better understand and control such complex networks systems, our work may provide a basic framework.","Li, Kezan; Ma, Zhongjun; Jia, Zhen; Small, Michael; Fu, Xinchu",Chaos,145,1

However, the tolerance of human genomes to losing enhancers has not yet been evaluated. Here we present the catalog of LoF-tolerant enhancers using structural variants from whole-genome sequences. Using a conservative approach, we estimate that individual human genomes possess at least 28 LoF-tolerant enhancers on average. We assessed the properties of LoF-tolerant enhancers in a unified regulatory network constructed by integrating tissue-specific enhancers and gene-gene interactions. We find that LoF-tolerant enhancers tend to be more tissue-specific and regulate fewer and more dispensable genes relative to other enhancers. They are enriched in immune-related cells while enhancers with low LoF-tolerance are enriched in kidney and brain/neuronal stem cells. We developed a supervised learning approach to predict the LoF-tolerance of all enhancers, which achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 98%. We predict 3,519 more enhancers would be likely tolerant to LoF and 129 enhancers that would have low LoF-tolerance. Our predictions are supported by a known set of disease enhancers and novel deletions from PacBio sequencing. The LoF-tolerance scores provided here will serve as an important reference for disease studies.","Xu, Duo; Gokcumen, Omer; Khurana, Ekta",PLoS Genet,145,1

It is often the case, however, that discrete-time approaches are employed to analyze such models or to simulate them numerically. In such cases, time is discretized into uniform steps and transition rates between states are replaced by transition probabilities. In this paper, we illustrate potential limitations to this approach. We show how discretizing time leads to a restriction on the values of the model parameters that can accurately be studied. We examine numerical simulation schemes employed in the literature, showing how synchronous-type updating schemes can bias discrete-time formalisms when compared against continuous-time formalisms. Event-based simulations, such as the Gillespie algorithm, are proposed as optimal simulation schemes both in terms of replicating the continuous-time process and computational speed. Finally, we show how discretizing time can affect the value of the epidemic threshold for large values of the infection rate and the recovery rate, even if the ratio between the former and the latter is small.","Fennell, Peter G.; Melnik, Sergey; Gleeson, James P.",Phys Rev E,145,1

The model is intended to understand spread of influence, or any other spreading process implying a threshold dynamics, in setups of interconnected networks with significant clustering. The contagion is assumed to be general enough to account for a content-dependent linear threshold model, where each link type has a different weight (for spreading influence) that may depend on the content (e.g., product, rumor, political view) that is being spread. Using the generating functions formalism, we determine the conditions, probability, and expected size of the emergent global cascades. This analysis provides a generalization of previous approaches and is especially useful in problems related to spreading and percolation. The results present nontrivial dependencies between the clustering coefficient of the networks and its average degree. In particular, several phase transitions are shown to occur depending on these descriptors. Generally speaking, our findings reveal that increasing clustering decreases the probability of having global cascades and their size, however, this tendency changes with the average degree. There exists a certain average degree from which on clustering favors the probability and size of the contagion. By comparing the dynamics of complex contagions over multiplex networks and their monoplex projections, we demonstrate that ignoring link types and aggregating network layers may lead to inaccurate conclusions about contagion dynamics, particularly when the correlation of degrees between layers is high.","Zhuang, Yong; Arenas, Alex; Yağan, Osman",Phys Rev E,145,1

METHODS: We used the National Inpatient Sample to retrospectively identify all cases of ICH in the USA over the period 2004–2014. We used multivariable-adjusted models to compare odds of mortality between rural and urban hospitals. Joinpoint regression was used to evaluate trends in age- and sex-adjusted mortality in rural and urban hospitals over time. RESULTS: From 2004 to 2014, 5.8% of ICH patients were admitted in rural hospitals. Rural patients were older (mean [SE] 76.0 [0.44] years vs. 68.8 [0.11] years in urban), more likely to be white and have Medicare insurance. Age- and sex-adjusted mortality was greater in rural hospitals (32.2%) compared to urban patients (26.5%) (p value < 0.001). After multivariable adjustment, patients hospitalized in rural hospitals had two times the odds of in-hospital death compared to patients in urban hospitals (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.77–2.41. p value < 0.001). After joinpoint regression, mortality declined in urban hospitals by an average of 2.8% per year (average annual percentage change, [AAPC] − 2.8%, 95% CI − 3.7 to − 1.8%), but rates in rural hospitals remained unchanged (AAPC − 0.54%, 95% CI − 1.66 to 0.58%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite current efforts to reduce disparity in stroke care, ICH patients hospitalized in rural hospitals had two times the odds of dying compared to those in urban hospitals. In addition, the ICH mortality gap between rural and urban centers is increasing. Further studies are needed to identify and reverse the causes of this disparity.

The use of supraglottic airway (SGA) or laryngeal mask airway (LMA) as the primary airway device is increasing due to numerous advantages over tracheal intubation. Compared with 1st generation SGAs, 2nd generation SGAs have an added benefit of isolating the airway from the alimentary tract. However, the vertical profile of SGAs may encroach into the surgical field and hence interfere with surgery. We investigated the vertical projections of 1st generation SGAs (LMA Classic, Ambu AuraFlex) and commonly used 2nd generation SGAs in our institution (LMA ProSeal, LMA Supreme, LMA Protector, Ambu AuraGain and I-gel) in a manikin model. Each device was connected to a corrugated catheter mount or angled connector following insertion as per usual clinical practice in our institutions. Vertical projections of all devices were measured from the chin using a centimetre ruler. Securing of airway device to the chin with an adhesive tape was possible for the LMA Classic and Ambu AuraFlex with straight corrugated connector, whereas the stiffer 2nd generations SGAs required the addition of an angled connector or straight corrugated tubing to direct the airway tube caudally, away from the surgical field. The LMA ProSeal had the lowest vertical projection amongst the 2nd generation SGAs and may be the suitable choice for ophthalmic surgery. We also describe a novel technique of utilising a 1st generation SGA with placement of an orogastric tube, although with some reservations. This study has several limitations and transferability of our findings into clinical practice is questionable as the use of a manikin may not fully imitate the real condition of the patient. Our study is the first study comparing vertical projected height of different SGAs in manikin, but future studies should investigate the use of SGA in the clinical setting during ophthalmic surgery.","Seet, Edwin; Zhang, Jinbin; Macachor, Joselo; Kumar, Chandra M.",J Clin Monit Comput,145,11

The aim of this study was to generate and characterize ssDNA aptamers for the detection of Newcastle disease virus (NDV). These aptamers were selected using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) in combination with quantitative high-throughput DNA sequencing. After three rounds of selections, a highly enriched ssDNA pool was sequenced, and the results were analyzed using FASTAptamer Toolkit. Sequencing reads were sorted by copy numbers and clustered into groups, according to their sequence homology. Top aptameric sequences were used to develop a sandwich enzymatic linked aptamer assay (ELAA) for rapid and sensitive detection of NDV in farm samples. The selected aptamers have an affinity within the nanomolar range, and a high specificity with no cross-reactivity towards other avian viruses. Following optimization of the sandwich ELAA method, the results demonstrated that both selected aptamers Apt_NDV01 and Apt_NDV03 with dissociation constant values of 31 nM and 78.1 nM, respectively, showed the highest specificity and affinity for NDV detection. The ELAA results were verified by quantitative real-time PCR, demonstrating strong concordance, and showing outstanding accuracy for detection of NDV in field sample. In summary, combination of SELEX with high-throughput DNA sequencing allowed rapid screening and selection of aptamers. The selected aptamers allowed recognition of NDV with high affinities. This is the first report that uses a validated sandwich ELAA for rapid and specific detection of NDV in poultry samples.","Marnissi, Boutheina; Kamali-Moghaddam, Masood; Ghram, Abdeljelil; Hmila, Issam",PLoS One,145,1

Electron microscopy of the full-length ULK1 complex shows that the FIP200 coiled coil projects away from the crescent-shaped FIP200 N-terminal domain dimer. NDP52 allosterically stimulates membrane-binding by FIP200 and the ULK1 complex by promoting a more dynamic conformation of the membrane-binding portion of the FIP200 coiled coil. Giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) reconstitution confirmed that membrane recruitment by the ULK1 complex is triggered by NDP52 engagement.

No systematic learning of pathologies and their treatment options is possible because appropriate patient populations are often unavailable; instead of that healthy students examine each other. For this reason, we have developed a project to improve teaching at the medical faculty of the JWG University in Frankfurt/Main, which offers the opportunity for training in ophthalmoscopy using a newly developed online platform (EyesiNet) in addition to simulator training. Defined learning contents are reproducible and made equally available to everyone. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate a format for improving the teaching of direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy for students. Practical exercises on virtual reality-based simulators were intertwined with newly developed theoretical content adapted to the teaching catalog in the online platform EyesiNet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: On the first and last days of the internship, the students worked on cases in Eyesi Direct and Eyesi Indirect. In the meantime, they were able to deal with the theoretical basics of these ophthalmological clinical pictures in the web-based EyesiNet on a voluntary basis. RESULTS: Eyesi Direct: with p = 0.29, both groups had the same state of knowledge and did not have significantly different results in case processing on the first day of the internship. In the group without training (n = 54), a significant improvement in simulator training was observed on the last day of the practical training with p = 0.02 but with a small effect size of 0.1. Among the trainees (n = 32) a highly significant improvement with an effect size of 0.3 was observed with p = 0.0004. Eyesi Indirect: both groups had no significant difference in the stage of knowledge in the Eyesi Indirect at the beginning of the training period (p = 0.10). After training both groups performed slightly better but without significance (without training p = 0.41/with training p = 0.17).

Less is known about the association of caregiver strain with health behaviors among caregivers with diabetes, a disease that requires a high degree of self-care. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between caregiver strain and diabetes self-care among caregivers with diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted between July 13, 2018, and June 25, 2020, using data on 795 US caregivers aged 45 years or older with self-reported diabetes from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, which comprised 30 239 Black and White adults 45 years or older throughout the US enrolled from January 2003 to October 2007. EXPOSURES: Caregiver strain, assessed by self-report in response to the question, “How much of a mental or emotional strain is it to provide this care?” Response options were no strain, some strain, or a lot of (high) strain. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diabetes self-care, which was assessed across 4 domains (Mediterranean diet adherence, physical activity, smoking status, and medication adherence), and a composite self-care score summing performance across these domains. The association between caregiver strain and diabetes self-care was examined with multivariable Poisson regression adjusting for demographic, clinical, physical and mental functioning, and caregiving covariates. RESULTS: Among the 795 caregivers with diabetes included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 63.7 (8.6) years, 469 (59.0%) were women, and 452 (56.9%) were Black individuals. Overall, 146 caregivers (18.4%) reported high caregiver strain. In unadjusted models, high caregiver strain was associated with less physical activity (prevalence ratio [PR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.97), low medication adherence (PR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.94), and worse self-care (PR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.98). In adjusted models, the association between some and high caregiving strain with low medication adherence remained significant (adjusted PR: some strain, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78-0.99]; high strain, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69-0.99]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of US adult caregivers with diabetes, a high level of strain was associated with low medication adherence. Increased awareness of the prevalence of caregiver strain and potential ramifications on caregivers’ self-care appears to be warranted among health care professionals and caregivers.","King, Alexandra; Ringel, Joanna Bryan; Safford, Monika M.; Riffin, Catherine; Adelman, Ronald; Roth, David L.; Sterling, Madeline R.",JAMA Netw Open,145,1

The present study aims to explore oral immunization of recombinant Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecalis expressing Hexon protein of fowl adenovirus 4 (FAdV-4). The bacteria L. lactis NZ9000 and E. faecalis MDXEF-1 were, respectively, modified as host strain to deliver truncated Hexon protein (ΔHexon) or ΔHexon protein fusing with dendritic cell (DC) targeting peptide (DC-ΔHexon) on the surface of bacteria. The expression of target protein in L. lactis NZ9000 and E. faecalis MDXEF-1 were detected by western blot. To evaluate the immune responses and protective efficacies provided by the live recombinant bacteria, chickens were immunized with the constructed ΔHexon-expressing bacteria three times at 2-week intervals, then experimentally challenged with hypervirulent FAdV-4/GX01. The results showed that oral immunizations with the four ΔHexon-expressing bacteria (NZ9000/ΔHexon-CWA, NZ9000/DC-ΔHexon-CWA, MDXEF-1/ΔHexon-CWA, and MDXEF-1/DC-ΔHexon-CWA), especially the two bacteria carrying DC-targeting peptide, stimulated higher levels of ΔHexon-specific sera IgG and secretory IgA (sIgA) in jejunal lavage fluid, higher proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and higher levels of Th1/Th2-type cytokines, along with significantly decreased virus loads in liver and more offered protective efficacies against FAdV infection compared with PBS and empty vector control groups (p < 0.01). For chickens in the group MDXEF-1/DC-ΔHexon-CWA, the levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in sera, and the virus loads in livers were significantly decreased vs. the other three ΔHexon-expressing bacteria (p < 0.01). The pathological changes in the hearts, livers, spleens and kidneys of chickens in MDXEF-1/DC-ΔHexon-CWA group were relatively slight compared to infection control group and other three ΔHexon-expressing bacteria groups. The rate of protection in MDXEF-1/DC-ΔHexon-CWA group was 90%.

Several pathologic alterations have been described in the brain of AD patients, but the ultimate causative mechanisms of AD are still elusive. The classic hallmarks of AD, including amyloid plaques (Aβ) and tau tangles (tau), are the most studied features of AD. Unfortunately, all the efforts targeting these pathologies have failed to show the desired efficacy in AD patients so far. Neuroinflammation and impaired autophagy are two other main known pathologies in AD. It has been reported that these pathologies exist in AD brain long before the emergence of any clinical manifestation of AD. Microglia are the main inflammatory cells in the brain and are considered by many researchers as the next hope for finding a viable therapeutic target in AD. Interestingly, it appears that the autophagy and mitophagy are also changed in these cells in AD. Inside the cells, autophagy and inflammation interact in a bidirectional manner. In the current review, we briefly discussed an overview on autophagy and mitophagy in AD and then provided a comprehensive discussion on the role of these pathways in microglia and their involvement in AD pathogenesis.","Eshraghi, Mehdi; Adlimoghaddam, Aida; Mahmoodzadeh, Amir; Sharifzad, Farzaneh; Yasavoli-Sharahi, Hamed; Lorzadeh, Shahrokh; Albensi, Benedict C.; Ghavami, Saeid",Int J Mol Sci,145,1

One of the rodent malaria parasites is Plasmodium yoelii, and multiple P. yoelii strains or subspecies that cause different disease phenotypes have been widely employed in various studies. The genomes and transcriptomes of several P. yoelii strains have been analyzed and annotated, including the lethal strains of P. y. yoelii YM (or 17XL) and non-lethal strains of P. y. yoelii 17XNL/17X. Genomic DNA sequences and cDNA reads from another subspecies P. y. nigeriensis N67 have been reported for studies of genetic polymorphisms and parasite response to drugs, but its genome has not been assembled and annotated. RESULTS: We performed genome sequencing of the N67 parasite using the PacBio long-read sequencing technology, de novo assembled its genome and transcriptome, and predicted 5383 genes with high overall annotation quality. Comparison of the annotated genome of the N67 parasite with those of YM and 17X parasites revealed a set of genes with N67-specific orthology, expansion of gene families, particularly the homologs of the Plasmodium chabaudi erythrocyte membrane antigen, large numbers of SNPs and indels, and proteins predicted to interact with host immune responses based on their functional domains. CONCLUSIONS: The genomes of N67 and 17X parasites are highly diverse, having approximately one polymorphic site per 50 base pairs of DNA. The annotated N67 genome and transcriptome provide searchable databases for fast retrieval of genes and proteins, which will greatly facilitate our efforts in studying the parasite biology and gene function and in developing effective control measures against malaria.

Here, a new deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model is developed with attention architecture, namely DeepVISP, for accurately predicting oncogenic virus integration sites (VISs) in the human genome. Using the curated benchmark integration data of three viruses, hepatitis B virus (HBV), human herpesvirus (HPV), and Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV), DeepVISP achieves high accuracy and robust performance for all three viruses through automatically learning informative features and essential genomic positions only from the DNA sequences. In comparison, DeepVISP outperforms conventional machine learning methods by 8.43–34.33% measured by area under curve (AUC) value enhancement in three viruses. Moreover, DeepVISP can decode cis‐regulatory factors that are potentially involved in virus integration and tumorigenesis, such as HOXB7, IKZF1, and LHX6. These findings are supported by multiple lines of evidence in literature. The clustering analysis of the informative motifs reveales that the representative k‐mers in clusters could help guide virus recognition of the host genes.

A Multi-Experiment Study",13.274281,3.458521,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND: Many pathogens, including Yersinia pestis, cannot be consistently and reliably cultured from blood. New approaches are needed to facilitate the detection of proteins, nucleic acid and microorganisms in whole blood samples to improve downstream assay performance. Detection of biomarkers in whole blood is difficult due to the presence of host proteins that obscure standard detection mechanisms. Nanotrap® particles are micron-sized hydrogel structures containing a dye molecule as the affinity bait and used to detect host biomarkers, viral nucleic acids and proteins as well as some bacterial markers. Nanotraps have been shown to bind and enrich a wide variety of biomarkers and viruses in clinically relevant matrices such as urine and plasma. Our objective was to characterize the binding ability of Nanotrap particle type CN3080 to Y. pestis bacteria, bacterial proteins and nucleic acids from whole human blood in order to potentially improve detection and diagnosis. RESULTS: CN3080 Nanotraps bind tightly to Yersinia bacteria, even after washing, and we were able to visualize the co-localized Nanotraps and bacteria by electron microscopy. These magnetic hydrogel Nanotraps were able to bind Yersinia DNA, supporting the utility of Nanotraps for enhancing nucleic acid-based detection methods. Nanotraps were capable of increasing Y. pestis nucleic acid yield by fourfold from whole human blood compared to standard nucleic acid extraction. Interestingly, we found CN3080 Nanotraps to have a high affinity for multiple components of the Yersinia type III secretion system (T3SS), including chaperone proteins, Yop effector proteins and virulence factor protein LcrV (V). Using Nanotraps as a rapid upstream sample-prep tool, we were able to detect LcrV in human blood by western blotting with minimal blood interference in contrast to direct western blotting of blood samples in which LcrV was obscured. We were able to computationally model the interaction of LcrV with the CN3080 Nanotrap dye and found that it had a low delta-G, suggesting high affinity. Importantly, Nanotraps were also able to enhance detection of secreted Yersinia proteins by mass spectrometry. CONCLUSION: Upstream use of magnetic CN3080 Nanotrap particles may improve the downstream workflow though binding and enrichment of biomarkers and speed of processing. Utilization of Nanotrap particles can improve detection of Yersinia pestis proteins and nucleic acid from whole human blood and contribute to downstream assays and diagnostics including molecular methods such as sequencing and PCR and protein-based methods.

The effective management and prevention of this disease requires that it is detected early. Current TB diagnostic approaches, such as the culture, sputum smear, skin tuberculin, and molecular tests are time-consuming, and some are unaffordable for low-income countries. Rapid tests for disease biomarker detection are mostly based on immunological assays that use antibodies which are costly to produce, have low sensitivity and stability. Aptamers can replace antibodies in these diagnostic tests for the development of new rapid tests that are more cost effective; more stable at high temperatures and therefore have a better shelf life; do not have batch-to-batch variations, and thus more consistently bind to a specific target with similar or higher specificity and selectivity and are therefore more reliable. Advancements in TB research, in particular the application of proteomics to identify TB specific biomarkers, led to the identification of a number of biomarker proteins, that can be used to develop aptamer-based diagnostic assays able to screen individuals at the point-of-care (POC) more efficiently in resource-limited settings.","Martin, Darius Riziki; Sibuyi, Nicole Remaliah; Dube, Phumuzile; Fadaka, Adewale Oluwaseun; Cloete, Ruben; Onani, Martin; Madiehe, Abram Madimabe; Meyer, Mervin",Diagnostics (Basel),145,1

The major leading strand polymerase, DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was recently reported to have a [4Fe4S] cluster located within the catalytic domain of the largest subunit, Pol2. Here the redox characteristics of the [4Fe4S] cluster in the context of that domain, Pol2(CORE), are explored using DNA electrochemistry, and the effects of oxidation and rereduction on polymerase activity are examined. The exonuclease deficient variant D290A/E292A, Pol2(CORE)exo(–), was used to limit DNA degradation. While no redox signal is apparent for Pol2(CORE)exo(–) on DNA-modified electrodes, a large cathodic signal centered at −140 mV vs NHE is observed after bulk oxidation. A double cysteine to serine mutant (C665S/C668S) of Pol2(CORE)exo(–), which lacks the [4Fe4S] cluster, shows no similar redox signal upon oxidation. Significantly, protein oxidation yields a sharp decrease in polymerization, while rereduction restores activity almost to the level of untreated enzyme. Moreover, the addition of reduced EndoIII, a bacterial DNA repair enzyme containing [4Fe4S](2+), to oxidized Pol2(CORE)exo(–) bound to its DNA substrate also significantly restores polymerase activity. In contrast, parallel experiments with EndoIII(Y82A), a variant of EndoIII, defective in DNA charge transport (CT), does not show restoration of activity of Pol2(CORE)exo(–).

It has been estimated that approximately 5% of healthy individuals are asymptomatic carriers of HCMV in blood. Although isolation of this virus from blood is relatively easily accomplished in immunosuppressed individuals or from those with symptomatic HCMV-associated clinical conditions, efforts to recover virus from the blood of asymptomatic healthy carriers have been largely and repeatedly unsuccessful. Only one report has documented viremia in healthy individuals (in 1969 Diosi and associates reported recovery of HCMV from blood in 2 of 35 blood bank donors).¶In the course of studies of healthy pregnant adolescents in North Carolina and in Maryland, HCMV was recovered from the blood in 5 of 96 and 2 of 41 subjects respectively, or 5% in each population. There was no demonstrable association with prenatal transmission of HCMV, with subject well-being or outcome of pregnancy.¶The risk of HCMV reactivation in young pregnant women may relate to gestational and endocrine factors. It is also possible that reactivation of HCMV occurs most frequently soon after primary infection and that the risk of reactivation is inversely related to the elapsed time since virus acquisition. These observations may assist in defining risk factors for transfusion-related transmission as well as for reactivation and prenatal acquistion of HCMV.","Lang, David J; Kummer, John F; Zweig, Sherrie E; Lang, Mary J",Pediatr Res,145,1

Severe anemia can significantly increase the risk of death. Only a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion can rapidly treat a severe anemia. In stable PICU patients, RBC transfusion is probably not required if the hemoglobin concentration is above 7 g/dL, unless the patient has a cyanotic cardiac condition. The trigger or goal that should be used to direct RBC transfusion therapy in unstable critically ill children remains undetermined, although some data suggest that RBC transfusion may help in the early treatment of unstable patients with sepsis if their ScvO(2) is below 70 % after mechanical ventilation, fluid challenge, and inotropes/vasopressors perfusions have been initiated. Plasma and platelets are used to prevent or to treat hemorrhage attributable to a coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. The risks and benefits of plasma and platelet concentrates in PICU patients are discussed. There is almost no evidence at the present time that might permit a strong recommendation with regard to the use of plasma and platelets in PICU. Good knowledge of transfusion reactions is required in order to appropriately estimate the cost/benefit ratio of transfusion. Nowadays, non-infectious serious hazards of transfusion (NISHOT) are more frequent and more challenging for pediatric intensivists than transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases. The decision to prescribe a transfusion must be tailored to individual needs and repeated clinical evaluation of each critically ill child.","Tucci, Marisa; Lacroix, Jacques; Gauvin, France; Toledano, Baruch; Robitaille, Nancy",Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,145,1

As a global language, English has developed in interesting ways via social media and the Internet all over the world. However, it is only in special polities such as Singapore where it is used as the ‘working language’ of the country for a multilingual population base, that English has developed into a phenomenon that has to be studied, better understood and perhaps given a label such as ‘glocal English.’ The chapter will contribute to the ongoing discussions of what it means for English to be a global language and how it adapts as ‘a communicative tool of immense political, ideological, and economic power’(Kachru, Kontalinguistik, 1996, pp. 906–913) in global-local tensions (e.g. commerce, trade, finance, industry, science and technology versus intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic communication within Singapore). In the shifting perspectives of what English is (really global or truly local?), what it does (for and in education), and how it is used in this country (globally and/or locally), the paper hopes to elucidate the dimensions of teaching and learning English in the Singapore context and perhaps more widely in an Asia-Pacific context.","Pakir, Anne",Dynamic Ecologies,145,17

Prophylaxis is a key element in the management of these patients, and is composed by two main components: infection control measures and antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. Infection control measures are safe, but not always effective. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is usually effective but may increase resistance rates, toxicity, and cost. Therefore, a careful evaluation of the actual risk for infection, the pathogens that predominate in a particular setting, and the periods at risk are important in order to define the most appropriate strategy. In this chapter we review the most important parameters to assess the risk on an individual basis, and the evidences and recommendations supporting infection control measures and antimicrobial prophylaxis against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites.","Nucci, Marcio; Anaissie, Elias J.",Neoplastic Diseases of the Blood,145,1

The mummified skeletal remains of Peruvian Incas, dating about 2,400 years ago, contained lesions suggestive of malignant melanoma. The term “cancer” goes back to Hippocrates (460–370 BC), who named a group of diseases καρκινοσ and καρκινομα, the ancient Greek word for crab.

Enteroviruses and adenoviruses are the most common etiologic agents. Viral myocarditis is a triphasic process. Phase 1 is the period of active viral replication in the myocardium during which the symptoms of myocardial damage range from none to cardiogenic shock. If the disease process continues, it enters phase 2, which is characterized by autoimmunity triggered by viral and myocardial proteins. Heart failure often appears for the first time in phase 2. Phase 3, dilated cardiomyopathy, is the end result in some patients. Diagnostic procedures and treatment should be tailored to the phase of disease. Viral myocarditis is a significant cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, as proved by the frequent presence of viral genomic material in the myocardium, and by improvement in ventricular function by immunomodulatory therapy. Myocarditis of any etiology usually presents with heart failure, but the second most common presentation is ventricular arrhythmia. As a result, myocarditis is one of the most common causes of sudden death in young people and others without preexisting structural heart disease. Myocarditis can be definitively diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy. However, it is clear that existing criteria for the histologic diagnosis need to be refined, and that a variety of molecular markers in the myocardium and the circulation can be used to establish the diagnosis. Treatment of myocarditis has been generally disappointing. Accurate staging of the disease will undoubtedly improve treatment in the future. It is clear that immunosuppression and immunomodulation are effective in some patients, especially during phase 2, but may not be as useful in phases 1 and 3. Since myocarditis is often selflimited, bridging and recovery therapy with circulatory assistance may be effective. Prevention by immunization or receptor blocking strategies is under development. Giant cell myocarditis is an unusually fulminant form of the disease that progresses rapidly to heart failure or sudden death. Rapid onset of disease in young people, especially those with other autoimmune manifestations, accompanied by heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias, suggests giant cell myocarditis. Peripartum cardiomyopathy in economically developed countries is usually the result of myocarditis.","Mason, Jay W.; Trehan, Sanjeev; Renlund, Dale G.",Cardiovascular Medicine,145,1

These feature vectors (graph descriptors) are used to measure the pairwise similarity between graphs. This enables applying data mining algorithms (e.g classification, clustering, or anomaly detection) on graph-structured data which have numerous applications in multiple domains. State-of-the-art algorithms for computing descriptors require the entire graph to be in memory, entailing a huge memory footprint, and thus do not scale well to increasing sizes of real-world networks. In this work, we propose streaming algorithms to efficiently approximate descriptors by estimating counts of sub-graphs of order [Formula: see text], and thereby devise extensions of two existing graph comparison paradigms: the Graphlet Kernel and NetSimile. Our algorithms require a single scan over the edge stream, have space complexity that is a fraction of the input size, and approximate embeddings via a simple sampling scheme. Our design exploits the trade-off between available memory and estimation accuracy to provide a method that works well for limited memory requirements. We perform extensive experiments on real-world networks and demonstrate that our algorithms scale well to massive graphs.","Hassan, Zohair Raza; Shabbir, Mudassir; Khan, Imdadullah; Abbas, Waseem",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,145,1

In particular, we focus on multi-player, skill-based card games, and use Rummy as a case study. GAIM framework provides a novel and extensible encapsulation of the game state as an image, and uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to learn these images to calibrate the goodness of the state, in such a way that the challenges arising from multiple players, chance factors and large state space, are all abstracted. We show that our model out-performs well-known image classification models, and also learns the nuances of the game without explicitly training with game-specific features, resulting in a true state model, wherein most of the misclassifications can be attributed to user mistakes or genuinely confusing hands. We show that GAIM helps gather fine-grained insights about player behavior, skill, tendencies, and business implications, that were otherwise not possible, thereby enabling targeted services and personalized player journeys.

High-velocity streams and operating costs, restrict these systems to examining only a sample of the activity. Current solutions use manual policies to decide which transactions to monitor. This limits the diversity of the data collected, creating a “filter bubble” over representing specific subsets of the data such as high-risk users and under-representing the rest of the population which may never be sampled. In recommendation systems, Bandit algorithms have recently been used to address this problem. We propose addressing the sampling for database activity monitoring problem as a recommender system. In this work, we redefine the data sampling problem as a special case of the multi-armed bandit problem and present a novel algorithm, C–[Formula: see text]–Greedy, which combines expert knowledge with random exploration. We analyze the effect of diversity on coverage and downstream event detection using simulated data. In doing so, we find that adding diversity to the sampling using the bandit-based approach works well for this task, maximizing population coverage without decreasing the quality in terms of issuing alerts about events, and outperforming policies manually crafted by experts and other sampling methods.","Grushka-Cohen, Hagit; Biller, Ofer; Sofer, Oded; Rokach, Lior; Shapira, Bracha",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,145,1

Ontario’s mid-stakes tests were meant to ensure accountability and transparency, and assure system-wide improvement, while avoiding the negative effects and perverse incentives of their high-stakes counterparts. The paper provides new evidence from two projects covering almost a 10-year time-span in 10 of Ontario’s 72 school districts. It shows that even though mid-stakes testing is milder in its manifestations and effects than high-stakes testing, concerns remain about the need for and side effects of such testing. The findings concern two periods of Ontario educational reform. In the first period, with a specific focus on improving performance in literacy and mathematics, administrators and special education support staff felt that the assessments raised teachers’ expectations and sense of urgency leading to steady improvements in measured achievement, but that there was also evidence of negative effects, especially on paying undue attention to “bubble” students just below the threshold for minimum proficiency. In the second reform period focused on broad excellence, well-being and equity as inclusion, mid-stakes tests were perceived as having more widespread negative effects. These included teaching to the test, cultural bias, avoidance of innovation, dilemmas of whether to include highly vulnerable students in the testing process or not, and emotional ill-being among students and teachers. The paper concludes that Ontario’s twentieth century system of large scale, mid-stakes assessment has not kept pace with its twenty first century commitments to deeper learning and stronger well-being.","Hargreaves, A.",J Educ Change,145,17

Interests are represented by on-line social groups in VK social network, which were marked by topics. Topic significance to a person is supposed to be related to the fraction of representative groups in user’s subscription list. We imply that for each topic, depending on its popularity, relation to geographical region, and social acceptability, there is a value of group size which is significant. In addition, we suppose, that professional clusters of groups demonstrate relatively higher inner density and unify common groups. Therefore, following groups from more specific clusters indicate higher personal involvement to a topic – in this way, representative topical groups are marked. We build social group similarity graph, which is based on the number of common followers, extract subgraphs related to a single topic, and analyse bins of groups, build with increase of group sizes. Results show topics of general interests have higher density at larger groups in contrast to specific interests, which is in correspondence with initial hypothesis.","Vaganov, Danila; Bardina, Mariia; Guleva, Valentina",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,145,1

Two methods, using the similarity (distance) to the reference instances and class imbalance ratio to select the most confident classifier for a given observation, have been proposed. Both approaches come in two modes, one based on the k-Nearest Oracles (knora) and the other also considering those cases where the classifier makes a mistake. The proposed methods were evaluated based on computer experiments carried out on [Image: see text] datasets with a high imbalance ratio.

Effective ssl imposes structural assumptions on the data, e.g. that neighbors are more likely to share a classification or that the decision boundary lies in an area of low density. For complex and high-dimensional data, neural networks can learn feature embeddings to which traditional ssl methods can then be applied in what we call hybrid methods. Previously-developed hybrid methods iterate between refining a latent representation and performing graph-based ssl on this representation. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid method that instead applies low-density separation to the embedded features. We describe it in detail and discuss why low-density separation may better suited for ssl on neural network-based embeddings than graph-based algorithms. We validate our method using in-house customer survey data and compare it to other state-of-the-art learning methods. Our approach effectively classifies thousands of unlabeled users from a relatively small number of hand-classified examples.","Burkhart, Michael C.; Shan, Kyle",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,145,1

The decisive determinants of hantavirus-associated pathogenicity are still enigmatic. Pathogenic hantavirus species, such as Puumala virus (PUUV), Hantaan virus (HTNV), Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV), and Sin Nombre virus (SNV), are associated with significant case fatality rates. In contrast, Tula virus (TULV) only sporadically causes mild disease in immunocompetent humans and Prospect Hill virus (PHV) so far has not been associated with any symptoms. They are thus defined here as low pathogenic/apathogenic hantavirus species. We found that productive infection of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), such as monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), correlated well with the pathogenicity of hantavirus species tested. HTNV (intermediate case fatality rates) replicated more efficiently than PUUV (low case fatality rates) in myeloid cells, whereas low pathogenic/apathogenic hantavirus species did not produce any detectable virus titers. Analysis of PHPUV, a reassortant hantavirus derived from a pathogenic (PUUV) and an apathogenic (PHV) hantavirus species, indicated that the viral glycoproteins are not decisive for replication in MPS cells. Moreover, blocking acidification of endosomes with chloroquine decreased the number of TULV genomes in myeloid cells suggesting a post-entry block for low pathogenic/apathogenic hantavirus species in myeloid cells. Intriguingly, pathogenic but not low pathogenic/apathogenic hantavirus species induced conversion of monocytes into inflammatory DCs. The proinflammatory programming of MPS cells by pathogenic hantavirus species required integrin signaling and viral replication. Our findings indicate that the capacity to replicate in MPS cells is a prominent feature of hantaviral pathogenicity.","Raftery, Martin J.; Lalwani, Pritesh; Lütteke, Nina; Kobak, Lidija; Giese, Thomas; Ulrich, Rainer G.; Radosa, Lukas; Krüger, Detlev H.; Schönrich, Günther",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,145,33

The ultraviolet system will decontaminate the chamber once the person has moved out. The system is controlled electronically by sensors and actuators. The sensors fixed in the chamber detect the entry of a person and initiates the hydrogen peroxide atomization process. The person is required to walk through the chamber. When the person exits the chamber, the system will put off the hydrogen peroxide atomization system and will turn on the UV lamp inside the chamber to decontaminate it. The ultraviolet system will be ON for a predefined time and after the process, the next person can enter the walkway. The whole process takes a maximum of 40 s. The safety and efficacy of the system have been validated experimentally through both in vivo and in vitro studies.","Krishnan, Jithin; Subhash, N. N.; Muraleedharan, C. V.; Mohanan, P.

This can be attributed to the fact that in many traditional educational systems, students are primarily involved in just answering assessment items. In recent years, the use of crowdsourcing to support learning at scale has received significant attention. In crowdsourcing educational systems, in addition to attempting assessment items, students are engaged with other various tasks such as creating resources, creating solutions, rating the quality of resources, and giving feedback. Past studies have demonstrated that engaging students in meaningful crowdsourcing tasks, also referred to as learningsourcing, has pedagogical benefits that can enhance student learning. In this paper, we present a learner model that leverages data from students’ learnersourcing contributions alongside attempting assessment items towards modelling of students’ knowledge state. Results from an empirical study suggest that indeed crowdsourced contributions from students can effectively be used in modelling learners.","Abdi, Solmaz; Khosravi, Hassan; Sadiq, Shazia",Artificial Intelligence in Education,145,1

Among the many factors that influence the development of such skills, the literature shows that the executive function of inhibition – i.e. the blocking out or tuning out of information or action that is irrelevant to the learning task – is one of the most important. There are many tests to assess children’s inhibition skills; however, such tests are generally time-consuming and have a short lifespan. In this context, we propose a computational approach to model children’s inhibition skills by using only student traces from a learning app as input. We propose a mathematical formalization of three related inhibition features, which could be used as input to classification algorithms.","Medeiros Machado, Guilherme; Bonnin, Geoffray; Castagnos, Sylvain; Hoareau, Lara; Thomas, Aude; Tazouti, Youssef",Artificial Intelligence in Education,145,1

This module is intended to shape a personalized learning path through the e-learning system.

The obstacle is the relatively small amount of data, in the form of available assessments, which is needed to train the neural network. The specifity of each subject/course taught requires the preparation of a separate neural network. The paper proposes a new method of data augmentation, Asynchronous Data Augmentation through Pre-Categorization (ADAPC), which solves this problem.

While there are opportunities to create automated systems to help instructors personalize their interventions, much care must be taken to prevent the introduction of unintended outcomes. In this study, we designed a weekly personalized intervention cycle based on students’ self-reports. The effect of such personalized intervention was then evaluated using a repeated measure ANOVA. Findings suggest that students receiving personalized interventions were more time efficient in makerspaces and on assignments. Additionally, they reported a lower level of frustration. Students with personalized intervention, however, expressed a lower sense of community. This suggests that while additional data provided to instructors can support personalized assistance, a more nuanced approach may be needed to avoid unintended consequences.","Chng, Edwin; Zeylikman, Sofya; Schneider, Bertrand",Artificial Intelligence in Education,145,1

One recent study found that while students experience more confusion and frustration (confrustion) when working with erroneous examples, they demonstrate better retention of decimal concepts. In this study, we investigated whether this finding could be replicated in a digital learning game. In the erroneous examples (ErrEx) version of the game, students saw a character play the games and make mistakes, and then they corrected the characters’ errors. In the problem solving (PS) version, students played the games by themselves. We found that confrustion was significantly, negatively correlated with performance in both pretest (r = −.62, p < .001) and posttest (r = −.68, p < .001) and so was gaming the system (pretest r = −.58, p < .001, posttest r = −.66, p < .001). Posthoc (Tukey) tests indicated that students who did not see any erroneous examples (PS-only) experienced significantly lower levels of confrustion (p < .001) and gaming (p < .001). While we did not find significant differences in post-test performance across conditions, our findings show that students working with erroneous examples experience consistently higher levels of confrustion in both game and non-game contexts.","Mogessie, Michael; Elizabeth Richey, J.; McLaren, Bruce M.; Andres-Bray, Juan Miguel L.; Baker, Ryan S.",Artificial Intelligence in Education,145,1

Determinants of corporate bond spreads substantially differ between COVID-19 and normal times. Most prominently, asset tangibility has a highly significant negative effect on spreads during normal times. During COVID-19, this is reversed, especially in industries heavily affected by lockdown measures, reflecting the inflexibility associated with fixed assets. A different picture emerges for equity issues, which slowed considerably during the first 4 weeks of the pandemic, before accelerating again.

One of the latest trends seen in the retailing industry is the implementation of an omnichannel business strategy. As a result, the number of businesses now implementing such a strategy has led to a lack of differentiation amongst competitors. Therefore, it is no surprise that omnichannel retailers have had to rethink and acquire a new competitive advantage through the exploration of new and innovative strategic activities. Prior work on services has shown gamification to be a successful strategy in enhancing customer loyalty, promoting positive word-of-mouth, and enhancing greater engagement with the offered service. Also, offering hedonic values (one of gamification’s main premises) has been an effective strategy for engaging customers as well as promoting repeat purchase intentions. Despite this, the potential effects of gamification within an omnichannel setting is not yet explored, and thus the rationale of this study. In exploring this gap, we employed means-end chain theory as a basis in which to discover the potential of gamification. Additionally, as gamification is a novel method in omnichannel research, this paper strived to explore the moderating effect of the novelty-seeking traits and unobserved heterogeneous behaviors of consumers. This research was based on 440 valid questionnaires in a survey dataset from Amazon M-Turk. The results provided strong evidence of the underlying proposition within the research models. Specifically, this study showed that gamification could be a potential unique feature used for engaging consumers onto one’s platform, especially consumers with a novelty-seeking trait. We did, however, find that this finding does not apply to the case for all consumers. Therefore, the implication of this research suggests to practitioners that its implementation should be approached through an opt-in rather than a compulsory option.","Kim, Cheong; Costello, Francis Joseph; Lee, Kun Chang",Front Psychol,145,16

However, the diagnosis of influenza is not accurate based on clinical evidence, as the symptoms of flu are similar to other respiratory virus. The lateral-flow assay is a rapid method to detect influenza virus. But the effectiveness of the technique in detecting flu viruses is unclear. Hence, a meta-analysis would be performed to evaluate the accuracy of LFA in detecting influenza virus. METHODS: Relevant literature was searched out in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases with the keywords “lateral flow assay” and “flu virus”. By Meta-DiSc software, pooled sensitivity, pooled specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC), and area under the curve (AUC) can be calculated. RESULTS: This meta-analysis contains 13 studies and 24 data. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the influenza virus detected by LFA were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82-0.86) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.97-0.98), respectively. The pooled values of PLR, NLR, DOR, and SROC were 32.68 (17.16-62.24), 0.17 (0.13-0.24), 334.07 (144.27-773.53), and 0.9877. No publication bias was found. CONCLUSIONS: LFA exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing influenza virus. It is a valuable alternative method which can diagnose influenza virus quickly.

We include environmental, economic, medical, and policy variables in our analysis to explain the number of corona cases and deaths per million. We find a significant positive impact of local air pollution on infection rates in the whole sample and on fatality rates for OECD countries. Obesity rates have a positive effect on cases and deaths across the different estimation equations. The strategy of aiming to achieve herd immunity has a significant positive effect on infections as well as on death rates. The first affected countries have significantly higher mortality rates, revealing the lack of experience and medical capacity to deal with the pandemic in an initial phase. Postponing – and fighting - the pandemic could save lives in many countries and generate considerable economic benefits. Other medical and policy variables discussed in the public sphere do not show a significant impact in the regression analysis. Our results suggest that improving air quality and fighting obesity helps reduce the negative effects of a coronavirus pandemic significantly.

Several studies have highlighted that the presence of human-like physical features could lead both adults and children to anthropomorphize the robots. In the present study we aimed to compare the attribution of mental states to two humanoid robots, NAO and Robovie, which differed in the degree of anthropomorphism. Children aged 5, 7, and 9 years were required to attribute mental states to the NAO robot, which presents more human-like characteristics compared to the Robovie robot, whose physical features look more mechanical. The results on mental state attribution as a function of children’s age and robot type showed that 5-year-olds have a greater tendency to anthropomorphize robots than older children, regardless of the type of robot. Moreover, the findings revealed that, although children aged 7 and 9 years attributed a certain degree of human-like mental features to both robots, they attributed greater mental states to NAO than Robovie compared to younger children. These results generally show that children tend to anthropomorphize humanoid robots that also present some mechanical characteristics, such as Robovie. Nevertheless, age-related differences showed that they should be endowed with physical characteristics closely resembling human ones to increase older children’s perception of human likeness. These findings have important implications for the design of robots, which also needs to consider the user’s target age, as well as for the generalizability issue of research findings that are commonly associated with the use of specific types of robots.","Manzi, Federico; Peretti, Giulia; Di Dio, Cinzia; Cangelosi, Angelo; Itakura, Shoji; Kanda, Takayuki; Ishiguro, Hiroshi; Massaro, Davide; Marchetti, Antonella",Front Psychol,145,24

Time- and progression-based CE indices have been proposed for localization of SB lesions. This systematic review analysed the role of CE transit indicators in choosing the insertion route for double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE). Methods A comprehensive literature search identified papers assessing the role of CE on the choice of the route selection for DBE. Data on CE, criteria for route selection, and DBE success parameters were retrieved and analyzed according to the PRISMA statement. Risk of bias was assessed through the STROBE assessment. The primary outcome evaluated was DBE success rate in reaching a SB lesion, measured as the ratio of positive initial DBE to the number of total DBE. Results Seven studies including 262 CEs requiring subsequent DBE were selected. Six studies used time-based indices and one used the PillCam Progress indicator. SB lesions were identified and insertion route was selected according to a specific cut-off, using fixed landmarks for defining SB transit except for one study in which the mouth-cecum transit was considered. DBE success rate was high in all studies, ranging from 78.3 % to 100 %. Six of seven studies were high quality. Conclusions The precise localization of SB lesions remains an open issue, and larger studies are required to determine the most accurate index for selecting the DBE insertion route. In the future, 3 D localization technologies and tracking systems will be essential to accomplish this tricky task.","Cortegoso Valdivia, Pablo; Skonieczna-Żydecka, Karolina; Pennazio, Marco; Rondonotti, Emanuele; Marlicz, Wojciech; Toth, Ervin; Koulaouzidis, Anastasios",Endosc Int Open,145,1

However, the transport of oxygen down, and carbon dioxide up, the airway is governed by subtle transport processes which hitherto have been difficult to quantify. We investigate one of these mechanisms in detail, nonlinear mean streaming, and the impact of the onset of turbulence on this streaming, via direct numerical simulations of a model 1:2 bifurcating pipe. This geometry is investigated as a minimal unit of the fractal structure of the airway. We first quantify the amount of gas recirculated via mean streaming by measuring the recirculating flux in both the upper and lower branches of the bifurcation. For conditions modeling the trachea-to-bronchi bifurcation of an infant, we find the recirculating flux is of the order of 3–5% of the peak flux . We also show that for conditions modeling the upper generations, the mean recirculation regions extend a significant distance away from the bifurcation, certainly far enough to recirculate gas between generations. We show that this mean streaming flow is driven by the formation of longitudinal vortices in the flow leaving the bifurcation. Second, we show that conditional turbulence arises in the upper generations of the airway. This turbulence appears only in the flow leaving the bifurcation, and at a point in the cycle centered around the maximum instantaneous flow rate. We hypothesize that its appearance is due to an instability of the longitudinal-vortices structure.","Jacob, Chinthaka; Tingay, David G.; Leontini, Justin S.",Theor Comput Fluid Dyn,145,16

Red cell distribution width (RDW) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are prognostic factors to mortality in different diseases. The aim of this study is to evaluate prognostic efficiency RDW, NLR, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for mortality prediction in respiratory patients with VAP. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six patients mechanically ventilated and developed VAP were included. Clinical characteristics and SOFA score on the day of admission and at diagnosis of VAP, RDW, and NLR were assessed and correlated to mortality. The average age of patients was 58.80 ± 10.53. These variables had a good diagnostic performance for mortality prediction AUC 0.811 for SOFA at diagnosis of VAP, 0.777 for RDW, 0.728 for NLR, and 0.840 for combined of NLR and RDW. The combination of the three parameters demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance (AUC 0.889). A positive correlation was found between SOFA at diagnosis of VAP and RDW (r = 0.446, P < 0.000) and with NLR (r = 0.220, P < 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: NLR and RDW are non-specific inflammatory markers that could be calculated quickly and easily via routine hemogram examination. These markers have comparable prognostic accuracy to severity scores. Consequently, RDW and NLR are simple, yet promising markers for ICU physicians in monitoring the clinical course, assessment of organ dysfunction, and predicting mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. Therefore, this study recommends the use of blood biomarkers with the one of the simplest ICU score (SOFA score) in the rapid diagnosis of critical patients as a daily works in ICU.","Abdelaleem, Nermeen A.; Makhlouf, Hoda A.; Nagiub, Eman M.; Bayoumi, Hassan A.",Egypt J Bronchol,145,1

Since oil and gas resources are found in remote areas whereby host communities neither possess the sophisticated skills nor the expensive technology to play part in the oil and gas industry, it is important for local content policies to have the tenets of justice for the purpose of cracking through the enclave of the oil and gas industry without creating an elite cluster. Therefore, local content policies will recognise marginalised communities, follow the right procedures under law taking into account the different peculiar factors within the context of different communities, as well as avail an equal distribution of ills and benefits of the oil and gas resources. This chapter introduces energy justice as a pivotal component in local content design, adaptation and implementation in developing oil and gas economies.

The article describes the requirements for the image of an academic speaker under conditions of uncertainty. Criteria for forming an online speaker’s image in modern information and communication space are considered. The significance of changing the status of an academic speaker-lecturer and student-listener as participants in the communication act in a digital environment is studied. It is concluded that the space of uncertainty has created a new image of an academic speaker with a number of distinctive features and peculiarities. Purpose of Work. The aim of the undertaken research is to identify and describe the fundamental changes that have influenced the formation of a new type of academic speaker and to determine the peculiarities of his perception by the audience in the context of virtual communication. The goal required solving the following interrelated tasks: to investigate the conditions for the formation of an academic online speaker; to identify the distinctive features of the online speaker from other types of speakers; to analyze the process of adapting a new type of academic speaker to the virtual communication environment in the distance learning format. Methodologies and Techniques. To achieve the goal of research and solve the identified problems the following methods were used: the method of system description (as the main one), the method of comparative analysis, the method of linguistic observation and the method of frontal survey. A frontal survey of the second-year students of Department of Law of the Don State Technical University was used as an empirical basis for the study, in which 150 recipients took part. Results.

Traditionally, the activities taken place in oceans and seas were related to fishery and transport of goods and people. Today, offshore energy production – oil, gas, and wind, aquaculture, and sea-based tourism are important contributors to the global economy. This creates competition and conflicts between various uses and requires an overall regulation and planning. Maritime activities generate pressures on the marine ecosystems, and in many areas severe impacts can be observed. Maritime spatial planning is seen as an instrument to manage the seas and oceans in a more sustainable way, but information and tools are needed.

Calude et al.’s recent quasipolynomial-time parity game solving algorithm essentially shows how to compute the same fixpoint in only quasipolynomially many iterations by reducing parity games to quasipolynomially sized safety games. Universal graphs have been used to modularize this transformation of parity games to equivalent safety games that are obtained by combining the original game with a universal graph. We show that this approach naturally generalizes to the computation of solutions of systems of any fixpoint equations over finite lattices; hence, the solution of fixpoint equation systems can be computed by quasipolynomially many iterations of the equations. We present applications to modal fixpoint logics and games beyond relational semantics. For instance, the model checking problems for the energy [Formula: see text] -calculus, finite latticed [Formula: see text] -calculi, and the graded and the (two-valued) probabilistic [Formula: see text] -calculus – with numbers coded in binary – can be solved via nested fixpoints of functions that differ substantially from the function for parity games but still can be computed in quasipolynomial time; our result hence implies that model checking for these [Formula: see text] -calculi is in [Formula: see text] .

The large volumes of epidemiological, clinical, personal, and environmental data generated during any pandemic can provide useful insights about the underlying causes, symptoms, relations, and correlations, which if analyzed can assist in mitigating the impact to a great extent. The cheap and easy connectivity and communication provided by the social media platforms (SMP) have established them as one of the most preferred mediums of communications among the masses. The data generated by these platforms can be analyzed in context of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis to provide critical information and insights related to the ground level realities like spread and severity of infection, the state of implementation of control measures, the mental state of individuals, and their needs. The tweets and comments of the users can provide information about the current situation and intensity of the problems in the affected regions. With the help of techniques like sentiment analysis and web mining, we can identify the emergent requirements and needs (like food, shelter, medicine, medical emergencies, security, etc.) of the population in the COVID-19-affected areas. With this chapter we aim to identify several use cases where the big medical data from the patients, epidemiological data, social media data, and environment-related data can be used to identify patterns, causes, and other growing factors of the COVID-19 pandemic with a goal to mitigate the damages and contain further spread of the disease. The chapter also discusses the impact of a preferred mitigation measure of nationwide lockdown on the number of new novel coronavirus-positive patients as well as the impact on the environment by analyzing the available data. Since the tourism industry is now of the worst hit businesses, we also discussed the impact of COVID-19 on tourism industry. Furthermore, we identify the challenges associated with handling the massive amount of data generated during such pandemics. Finally, the future avenues of using big data for effectively devising predictive mechanisms and techniques to contain such pandemics in the initial stages are discussed.

Regardless of the significance of this sector, it is often an under-researched branch of the tourism industry. For example, there is barely a study on how the previous epidemics and pandemics affected this critical sector. This study, therefore, investigates the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on entertainment (music, television and special events). Using archival and secondary data from authoritative sources, the study showed that the impact of the pandemic was devastating on the sector, leading to multibillion-dollar losses for global entertainment companies. Global entertainment companies such as Walt Disney World and Box Office suffered massive losses, which forced several companies to furlough employees and executives in the battle for survival and to protect capital. The study also showed that the pandemic disrupted both the demand side and the supply side of business in the entertainment sector, which resulted in cancellations of festivals and film production at a time of surging demand for entertainment. Given the nature of the pandemic, 2020 proved to be a challenging year for many entertainment companies – a situation likely to play out for the next 2–3 years as companies battle to recover.

The pandemic of NCOV-19 (novel coronavirus-19) has been engaged as a public health disaster of overall distress by the World Health Organization. Different pandemic models for NCOV-19 are being exploited by researchers all over the world to acquire experienced assessments and impose major control measures. Among the standard techniques for NCOV-19 global outbreak prediction, epidemiological and simple statistical techniques have attained more concern by researchers. Insufficiency and deficiency of health tests for identifying a solution became a major difficulty in controlling the spread of NCOV-19. To solve this problem, deep learning has emerged as a novel solution over a dozen of machine learning techniques. Deep learning has attained advanced performance in medical applications. Deep learning has the capacity of recognizing patterns in large complex datasets. They are identified as an appropriate method for analyzing affected patients of NCOV-19. Conversely, these techniques for disease recognition focus entirely on enhancing the accurateness of forecasts or classifications without the ambiguity measure in a decision. Knowing how much assurance present in a computer-based health analysis is necessary for gaining clinicians’ expectations in the technology and progress treatment consequently. Today, NCOV-19 diseases are the main healthcare confront throughout the world. Detecting NCOV-19 in X-ray images is vital for diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. Still, analytical ambiguity in a report is a difficult yet predictable task for radiologists. METHOD: In this paper, an in-depth analysis has been performed on the significance of deep learning for Covid-19 and as per the standard search database, this is the first review research work ever made concentrating particularly on Deep Learning for NCOV-19. CONCLUSION: The main aim behind this research work is to inspire the research community and to innovate novel research using deep learning. Moreover, the outcome of this detailed structured review on the impact of deep learning in covid-19 analysis will be helpful for further investigations on various modalities of diseases detection, prevention and finding novel solutions.","Nayak, Janmenjoy; Naik, Bighnaraj; Dinesh, Paidi; Vakula, Kanithi; Dash, Pandit Byomakesha; Pelusi, Danilo",Res,145,1

In order to unify this change in an objective manner, we propose a Deep Learning model that integrates a PANAS scale (Positive and Negative Affect Scale) (PANAS-tDL), to characterize a tourist destination based on a series of potential factors (weather conditions, healthy, holidays, seasonality and economic factors) identified in comments obtained from a social network like Twitter. The results obtained by the PANAS-tDL model show its good performance evaluating the change of perception of tourists against four destinations affected by COVID-19, taking as reference the 11-sentiment scale defined by PANAS-t scale. Thanks to adaptation capacity, the model can be extended to evaluate the change in perception of tourists using different social networks and to evaluate different marketing strategies to promote a destination.","Peña, Alejandro; Mesias, Jorge; Patiño, Alejandro; Carvalho, Joao Vidal; Gomez, Gregorio; Ibarra, Kevin; Bedoya, Santiago","Advances in Tourism, Technology and Systems",145,1

In the present research article, we propose a differential equation-based mathematical model for modeling India’s COVID-19 that incorporates the lockdown effect while looking at the future predictions in terms of the spread and the extent to which lockdown has been effective in India. We have estimated the growth of COVID-19 across India using modified SIR modeling, which is a Compartmental model in Epidemiology. Further, the use of SIQR model to estimate the growth of this disease across the country. Also, a constant factor has been introduced in the model to measure the number of corona-affected patients count due to any accidental mass crowd gathering.

From the epidemiological evidences, it is evident that several pollutants like pm 2.5, NO(2), SO(2), O(3), CO noxious effects of pollution. Here we will analyse the basic contributing factor of pollution and which majorly impacts AQI. We will also visualise the change of AQI in the context of the season or a particular time, i.e. during the festive season and Diwali pollution highly increases and it continues till April. During COVID-19, to avoid the contamination and spreading of the virus, Govt of India declared Lockdown and due to this all the industrial works gets stopped and the reduction of vehicular waste also reduced and thus the concentration of pollutants ([Formula: see text] ) decreases immensely. It can be interpreted that due to closure of industries and decreases in the number of vehicles, the concentration of the pollutants decreases thus it can be said that COVID-19 is a blessing to nature. But after reopening, i.e. unlock 1 the concentration, increases rapidly and immensely and from the reports, it is evident that in only in ecological regions, there is an increase of 400%. Thus after unlock, people are avoiding social gathering maintaining social distance preferring own vehicle rather than the public vehicle. Also, sales of the cycle are increasing promoting greenery and the use of pollution-free vehicles. Is the Nightmare and pandemic situation helps to maintain ecological balance?

Multiple logistic regression analyses controlling for participant demographics, as well as sensitivity and specificity, were computed for each screening measure using the PCST as the criterion measure. RESULTS: The Mini-Cog, Menu Task, and MoCA identified 25.89%, 32.49%, and 47.21% more individuals, respectively, as impaired than the BIMS. In multiple logistical regression analyses, the BIMS correctly identified 58% of those impaired on the PCST. However, each of the alternate screening measures correctly identified at least 70% of individuals as impaired on the PCST. CONCLUSIONS: In this community sample, the BIMS was insensitive to subtle impairments with the potential to compromise community living, suggesting that the BIMS may be inappropriate for use outside nursing home settings.","Marks, Timothy S.; Giles, Gordon M.; Al-Heizan, Muhammad O.; Edwards, Dorothy F.",Arch Rehabil Res Clin Transl,145,13

The text is remarkable for its obdurate silence on her attitudes, thoughts, and emotions. Both on a structural and on a thematic level, Hoby follows the grid recommended in Calvinist tracts on self-monitoring: She keeps her diary on a regular basis and in strict chronological order. Furthermore, she attempts to match her own life against religious ideals. As a result, her journal is quite dry and repetitive. There are, however, some instances in which Hoby breaks the monotonous litany of her journal. Characteristically, these passages focus exclusively on her religious anxieties. Hoby never actually “fashions” herself (Greenblatt. Renaissance Self-Fashioning. Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press, 1980) as a model-Christian figure but stresses her own inadequacy. She does articulate a sense of self; however, her narrative identity is characterised by passivity, obedience, and receptivity rather than an emergent individualism. Hoby’s interiority as constructed on the pages of her journal is fragmented, rather than unified, and only becomes coherent through repetition and routine.","Nandi, Miriam",Reading the Early Modern English Diary,145,1

According to the results, this study shows that increasing the COVID-19 test number will help to reduce new COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, increase in the test number per thousand will probably not contribute to reducing new COVID-19 cases, because countries do not already test by random selection, and even if they do, it will not contribute to detection and isolating of the new cases without identifying risky groups.","Cirakli, Umit; Dogan, Ibrahim; Gozlu, Mehmet",J Knowl Econ,145,1

Considering that women at the postnatal period are more susceptible to anxiety and stress symptoms, our objective is to present a digital psychoeducational booklet analyzing its validity to help this target population to cope with the stress from the new coronavirus crisis. Based on the dispositional coping theory and positive psychology, this proposal was developed as a digital booklet to promote the maternal mental health and well-being based on informational and psychoeducational approaches. Information about the COVID-19, as well as coping strategies and positive practices, were presented to provide support for the coping with pandemic stressors. To validate the booklet, 12 women answered a Google Form via WhatsApp that included a free and informed consent form, a general data protocol, and a questionnaire with validity criteria (clarity of written, practical pertinence, theoretical relevance, and presentation). Content validity coefficients (CVC) were calculated for all criteria. The participants were on average 30 years old (A.V.=23–43), and half of them had a high school degree; 50% of them self-declared white and 25% black, and 2 of them declared themselves brown and 1 yellow. All CVC were ≥ 0.96. These findings confirmed that our booklet can be considered a viable, useful, and efficient tool to help puerperium women during the pandemic, providing support for a resilient coping face to this new and critical moment.","Perry, Cassia Patricia Barroso; da Cunha, Ana Cristina Barros; de Albuquerque, Karolina Alves; Martins, Andressa Leal; Lima, Dayane Brandão; de Moura Burgarelli, Paula Caroline; Gonçalves, Vanessa Correia Fernandez",Trends in Psychol.,145,13

The study analysed the statuses of air quality with respect to NO(2) in pre and during the COVID-19 lockdown period in eight districts of India where tier I cities are located. Nitrous Oxide concentration was determined through Sentinel 5P satellites imagery and Central Pollution Control Board ground station data. The lockdown across the country has helped the environment to regain, and therefore, more studies are required to assess other parameters to explore the implementation of the provision of the well-planned lockdown of 1-week duration in a year for giving enough time to the environment to recuperate. These results show that the study areas (Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Pune) have witnessed a significant drop in nitrogen dioxide (14–62%) as compared to the same period in 2019.

The present study discusses interview comments made by upper secondary level students in England when 15 young people were asked to give their personal responses to brief vignettes describing scientific careers. Using an interview-about-scenarios approach, the students were asked about whether they would feel comfortable working in the scientific careers represented. The career areas were purposefully selected because they might be considered to potentially raise issues in relation to personal values or commitments that some students might hold. A range of student perceptions relating to the mooted careers were elicited (positive, negative and indifferent), but all of the participants raised issues that impacted on the acceptability or attractiveness of at least one of the mooted scientific careers, in terms of aspects of their own personal beliefs and values systems. It is recommended that teachers and career advisors should be aware of the range of value-related considerations that influence student views of science-related careers and should consider exploring aspects of science-based careers that link to values commonly shared by young people. This exploratory study also offers indications for directions for further research exploring how learners’ value systems impact upon their perceptions of science and scientific work.","Taber, Keith S.; Billingsley, Berry; Riga, Fran",SN Soc Sci,145,16

Second, it highlights the effect of good governance on sustainable development, and third, it assesses the effect of e-government development on sustainable development, i.e., the digital dividends. The race is between skills and technology, while the outcome will settle on whether the dividends from digital technologies are realized and the benefits widely shared. The results reveal that most indicators of good governance have a positive contribution to sustainable development. As for the impact of e-government development on governance indicators, findings show that digitalization improves control of corruption and government effectiveness, and to a lesser extent, regulatory quality. Contrary to what was expected, e-government-related variables exert an adverse effect on various aspects of sustainable development instead of being a catalyst for progress. Based on these findings, the paper provides some recommendations. Essentially, policies on the use of digital technologies need to be adequately embedded in public sector reform. MENA countries should promote competitive business environments, enhance accountability, and upgrade education and skills development systems. Our findings are then of great interest to policymakers to make the necessary reforms that reap digital dividends in the form of faster growth, better public services, and adequate environmental management.","Dhaoui, Iyad",J Knowl Econ,145,16

However, relational switching costs show a significant positive effect on customers’ intentions to continue with their current online booking service provider, while other switching costs do not. Qualitative research further explores the multi-dimensional nature of customer-perceived switching costs and shows that consumers’ habitual purchases with an online hotel booking service provider form trust, increasing the cost of brand relationship losses and preventing customers from switching. When the self-construal of consumers is different, the homogeneity of providers will have both a positive and negative impact on switching intentions. There are also some interesting findings regarding learning costs in the online hotel booking field.

INTRODUCTION: The global crisis of COVID-19 has highlighted how the health care system needs to adapt. With the announcement of a partial lockdown, cardiac rehabilitation centers in Israel were closed and patients were left without regular training and risk factor management. However, the Remote Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs (RCRP), which had been previously developed, continued to function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of RCRP during the pandemic. METHODS: We compared retrospective cohort data on the performance of RCRP patients and care teams over two time periods: (P1) nine weeks before lockdown; and (P2) seven weeks during the lockdown. Included in the analysis were parameters of exercise adherence, objective training efficacy, and satisfaction. RESULTS: The analysis included 38 patients, 92% male, age 58 ± 11 enrolled in the RCRP predominantly following myocardial infarction or coronary interventions (57%). Patient activity during the lockdown period increased with higher average exercise minutes per week as well as higher exercise minutes performed at the designated target heart rate (all P for trend < 0.05). In a mid-study survey, over 86% of patients responded that they felt safe and satisfied with the RCRP. CONCLUSIONS: The RCRP has proven to be reliable and effective in maintaining the mental and physical health of patients in the face of a national crisis, even with a substantial reduction in staff. Automation by flexible rules, incorporated in the system, resolved numerous time-consuming tasks, thus allowing for more time to be dedicated to human interaction.","Nabutovsky, I; Klempfner, Y; Nachshon, A; Yeshayahu, S; Breitner, D; Heller, A; Klempfner, R",Eur J Prev Cardiol,145,1

Early diagnosis is critical for the prognosis of CVD. Before using myocardial tissue strain, strain rate, and other indicators to evaluate and analyze cardiac function, accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) endocardium is vital for ensuring the accuracy of subsequent diagnosis. For accurate segmentation of the LV endocardium, this paper proposes the extraction of the LV region features based on the YOLOv3 model to locate the positions of the apex and bottom of the LV, as well as that of the LV region; thereafter, the subimages of the LV can be obtained, and based on the Markov random field (MRF) model, preliminary identification and binarization of the myocardium of the LV subimages can be realized. Finally, under the constraints of the three aforementioned positions of the LV, precise segmentation and extraction of the LV endocardium can be achieved using nonlinear least-squares curve fitting and edge approximation. The experiments show that the proposed segmentation evaluation indices of the method, including computation speed (fps), Dice, mean absolute distance (MAD), and Hausdorff distance (HD), can reach 2.1–2.25 fps, 93.57 ± 1.97%, 2.57 ± 0.89 mm, and 6.68 ± 1.78 mm, respectively. This indicates that the suggested method has better segmentation accuracy and robustness than existing techniques.","Zhuang, Zhemin; Jin, Pengcheng; Joseph Raj, Alex Noel; Yuan, Ye; Zhuang, Shuxin",Comput Math Methods Med,145,22

In clinical procedures, it is desirable to acquire CT scans by minimizing the X-ray flux to prevent patients from being exposed to high radiation. However, these Low-Dose CT (LDCT) scanning protocols compromise the signal-to-noise ratio of the CT images because of noise and artifacts over the image space. Thus, various restoration methods have been published over the past 3 decades to produce high-quality CT images from these LDCT images. More recently, as opposed to conventional LDCT restoration methods, Deep Learning (DL)-based LDCT restoration approaches have been rather common due to their characteristics of being data-driven, high-performance, and fast execution. Thus, this study aims to elaborate on the role of DL techniques in LDCT restoration and critically review the applications of DL-based approaches for LDCT restoration. To achieve this aim, different aspects of DL-based LDCT restoration applications were analyzed. These include DL architectures, performance gains, functional requirements, and the diversity of objective functions. The outcome of the study highlights the existing limitations and future directions for DL-based LDCT restoration.

This study focuses on a research capacity strengthening project supporting seven test facilities in Africa conducting studies on mosquito vector control products towards Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) certification. It captures the primary effects of the project on each facility’s research capacity, the secondary effects at the individual and institutional level, and the ripple effects that extend beyond the research system. The relationships between effects at different levels are identified and compared to an existing framework for the evaluation of research capacity strengthening initiatives. Methods: To capture the views of individuals engaged in the project at all levels within each facility, a maximum-variation purposive sampling strategy was used. This allowed triangulation between different data sources. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals in three facilities and a combination of email and remote video-call interviews were conducted with individuals at two further facilities. Results: We found that, despite a focus of the GLP certification project at the institutional level, the project had effects also at individual (including enhanced motivation, furtherment of careers) and national/international levels (including development of regional expertise). In addition, we detected ripple effects of the project which extended beyond the research system. Conclusion: This study shows that research capacity strengthening interventions that are focussed on institutional level goals require actions also at individual and national/international levels. The effects of engagement at all three levels can be amplified by collaborative actions at the national/international level. These findings show that research capacity strengthening projects must develop plans that address and evaluate impact at all three levels.

Chromoendoscopy (CE) is the recommended screening method. Narrow band imaging (NBI) is potentially a more convenient alternative. Few studies have explored the diagnostic yield of second generation NBI (Olympus 190 series) versus chromoendoscopy. METHODS: NBICromo (NCT04403997) is an ongoing prospective randomized controlled trial in which patients with clinical indication for CE (>8 years of disease, left-side or extensive colitis, colonic Crohn′s disease with >2 colonic segments affected or associated primary esclerosing cholangitis) are randomized on 1:1 ratio to CE with methylene blue 0,1% or NBI. All procedures are done with Olympus HQ190 endoscopes by endoscopists with experience in IBD. Biopsies are taken from all visible lesions. Primary objective is to compare the total number of neoplastic lesions detected in each group. Secondary objectives are to compare the procedure time, the number of biopsies taken,and the accuracy of optical characterization of the lesions. The study has been approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee and patient informed consents were obtained. Estimated sample size for the study is 175 patients, and recruitment is currently ongoing. An interim analysis was conducted with the first 75 randomized patients to exclude futility due to slowed recruitment caused by covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 75 patients were randomized, 34 to CE and 41 to NBI. 10 patients were excluded due to presence of inflammation or poor bowel preparation in the colonoscopy. 65 patients were analyzed per protocol, 31 in the CE arm and 34 in the NBI arm. Mean age was 57±13 years, 46.15% were male and 53.85% female. Mean disease duration was 17.1 ± 8.3 years. No significant differences were found between groups in basal characteristics. 123 lesions were detected. 77 with CE and 46 with NBI, of these 34 (27,6%) were neoplastic (14 neoplastic lesions were found in NBI group and 19 in CE group p=0.1. Neoplastic lesions were found in 13 patients in CE group (41,9%) and 7 patients with NBI (20,5%) p=0.06. Total withdrawal time (including staining and/or therapeutics) was significantly shorter in the NBI group (17.6 ±9.8 vs 30.5 ± 16.5 min p<0.001). No differences were found in biopsies numbers (2.5 ± 2.5 CE vs 1.7 ±1.6 NBI p=0.16). AE were 1 mild post resection bleeding and 1 mild fever, both in the CE group p=0.07. CONCLUSION: In this interim analysis there are no significant differences in dysplasia detection between CE and NBI, although more sample size is needed. NBI could be a more convenient alternative to CE, with significant shorter and more simple procedures. The ongoing clinical trial will be completed.","Martin Arranz, E; Suarez Ferrer, C; García Ramirez, L; Sanchez Azofra, M; Rueda García, J L; Poza Cordón, J; Martín Arranz, M D",J Crohns Colitis,145,1

A preregistered experiment found broad, generous, and nondiscriminatory support for direct cash transfers related to COVID-19 in Canada. The second study, accepted as a preregistered report, further probes these dynamics by comparing COVID-19-related outlays with nonemergency ones. We find that COVID-19-related spending was more universal as compared to a more generic cash allocation program.

Recent evidence indicates that neuroinflammation plays a critical role in both early brain injury and delayed neural deterioration after aSAH, contributing to unfavorable outcomes. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a peripheral biomarker that conveys information about the inflammatory burden in terms of both innate and adaptive immunity. This review summarizes relevant studies that associate the NLR with aSAH to evaluate whether the NLR can predict outcomes and serve as an effective biomarker for clinical management. We found that increased NLR is valuable in predicting the clinical outcome of aSAH patients and is related to the risk of complications such as delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) or rebleeding. Combined with other indicators, the NLR provides improved accuracy for predicting prognosis to stratify patients into different risk categories.

The exploration of their core connotations is an essential way to achieve breakthroughs in geography in the new era. This paper focuses on the important method in geographic research: Geographic modeling and simulation. First, we clarify the research requirements of the said three characteristics of geography and its potential to address geo-problems in the new era. Then, the supporting capabilities of the existing geographic modeling and simulation systems for geographic research are summarized from three perspectives: Model resources, modeling processes, and operational architecture. Finally, we discern avenues for future research of geographic modeling and simulation systems for the study of regional, comprehensive and complex characteristics of geography. Based on these analyses, we propose implementation architecture of geographic modeling and simulation systems and discuss the module composition and functional realization, which could provide theoretical and technical support for geographic modeling and simulation systems to better serve the development of geography in the new era.","Chen, Min; Lv, Guonian; Zhou, Chenghu; Lin, Hui; Ma, Zaiyang; Yue, Songshan; Wen, Yongning; Zhang, Fengyuan; Wang, Jin; Zhu, Zhiyi; Xu, Kai; He, Yuanqing",Sci China Earth Sci,145,33

This study, therefore, examines teachers’ perceptions of climate change regarding its significance, causes, consequences, and mitigation, through analysis of a self-administered structured questionnaire completed by 95 teachers from public and private educational institutions in the city of Sylhet in Bangladesh. Results from descriptive and inferential statistical analysis show that public and private school teachers have an understanding of climate change regarding its significance, causes, consequences, and mitigation. The results also reveal that the sociodemographic characteristics of teachers, as well as academic-related factors, influence their perceptions of climate change. This research concludes that teachers in public institutions have a greater awareness and understanding of climate change than those working in private schools. The research findings have broader implications for further research and policy recommendations and, in particular, draw the attention of the Departments of Education and Disaster Management in Bangladesh or in countries with similar contexts to introduce environmental and disaster education and training opportunities for teachers.","Chowdhury, Mohammed Thanvir Ahmed; Ahmed, Khandaker Jafor; Ahmed, Mufti Nadimul Quamar; Haq, Shah Md.

However, the control of other cattle diseases that have no, or limited EU regulation, is left to each member state. Slovenia has five control programmes (CPs) for non-EU regulated cattle diseases: bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), bluetongue and anthrax. Two (IBR and BVD) are voluntary and the others (EBL, anthrax and bluetongue) are compulsory. The three compulsory CPs are funded by the government. All the CPs are run by the government and laboratory tests are performed by the National Veterinary Institute. The rules for the CPs are laid down in Slovenian legislation. In addition, there is a national directive for the control of salmonellosis. Both BVD and IBR are endemic and have CPs based on increased biosecurity, testing and culling or vaccination, financed by the animal owners. Slovenia has been officially free of EBL since 2005 and carries out surveillance based on serological testing of a representative number of herds and inspection of carcasses at slaughter or necropsy. Vaccination is the main disease control measure for anthrax (sporadic) and bluetongue (currently perceived free—vaccination since 2017). Lack of motivation of farmers to participate in voluntary disease CPs and to implement and follow strict biosecurity measures are the most pressing issues in improving the health status of Slovenian cattle. An overview of the existing CPs and the circumstances leading to their implementation are presented.","Hodnik, Jaka Jakob; Knific, Tanja; Starič, Jože; Toplak, Ivan; Ocepek, Matjaž; Hostnik, Peter; Ježek, Jožica",Front Vet Sci,145,1

However, the current diagnostic tool for MM is still under-developed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the diagnostic significance of a strategy that combined plasma-based metabolomics with machine learning algorithms for MM. Methods: Plasma samples collected from 25 MM patients and 32 healthy controls (HCs) were randomly divided into train set and test set, after which analyzation was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Differential metabolites were screened out from the samples of the train set. Subsequently, metabolite-based diagnostic models, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Random Forest model (RF), were established, and their prediction accuracies were calculated for the test set samples. Results: Twenty differential plasma metabolites were annotated in the train set; 10 of these metabolites were validated in the test set. The seven metabolites with most significant diagnostic values were taurocholic acid (accuracy = 0.6429), uracil (accuracy = 0.7143), biliverdin (accuracy = 0.7143), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (accuracy = 0.5000), histidine (accuracy = 0.8571), pyrroline hydroxycarboxylic acid (accuracy = 0.8571), and phenylalanine (accuracy = 0.7857). Furthermore, RF based on 20 annotated metabolites showed a prediction accuracy of 0.9286, and its optimized version achieved 1.0000 in the test set. Moreover, the comparison between the samples of peritoneal MM (n = 8) and pleural MM (n = 17) illustrated a significant increase in levels of taurocholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid, as well as an evident decrease in biliverdin. Conclusions: Our results revealed the potential diagnostic value of plasma-based metabolomics combined with machine learning for MM. Further research with large sample size is worthy conducting. Moreover, our data demonstrated dysregulated metabolism pathways in MM, which aids in better understanding of molecular mechanisms related to the initiation and development of MM.","Li, Na; Yang, Chenxi; Zhou, Sicheng; Song, Siyu; Jin, Yuyao; Wang, Ding; Liu, Junping; Gao, Yun; Yang, Haining; Mao, Weimin; Chen, Zhongjian",Diagnostics (Basel),145,1

Language intervention in aphasia enhances the patient outcomes. Recently, computer programs are developed for the treatment of aphasia. It is an effective and a low-cost therapy choice. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of language therapy using a computer-based Arabic software program for rehabilitation of post-stroke Arabic-speaking aphasic patients in comparison to the conventional language therapy. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with blinded endpoint evaluation. The trial included 50 aphasic patients. They were randomized into either group I or group II to receive 48 therapy sessions using the Arabic software program (group I) or the conventional therapy (group II). The primary outcome was a measure of improvement in language abilities. It was measured using the Arabic version of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination to detect any significant improvement in the language of both groups in comparison to pre-therapy results. The post-therapy results of both groups were compared to each other to document the effectiveness of the software program. RESULTS: A total of 105 aphasic patients were screened and 50 subjects were randomized to the intervention groups [40 subjects were males, mean age of the patients: 57.04 years± SD 10.88 for group I and 58.80 years ± SD 11.58 for group II]. The therapy results showed a significant improvement from the baseline in both groups. There was no significant difference in the post-therapy results between group I and group II except for some items whereas group I showed more significant improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Language therapy using a computer-based Arabic software program was as effective as the conventional therapy in the improvement of language abilities of Arabic-speaking aphasic patients.","Elhakeem, Engy Samy; Saeed, Sabah Saeed Gommaa Mohamed; Elsalakawy, Ramy Nabil Abd-Elkader; Elmaghraby, Reham Mohamed; Ashmawy, Ghada Abdel Hady Ossman",Egypt J Otolaryngol,145,17

The crisis has clearly highlighted well-known differences between centralized and decentralized systems. Yet focusing on this dichotomy is not sufficient. It is suggested that, while the distribution of authority between central and regional governments matters, policy dynamics—that is, how different territorial levels interact in policy-making processes—are even more important in driving multi-level responses to the emergency. Whether these dynamics are hierarchical (France), competitive (Italy and Spain), cooperative (Germany) or mixed (the United Kingdom) depends on how pre-crisis institutional, sectoral and political “causal forces” moderate the impact of an exogenous shock.","Vampa, Davide",Publius,145,1

METHODS: Patients who were >17 years and scheduled for reconstructive surgery for limb lengthening or angular deformity with internal and/or external fixation and healthy control subjects were prospectively enrolled. Patients completed the LD-SRS preoperatively. Mechanical axis deviation (MAD) and leg length discrepancy (LLD) were recorded preoperatively. Participants were stratified into five groups based on their diagnosis. ANOVA was used to test for associations between LD-SRS scores and diagnosis as well as mechanical axis deviation. RESULTS: Patients with LLD, angular deformity, or combined LLD and angular deformity reported significantly worse scores than control subjects in LD-SRS Function/Activity, Pain, Self-Image/Appearance, and total score (P < 0.001 for all). Patients with short stature reported significantly worse LD-SRS Self-Image/Appearance (P < 0.001) and total score compared with control subjects (P = 0.015). There was a significant correlation between LLD and LD-SRS Self-Image/Appearance in the LLD and angular deformity group (r = −0.359, P = 0.043). DISCUSSION: Although LD-SRS scores were worse in patients with limb deformity compared to controls, LD-SRS scores were not related to the degree of deformity in most patients, indicating that patient self-perception may be a construct unrelated to objective radiographic or clinical findings.","Heath, Madison R.; Shin, Tom J.; Mehta, Rena; Principe, Peter S.; Mackie, Alexandra T.; Fragomen, Austin; Rozbruch, S.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was searched and the expression patterns of HOXB-AS3 in head and neck carcinoma were analyzed. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis was used to measure the mRNA and protein expression level of HOXB-AS3 in patients with OSCC, respectively. Next, HOXB-AS3 was knocked down in 2 OSCC cell lines to investigate the biological function of the HOXB-AS3-encoded protein using a Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assays. To further identify the potential mechanism of the HOXB-AS3-encoded protein, co-immunoprecipitation was also used to detect the interaction between HOXB-AS3 and IGF2BP2, while HOXB-AS3 was re-expressed to determine whether the HOXB-AS3-encoded protein and not HOXB-AS3 exerted its function in OSCC. HOXB-AS3 was upregulated in OSCC tissues, in both TCGA database and in patients with OSCC recruited into the present study. HOXB-AS3 was associated with poor prognosis in OSCC. The proliferation and viability decreased in the 2 OSCC cell lines following knock down of HOXB-AS3. HOXB-AS3 was also found to encode a protein that directly interacted with IGF2BP2 and thereby promoted the stability of c-myc. Taken together, the results from the present study indicated that increased HOXB-AS3 expression was associated with poor prognosis in OSCC. This indicated that HOXB-AS3 and its encoded protein promoted OSCC cell proliferation and viability by maintaining c-Myc mRNA stability by directly binding to IGF2BP2.","Leng, Fei; Miu, Yan-Yu; Zhang, Yi; Luo, Hao; Lu, Xiao-Li; Cheng, Hui; Zheng, Zhi-Guo",Oncol Lett,145,1

The present study therefore adopted a life course perspective to investigate the longitudinal effects of residential mobility and caregiver social support on a range of individual health outcomes (i.e., caregiver depression, adolescent internalizing problems, and adolescent externalizing problems) among families exposed to disadvantaged social and economic conditions. Data were obtained from the Longitudinal Studies in Child Abuse and Neglect, and 425 children and their caregivers who completed the age 12, 14, 16, and 18 interviews were included in this study. Structural equation modeling was conducted to test the measurement and structural models. The results showed that greater residential mobility was significantly associated with higher levels of caregiver depression, which in turn led to more adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. Alternatively, higher levels of caregiver social support mitigated the levels of caregiver depression, which in turn resulted in fewer adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. Highly mobile children and their caregivers were found to be vulnerable to several negative health outcomes and in high need of mental and behavioral health support and services. These findings inform important policy and practice implications on social support for mobile caregivers to address their children’s behavioral problems.","Du, Xi; Kim, Youn Kyoung",J Child Fam Stud,145,19

METHODS IRB approved single-center interventional clinical study in 22 patients (10 females, 12 males, mean age 55, age range 33-74 years) for the endovascular treatment of wide-neck aneurysms. After obtaining informed consent, patients were included according to the following criteria: aneurysm fundus-to-neck ratio < 2 or neck diameter > 4 mm, and a parent vessel diameter of ≤3.5 mm. Primary end point for clinical safety was absence of death, absence of major or minor stroke, and absence of transient ischemic attack. Primary end point for treatment efficacy was complete angiographic occlusion according to the Raymond-Roy Occlusion Classification (RROC) immediately after the procedure and at follow-up after 3 and 6 months on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS In 20/22 (91 %) of patients, the primary end point of safety was reached; in the two remaining patients, transient ischemic attack, but no permanent deficit was observed; in 16/22 (73 %), efficient occlusion (RROC1) was reached, and in 6/22 (27 %), a residual neck remained (RROC2). Single [seven with antegrade, two in crossover configuration, and four with ""first-balloon-then-stent"" (FBTS) technique] or double-stent (eight patients with Y configuration and one patient with X configuration) deployment was technically successful in all cases. CONCLUSION Deployment of the LVIS Jr. microstent in various single- or double-stent configurations is safe and effective to assist the treatment of intracranial wide-neck aneurysms.","Möhlenbruch, M; Herweh, C; Behrens, L; Jestaedt, L; Amiri, H; Ringleb, P A; Bendszus, M; Pham, M",Neuroradiology,145,28

METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review for studies of fetoscopic or open fetal surgery performed since 1990, recording maternal complications during fetal surgery, the remainder of pregnancy, delivery, and after the index pregnancy. RESULTS One hundred sixty-six studies were included, reporting outcomes for open fetal (n = 1193 patients) and fetoscopic surgery (n = 9403 patients). No maternal deaths were reported. The risk of any maternal complication in the index pregnancy was 20.9% (95%CI, 15.22-27.13) for open fetal and 6.2% (95%CI, 4.93-7.49) for fetoscopic surgery. For severe maternal complications (grades III to V Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications), the risk was 4.5% (95% CI 3.24-5.98) for open fetal and 1.7% (95% CI, 1.19-2.20) for fetoscopic surgery. In subsequent pregnancies, open fetal surgery increased the risk of preterm birth but not uterine dehiscence or rupture. Nearly one quarter of reviewed studies (n = 175, 23.3%) was excluded for failing to report the presence or absence of maternal complications. CONCLUSIONS Maternal complications occur in 6.2% fetoscopic and 20.9% open fetal surgeries, with serious maternal complications in 1.7% fetoscopic and 4.5% open procedures. Reporting of maternal complications is variable. To properly quantify maternal risks, outcomes should be reported consistently across all fetal surgery studies.","Sacco, Adalina; Van der Veeken, Lennart; Bagshaw, Emma; Ferguson, Catherine; Van Mieghem, Tim; David, Anna L; Deprest, Jan",Prenatal diagnosis,145,6

We found that intrinsic enteric-associated neurons (iEAN) in mice are functionally adapted to the intestinal segment they occupy; ileal and colonic neurons are more responsive to microbial colonization than duodenal neurons. Specifically, a microbially-responsive subset of viscerofugal CART+ neurons, enriched in the ileum and colon, modulated feeding and glucose metabolism. These CART+ neurons send axons to the prevertebral ganglia and are poly-synaptically connected to the liver and pancreas. Microbiota depletion led to NLRP6- and Caspase 11-dependent loss of CART+ neurons, and impaired glucose regulation. Hence, iEAN subsets appear to be capable of regulating blood glucose levels independently from the central nervous system.","Muller, Paul A; Matheis, Fanny; Schneeberger, Marc; Kerner, Zachary; Jové, Veronica; Mucida, Daniel",Science,145,7

Recent advances in virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and clinical management of COVID-19 have contributed to the control and prevention of this disease, but re-positivity of SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 patients has brought a new challenge for this worldwide anti-viral battle. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but a positive RT-PCR result may be multifactorial, including false positive, SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment shedding, reinfection of SARS-CoV-2, or re-activation of COVID-19. Re-infection of SARS-CoV-2 or re-activation of COVID-19 is an indicator of live viral carriers and isolation/treatment is needed, but SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment shedding is not. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is recently reported to integrate into the host genome, but the far-reaching outcome is currently unclear. Therefore, it is critical for appropriate manipulation and prevention of COVID-19 to distinguish these causal factors of SARS-CoV-2 re-positivity. In this review article, we updated the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 re-positivity in discharged COVID-19 patients with a focus on re-infection and re-activation.

BACKGROUND The association between hemorrhagic complications and mortality may explain the survival benefit with bivalirudin. METHODS A total of 3,602 STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI were randomized to bivalirudin versus UFH+GPI. Three-year cardiac mortality was analyzed in patients with and without major bleeding. RESULTS When compared with UFH+GPI, bivalirudin resulted in lower 3-year rates of major bleeding (6.9% vs. 10.5%, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.64 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51 to 0.80], p < 0.0001) and cardiac mortality (2.9% vs. 5.1%, HR: 0.56 [95% CI: 0.40 to 0.80], p = 0.001). Three-year cardiac mortality was reduced in bivalirudin-treated patients with major bleeding (20 fewer deaths with bivalirudin; 5.8% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.025) and without major bleeding (18 fewer deaths with bivalirudin; 2.6% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.048). In a fully-adjusted multivariable model accounting for major bleeding and other adverse events, bivalirudin was still associated with a 43% reduction in 3-year cardiac mortality (adjusted HR: 0.57 [95% CI: 0.39 to 0.83], p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS Bivalirudin reduces cardiac mortality in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI, an effect that can only partly be attributed to prevention of bleeding.

Recently, uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been widely accepted as a less invasive technique for the treatment of pneumothorax. Thus, we introduced single-staged uniportal VATS technique in the supine position, for the management of two cases of SBPSP. CASE PRESENTATION A 17-year-old boy presented with bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax and he underwent single-staged uniportal VATS in the supine position. Single wide draping in consecutive bilateral approaches removes the needs of changing patients' position. Whole thoracoscopic procedure for wedge resection of bullae lesions was conducted without difficulty. The total operation time took 65 min and the patient discharged 3 days after the operation. The patient was followed for 24 months without recurrence of both sides. Another 18-year-old boy was admitted with bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax and single-staged uniportal VATS was also performed in the supine position. The total operation time took 79 min and the patient discharged on postoperative day 4. He was followed for 19 months without recurrence of both sides. CONCLUSIONS Single-staged uniportal VATS approach yielded satisfactory results from simplicity that not requires position change compared to conventional multi-ports VATS in the lateral position, and with better cosmetics. This technique is thought to be a feasible procedure in selective patients with SBPSP or with contralateral bullae for preventive role.","Kim, Kyung Soo",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,145,7

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data were obtained from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). Type 2 diabetes was reported by participants themselves in each survey wave. The duration of follow-up was defined as the period from the first visit to the first time self-reported type 2 diabetes, death, or other loss to follow-up from CHNS. The patterns of change trajectories in BMI were derived by latent class trajectory analysis method. The Fine and Gray regression model was used to estimate HRs with corresponding 95% CIs for type 2 diabetes. RESULTS Four patterns of the trajectories of change in BMI were identified among Chinese adults, 42.7% of participants had stable BMI change, 40.8% for moderate BMI gain, 8.9% for substantial BMI gain and 7.7% for weight loss. During the follow-up with mean 11.2 years (158 637 person-years contributed by 14 185 participants), 498 people with type 2 diabetes (3.7%) occurred. Risk of type 2 diabetes was increased by 47% among people who gained BMI more substantially and rapidly (HR: 1.47, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.02, p=0.016) and increased by 20% among those in people with the moderate BMI gain (HR: 1.20, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.48, p=0.078), compared with those with stable BMI change. CONCLUSIONS Long-term substantial gain of BMI was significantly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the Chinese adults.","Mi, Baibing; Wu, Chenlu; Gao, Xiangyu; Wu, Wentao; Du, Jiaoyang; Zhao, Yaling; Wang, Duolao; Dang, Shaonong; Yan, Hong",BMJ open diabetes research & care,145,31

Genetic methods expressing fluorescent proteins are widely used to label specific neuronal populations. However, because cell type specificity of genetic labeling is often limited, it is advantageous to combine genetic labelling with additional methods to select specific cell/neuronal types. Laser capture microdissection is one of such techniques with which one can select a specific cell/neuronal population based on morphological observation. However, a major issue is disappearance of fluorescence signals during tissue processing required for high quality sample preparation. Here, we developed a simple, novel method in which fluorescence signals are preserved. We use genetic labeling with fluorescence proteins fused to transmembrane proteins, which shows highly stable fluorescence retention and allows for the selection of fluorescent neurons/cells based on morphology. Using this method in mice, we laser-captured neuronal somata and successfully isolated RNA. We determined that ∼100 cells are sufficient to obtain a sample required for downstream applications such as quantitative PCR. Capability to specifically micro-dissect targeted neurons was demonstrated by ∼10-fold increase in mRNA for fluorescent proteins in visually identified neurons expressing the fluorescent proteins compared to neighboring cells not expressing it. We applied this method to validate virus-mediated single-cell knockout, which showed up to 95% reduction in knocked-out gene RNA compared with wild-type neurons. This method using fluorescent proteins fused to transmembrane proteins provides a new, simple solution to perform gene expression analysis in sparsely labelled neuronal/cellular populations, which is especially advantageous when genetic labelling has limited specificity.Significance statementGenetic labeling of specific cell types with reporter fluorescent proteins is widely used for gene expression analysis. However, because the specificity of genetic labeling is often limited, an additional method is required to collect samples from a specific cell type. Here, we developed a novel method to allow for selection of a cell/neuronal type of interest based on morphology before performing sample collection using laser capture microdissection. Stable fluorescent signals from fluorescent proteins fused to transmembrane proteins allows us to morphologically select and laser-capture hundreds of single neurons. This method would be applicable to genomic and transcriptomic analysis of different cell/neuronal types and could facilitate our understanding of brain functions.","Chang, Ching Ching; Chong, Hai Tarng; Tashiro 田代歩, Ayumu",eNeuro,145,30

In contrast, gel column (GEL) and immunochromatographic strip (STRIP) techniques are preferred for compatibility testing in dogs and cats. OBJECTIVE To determine the accuracy of novel and standard crossmatch and typing methods. ANIMALS Thirty-eight healthy horses, previously blood typed and alloantibody screened. METHODS TUBE and GEL crossmatches were performed on 146 different recipient-donor pairs with 56 incompatible TUBE crossmatches. Crossmatches were compared by nonparametric area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) analyses. Horses also were blood typed by the novel immunochromatographic Ca typing STRIP. RESULTS Compared to TUBE crossmatch, GEL had excellent accuracy for agglutination (AUC-ROC = 0.903), but marginal accuracy for hemolysis (AUC-ROC = 0.639). Compared to macroscopic TUBE, microscopic TUBE had excellent accuracy for agglutination (AUC-ROC = 0.912). The predicted crossmatch compatibility based on blood type and alloantibody assay showed excellent accuracy compared to TUBE and GEL (AUC-ROC = 0.843 and 0.897, respectively). However, there were more recipient-donor pairs identified as incompatible by both TUBE and GEL than predicted by blood type and antibody screen, suggesting the presence of unidentified alloantibodies. A Ca typing STRIP exhibited 100% sensitivity and specificity for the 35 Ca+ and 3 Ca- horses tested. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Gel column crossmatch and Ca typing immunochromatographic strip are simple and accurate methods to evaluate clinical blood compatibility.","Luethy, D; Owens, S D; Stefanovski, D; Nolen-Walston, R; Giger, U",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,145,12

Most efforts follow variants of the established SIR methodological framework that divides a population into ""Susceptible"", ""Infectious"" and ""Recovered/Removed"" fractions and defines their dynamic inter-relationships with first-order differential equations. Goal This paper proposes a novel approach based on data-guided detection and concatenation of infection waves - each of them described by a Riccati equation with adaptively estimated parameters. Methods This approach was applied to Covid-19 daily time-series data of US confirmed cases, resulting in the decomposition of the epidemic time-course into five ""Riccati modules"" representing major infection waves to date (June 18th). Results Four waves have passed the time-point of peak infection rate, with the fifth expected to peak on July 20th. The obtained parameter estimates indicate gradual reduction of infectivity rate, although the latest wave is expected to be the largest. Conclusions This analysis suggests that, if no new waves of infection emerge, the Covid-19 epidemic will be controlled in the US (<5000 new daily cases) by September 26th, and the maximum of confirmed cases will reach 4,160,000. Importantly, this approach can be used to detect (via rigorous statistical methods) the emergence of possible new waves of infections in the future. Analysis of data from individual states or countries may quantify the distinct effects of different mitigation measures.","Marmarelis, Vasilis Z",IEEE open journal of engineering in medicine and biology,145,11

During this procedure, incomplete excision of the hernia sac from the mediastinum and omission of creating a 'non-tension-free position' of the cardio-esophageal junction into the abdominal cavity are associated with hiatal hernia recurrence. Giant hiatal hernias therefore often require a thoracotomy or thoracoscopy, to free dense adhesions higher up the chest. These procedures may increase the risk of perioperative morbidity due to lengthy operating times.

This systematic scoping review examines the range and variety of interventions on the use of PS across the cancer care continuum. METHOD We used a broad definition of PS to capture a wide-range of interventions and characterize the current status of the field. Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, SCOPUS, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published from January 2011 to June 2016. We screened the title and abstracts of 2087 articles, followed by full-text screening of 420 articles, resulting in a final sample of 242 articles of which the most recent 100 articles were reviewed (published June 2014 to May 2016). RESULTS A number of the recent intervention studies focused on breast cancer (32%, breast cancer only) or multiple cancer sites (23%). Although the interventions spanned all phases of the cancer care continuum, only 2% targeted end-of-life care. Seventy-six percent focused on clinical outcomes (e.g., screening, treatment adherence) and 72% on reducing health disparities. Interventions were primarily phone-based (44%) or delivered in a clinic setting (44%). Only a few studies (22%) described the impact of providing PS on peer supporters. CONCLUSION PS appears to be a widely used approach to address needs across the cancer care continuum, with many opportunities to expand its reach.","Kowitt, Sarah D; Ellis, Katrina R; Carlisle, Veronica; Bhushan, Nivedita L; Black, Kristin Z; Brodar, Kaitlyn; Cranley, Nicole M; Davis, Kia L; Eng, Eugenia; Martin, Michelle Y; McGuirt, Jared; Sokol, Rebeccah L; Tang, Patrick Y; Vines, Anissa I; Walker, Jennifer S; Fisher, Edwin B",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,145,26

In this study, the authors present the preliminary results (April 1-5, 2020) of a public risk perception study of COVID‑19. MATERIAL AND METHODS The online questionnaire survey was announced in the national TV and radio stations with the nationwide coverage. Respondents were recruited through the website of the University of Ostrava during the first 5 days of the survey (N = 7966). The data covered risk perception with a focus on physical and psychological aspects, the current socio-economic situation and adaptation to the lockdown. The authors used Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, as well as ordered logistic regression, with a significance level of 5% using STATA version 15. RESULTS From the total sample of the respondents aged 40 years on average (a range of 15-87 years), the present study shows that women (p < 0.001) and elderly people (p < 0.001) perceived the health risk related to COVID‑19 as significantly worse than others. Older people (>60 years) perceived their mental health as significantly better than younger participants (p < 0.001). Most of the respondents assessed the adopted measures as adequate (71%) and believed in their effectiveness (69.7%).

We examined age-related differences in emotions, cognitive attitudes, and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory, we expected to find a positive approach in older adults, which may translate into lower compliance with restrictive measures. Methods: We analyzed data (n = 306) from a nation-wide online survey conducted between April 1st and April 16th, 2020. We compared young (18-29 years), middle-aged (30-50 years), and older (65-85 years) adults' self-reported emotions, attitudes toward the emergency, and compliance with governmental rules. Results: Older adults showed lower negative emotions than young and middle-aged adults. Also, older adults were more confident about COVID-related information received, more favorable toward the restrictive measures, and perceived lower underestimation of the emergency compared to the other age groups. However, older people anticipated a longer time for the emergency to resolve. No age-related differences in compliance with the rules emerged. Conclusion: Older people showed a positive attitude toward the emergency. This attitude was confined in the here and now and did not extend to expectations for the future. Compliance with rules was high across our sample. However, less compliant individuals were also less confident in COVID-related information received by the media and official sources, suggesting the importance of providing precise and reliable information to promote adherence to restrictive measures.","Ceccato, Irene; Palumbo, Rocco; Di Crosta, Adolfo; La Malva, Pasquale; Marchetti, Daniela; Maiella, Roberta; Verrocchio, Maria Cristina; Marin, Anna; Mammarella, Nicola; Palumbo, Riccardo; Di Domenico, Alberto",Aging & mental health,145,31

The aim of this study was to elucidate the characteristics of and outcomes in patients with thymic carcinomas and thymic neuroendocrine carcinomas undergoing LND. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed using our multi-institutional database to identify patients who underwent resection and LND for thymic carcinoma or thymic neuroendocrine carcinoma between 1991 and 2018. An enlarged mediastinal LN was defined as having a short-axis diameter >1 cm. We assessed survival outcomes using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS N1-level LND was performed in 41 patients (54.6%), N2-level LND in 14 patients (18.7%) and both-level LND in 16 patients (21.3%). Pathological LN metastasis was detected in 20 patients (26.7%) among the 75 patients undergoing LND. There was a significant difference in the number of LN stations (P = 0.015) and metastasis factor (P = 0.0042) between pathologically LN-positive and pathologically LN-negative patients. The sensitivity of enlarged LNs on preoperative computed tomography was 18.2%. There was a tendency towards worse overall survival of pathologically N2-positive patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative CT appears to play a limited role in detecting pathological LN metastases.

METHODS Postmortem skin samples were obtained for histological evaluation from 37 frogs, with and without skin lesions, that died while in captivity at Auckland Zoo between 2000 and 2012. Four frogs with skin lesions were biopsied under general anaesthesia and samples used for both light and transmission electron microscopy. The records of 94 frogs held at the University of Otago and Auckland Zoo between 2000-2012 were reviewed, which included some frogs recently collected from the wild. Information about the occurrence of skin lesions, and mortality associated with skin lesions was collated. RESULTS Grossly the skin lesions varied in appearance; most were circular, pale grey papules, which measured from <0.5-1.5 mm in diameter with no umbilication. The overlying epidermis was not fragile and there was no associated inflammation. Contents often appeared clear or semi-transparent. Lesions were located predominantly on ventral surfaces including trunk, thighs, lower legs and forearms, and gular region, but not on digits. The number ranged from single to multiple, often confluent lesions covering the entire ventral surface of the frog. Histologically the lesions consisted of enlarged proliferating mucous glands that expanded the dermis and elevated the epidermis. They were semi-organised, solid or occasionally cavitated acinar structures with central lumina which sometimes contained mucus. Nuclei showed moderate anisokaryosis and mitotic figures were uncommon. Transmission electron microscopy did not show any infectious agents. Between 2000 and 2012, skin lesions were recorded in 35/94 (37%) frogs. The size and location of skin lesions varied over time, with some resolving and sometimes reappearing. Skin lesions were not associated with an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS The skin lesions had the gross and microscopic characteristics of adenomatous hyperplasia of the dermal mucous glands. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The aetiology of this adenomatous hyperplasia is unknown, but factors associated with the captive environment are the most likely cause. This is the first description of adenomatous hyperplasia of the cutaneous mucous glands in amphibians.","Shaw, S D; Berger, L; Harvey, C; Alley, M R; Bishop, P J; Speare, R",New Zealand veterinary journal,145,1

For those with tinnitus, such changes can be factors in exacerbating tinnitus. The purpose of this study was to determine tinnitus help-seeking behavior, which resources individuals utilized to cope during the pandemic, and what additional support is desired. Method An exploratory cross-sectional study design including 1,522 adults with tinnitus living in North America (Canada and the United States) was used. Data were collected through an online survey distributed by the American Tinnitus Association via e-mail. Free text from open-ended questions was analyzed using the automated content analysis. The responses to the structured questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric statistics. Results Significantly less tinnitus support was sought during the pandemic, and very few respondents utilized tinnitus support networks during the pandemic at the time the survey was conducted. Nonetheless, seeking support during the pandemic was significantly associated with significantly less tinnitus distress. The most frequently utilized resources for coping during the pandemic were contacting family and friends, spending time outdoors or in nature, relaxation, and exercise. Such tools for coping were associated with significantly less tinnitus distress. The support requested and advice provided by participants to health care services had overlap. The main support needs related to managing tinnitus included addressing hearing loss, providing peer support, finding cures, and accessing trained and understanding health care providers to help. The advice for professionals related to tinnitus management included the need for cures, personalized support, addressing hearing loss, targeting the tinnitus percept, and providing more information about the condition. Conclusions These findings provide suggestions on how to better support those with tinnitus at a time when health care is undergoing rapid changes. Findings can be used by stakeholders, clinical practitioners, and tinnitus support services to devise ways to work more effectively together to improve access to patient-driven, suitable, accessible, and evidence-based support.

It appears to work in tandem with vitamin D, a secosteroid pro-hormone which reportedly acts as a negative regulatory factor of the RAS [3-6]. A dysfunction (e.g. over-reactivity) of RAS, together with hypovitaminosis D, is likely associated with some of the various renal, cardiac, vascular and immune outcomes that might be observed in COVID-19 patients, including the cytokine storm (i.e. unopposed hyperactive immune reaction generating both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines) and consequent lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome [1, 7]. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9], the causative agent of COVID-19, has been described to interfere with the RAS [2] by interacting -via its spike (S) glycoprotein- with the metallopeptidase Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [9, 10] that is expressed at the surface of epithelial cells from blood vessels, lung, kidney (renal tubules), intestine, and heart, as well as on cerebral neurons and immune monocytes/macrophages [11-13]. The main SARS-CoV-2-related COVID-19 symptoms/diseases reported hitherto are hypertension, atherosclerosis, thrombosis (coagulopathy), diarrhea, glaucoma, anosmia, ageusia, skin lesions (dermatitis), autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system, and damages to various organs such as the lung, heart, kidney, and testicle [1, 2, 14]. All these diffuse COVID-19 disorders are likely linked to an over-reaction of RAS in SARS-CoV-2-infected persons. Such a RAS imbalance would be also favored by hypovitaminosis D [2-7, 11]. Since RAS appears to be central in COVID-19 symptoms/diseases, selective targeting of key component(s) of this system might be appropriate to treat RAS-dependent disorders. COVID-19 Disorders: 'Renin-Angiotensin' System (RAS) & Counter-regulatory RAS In the RAS pathway [1, 15], Renin (kidney) cleaves Angiotensinogen (liver) to give Angiotensin I (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPFHL). The latter is cleaved by the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) to produce Angiotensin II (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPF), which is the substrate of ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and key player of the RAS. The cellular targets of Angiotensin II are the vasoconstrictor type 1 (AT1R) and vasodilatator type 2 (AT2R) Angiotensin II receptors (AT1R is expressed at the surface of monocytes/macrophages and T-cells indicating that RAS acts on innate immunity in host). When cleaved by ACE2, Angiotensin II gives Angiotensin 1-7 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHP), targeting the vasodilatator proto-oncogene Mas receptor (MasR). Angiotensin 1-7 can be further transformed to Alamandine (i.e. peptide ARVYIHP) by an aspartate decarboxylase. Alamandine would bind to the vasodilatator Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor member D (MRGD) thus promoting most of the Angiotensin 1-7-like effects. Angiotensin II can produce Angiotensin A (i.e. peptide ARVYIHPF) via an aspartate decarboxylase, and Alamandine via an additional ACE2 cleavage. ACE2 can also cleave Angiotensin I to form Angiotensin 1-9 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPFH), which targets AT2R. In the RAS pathway were finally evidenced the related Angiotensin III (i.e. peptide RVYIHPF) and Angiotensin IV (i.e. peptide VYIHPF) variants targeting the AT1R and vasodilatator AT4R, respectively. From the known molecular functioning of the RAS, Angiotensins I and II (aside Angiotensin III) are playing central roles in the activity of RAS and associated pathologies, including COVID-19 [2, 10]. Interestingly, it appears that a 'counter-regulatory' RAS does exist to modulate system homeostasis; it relies on Angiotensin 1-7, Angiotensin 1-9, Alamandine, Angiotensin A, and Angiotensin IV, which are targeting the MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R vasodilatator receptors, respectively. These peptides were found to exhibit cardioprotective, vasoactive (anti-hypertensive), anti-hypertrophic and/or anti-inflammatory potentials [15]. Such naturally-produced molecules of the RAS are expected to counteract the SARS-CoV-2-induced over-activation of RAS and reverse, to some extent, the associated COVID-19 diseases. CONCLUDING REMARKS A recent report suggests that RAS inhibitors may act on the severity of viral infection and mortality of COVID-19 patients [14]. Whether or not RAS blockers would be beneficial to COVID-19 cases is still controversial. The RAS inhibitors likely prevent the cytokine storm as RAS is reported to control the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [1, 7]. It appears that COVID-19 disorders of SARS-CoV-2-infected humans depend on the RAS over-reacted by the (ACE2-dependent) viral infection and vitamin D deficiency. The track for a possible COVID-19 treatment would be to target RAS using specific candidate chemotherapeutic drugs. The proposed molecules are (so far) ACE inhibitors (to prevent the production of Angiotensin II from Angiotensin I), and blockers/antagonists of AT1R such as Losartan and derivatives. Recombinant ACE2 (under clinical trials) is also considered as a decoy for the recognition and competitive binding to the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10]. We support the use of natural candidate peptide drugs that belong to the 'counter-regulatory' RAS, i.e. Angiotensin 1-7, Angiotensin 1-9, Alamandine, Angiotensin A and/or Angiotensin IV to treat COVID-19 disorders. The targeted receptors would thus be MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R. The authors wish to thank Bonabes De Rougé MD for fruitful discussions.","Annweiler, Cédric; Cao, Zhijian; Wu, Yingliang; Faucon, Emmanuelle; Mouhat, Stéphanie; Kovacic, Hervé; Sabatier, Jean-Marc",Infectious disorders drug targets,145,5

It is argued that Solnica et al's analysis of Rabbi Waldenberg's text and their conclusion that healthcare workers are obligated to endanger themselves while treating patient who suffer from contagious illness during epidemics according to Jewish law suffer from various shortcomings. Indeed, Jewish law looks favourably on healthcare workers who take a reasonable risk in treating their patients in the context of epidemics.

OBJECTIVE The objective was (1) to measure rates of successful resolution of dysphagia in patients after undergoing surgical intervention for diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH); and (2) to determine if older age, longer duration of preoperative symptoms, or increased severity of disease was correlated with unsuccessful surgical intervention. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA DISH, also known as Forestier disease, is an enthesopathy affecting up to 35% of the elderly population. Many patients develop osteophytes of the anterior cervical spine, which contribute to chronic symptoms of dysphagia causing debilitating weight loss and possibly resulting in the placement of a permanent gastrostomy feeding tube. For patients that fail conservative medical management, an increase in surgical interventions have been reported in the literature in the last 2 decades. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Studies measuring outcomes after surgical intervention for patients with dysphagia from DISH were selected for inclusion. Two independent reviewers screened and assessed all literature in accordance with Cochrane systematic reviewing standards. RESULTS In total, 22 studies reporting 119 patients were selected for inclusion. Successful relief of dysphagia was obtained in 89% of patients after surgical intervention. Failure to relieve dysphagia was associated with increased length of symptoms preoperatively (P<0.01) using logistic regression. Patients with more severe preoperative symptoms also seem to have an increased risk for treatment failure (risk ratio, 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-6.85; P=0.02). Treatment failure was not associated with patient age, use of intraoperative tracheostomy, implementation of additional fusion procedures, level of involved segments, or number of involved segments. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing surgical intervention have a higher likelihood of failing surgery with increasing preoperative symptom length and increased preoperative symptom severity.

DATA SOURCES Comprehensive electronic search of PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science Core Collection. STUDY SELECTION Studies in which a tool that screened children for multiple SDOHs (defined according to Healthy People 2020) was developed, tested, and/or employed. DATA EXTRACTION Extraction domains included study characteristics, screening tool characteristics, SDOHs screened, and follow-up procedures. RESULTS The search returned 6274 studies. We retained 17 studies encompassing 11 screeners. Study samples were diverse with respect to biological sex and race and/or ethnicity. Screening was primarily conducted in clinical settings with a parent or caregiver being the primary informant for all screeners. Psychometric properties were assessed for only 3 screeners. The most common SDOH domains screened included the family context and economic stability. Authors of the majority of studies described referrals and/or interventions that followed screening to address identified SDOHs. LIMITATIONS Following the Healthy People 2020 SDOH definition may have excluded articles that other definitions would have captured. CONCLUSIONS The extent to which SDOH screening accurately assessed a child's SDOHs was largely unevaluated. Authors of future research should also evaluate if referrals and interventions after the screening effectively address SDOHs and improve child well-being.","Sokol, Rebeccah; Austin, Anna; Chandler, Caroline; Byrum, Elizabeth; Bousquette, Jessica; Lancaster, Christiana; Doss, Ginna; Dotson, Andrea; Urbaeva, Venera; Singichetti, Bhavna; Brevard, Kanisha; Wright, Sarah Towner; Lanier, Paul; Shanahan, Meghan",Pediatrics,145,1

In light of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, many health-care settings are now implementing these techniques amid respirator shortages. We sought to perform a critical review of the available literature regarding decontamination methods to determine which strategies are effective at inactivating the target organism, preserve performance (filter efficiency and fit) of the respirator, leave no residual toxicity from the treatment, and are fast-acting, inexpensive, and readily available. We also identified areas for future research. We found that ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is the most widely studied method, and treatments are effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2 without diminishing filtration efficiency or fit. These treatments were found to leave no residual toxicity for the wearer, have a relatively short cycle time of less than 1 h, and existing systems can likely be retrofitted to accommodate this method. Further, UVGI (among other treatment methods) has been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and respirator manufacturers. Methods involving microwave-generated steam also show potential in that they are likely effective against SARS-CoV-2, preserve performance, have no residual toxicity, require a short duration treatment cycle (often less than 10 min), and microwave ovens are inexpensive and readily available. Steam methods are currently recommended by the CDC, OSHA, and manufacturers. These respirator decontamination methods are likely also useful against other viruses or pathogens.","Jacobs, Neva; Chan, Kathy; Leso, Veruscka; D'Anna, Andrea; Hollins, Dana; Iavicoli, Ivo",Toxicology and industrial health,145,1

The approach enables the glass matrix to be explored as a precursor and a route for the synthesis of supported copper-based nanoparticles in a solvent-free process without immobilization steps or stabilizing agents. In order to demonstrate the wide synthetic utility of this CuONPs glass-based catalyst, one-pot three-component domino reactions were performed under an air atmosphere, affording the desired selenylated oxadiazoles in good to excellent yields.

AIMS To assess effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab at week 54 in patients UC and CD. METHODS Between June and December 2014, 173 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 121 with ulcerative colitis (UC) were treated with vedolizumab induction therapy. Among those 294 patients, 272 completed the induction period and were evaluated at the week 14 visit (161 patients with CD and 111 with UC). Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index for CD and the partial Mayo Clinic score for UC. The primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission at week 54. RESULTS At week 54, steroid-free clinical remission rates at week 54 were 27.2% and 40.5% in patients with CD and UC respectively. In addition, the sustained steroid-free clinical remission (from week 14 to week 54) rates were 8.1% and 19.0% respectively. No deaths were observed. Severe adverse events occurred in 17 (7.2%) patients, including six (2.5%) leading to vedolizumab discontinuation. CONCLUSION Vedolizumab is able to maintain steroid-free clinical remission in up to one-third of patients with UC and CD at week 54 with a reasonable safety profile.

METHODS This cross-sectional study included all urban and rural counties in the United States. County-level HL data were estimated using 2010 US Census and 2011 American Community Surveys data; EOL expenditures in 2010 were derived from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care database. Hierarchical generalized linear regressions were used to assess associations between HL and EOL care, controlling for county-level characteristics and focusing on rurality (with areas classified as urban, rural micropolitan, or rural noncore). FINDINGS Of 3,137 US counties, 100 (3.2%) counties where 7.6 million Americans live had low HL (LHL). Counties with LHL had significantly higher average expenditures in the last 6 months of life and during terminal hospitalization than counties with high HL (HHL) (both P < .001). There was a statistically significant interaction between HL and rurality (P < .001). EOL expenditures were significantly higher in LHL counties than HHL counties in urban areas, while no such relationship appeared in rural areas. Average estimated EOL expenditures among LHL counties decreased by rurality ($16,953, $14,939, and $12,671 for urban, rural micropolitan, and rural noncore areas, respectively), while average estimated expenditures in HHL counties were around $14,000 in each of these areas. CONCLUSIONS HL and EOL expenditures were inversely associated with urban America but unrelated to rural areas. Counties with HHL had constant expenditures regardless of rurality. Interventions targeting HL may help reduce EOL expenditures and rural-urban disparities in EOL care.","Shi, Kewei; Hung, Peiyin; Wang, Shi-Yi",The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,145,1

That facility became the initial U.S. epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic when they discovered 129 cases associated with the outbreak (81 residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors) and 23 persons died. The vulnerability of the elderly population, shared living and social spaces, suboptimal infection control practices, and prolonged contact between residents were identified as contributing factors to the rapid spread of the disease. The first known case of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in a U.S. inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit was also in King County, Washington, and occurred soon afterward on March 11th, 2020. Between March 11 and March 18, nine inpatients and seven staff members were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. This article examines how the swift identification and isolation of confirmed patients, an enhanced infection prevention protocol, and engagement of frontline psychiatric care staff prevented a catastrophic outcome in a vulnerable population. METHODS Here we describe infection control and nursing-led interventions that were quickly enacted in response to this SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in an inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit. RESULTS The interventions effectively contained the outbreak, with no further patients and only one staff member testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 over the subsequent 2-month time period. CONCLUSIONS We share our learnings and preventative infection control measures that can be adapted to a variety of settings to prevent or contain future outbreaks of COVID-19.","Constantino-Shor, Cheri; Rani, Golo; Olin, Svaya; Holmes, Charity; Nasenbeny, Keri",Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association,145,16

We aimed to summarize the possible relationship between gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV) and endoscopic GERD according to Lyon Consensus using meta-analysis of studies done in Asia. MATERIALS AND METHODS Comprehensive searches of PubMed, WOS, Embase, SinoMed, and CNKI databases were completed to identify eligible studies published before September 22, 2019. A total of 237 articles have been reviewed and 2 reviewers independently evaluated the eligibility for inclusion, extracted, and analyzed the statistical data. The pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were measured for the association. Random-effects models were used when observing significant heterogeneity. RESULTS A total of 15 studies were included and we found that abnormal GEFV (III and IV) could be associated with RE and the correlation become stronger as the grade increases (RE-A vs. controls-RR: 2.186, 95% CI: 1.560-3.064, P<0.001; RE-B vs. RE-A-RR: 1.268, 95% CI: 1.128-1.425, P<0.001; RE-C vs. RE-B-RR: 1.181, 95% CI: 1.000-1.395, P=0.049; RE-D vs. RE-C-RR: 1.471, 95% CI: 1.151-1.879, P=0.002). Both suspected GERD (RR: 2.400, 95% CI: 1.761-3.271, P<0.001) and endoscopic GERD (RR: 1.388, 95% CI: 1.127-1.711, P=0.002) were related to abnormal GEFV. CONCLUSION Abnormal GEFV could provide useful information for reflux conditions, but it could not distinguish confirmatory GERD from low-grade RE under the upper endoscopy.","Bao, Yun; Chen, Xiaosu; Xu, Ying; Wang, Yan; Lin, Lin; Tang, Yurong",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,145,12

Consequently very few chemoattractants have been identified till date. OBJECTIVES To investigate sperm motility behaviour in response to ovulatory (OV) and preovulatory (preOV) oviductal fluid (OF) and identify potential chemotactic metabolites. MATERIALS AND METHODS Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+ ]I ) influx in capacitating sperm was determined by spectrofluorimetry. The chemotactic response of rat caudal sperm to OF from the preOV- and OV- phases of normally cycling female rats, was assessed in a microfluidic device developed by us. Hydrophilic metabolites extracted from the OF of both the phases were resolved and identified by LC-MS/MS, followed by data analysis using XCMS and Metaboanalyst software, and chemotactic potential of the most promising compound was validated using the microfluidic device. RESULTS Spectrofluorimetric analysis depicts a significant increase in sperm [Ca2+ ]I in response to OV-OF. With the microfluidic chemotaxis assay, sperm population shows a significantly increased directionality and velocity to an ascending gradient of 0.06 µg/µL OV-OF compared to preOV-OF. LC-MS/MS of the OFs demonstrates 5 and 4 metabolites to be exclusive to the OV-OF and preOV-OF, respectively, and 25 metabolites common to both, of which 14 metabolites including N-formyl L-aspartate (NFA) are increased in OV-OF; NFA tested for its ability to influence sperm movement, shows chemotaxis potential. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION(S) This is the first study that has systematically demonstrated sperm chemotaxis with ovulatory phase rat oviductal fluid, identified NFA present in this fluid as a novel chemoattractant to sperm, and proven the utility of the device to test putative chemoattractants. It remains to be seen whether NFA is present in the follicular fluid of infertile women, and whether it may likely be a reason for the failure of natural conception in idiopathic infertile women.","Bhagwat, Shweta; Sontakke, Shraddha; Desai, Sneha; Panchal, Durva; Jadhav, Sameer; Parte, Priyanka",Andrology,145,20

Mortality and/or thrombotic events were reported sporadically in a subset of studies and attributed to the high hematocrit (HCT) achieved in the animals. However, similarly high HCT was achieved in both high-dose and low-dose groups, but there were no reported adverse events in the low-dose group suggesting HCT was not the sole contributing factor leading to toxicity. Our analysis indicated that increased dose, dose frequency, and dosing duration in addition to high HCT contributed to mortality and thrombosis. To further evaluate this relationship, the incidence of toxicities was compared in rats administered an experimental hyperglycosylated analog of recombinant human erythropoietin (AMG 114) at varying dosing schedules in 1-month toxicity studies. The incidence of mortality and thrombotic events increased in higher dose groups and when dosed more frequently, despite a similarly high HCT in all animals. The results from the investigative study and retrospective analysis demonstrate that ESA-related toxicities in preclinical species are associated with dose level, dose frequency, and dosing duration, and not solely dependent upon a high HCT.","Andrews, Dina A; Pyrah, Ian T G; Boren, Babette M; Tannehill-Gregg, Sarah H; Lightfoot-Dunn, Ruth M",Toxicologic pathology,145,16

The aim of this study was to compare the cardiorespiratory responses and preferences of a single bout of interval exercise with continuous exercise in individuals with advanced ILD. Methods: Peak work (Wpeak) was obtained from a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). The total volume of prescribed exercise was matched between a bout of interval cycling (alternating 30 seconds at 100% of Wpeak: 30 seconds total rest × 20 min) and continuous cycling (50% of Wpeak × 20 min). Results: Nine lung transplant candidates with ILD were included: 4 men; 62 (6) years; forced vital capacity (FVC) 60% of predicted; and all using supplemental oxygen. Eight (89%) participants reported a preference for interval exercise and one reported no preference (p = .01). One participant required two unintended breaks during continuous exercise.

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of blunt-tip needles in the surgery. METHODS Cases of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy were reviewed. If a blunt-tip needle had been used to suture the DVC, the patient was recruited to the blunt-tip group. If a regular needle was used, the patient was recruited to the control group. Patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. RESULTS One hundred and nine cases were reviewed. A blunt-tip needle was used to suture the DVC in 67 cases, and a regular needle in 42 cases. All characteristics of the two groups are comparable (p > 0.05). In 66 cases in the blunt-tip group, no sutures or coagulations were needed when suturing the DVC, Five cases of DVC-related bleeding were observed in the control group, which is higher than in the blunt-tip group (p = 0.031). At the same time, no catheter was sutured in the blunt-tip group. All patients were followed for at least six months. The continence rate in the blunt-tip group is 89.6%, significantly higher than in the control group (73.8%, p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS Using a blunt-tip needle to suture the DVC may reduce DVC-related bleeding and provide a better surgical field. It may be helpful in improving postoperative continence. However, its effect on positive margin at the apex still needs further investigation.","Zhang, Chao; Wang, Huiqing; Ye, Chen; Guo, Fei; Yang, Bo; Xu, Chuanliang; Sun, Yinghao",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,145,16

Methods The study was performed on buffy-coat samples from EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood samples of 205 healthy shelter cats. From 50 of these cats, fecal samples were also examined. FCoV genomic and subgenomic RNA in the buffy coats was amplified by a total FCoV RNA qRT-PCR. Evidence for FCoV replication in peripheral blood and feces was obtained by M gene mRNA qRT-PCR. Results Nine of 205 cats (4.4%) were viremic by the total FCoV RNA qRT-PCR, and one of these cats had evidence of peripheral FCoV blood replication by an FCoV mRNA qRT-PCR. The single cat with peripheral blood replication had a unique partial M gene sequence distinct from positive controls and previously published FCoV sequences. Neither seven of the nine viremic cats with follow-up nor the single cat with replicating FCoV with positive qRT-PCR results developed signs compatible with FIP within 6 months of sample collection. Conclusions and relevance FCoV viremia and peripheral blood replication in healthy shelter cats have a low prevalence and do not correlate with later development of FIP in this study population, but larger case-control studies evaluating the prognostic accuracy of the qRT-PCR assays are needed.","Fish, Eric J; Diniz, Pedro Paulo Vp; Juan, Yen-Chen; Bossong, Frank; Collisson, Ellen W; Drechsler, Yvonne; Kaltenboeck, Bernhard",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,145,26

We present our experience with self-expanding Acandis Acclino stents for the treatment of complex aneurysms using the kissing-Y technique. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed seven patients with seven complex aneurysms (three anterior communicating artery (AcomA), two middle cerebral artery, one basilar artery/superior cerebellar artery, and one vertebral artery/posterior inferior cerebellar artery) who were treated with the kissing-Y technique by stent assisted coiling from June 2013 to July 2014, with follow-up until January 2015. DSA follow-up was up to 17 months, with a mean follow-up period of 10 months. Six patients were treated electively and one in the acute phase of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. In all cases, closed cell Acandis Acclino stents were used. We evaluated procedural complications, clinical outcomes, and mid term angiographic follow-up. Additionally, a literature review is provided. RESULTS In all patients, stents were successfully placed and implanted. One patient developed a periprocedural thromboembolic complication not directly related to the stents. No other periprocedural or postprocedural complications were encountered. Follow-up examinations showed stable and total occlusion of all coiled aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS The results of our study show that the kissing-Y technique using closed cell Acandis Acclino stents followed by coil embolization is a feasible treatment option for selected complex bifurcation aneurysms.","Brassel, Friedhelm; Melber, Katharina; Schlunz-Hendann, Martin; Meila, Dan",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,145,1

AREAS COVERED There are numerous RSV interventions in development, including long-acting monoclonal antibodies, vaccines (maternal and child) and treatments which are expected to become available soon. We reviewed the key challenges and issues that need to be addressed to maximize the impact of these RSV interventions in LMICs. The epidemiology of RSV in LMICs was reviewed (PubMed search to 30-Jun-20 inclusive) and the need for more and better-quality data, encompassing hospital admissions, community contacts, and longer-term respiratory morbidity, emphasized. The requirement for an agreed clinical definition of RSV lower respiratory tract infection was also proposed. The pros and cons of the new RSV interventions are reviewed from the perspective of LMICs. EXPERT OPINION We believe that a vaccine (or combination of vaccines, if practicable) is the only viable solution to the burden of RSV in LMICs. A coordinated program, analogous to that with polio, involving governments, non-governmental organizations, the World Health Organization, the manufacturers and the healthcare community is required to realize the full potential of vaccine(s) and end the devastation of RSV in LMICs.","Carbonell-Estrany, Xavier; Rodgers-Gray, Barry S; Paes, Bosco",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,145,1

The long-term prognosis remains dismal given the high likelihood for primary refractory or relapsed disease. An essential component of relapse is resurgence from the bone marrow. To date, the murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche has been clearly defined, but the human HSC niche is less well understood. The design of niche-based targeted therapies for AML must account for which cellular subsets compete for stem cell occupancy within respective bone marrow microenvironments. In this review, we highlight the principles of stem cell niche biology and discuss translational insights into the AML microenvironment as of 2021. Optimization of competition for niche occupancy is important for the elimination of measurable residual disease (MRD). Some of these novel therapeutics are in the pharmacologic pipeline for AML and may be especially useful in the setting of MRD.","Patel, Shyam A; Dalela, Disha; Fan, Amy C; Lloyd, Maxwell R; Zhang, Tian Y",Leukemia & lymphoma,145,1

We systematically reviewed COVID-19 cardiac complications and calculated their pooled incidences. Secondarily, we compared the cardiac troponin I (cTnI) level between the surviving and expired patients. METHODS A systematic search was conducted for manuscripts published from December 1, 2019 to April 16, 2020. Cardiovascular complications, along with the levels of cTnI, creatine kinase (CK), and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) in hospitalized PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were extracted. The pooled incidences of the extracted data were calculated, and the unadjusted cTnI level was compared between the surviving and expired patients. RESULTS Out of 1094 obtained records, 22 studies on a total of 4,157 patients were included. The pooled incidence rate of arrhythmia was 10.11%. Furthermore, myocardial injury had a pooled incidence of 17.85%, and finally, the pooled incidence for heart failure was 22.34%. The pooled incidence rates of cTnI, CK-MB, and CK elevations were also reported at 15.16%, 10.92%, and 12.99%, respectively. Moreover, the pooled level of unadjusted cTnI was significantly higher in expired cases compared with the surviving (mean difference = 31.818, 95% CI = 17.923-45.713, P value <0.001).

Viral receptors are subject to two conflicting directional forces, namely negative selection to maintain their cellular function and positive selection resulted from everchanging host-virus arms race. Much remains unclear how viral receptors evolved in mammals, and whether viral receptors from different mammal groups experienced different strength of natural selection. Here, we perform evolutionary analyses of 92 viral receptors in five major orders of mammals, including Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla, Chiroptera, Primates, and Rodentia. In all the five mammal orders, signals of positive selection are detected for a high proportion of viral receptors (from 41% in Carnivora to 65% in Rodentia). Many positively selected residues overlap host-virus interaction interface. Compared with control genes, we find viral receptors underwent elevated rate of adaptive evolution in all the five mammal orders, suggesting that host-virus conflicts are the main driver of the adaptive evolution of viral receptors in mammals. Interestingly, the overall strength of natural selection acting on viral receptors driven by host-virus arms race is largely homogenous and correlated among different mammal orders with bats and rodents, zoonosis reservoirs of importance, unexceptional. Taken together, our findings indicate host-virus conflicts have driven the elevated rate of adaptive evolution in viral receptors across mammals, and might have important implications in zoonosis surveillance and prediction. Importance Viral receptors are cellular proteins hijacked by viruses to help their infections. A complete picture on the evolution of viral receptors in mammals is still lacking. Here, we perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the evolution of 92 viral receptors in five mammal orders, including Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla, Chiroptera, Primates, and Rodentia. We find that positive selection pervasively occurred during the evolution of viral receptors, and viral receptors exhibit at an elevated rate of adaptive evolution than control genes in all the five mammal orders, suggesting host-virus conflicts are a major driver of the adaptive evolution of viral receptors. Interestingly, the strength of positive selection acting on viral receptors is similar among the five mammal orders.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 68 patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy using a TMLNH (n = 38) or a LNHPH (n = 30). Patients' age, parity, body mass index, mean operating time, mean vaginal cuff suturing time, uterine weight, estimated blood loss, drop of hemoglobin level, return of bowel activity, hospital stay, conversion to multiport access, conversion to laparotomy, and postoperative and intraoperative outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS The TMLNH group had a shorter operative time ( P < .001) and a shorter vaginal cuff suturing time ( P < .001) compared with the LNHPH group during a single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy. There was no difference in intraoperative and postoperative complications. CONCLUSION The TMLNH facilitates vaginal cuff suturing and decreases operation time during a single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy. We proposed that the TMLNH is a promising technique for suturing and vaginal cuff closure in a single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy.","Biler, Alper; Kale, Ahmet; Terzi, Hasan; Solmaz, Ulas",Surgical innovation,145,1

We aimed to identify associations between clinical and radiographic features as well as to assess the feasibility of deep learning applied to chest X-rays in the setting of an acute COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS A retrospective study of X-rays, clinical, and laboratory data was performed from 48 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients (age 60±17 years, 15 women) between February 22 and March 6, 2020 from a tertiary care hospital in Milan, Italy. Sixty-five chest X-rays were reviewed by two radiologists for alveolar and interstitial opacities and classified by severity on a scale from 0 to 3. Clinical factors (age, symptoms, comorbidities) were investigated for association with opacity severity and also with placement of central line or endotracheal tube. Deep learning models were then trained for two tasks: lung segmentation and opacity detection. Imaging characteristics were compared to clinical datapoints using the unpaired student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Cohen's kappa analysis was used to evaluate the concordance of deep learning to conventional radiologist interpretation. RESULTS Fifty-six percent of patients presented with alveolar opacities, 73% had interstitial opacities, and 23% had normal X-rays. The presence of alveolar or interstitial opacities was statistically correlated with age (P = 0.008) and comorbidities (P = 0.005). The extent of alveolar or interstitial opacities on baseline X-ray was significantly associated with the presence of endotracheal tube (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.049) or central line (P = 0.003 and P = 0.007). In comparison to human interpretation, the deep learning model achieved a kappa concordance of 0.51 for alveolar opacities and 0.71 for interstitial opacities. CONCLUSION Chest X-ray analysis in an acute COVID-19 outbreak showed that the severity of opacities was associated with advanced age, comorbidities, as well as acuity of care. Artificial intelligence tools based upon deep learning of COVID-19 chest X-rays are feasible in the acute outbreak setting.","Blain, Maxime; T Kassin, Michael; Varble, Nicole; Wang, Xiaosong; Xu, Ziyue; Xu, Daguang; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Vespro, Valentina; Stellato, Elvira; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Di Meglio, Letizia; D Suh, Robert; A Walker, Stephanie; Xu, Sheng; H Sanford, Thomas; B Turkbey, Evrim; Harmon, Stephanie; Turkbey, Baris; J Wood, Bradford",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,145,23

The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed interest in telemedicine and may spur expansion or development of new TCC programs. This narrative addresses the Cleveland Clinic TCC service, (eHospital) to promote exchange of ideas to continually optimize the practice for current and future users. Methods: A descriptive narrative methodology is used in this report. Results: Cleveland Clinic's eHospital was established in 2014 to support nighttime critical care across system hospitals. It encompasses a tiered system of two-way audiovisual communication, telemetry, software platform that integrates the electronic health record, and a proprietary risk stratification algorithm for targeted electronic surveillance. The TCC team includes intensivists, advanced care providers, and registered nurses. Three coverage models evolved depending on onsite clinician availability. More than 133,000 patients have been served by eHospital to date, and span the typical spectrum of critical illness. Along with universal monitoring, ∼18% of patients received active interventions, the most common of which are categorized. Patterns of activity, typical workflows, and adaptations of bedside best practices are also described. Bookending the work shift are sign outs focused on pending critical issues, unstable patients, and those who can be triaged out of the intensive care unit. In between, TCC teams round periodically and interact with bedside teams. Conclusions: TCC adoption has proceeded slowly. Some acceleration is anticipated in a post-COVID-19 pandemic world.

The aim of this study was to analyze different techniques applied and relative results during the first 2 years of the ECR. METHODS The ECR was designed as a voluntary database with online access. All members of the European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery were requested to participate in the registry. Demographic and therapy data as well as data on the postoperative course are recorded in the ECR in an anonymous way. RESULTS A total of 533 patients who underwent NOTES procedures were included in the study. Four different hybrid techniques for 435 cholecystectomies were described, registering postoperative complications in 2.8% of patients, addition of a single trocar in 5.3%, and conversions to laparoscopy in 0.5%. Both flexible endoscopic and rigid laparoscopic cholecystectomy techniques proved to be safe and effective with minor differences. There was a shorter operative time in the rigid laparoscopic group. Thirty-three appendectomies were reported by transgastric and transvaginal techniques, with transvaginal techniques scoring shorter operative time and hospital stay, but with a frequent need to add more trocars. Overall complications occurred in 14.7% of patients but they did not differ significantly among the different techniques. One transvaginal and 31 transanal sigmoidectomies were included for prolapse and diverticulitis, with four postoperative complications (12.5%), but none needing further treatment. Twenty peroral esophageal myotomies were included with three postoperative complications (15.0%), but none needing further treatment. CONCLUSIONS Five years since the introduction of NOTES into clinical practice, hybrid techniques have gained considerable clinical application. Several NOTES hybrid cholecystectomy and appendectomy techniques are practicable and safe alternatives to laparoscopic procedures. Also, sigmoidectomies and peroral esophageal myotomies were described, proving feasibility and safety.

ED has been demonstrated in patients with hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, and in patients with atherosclerotic disease. Besides classical risk factors, ED is affected by chronic inflammatory diseases and acute infections, particularly viral diseases. Causes of ED include oxidative stress, inflammation, and shear stress, which decrease the bioavailability of nitric oxide. Markers of ED have been sought, particularly circulating markers. Using these tests, it is possible to evaluate the response to harmful effects of risk factors and the effects of treatment on vessel wall function. Endothelial dysfunction is significantly and directly correlated with the occurrence of cardiac events and the risk of cardiac events increase as ED worsens. Because endothelial function plays a central role in atherogenesis it became a therapeutic target. Endothelial dysfunction is reversible and its improvement may be achieved by elimination of risk factors, inhibitors of endothelium-derived contracting factors (angiotensin-converting enzyme), smoking cessation, lipid-lowering drugs, diet, and physical exercise. By reversing ED, it is possible to restore vascular function.","Poredos, Pavel; Visnovic Poredos, Aleksandra; Gregoric, Igor",Angiology,145,16

(L. japonica) has the functions of clearing away heat and detoxifying, broad-spectrum antibacterial and anti-virus, etc. More than 70% of anti-inflammatory and cold Chinese patent medicines contain L. japonica. Trichomes comprise specialized multicellular structures that have the capacity to synthesize and secrete secondary metabolites and protect plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. The extraction of trichome secretions has great commercial value. However, little is known about the trichome formation mechanism in L. japonica. Therefore, the study of trichome development between different varieties provides a basis for selecting suitable planting resources. RESULTS Here, we present a genome-wide comparative transcriptome analysis between two L. japonica cultivars, toward the identification of biological processes and functional gene activities that occur during flowering stage trichome development. In this study, the density and average lengths of flower trichomes were at their highest during three-green periods (S2). Using the Illumina RNA-Seq method, we obtained 134,304 unigenes, 33,733 of which were differentially expressed. In an analysis of 40 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) involved in trichome development, 29 of these were transcription factors. The DEGs analysis of plant hormone signal transduction indicated that plant growth and development may be independent of gibberellin (GA) and cytokinine (CTK) signaling pathways, and plant stress may be independent of jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) signaling pathways. We screened several genes involved in the floral biosynthesis of odors, tastes, colors, and plant hormones, and proposed biosynthetic pathways for sesquiterpenoid, triterpenoid, monoterpenoid, flavonoid, and plant hormones. Furthermore, 82 DEGs were assigned to cell cycles and 2616 were predicted as plant resistance genes (PRGs). CONCLUSIONS This study provides a comprehensive characterization of the expression profiles of flower development during the seven developmental stages of L. japonica, thereby offering valuable insights into the molecular networks that underly flower development in L. japonica.","Li, Jianjun; Ye, Chenglin; Chang, Cuifang",BMC plant biology,145,30

METHODS During a 1-day, full-scale exercise using 354 volunteer victims, variables assessing adherence to the mass screening protocol and infection control recommendations were evaluated using standardized forms. RESULTS While all hospitals were able to apply the suggested mass screening protocol for separation based on case status, significant differences were observed in several infection control variables among participating hospitals and different hospital areas. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of mass screening and other infection control interventions during a hospital full-scale exercise was feasible and resulted in measurable outcomes.

The incorporation of chemokines did not affect hydrogels properties including swelling ratio and mechanical stiffness, and the bioactivities of IL-8 and MIP-3α released from hydrogel matrices were stably maintained. In vivo transplantation of chemokine-loaded GH hydrogels facilitated cell infiltration into the wound area, and promoted wound healing with enhanced re-epithelialization/neovascularization and increased collagen deposition, compared with no treatment or the GH hydrogel alone. Based on our results, we suggest that cell-recruiting chemokine-loaded GH hydrogel dressing can serve as a delivery platform of various therapeutic proteins for wound healing applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE Despite development of materials combined with therapeutic agents for diabetic wound treatment, impaired wound healing by insufficient chemotactic responses still remain as a significant problem. In this study, we have developed enzyme-catalyzed gelatin (GH) hydrogels as a sprayable dressing material that can deliver cell-attracting chemokines for diabetic wound healing. The chemotactic cytokines (IL-8 and MIP-3α) were simply loaded within hydrogel during in situ gelling, and wound healing efficacy of chemokine-loaded GH hydrogels was investigated in STZ-induced diabetic mouse model. These hydrogels significantly promoted wound-healing efficacy with faster wound closure, neovascularization, and thicker granulation. Therefore, we expect that HRP-catalyzed in situ forming GH hydrogels can serve as an injectable/sprayable carrier of various therapeutic agents for wound healing applications.","Yoon, Dong Suk; Lee, Yunki; Ryu, Hyun Aae; Jang, Yeonsue; Lee, Kyoung-Mi; Choi, Yoorim; Choi, Woo Jin; Lee, Moses; Park, Kyung Min; Park, Ki Dong; Lee, Jin Woo",Acta biomaterialia,145,27

To our knowledge, there have been no previous case reports involving the flexor pollicis longus tendon at the thumb interphalangeal joint. We present a 9-year-old boy with a painful mass at the right thumb interphalangeal joint. Initial radiographs revealed a 7-mm ovoid calcific mass along the volar soft tissues of the thumb interphalangeal joint. Subsequent ultrasound and magnetic resonance findings further confirmed calcification with surrounding edema. Because the pain was limiting the patient's school activities, his family elected for excisional biopsy of the calcific mass. Pathology ultimately revealed prominent dystrophic calcifications with surrounding granulomatous inflammation, consistent with calcific tendonitis.","Phan, Mimi; Birkemeier, Krista; George, Reshma; Garza-Gongora, Ricardo; Crisp, Matthew; Trotter, Bradley; Haghshenas, Varan",Proceedings,145,5

The Tidepool experience.,13.012806,3.2318654,2021-05-27,"Previous research suggests that enteric disease and poor gut health interact to decrease pig performance. Our objective was to determine if light birth weight pigs or those from the bottom 10th percentile of transition ADG (tADG) have a higher incidence of pathogen presence or enteric lesions than heavier or faster-growing contemporaries. A total of 1,500 pigs were weighed at birth and divided into 5 birth weight (BRW) categories: <1, 1 to 1.25, 1.26 to 1.5, 1.51 to 1.75, and >1.76 kg. At weaning, 1,054 random pigs were moved to a commercial wean-to-finish barn. Pigs were weighed individually at 0 and 3 wk postweaning. Transition ADG was calculated as the ADG between wk 0 and 3 postweaning. One pig from each of the 10th, 30th, and 70th percentiles of tADG was used to create 1 set of 3 pigs with the same litter size and from the same parity sow. Forty pigs from each of the 3 tADG percentiles were matched for sex, litter size, and sow parity but not BRW to create 20 matched sets of 60 pigs. This allowed for the main effects of BRW and tADG to be studied as a 5 × 3 factorial design. At 3 and 22 wk postweaning, pigs were euthanized for organ system tissue evaluation. Lung, lymph node, and digesta were analyzed for presence of pathogens and for severity of microscopic lesions (0 = not present, 1 = present, with slight erosion, 2 = present, with moderate erosion, and 3 = present and severe erosion). Data were analyzed using PROC GENMOD and GLIMMIX, where pig served as the experimental unit. The fixed effects were BRW and tADG and the random effects were pen and set. There were no BRW × tADG interactions (P = 0.16). There was no correlation (P = 0.12) between tADG and pathogen presence at either 3 or 22 wk postweaning. Incidence and severity of microscopic lesions in the large intestine at 3 wk postweaning decreased linearly with increasing tADG (P = 0.01). Lesion incidence and severity were also affected (P < 0.04) by tADG at 22 wk postweaning, with greater stomach incidence in the 10th percentile. Birth weight affected (P = 0.02) haemolytic Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. B (includes Salmonella typhimurium) isolation at 3 wk postweaning as well as Brachyspira spp. isolation at 22 wk postweaning (P = 0.05) but in mixed directions. There were no effects (P = 0.21) of BRW or tADG on serum or ileum mucosa immune markers. In summary, it is apparent from this research that neither BRW nor tADG are likely causes of pathogen or lesion incidence.","Jones, C K; Madson, D M; Main, R G; Gabler, N K; Patience, J F",Journal of animal science,145,16

Hypercholesterolemia is among the main risk factors for developing cardiovascular events, and is highly prevalent in the Mexican population. The primary objective of the present work was to assess the effect of a dietary portfolio (DP) with functional foods containing dehydrated nopal, soy protein, chia seeds, inulin, and oats in LDL-C and TC concentrations of subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia. Also, we explored the changes in the profile of the lipoprotein subclasses measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). METHODS Sixty-two subjects (47 women, 15 men) with mild hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C, ≥130 ≤ 190 mg/dL, TC > 200 mg/dL) completed the randomized, parallel, controlled study. The dietary intervention was given in two stages. First, a dietary standardization stage with a low saturated fat diet (LSFD) which matched the habitual energy intake of the volunteers for 2-weeks, followed by 2.5 months of dietary intervention with a LSFD plus placebo (PL) or DP. RESULTS Subjects who consumed the LSFD + DP interventions had a significantly higher reduction of LDL-C (-18.05%, P = 0.003) and TC (-17.08%, P = 0.02) compared to volunteers who consumed an LSFD for the same period. Furthermore, the lipoprotein subclass profiling showed that the small low-density-lipoproteins, and the small high-density-lipoproteins significantly decreased (P = 0.04, P < 0.001, respectively), conveying a less atherogenic state. At the end of the study, 78% of the subjects who consumed LSFD + DP reduced their LDL-C below 160 mg/dL, and of these, 47% reduced it below 130 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results obtained from this study, the inclusion of functional foods as part of the lifestyle modifications is recommended to treat mild hypercholesterolemia and reduce cardiovascular risk.

METHODS In this prospective, IRB-approved study, 40 PAD patients (30 male, mean age 72 years) underwent CTA on a dual-source CT scanner at 80kV tube voltage. The reference amplitude for tube current modulation was personalized based on the body mass index (BMI) with 120 mAs for [BMI≤25] or 150 mAs for [2570%) was assessed by two readers independently and compared to subsequent DSA. Radiation exposure was assessed with the computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol) and the dosis-length product (DLP). Objective image quality was assessed via contrast- and signal-to-noise ratio (CNR and SNR) measurements. Radiation exposure and image quality were compared between the BMI groups and between the BMI-adjusted ultra-low-dose protocol and the low-dose institutional standard protocol (ISP). RESULTS The BMI-adjusted ultra-low-dose protocol reached high diagnostic accuracy values of 94% for Reader 1 and 93% for Reader 2. Moreover, in comparison to the ISP, it showed significantly (p<0.001) lower CTDIvol (1.97±0.55mGy vs. 4.18±0.62 mGy) and DLP (256±81mGy x cm vs. 544±83mGy x cm) but similar image quality (p=0.37 for CNR). Furthermore, image quality was similar between BMI groups (p=0.86 for CNR). CONCLUSIONS A CT protocol that incorporates low kV settings with a personalized (BMI-adjusted) reference amplitude for tube current modulation and iterative reconstruction enables very low radiation exposure CTA, while maintaining good image quality and high diagnostic accuracy in the assessment of PAD.","Schreiner, Markus M; Platzgummer, Hannes; Unterhumer, Sylvia; Weber, Michael; Mistelbauer, Gabriel; Loewe, Christian; Schernthaner, Ruediger E",European journal of radiology,145,26

DESIGN Nested case-control study. SETTING UK general practice database, 2000-7. PARTICIPANTS All incident cases of gout (n = 24,768) among adults aged 20-79 and a random sample of 50,000 matched controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Relative risk of incident gout associated with use of antihypertensive drugs. RESULTS After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, visits to the general practitioner, alcohol intake, and pertinent drugs and comorbidities, the multivariate relative risks of incident gout associated with current use of antihypertensive drugs among those with hypertension (n = 29,138) were 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.93) for calcium channel blockers, 0.81 (0.70 to 0.94) for losartan, 2.36 (2.21 to 2.52) for diuretics, 1.48 (1.40 to 1.57) for β blockers, 1.24 (1.17 to 1.32) for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and 1.29 (1.16 to 1.43) for non-losartan angiotensin II receptor blockers. Similar results were obtained among those without hypertension. The multivariate relative risks for the duration of use of calcium channel blockers among those with hypertension were 1.02 for less than one year, 0.88 for 1-1.9 years, and 0.75 for two or more years and for use of losartan they were 0.98, 0.87, and 0.71, respectively (both P<0.05 for trend). CONCLUSIONS Compatible with their urate lowering properties, calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of incident gout among people with hypertension. By contrast, diuretics, β blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and non-losartan angiotensin II receptor blockers are associated with an increased risk of gout.","Choi, Hyon K; Soriano, Lucia Cea; Zhang, Yuqing; Rodríguez, Luis A García",BMJ,145,16

This may warrant determining whether cases of unintentional ocular exposure are increasing, especially in children. Objective To describe the epidemiologic trend of pediatric eye exposures to ABHS and to report the severity of the ocular lesions. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective case series conducted from April 1, 2020, to August 24, 2020. Cases were retrieved from the national database of the French Poison Control Centers (PCC) and from a pediatric ophthalmology referral hospital in Paris, France. Cases of ocular exposure to chemical agents in children younger than 18 years during the study period were reviewed. Cases of ABHS exposure were included. Exposures The following data were collected: age, sex, circumstances of exposure, symptoms, size of the epithelial defect at first examination, time between the incident and re-epithelialization, and medical and/or surgical management. Main Outcomes and Measures Comparison of the number of eye exposures to ABHS in children between April to August 2020 and April to August 2019. Results Between April 1 and August 24, 2020, there were 7 times more pediatric cases of ABHS eye exposures reported in the PCC database compared with the same period in 2019 (9.9% of pediatric eye exposures in 2020 vs 1.3% in 2019; difference, 8.6%; 95% CI, 7.4-9.9; P < .001). The number of cases occurring in public places increased in 2020 (from 16.4% in May to 52.4% in August). Similarly, admissions to the eye hospital for ABHS exposure increased at the same period (16 children in 2020 including 10 boys; mean [SD] age, 3.5 [1.4] years vs 1 boy aged 16 months in 2019). Eight of them presented with a corneal and/or conjunctival ulcer, involving more than 50% of the corneal surface for 6 of them. Two cases required amniotic membrane transplant. Conclusions and Relevance These data support the likelihood of an increasing number of unintentional ocular exposures to ABHS in the pediatric population. To maintain good public compliance with hand disinfection, these findings support that health authorities should ensure the safe use of these devices and warn the parents and caregivers about their potential danger for children.","Martin, Gilles C; Le Roux, Gael; Guindolet, Damien; Boulanger, Etienne; Hasle, Denis; Morin, Emilie; Vodovar, Dominique; Vignal, Catherine; Gabison, Eric; Descatha, Alexis",JAMA ophthalmology,145,24

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a relatively common condition affecting young females that could lead to permanent blindness if not properly treated. In this article, we provide some insight and recommendations regarding the management of IIH during the pandemic. METHODS The diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment methods of IIH during the COVID-19 pandemic period are reviewed. COVID-19 as a mimic of IIH is also discussed. RESULTS Diagnosis and follow-up of papilledema due to IIH during the COVID-19 pandemic can be facilitated by nonmydriatic fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. COVID-19 may mimic IIH by presenting as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, papillophlebitis, or meningoencephalitis, so a high index of suspicious is required in these cases. When surgical treatment is indicated, optic nerve sheath fenestration may be the primary procedure of choice during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION IIH is a serious vision threatening condition that could lead to permanent blindness and disability at a relatively young age if left untreated. It could be the first presentation of a COVID-19 infection. Certain precautions during the diagnosis and management of this condition could be taken that may allow appropriate care to be delivered to these patients while minimizing the risk of coronavirus infection.","Elnahry, Ayman G; Elnahry, Gehad A",Reviews on recent clinical trials,145,5

Vahl) usually used to treat inflammatory diseases. However, little is known about the therapeutic effect of FSE on liver fibrosis. AIM OF THE STUDY The purpose of our study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of FSE on liver fibrosis and reveal the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS Liver fibrosis model was established by subcutaneous injection of olive oil containing 40% CCl4. Rat liver tissue morphologic pathology was investigated by using HE staining, Masson staining and Sirius red staining. Several biochemical markers including liver (ALT, AST, AKP, γ-GT), fibrosis (HA, LN, PC III, Col IV) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) were determined by using Elisa kits. Immunohistochemistry was used to observe the distribution of α-SMA and COL1 in liver tissue. Effects of FSE on inflammatory pathway (TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB) and fibrotic pathway (TGF-β/smads) were detected by western blot and qPCR. RESULTS The results showed that hepatic histopathological injury, abnormal liver function, fibrosis and inflammation induced by CCl4 were improved by FSE (2.5, 5 g/kg). Immunohistochemistry and western blot results indicated that the expression of α-SMA and COL1 in liver tissue was inhibited by FSE (2.5, 5 g/kg). Western blot and qPCR results further proved that FSE (2.5, 5 g/kg) inhibited the transduction of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and TGF-β/smads signaling pathways. CONCLUSION FSE can inhibit the expression of inflammatory factors and fibrotic cytokines, reduce liver injury, and inhibit the development of liver fibrosis through TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and TGF-β/smads signaling pathways.","Hu, Naihua; Guo, Chaocheng; Dai, Xuyang; Wang, Cheng; Gong, Lihong; Yu, Lingyuan; Peng, Cheng; Li, Yunxia",Journal of ethnopharmacology,145,15

Thus, samples from different locations within several skeletal muscles as well as from cardiac and smooth muscle tissue samples were collected from three autopsy cases with varying degree of decomposition. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and compared for protein degradation patterns. Intramuscular variations turned out to be minimal and without major influence for the use of the method. Observed intermuscular differences provide possibilities for future improvement of the precision and temporal application range. The results of this study show the strengths and current limitations of protein degradation-based PMI estimation and provide a deeper understanding of intraindividual postmortem protein degradation processes.","Pittner, Stefan; Gotsmy, Walther; Zissler, Angela; Ehrenfellner, Bianca; Baumgartner, Dominik; Schrüfer, Anna; Steinbacher, Peter; Monticelli, Fabio",International journal of legal medicine,145,5

A székletmikrobiota-transzplantáció (faecalismikrobiota-transzplantáció - FMT) a Clostridioides difficile fertőzés (CDI) kezelésében nemzetközileg széles körben elfogadott, megfelelő szakmai háttér mellett végezve biztonságos, potenciálisan életmentő, költséghatékony, valamint a hospitalizációs idő és az orvos-beteg találkozások jelentős redukálására képes eljárás. Az FMT elvégzésére egyes országokban magas szintű minőségirányítási háttérrel működő, célfeladatra szerveződött donor- és székletbankok rendezkedtek be. Máshol, így például hazánkban, az eljáráshoz az egyértelmű jogi szabályozási környezet, a standardizált technológiai háttér és a finanszírozás hiánya miatt nem egységes a hozzáférés. Régóta időszerű továbbá, hogy a heterogén, nemegyszer háztartási eszközökkel előkészített beavatkozások helyett a nemzetközi és legújabban már a hazai ajánlásokban is megfogalmazott, a betegbiztonságot legjobban garantáló elvárások mellett történjen a széklettranszplantáció. Az új koronavírus (SARS-CoV-2) okozta pandémia megjelenése erőteljes szakmai érv országos szinten az FMT minőségirányítási környezetének és technológiai hátterének újragondolására, mert a SARS-CoV-2 egyszerre jelent kockázatot a CDI miatt kórházban kezelt sérülékeny betegpopulációnak, és egyben veszélyezteti az FMT biztonságosságát mind a recipiens, mind pedig az eljárást végző egészségügyi személyzet tekintetében. Ezekre a szakmai és társadalmi kihívásokra reagálva, a széles körű beteghozzáférés és a legmagasabb szintű betegbiztonság garantálására, a Debreceni Egyetemen új eljárásrendet dolgoztunk ki az FMT végzésére.

Javasolt, hogy országos szinten hasonló, megfelelő minőségirányítási és technológiai környezettel, a SARS-CoV-2-fertőzés kizárását is integráló donorszűrési rendszerrel, továbbá fagyasztottgraft-banki háttérrel működő laboratóriumok vegyenek részt a széklettranszplantációk végzésében.

Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(44): 1858-1871. Summary. Stool transplantation (faecal microbiota transplantation - FMT) is a widely accepted, potentially life-saving, cost-effective medical intervention for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), which has an acceptable safety profile if performed with an appropriate professional background. FMT can significantly reduce hospitalization time and the number of patient visits. National donor and stool banks with high-standard quality management systems were established in certain countries for supporting the procedures. In other regions, including Hungary, patient access is not uniform due to the lack of clear legal regulations, standardized technology or financial reimbursement. It has been expected for a long time to replace the heterogenous techniques, occasionally utilizing household equipment with a technology providing improved patient safety and fulfilling international and recently published local FMT guidelines. The emergence of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a very powerful argument in favour of urgently reconsidering the quality management and technological background of FMT procedures. SARS-CoV-2 is a major threat to the vulnerable patients suffering from CDI and also impose risks for the recipient and healthcare personnel involved in carrying out the transplantation. New FMT guidelines were implemented at the University of Debrecen to address these professional and public challenges, to provide wide patient access and to guarantee the highest achievable patient safety. Relevant elements of this new protocol are presented, focusing on a systemic quality management approach, on the operation of a frozen stool bank and on a modified donor screening algorithm taking the risks of COVID-19 into consideration. We suggest that laboratories with proper quality assurance and technological conditions, implementing SARS-CoV-2 donor screening and operating a frozen graft bank should participate in faecal microbiota transplantations. It is also recommended that, based on the analogies and the similar donor-recipient concept, FMT should be embedded under the organ tissue and cell transplantation polices in Hungary.

Lockdown restrictions, compromised access to medical care and fear of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 have forced patients with non-COVID-19 illnesses such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) to stay home. This situation can lead to delay in T1D diagnosis and insulin treatment resulting in rapid progression to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and therefore increased risk of complications and death. . AIM The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and severity of DKA at the onset of T1D in children diagnosed in our department during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown from March 2020 till May 2020 in comparison to corresponding period of the previous year. . MATERIAL AND METHODS We collected data of children with newly diagnosed T1D. DKA was defined according to ISPAD guidelines. . RESULTS The study cohort comprised 34 children in group 2020 and 52 in group 2019 with an average age 9.90 ±4.9 vs. 9.59±4.7 years with mean HbA1c 12.9 ±2.4 vs. 11.5 ±2.2%, respectively. The incidence of DKA was higher by 12% in group 2020 vs. 2019 (52.94% vs 40.38%; p = 0.276). Regarding the DKA severity (2020 vs. 2019) 32.35% vs. 11.54% were severe (p = 0.026), 17.65 vs. 13% were moderate (p = 0.759), and 2.94 vs. 15.38% were mild (p = 0.081).

CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown changes in society and health care system, the DKA rate has increased by 12 percentage points with more severe cases noted in children with newly diagnosed T1D. Regular education of the whole society about the symptoms of diabetes could contribute to faster diagnosis of T1D and reduction of DKA prevalence. .","Dżygało, Katarzyna; Nowaczyk, Jędrzej; Szwilling, Alicja; Kowalska, Agnieszka","Pediatric endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism",145,12

Although thoracic epidural analgesia provides excellent pain relief, recent trends suggest search for effective alternatives. Systemic morphine is often used as an alternative analgesic technique. However, it does not provide dynamic analgesia and can often impede recovery in patients undergoing major surgery on the abdomen. The authors present the first report of a novel analgesic regimen in this cohort with good outcomes. Methods Five patients undergoing open radical nephrectomy and inferior vena cava exploration received erector spinae plane infusion and intra thecal opioid analgesia at a tertiary care university teaching hospital. Outcomes included dynamic analgesia, length of hospital stay and complications Results Five adult patients undergoing major upper abdominal surgery, who refused thoracic epidural analgesia, received erector spinae plane infusion and intrathecal opioid analgesia. Patients reported effective dynamic analgesia, minimal use of rescue analgesia, early ambulation and enhanced recovery. Conclusion The novel regimen that avoids both epidural analgesia and systemic morphine can be an option in enabling enhanced recovery in this cohort.","Ratnayake, Ashani; Goh, Lihxuan; Woolsey, Lee; Thawale, Roshan; Jackson, Benjamin L; Niraj, G",Scandinavian journal of pain,145,23

Besides weight reduction, other criteria such as safety and nutritional status are of relevance. Therefore, we compared a favored surgical intervention with the most effective conservative treatment regarding anthropometry and nutritional status. METHODS Fifty-four obese patients were included who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG, n = 27) or a 52-week multidisciplinary intervention program (MIP, n = 27) for weight loss. Body weight, body composition assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and serum protein levels were measured before and within 12 months after intervention. RESULTS After 1 year of observation, excess weight loss was more pronounced following LSG (65 %) compared to MIP (38 %, p < 0.001). In both groups, body fat was clearly reduced, but a higher reduction occurred in the LSG group. However, protein status deteriorated particularly in the LSG group. Within 1 year, body cell mass declined from 37.1 to 26.9 kg in the LSG group, but only from 35.7 to 32.2 kg in the MIP group. This resulted in an increased mean extracellular mass/body cell mass ratio (1.42 versus 1.00, p < 0.001), in a decreased mean phase angle (4.4° versus 6.6°, p < 0.001), and in a lower prealbumin level in serum (p < 0.02) in the LSG group compared to the MIP group. CONCLUSIONS LSG, compared to MIP, was more effective regarding excess weight loss and body fat loss within 1 year, however, induced more pronounced muscle mass and protein loss, possibly requiring particular interventions such as exercise or protein supplements.","Friedrich, Asja E; Damms-Machado, Antje; Meile, Tobias; Scheuing, Nicole; Stingel, Katrin; Basrai, Maryam; Küper, Markus A; Kramer, Klaus M; Königsrainer, Alfred; Bischoff, Stephan C",Obesity surgery,145,16

This study aims to provide a detailed systematic review of diarrhoea in adults with COVID-19. METHODS A PUBMED and Scopus search (until 7 September 2020) was performed. Studies that were limited to describing incidence of diarrhoea and its effect on prognosis were excluded. RESULTS Twenty-six papers including 7860 patients with COVID-19 were subjected to synthesis. Mean duration of diarrhoea was 4.2 (3.6-4.9) days (range 1-16 days), whereas mean bowel movement count was 4.6 (3.8-5.3) and maximum was 20 per day. Diarrhoea started on an average 5.1 (3.8-6.5) days after disease onset but was the first manifestation in 4.3% patients. Stool occult blood was detected in 6.8% of patients with diarrhoea, while 53.3% cases had watery diarrhoea. Patients with diarrhoea also had elevated faecal calprotectin. Viral genome in faeces was detected more often in patients with diarrhoea and most often in patients without respiratory symptoms. Fever, myalgia and respiratory symptoms were observed with the same incidence in patients with and without diarrhoea. Similarly, there were no differences noted in complete blood count and most inflammation biomarkers between patients with and without diarrhoea. However, nausea, vomiting abdominal pain, sneezing and headache were more common in patients with diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was the main manifestation of COVID-19 in 6.1% of cases and this form of the disease had specific features.

METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to two groups; uniportal video-assisted lobectomy (Group A; n = 51) and other video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy techniques (Group B; n = 55). The primary outcome measures were: postoperative pain (analogue visual scale) and supplementary doses of analgesics (morphine, milligrams); the secondary outcome measures were: the delay in removing the paravertebral catheter and the chest drain, the duration of the postoperative hospital stay, postoperative complications and the operative or 30-day mortality. We assessed postoperative pain during the first 3 days to identify possible differences coinciding with paravertebral catheter removal and with the start of mobilization, and we evaluated the type of resection, R0/R1 (a very important factor in assessing postoperative pain). All continuous data were evaluated for normality, and analysed with the Mann-Whitney U-tests or t-tests. Categorical data were analysed by Fisher's exact test. RESULTS One hundred and six lobectomies were completed. Both groups were comparable with respect to different clinical parameters (age, clinical stage and comorbidity), preoperative and pathological variables. The median visual analogue pain score in the first 3 days did not show statistically significant differences (respectively, P = 0.58, P = 0.64, P = 0.85). Likewise, the median morphine use in the first 3 days did not show statistically significant differences (respectively, P = 0.72, P = 0.81, P = 0.64). There was no difference in timing to remove the paravertebral catheter (P = 0.82) and the chest drain (P = 0.65) and the duration of the postoperative hospital stay (P = 0.62). There was no difference in postoperative complications (one reoperation for bleeding in Group B, P = 0.24). There was no operative or 30-day mortality in either group. CONCLUSIONS Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy does not present better postoperative outcomes than other video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy techniques.","Perna, Valerio; Carvajal, Angel Francisco; Torrecilla, Juan Antonio; Gigirey, Orlando",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,145,1

The objectives of this study were to report characteristics, disposition, and health status of dogs rescued in the Fukushima Prefecture, and to perform a retrospective epidemiological evaluation of factors associated with disposition and disease incidence at shelters.ProblemsThe problems addressed in this study were shelter-related health issues at the first response shelter and reasons for retained adoption at the secondary shelter that caused delayed closure of the shelter. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was performed with all dogs that were rescued from the restricted area in the Fukushima Prefecture. Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analysis was performed to estimate the median days to outcomes. A chi-square test of homogeneity was used to determine whether ownership status was associated with breed. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between time-to-adoption with ownership status, age, sex, and breed, the association between time to onset of diarrhea with age and breed, and between duration of diarrheic symptoms with the number of antibiotics and the number of medications. RESULTS Five-hundred and twenty-nine dogs were admitted to the Ihno and Miharu shelters (Fukushima Prefecture), including 179 that had detailed medical records. Seventy-six percent of dogs were mixed breed. Twenty-six percent of dogs had verified ownership, and almost 16% of dogs were reclaimed by their owners. Sixty-six percent of dogs developed diarrhea, and 17 different antibiotics were used to treat it. Using three or more different antibiotics was associated with prolonged signs of diarrhea. Dogs with verified ownership took longer for adoption than those without verified ownership. Breed and sex were not significantly associated with time to adoption. Age was associated with prolonged time to adoption. CONCLUSION To improve the welfare of dogs in disasters, responsible owner education, a well-organized registered volunteer training program for care of animals at shelters, proper disease management protocols, and enrichment strategies to prevent stress and disease in shelter setting are essential.

QAC already are commonly found in wastewaters, and their concentration could increase, since QAC are recommended to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Exposure of bacteria to QAC can lead to proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). In particular, O2-based membrane biofilm reactors (O2-MBfRs) achieved excellent CTAB biodegradation, but ARG increased in their biofilms. Here, we applied meta-transcriptomic analyses to assess the impacts of CTAB exposure and operating conditions on microbial community's composition and ARG expression in the O2-MBfRs. Two opportunistic pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, dominated the microbial communities and were associated with the presence of ARG. Operating conditions that imposed stress on the biofilms, i.e., limited supplies of O2 and nitrogen or a high loading of CTAB, led to large increases in ARG expression, particularly for genes conferring antibiotic-target protection. Important within the efflux pumps was the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) family, which may have been active in exporting CTAB from cells. Oxidative stress appeared to be the key factor that triggered ARG proliferation by selecting intrinsically resistant species and accentuating the expression of ARG. Our findings suggest that means to mitigate the spread of ARG, such as shown here in a O2-based membrane biofilm reactor, need to consider the impacts of stressors, including QAC exposure and stressful operating conditions.","Luo, Yi-Hao; Lai, YenJung Sean; Zheng, Chenwei; Ilhan, Zehra Esra; Ontiveros-Valencia, Aura; Long, Xiangxing; Krajmalnik-Brown, Rosa; Rittmann, Bruce E",The Science of the total environment,145,29

By public messaging, we are referring to a well-established evidence-driven method of disseminating information at scale that enables the public to take action to protect their health. Our project plan was upended by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-but we used the opportunity to conduct focus groups during the pandemic that, compared with focus groups conducted before the pandemic, provide an important portrait of public perceptions of serious illness care that can be used to design for greater public engagement. Our findings can be summarized in three observations. First, misunderstanding of ACP, PC, and hospice is wide ranging and deep. Second, COVID-19 evokes its own brand of confusion and ambivalence that is distinct from other serious illnesses. And third, distrust of the health care system has become the new normal. Despite these findings, our focus group participants strongly endorsed five messaging principles (1) talk up the benefits, (2) present choices for every step, (3) use stories that are positive and aspirational, (4) invite dialogue-more than once, and (5) invoke a new team-of people who matter, clinicians, medical institutions, and community organizations who are ready to help. After listening to 100-word stories describing real patient experiences with ACP, PC, and hospice, our focus group participants expressed interest and appreciation.

Given the links between inflammation and thrombosis, the use of higher doses of anticoagulants could improve outcomes. We conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in adult patients hospitalized with non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated D-dimer. Patients were randomized to therapeutic-dose bemiparin (115 IU/Kg daily) vs. standard prophylaxis (bemiparin 3,500 IU daily), for 10 days. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of death, intensive care unit admission, need of mechanical ventilation support, development of moderate/severe acute respiratory distress and venous or arterial thrombosis within 10 days of enrollment. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding (ISTH criteria). A prespecified interim analysis was performed when 40% of the planned study population was reached. From October 2020 to May 2021, 70 patients were randomized at 5 sites and 65 were included in the primary analysis; 32 patients allocated to therapeutic-dose and 33 to standard prophylactic-dose.

OBJECTIVE To determine the best physical components of bubble CPAP circuits for respiratory support of children in low-resource settings. METHODS Using PubMed, CINAHL and LILACS, studies of any design in any language published before June 2017 which examined the physical components of bCPAP circuits were identified and reviewed. RESULTS After screening, the review included 45 articles: 17 clinical trials, 11 literature reviews, 10 technical assessments of bCPAP components, three reports of real-world implementation in low-resource settings, three cost analyses and one case report. There is no ideal bCPAP circuit for all settings and patients, but some choices are generally better than others in designing a circuit for low-resource settings. Oxygen concentrators are usually the best source of oxygen. As yet, there is no affordable and accurate oxygen blender.

Methods Original research articles in English obtained through keyword search in PubMed, WHO Global Database for COVID19, and pre-print servers were included in the review. Thematic synthesis of extracted data from articles were done. Results Twenty-four articles were found eligible for the review - four published articles and twenty pre-print articles. Compartmental model was found to be the most commonly used mathematical model; along with exponential, time varying, neural network and cluster kinetic models. Social distancing, specifically lockdown, was the most commonly modelled intervention strategy. Additionally, contact tracing using smartphone application, international travel restriction, increasing hospital/ICU beds, changes in testing strategy were also dealt with. Social distancing along with increasing testing seemed to be effective in delaying the peak of the epidemic and reducing the peak prevalence. Conclusion Although there is mathematical rationality behind implementation of social distancing measures including lockdown, this study also emphasised the importance of other associated measures like increasing tests and increasing the number of hospital and ICU beds. The later components are particularly important during the social mixing period to be observed after lifting of lockdown.","Lahiri, Arista; Jha, Sweety Suman; Bhattacharya, Saikat; Ray, Soumalya; Chakraborty, Arup",Indian journal of public health,145,27

Methods From January 20 to February 26, 2020, adult patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who were treated in The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, in Zhuhai, China, were recruited. Forty-seven eligible patients were enrolled and randomly classified into either the test group or the control group. All of the patients received the standard therapeutic regimen and routine ward rounds. The test group was subdivided into three subgroups: the first subgroup (5-minute group) was given an extra 5-minute ward round by WeChat voice call once daily for basic disease communication; the second subgroup (10-minute group) received an extra 10-minute ward round by WeChat voice call once daily for further detail; and the third subgroup (20-minute group) was given an extra 10-minute ward round via WeChat voice call once daily, as well as an extra 10 minutes every 3 days. The primary outcome was the duration of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid diagnosed by the NAT (nucleic acid testing).

Our innovative, digital health solution comprises two components: (1) a highly personalised and measurement-based model of care (Brain and Mind Centre model of care) that considers both the heterogeneity of mental disorders and other underlying comorbidities, as well as clinical staging; and (2) a health information technology (i.e. the InnoWell Platform). This digital health solution has been embedded as part of standard service delivery into a community-based intake service, thus resulting in a redesigned service model. The service model is currently being implemented as part of a pilot feasibility study, the marker of acceptability at the health professional and service level, and is now under active evaluation to determine its effect on outcomes for consumers, health professionals and the service. For the purposes of this paper, this model served as a prototype for the preclinic triage system that was conceptualised for national scalability at the primary health network level. When implemented at a national level, our direct-to-consumer preclinic triage system is expected to be an effective population health demand management strategy to address the rapidly emerging mental health demand crisis in Australia, and is aligned with the recent recommendation from the Productivity Commission to develop a sustainable national digital platform to facilitate the assessment and referral process to ensure access to mental health care matched to an individual's level of need.What is known about the topic?Although there is increased recognition of the mental health demand crisis in Australia as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, little has been done to 'flatten' the curve. The Australian Government committed additional funding to support the Better Access Pandemic Support measure; however, this approach to care fails to appreciate both the disparities in service availability across Australia and the gap fees that are prohibitive to some of those seeking help. Furthermore, the expansion of this program may only result in those in care remaining in care, thus further delaying access to those in need.What does this paper add?This paper describes a digital health solution, comprised of a highly personalised and measurement-based model of care coupled with a health information technology, that has been embedded as part of standard service delivery. Consumers seeking mental health care complete a multidimensional self-report assessment via the technology, the results of which are available in real-time and used to facilitate triage to pathways of care as indicated by the severity of the consumer's illness and level of need to more effectively and efficiently allocate consumers to care. The redesigned service model is now under active evaluation to determine its effects on outcomes at consumer, health professional and service levels.What are the implications for practitioners?The redesigned local service model served as a prototype for our innovative direct-to-consumer preclinic triage system specifically designed to allocate consumers to self-management, ambulatory care or acute care based on clinical stage and level of need. It is our hypothesis that the preclinic triage system will be an effective population health demand management strategy. Importantly, the proposed preclinic triage system aligns with the recent recommendation from the Productivity Commission for the Australian Government to fund the development and sustained implementation of a digital platform to facilitate assessment and referral to evidence-based interventions matched to a consumer's level of need.","Davenport, Tracey A; LaMonica, Haley M; Rowe, Shelley; Sturgess, Julie; Scott, Elizabeth M; Lee, Grace; Cheng, Vanessa Wan Sze; Hickie, Ian B",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,145,27

Milk yield, milking time, milk flow and milking interval were measured and milk samples were analysed for gross composition, sodium and potassium concentration, free fatty acid (FFA) content, milk fat globule (MFG) size, MFG membrane (MFGM) material and fatty acid composition. Residual milk was harvested to evaluate udder emptying. Increasing the take-off level from 200 to 800 g/min at the whole udder level decreased milking time and increased harvest flow. Udder emptying decreased slightly, but there were no effects on milk yield, FFA content or MFGM. There were interactive effects of take-off level and feeding during milking on content of fatty acids C4:0, C6:0, C16:0, C18:3(n-3) and C20:0. Feeding during milking increased milk yield per day and decreased milking interval. Sodium and potassium concentrations in milk were unaffected by treatments, indicating no loss of tight junction integrity. From these results, it is clear that feeding during milking should be used to increase milk yield and improve milking efficiency, regardless of take-off level used, and that the effect of feeding is more pronounced when a low take-off level is used. Feeding seemed to counteract the effects of the low take-off level on milking time and milking interval. Low take-off levels can therefore be used in combination with feeding.","Ferneborg, Sabine; Stadtmüller, Larissa; Pickova, Jana; Wiking, Lars; Svennersten-Sjaunja, Kerstin",The Journal of dairy research,145,20

In this randomised, double-blind controlled clinical trial, 52 men with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia attending a urology clinic, were randomly assigned to either an intervention or placebo (n = 26) group. This investigation was registered by the identification code of IRCT20141025019669N7 in the clinical trials registry of Iran. The Intervention group took 500 mg of Probiotics daily and the placebo group took a daily placebo for 10 weeks. Semen parameters, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, inflammatory factors and reproductive hormones were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. After the intervention, ejaculate volume, number, concentration and the percentage of motile sperm, total antioxidant capacity of plasma significantly increased and the concentration of plasma malondialdehyde and inflammatory markers significantly decreased in the intervention group. Probiotic supplementation in infertile men lead to a significant increase in sperm concentration and motility and a significant reduction in oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. Therefore, oral intake of probiotics has the potential to be one of the ways to deal with oxidative damage of sperm.","Helli, Bijan; Kavianpour, Maria; Ghaedi, Ehsan; Dadfar, Mohammadreza; Haghighian, Hossein Khadem",Human fertility,145,19

Here, we show that macaque immunization with a multimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) nanoparticle adjuvanted with 3M-052/Alum elicited cross-neutralizing antibody (cross-nAb) responses against batCoVs, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, P.1, and B.1.351. Nanoparticle vaccination resulted in a SARS-CoV-2 reciprocal geometric mean neutralization ID50 titer of 47,216, and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in macaque upper and lower respiratory tracts. Importantly, nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding a stabilized transmembrane spike or monomeric RBD also induced SARS-CoV-1 and batCoV cross-nAbs, albeit at lower titers.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective review of our department data was conducted between March 20, 2020, and April 16, 2020. All consecutive patients who received healthcare in both urology and emergency COVID-19 clinics by urologists during this period were included. We classified our healthcare into 4 categories: 1) Standard urological outpatient clinic procedures, 2) Urological emergency procedures, 3) Standard inpatient treatment clinic procedures and specific inpatient treatment clinic procedures for COVID-19 suspected cases, and 4) Specific emergency clinic procedures for COVID-19. Epidemiologic data and patient characteristics were analyzed using independent t test and chi-square test. RESULTS Overall, the data of 990 patients were evaluated. Of these patients, 344 were seen in standard urology outpatient clinic and 212 were transferred from COVID-19 emergency clinic and hospitalized because of suspected COVID-19 infection. In the COVID-19 emergency clinic, 361 patients were seen by urologists in different shifts. Our workload was on behalf of COVID-19 cases. In our COVID-19 experience, there were no statistically significant differences between our suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients in terms of mean age, sex and age periods (p=0.30, p=0.77, and p=0.78, respectively). CONCLUSION We successfully contributed to the national COVID-19 management program. In our opinion, each department should create a customized action plan instead of a standardized approach during the COVID-19 pandemic or potential public emergencies in the future.","Temiz, Mustafa Zafer; Yürük, Emrah; Kandıralı, Engin; Semerciöz, Atilla; Müslümanoğlu, Ahmet Yaser",Turkish journal of urology,145,16

Greater occipital nerve blockades can transiently suppress attacks in approximately 50% of patients, however, its mechanism of action remains uncertain, and there are no reliable predictors of treatment response. To address this, we investigated the effect of occipital nerve blockade on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), an index of brain activity, and differences between treatment responders and non-responders. Finally, we compared baseline perfusion maps from patients to a matched group of healthy controls. METHODS 21 male, treatment-naive patients were recruited while in a cluster headache bout. During a pain-free phase between headaches, patients underwent pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelled MRI assessments to provide quantitative indices of rCBF. MRIs were performed prior to and 7-to-21 days following treatment. Patients also recorded the frequency of their headache attacks in a daily paper diary. Neuropsychological assessment including anxiety, depression and quality of life measures was performed in a first, scanning free session for each patient. RESULTS Following treatment, patients demonstrated relative rCBF reductions in posterior temporal gyrus, cerebellum and caudate, and rCBF increases in occipital cortex. Responders demonstrated relative rCBF increases, compared to non-responders, in medial prefrontal cortex and lateral occipital cortex at baseline, but relative reductions in cingulate and middle temporal cortices. rCBF was increased in patients compared to healthy controls in cerebellum and hippocampus, but reduced in orbitofrontal cortex, insula and middle temporal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS We provide new mechanistic insights regarding the aetiology of cluster headache, the mechanisms of action of occipital nerve blockades and potential predictors of treatment response. Future investigation should determine whether observed effects are reproducible and extend to other headache disorders.","Medina, Sonia; Bakar, Norazah Abu; O'Daly, Owen; Miller, Sarah; Makovac, Elena; Renton, Tara; Williams, Steve C R; Matharu, Manjit; Howard, Matthew A",The journal of headache and pain,145,1

Greater surveillance of underage use is necessary to inform e-cigarette policy and mitigate adolescent e-cigarette use. Accurate prevalence estimates for adolescent e-cigarette use are provided by large national surveys. However, these surveys are costly and provide only annual estimates. To obtain more affordable estimates faster and more frequently, novel methods are required. Methods: Online search term popularity data were taken from Google Trends. Interest in vaping-related search terms were followed monthly from January 2011 to November 2020. Time-lagged zero-normalized cross-correlations were performed between the Google data and current (past 30 day) high-school e-cigarette use prevalence estimates from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS). The search interest data were then calibrated to the NYTS data to estimate adolescent e-cigarette use prevalence using online searches. Results: Maximum correlation coefficients of 0.979 for ""vapes"" and 0.938 for ""vape"" were obtained when search interest lagged use prevalence by one month, and 0.970 for ""vape pen"" when the lag was two months (p < 0.001 for all). Calibrating the search term data to NYTS provided a high-school current e-cigarette use prevalence estimate of 12.1-18.4% for November 2020, suggesting adolescent use of e-cigarettes has continued to decline since the NYTS estimate of 19.6% for January-March 2020. Conclusions: Online search trend data may provide reasonably reliable and more frequent estimates of adolescent e-cigarette use prevalence at substantially lower costs than traditional surveys. Such additional data may help to assess immediate impacts of policies and events.","Foxon, Floe",Substance use & misuse,145,5

Currently, permanent and nonpermanent options are available. However, concern has been raised about the permanent buttress material and its potential for delayed strip expulsion. This study analyzed our experience with 3 different buttressing materials for creating the gastric division during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. METHODS From July 5, 2001 to May 30, 2007, 1451 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass with buttressing material used for the stapled creation of the gastric pouch. Peristrips Dry (PSDs), permanent bovine pericardial strips, were used in 926 cases from July 5, 2001 to October 11, 2005. Seamguards, a synthetic bioabsorbable product, were used in 145 cases from November 2, 2004 to July 18, 2006, and PSD Veritas, remodelable, nonpermanent bovine pericardial strips, were placed in 380 patients from October 11, 2005 to May 30, 2007. All products were applied to the 60-mm-long, 3.5-mm cartridges of the EndoGIA II stapler. The ease of use, operative complications, visual bleeding, and postoperative leaks were recorded. RESULTS The patient characteristics were comparable for all groups. All products were easy to load on the stapler, and no operative complications related to the use of the buttress materials occurred. The incidence and severity of staple line bleeding was not specifically calculated but was visually noted to be minimal in all cases. Of the 3 groups, 4 contained leaks occurred in the Seamguards group, and all were successfully managed nonoperatively. No acute leaks were discovered in the PSD or PSD Veritas groups. This difference was statistically significant (p <.001). CONCLUSION Neither the PSDs or PSD Veritas group exhibited staple line complications. However, 4 leaks occurred in the patients who had Seamguards incorporated into their gastric pouch linear staple lines.","Shikora, Scott A; Kim, Julie J; Tarnoff, Michael E",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,145,28

This study was performed with the aim to compare the SSI rate in human immunodeficiency virus HIV-positive patients, to identify other risk factors for SSI and to establish a nomogram model to predict the risk of SSI. METHODS A total of 101 HIV-positive individuals following orthopedic surgery patients admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital. Their characteristics were gathered. The univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed to explore the risk factors of SSI. And the Nomogram prediction model was constructed and verified.

STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review was performed of all surgical consults at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in the 30 days prior to and 30 days following confirmation of the first COVID-19 patient at the institution. Consults to all divisions within general surgery were included. RESULTS Total surgical consult volume decreased by 43% in the post-COVID-19 period, with a significant reduction in the median daily consult volume from 14 to 8 (P < .0001). Changes in consult volume by patient location, chief complaint, and surgical division were variable, in aggregate reflecting a disproportionate decrease among less acute surgical complaints. The percentage of consults resulting in surgical intervention remained equal in the 2 periods (31% vs 28%, odds ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.61-1.21, P = .38) with most but not all operation types decreasing in frequency. The rise in the COVID-19 inpatient census led to increased consultation for vascular access, accommodated at our center by the creation of a new surgical procedures team.

All the constructs were assessed by self-report in an anonymous survey during the final period of the outbreak. Results showed that the relations of stressors and coping to psychological adjustment varied by domain of adjustment. Regression analyses suggested that the number of stressors and use of avoidant coping strategies positively predicted psychological symptoms. Active coping positively predicted life satisfaction when controlling for stressors. Moreover, all types of coping served as a buffer against the negative impact of stressors on perceived general health. These findings hold implications for university counseling services during times of acute, large-scale stressors. In particular, effective screening procedures should be developed to identify students who experience a large number of stressors and thus are at high risk for developing mental health problems. Intervention efforts that target coping should be adapted to take account of the uncontrollability of stressors and clients' cultural preferences for certain coping strategies.

Social isolation (lockdown) has been assessed to prevent and control virus diffusion, leading to a worldwide financial and political crisis. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swab takes place by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). However, molecular tests can give some false-negative results. In this context, serological assays can be useful to detect IgG/IgM antibodies, to assess the degree of immunization, to trace the contacts, and to support the decision to re-admit people at work. A lot of serological diagnostic kits have been proposed on the market but validation studies have not been published for many of them. The aim of our work was to compare and to evaluate different assays analytical performances (two different immunochromatographic cards, an immunofluorescence chromatographic card, and a chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay) on 43 positive samples with RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 negative control subjects. Our data display excellent IgG/IgM specificities for all the immunocromatographic card tests (100% IgG and 100% IgM) and for the chemiluminescence-automated assay (100% IgG and 94% IgM); IgG/IgM sensitivities are moderately lower for all methods, probably due to the assay viral antigen's nature and/or to the detection time of nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, with respect to symptoms onset. Given that sensitivities (around 94% and 84% for IgG and IgM, respectively) implicate false-negative cases and given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments, the only currently available procedure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission is to identify and isolate persons who are contagious. For this reason, we would like to submit a flowchart in which serological tests, integrated with nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, are included to help social and work activities implementation after the pandemic acute phase and to overcome lockdown.","Nuccetelli, Marzia; Pieri, Massimo; Grelli, Sandro; Ciotti, Marco; Miano, Roberto; Andreoni, Massimo; Bernardini, Sergio",Cell death discovery,145,1

Recent progress in the understanding of human proteases responsible for influenza virus hemagglutinin activation has led to the identification of members of the type II transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 and human airway trypsin-like protease; however, none has proved to be the sole enzyme responsible for hemagglutinin cleavage. In this study, we identify and characterize matriptase as an influenza virus-activating protease capable of supporting multicycle viral replication in the human respiratory epithelium. Using confocal microscopy, we found matriptase to colocalize with hemagglutinin at the apical surface of human epithelial cells and within endosomes, and we showed that the soluble form of the protease was able to specifically cleave hemagglutinins from H1 virus, but not from H2 and H3 viruses, in a broad pH range. We showed that small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of matriptase in human bronchial epithelial cells significantly blocked influenza virus replication in these cells. Lastly, we provide a selective, slow, tight-binding inhibitor of matriptase that significantly reduces viral replication (by 1.5 log) of H1N1 influenza virus, including the 2009 pandemic virus. Our study establishes a three-pronged model for the action of matriptase: activation of incoming viruses in the extracellular space in its shed form, upon viral attachment or exit in its membrane-bound and/or shed forms at the apical surface of epithelial cells, and within endosomes by its membrane-bound form where viral fusion takes place.","Beaulieu, Alexandre; Gravel, Émilie; Cloutier, Alexandre; Marois, Isabelle; Colombo, Éloïc; Désilets, Antoine; Verreault, Catherine; Leduc, Richard; Marsault, Éric; Richter, Martin V",Journal of virology,145,1

This approach to governing can draw large support from the populace, legislators, and the academic community alike. Yet, it has the potential to undermine evidence-based health policy decision making. In this paper, I delineate six drawbacks and several related corollaries drawn from historical events that have occurred during the recent coronavirus pandemic. These examples illustrate the dire downstream consequences (e.g., disregard for the needs of minority groups; diminution of critical services not broadly supported by the public; promotion of fringe group or foreign actor agendas; advancement of poorly informed opinions; shift from a forward-thinking, proactive perspective to a retroactive one; and reliance on potentially biased estimates) that may follow if public surveys become embedded in healthcare policy decision making. Without solutions to the drawbacks delineated in this paper, health policy driven by public opinion is likely to cause more harm than good.","Gugiu, Paul Cristian",Evaluation & the health professions,145,1

However, the cellular dynamics that underlie transplanted NPC-mediated remyelination have not been described. Using two-photon imaging of a newly developed ventral spinal cord preparation and a viral model of demyelination, we describe the motility and intercellular interactions of transplanted mouse NPCs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) with damaged axons expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Our findings reveal focal axonal degeneration that occurs in the ventral side of the spinal cord within 1 wk following intracranial instillation with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV). Axonal damage precedes extensive demyelination and is characterized by swelling along the length of the axon, loss of YFP signal, and transected appearance. NPCs engrafted into spinal cords of JHMV-infected mice exhibited diminished migration velocities and increased proliferation compared with transplanted cells in noninfected mice. NPCs preferentially accumulated within areas of axonal damage, initiated direct contact with axons, and subsequently expressed the myelin proteolipid protein gene, initiating remyelination. These findings indicate that NPCs transplanted into an inflammatory demyelinating microenvironment participate directly in therapeutic outcome through the wrapping of myelin around damaged neurons.","Greenberg, Milton L; Weinger, Jason G; Matheu, Melanie P; Carbajal, Kevin S; Parker, Ian; Macklin, Wendy B; Lane, Thomas E; Cahalan, Michael D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,145,1

As both a mediator and a target of IFN signals, STAT1 expression reports on, and determines IFN activity. Gene expression analyses of melanoma patient samples revealed varied levels of STAT1 expression, which highly correlated with expression of >700 genes. The ability of oncolytic viruses to exploit tumor-induced defects to antiviral responses suggests that oncolytic viruses may efficiently target a subset of melanomas, yet these should be defined. We modeled this scenario with murine B16F10 melanomas, immortalized skin fibroblasts as controls and a novel oncolytic virus, EHDV-TAU. In B16F10 cells, constitutive low expression of STAT1 and its target genes, which included intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), correlated with their inability to mount IFN-based antiviral responses upon EHDV-TAU challenge, and with potency of EHDV-TAU-induced oncolysis. This under-expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and PRRs, and the inability of EHDV-TAU to induce their expression, were reversed by epigenetic modifiers, suggesting epigenetic silencing as a basis for their under-expression. Despite their inability to mount IFN/STAT-based responses upon viral infection, EHDV-TAU infected B16F10 cells secreted immune-stimulatory chemokines. Accordingly, in vivo, EHDV-TAU enhanced intra-tumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T-cells and reduced growth of local and distant tumors. We propose that 'STAT1 signatures' should guide melanoma virotherapy treatments, and that oncolytic viruses such as EHDV-TAU have the potential to exploit the cellular context of low-STAT1 tumors.","Dellac, Sarah; Ben-Dov, Hamutal; Raanan, Ayala; Saleem, Hanna; Zamostiano, Rachel; Semyatich, Rinat; Lavi, Sara; Witz, Isaac P; Bacharach, Eran; Ehrlich, Marcelo",International journal of cancer,145,32

However, behavioral interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation are Level-A evidence-based treatments for headache prevention. To understand how to develop and study further mind-body interventions (MBIs) and behavioral therapies for PTH and PCS, we developed the following question using the PICO framework: Are behavioral therapies and MBIs effective for treating PTH and PCS? METHODS We conducted a systematic search of 3 databases (Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE) for behavioral interventions and MBIs with the subject headings and keywords for PTH, concussion, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Inclusion criteria were (1) randomized controlled trials, (2) the majority of the intervention had to be behavioral or mind-body therapy focused, (3) the majority of the participants (>50%) had to have had a mild TBI (not a moderate or severe TBI), (4) published in a peer-reviewed publication, and (5) meeting pre-specified primary and/or secondary outcomes. Primary outcome(s): whether there was a significant change in concussion symptom severity (yes/no) based on the symptom severity checklist/scale used, whether there was a 50% reduction in headache days and/or disability; secondary outcome(s): sleep variables, cognitive complaints, depression, and anxiety. The search identified 917 individual studies. Two independent reviewers screened citations and full-text articles independently. Nineteen articles were pulled for full article review. Seven articles met the final inclusion criteria. The systematic review was registered in Prospero (CRD42017070072). RESULTS Overall, there was vast heterogeneity across the studies, making it difficult to fully assess efficacy. The heterogeneity ranged from differences in patient populations, the timing of when the interventions were initiated, the types of intervention implemented, and the measures used to assess outcomes. Seven studies were identified as meeting final inclusion criteria, resulting in a total of 1108 adult participants ranging from 18 to 80. Sixty-nine percent were male. Of the 7 studies, 3 were focused on military staff (retired and active). Time post-injury for inclusion into the studies varied from 48 hours post-injury to more than 2 years post-injury. One of the 7 studies did not include time post-TBI in the inclusion criteria. Two studies recruited patients who had visited their emergency departments, 4 of the studies recruited subjects through outpatient referrals, and 1 study recruited patients who had been in a prior traffic accident with resulting chronic PTH directly from a headache center. Group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions and telephonic counseling or communication were common intervention methods used in the studies, with group CBT being used in 2 of the studies and telephonic counseling being used in 3. Other intervention methods used included individual CBT, cognitive training, psychoeducation, and computer-based and/or therapist-directed cognitive rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS Many of the interventions offered vastly different methods of delivery of intervention and doses of intervention. Many of the negative studies were done after an extended duration post-injury (>1-year posttraumatic brain injury [TBI]). In addition, the participants were lumped together regardless of their pre-concussion comorbidities, their mechanism of injury, their symptoms, and the duration from injury to the start of the intervention. The mass heterogeneity found between the studies led to inconclusive findings. Thus, there are various considerations for the design of the intervention for future behavioral/MBI studies for PTH and concussion that must be addressed before the leading question of this review may be effectively answered.","Minen, Mia; Jinich, Sarah; Vallespir Ellett, Gladys",Headache,145,11

In this article, we report our technique and experience. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE With supine positioning, an umbilical trocar and three 5-mm trocars are positioned across the epigastrium. The gastrocolic ligament is opened completely and the stomach is retracted superiorly. A vessel-sealing electrosurgical device is used to dissect along the inferior margin of the pancreas. Dissection proceeds proximally or distally, depending on the location of the pathology. The proximal pancreatic duct is oversewn or stapled closed. The distal pancreas is mobilized from the splenic vessels. If the vessels cannot be mobilized from the pancreas, they are divided and a laparoscopic splenectomy is performed. The specimen is removed through the umbilical trocar by using a retrieval bag. Drains are placed prior to closure. CASE EXPERIENCE: We report 4 cases: 2 with pseudopapillary tumors and 2 with traumatic injuries. One patient was male; the mean age was 13.0 +/- 1.4 years. Two spleens were removed due to pathology. Mean operative time was 256 +/- 46.6 minutes, with no open conversion or mortality. Patients initiated oral intake 2.0 +/- 1.4 days postoperatively. Hospital stay was 6.2 +/- 3.9 days. One patient required 15 days of total parenteral nutrition to resolve a pancreatic fistula. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic pancreatic resection in children is feasible, safe, and leads to rapid recovery without significant morbidity. The spleen can often be spared, minimizing the risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis. This initial experience should encourage wider use of laparoscopy for pancreatic resection in children.","Mukherjee, Kaushik; Morrow, Stephen E; Yang, Edmund Y",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

METHODS A total of 230 patients who underwent DP between 2008 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed to identify predictive factors for portal or splenic VT. RESULTS Ultimately, 164 patients were analyzed. Portal or splenic VT was significantly correlated with age < 65 years old, benign tumor, laparoscopic surgery, preservation of the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and left gastric vein (LGV), preservation of the IMV only, no drainage vein, length of the residual splenic vein (RSV) ≥ 26 mm, vessel dissection with a linear stapler, and intra-abdominal abscess (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, a multivariate analysis indicated that the length of the RSV (odds ratio [OR]: 9.15, P = 0.03) was an independent predictive factor for portal VT and that the length of the RSV (OR: 37.9, P < 0.01), vessel dissection with a linear stapler (OR: 6.49, P = 0.03), and intra-abdominal abscess (OR: 23.0, P = 0.02) were independent predictive factors for splenic VT. CONCLUSION As the length of the RSV was significantly associated with portal or splenic VT, a follow-up imaging diagnosis might be recommended for such cases.","Tanaka, Nobutake; Yamada, Suguru; Sonohara, Fuminori; Takami, Hideki; Hayashi, Masamichi; Nakayama, Goro; Koike, Masahiko; Fujiwara, Michitaka; Fujii, Tsutomu; Kodera, Yasuhiro",Surgery today,145,11

It has exposed a serious primary care shortage, the unreliability of employer-sponsored health insurance, systemic racism, and other dysfunctions of a system turned on its head without a primary care base. Fundamental reform is urgently needed to bring affordable health care that is accessible to all Americans. Over the last 40-plus years, our supposed system has been taken over by corporate stakeholders with the presumption that a competitive unfettered marketplace will achieve the needed goal of affordable, accessible care. That theory has been thoroughly disproven by experience as the ranks of more than 30 million uninsured and 87 million underinsured demonstrates. Three main reform alternatives before us are: (1) to build on the Affordable Care Act; (2) to implement some kind of a public option; and (3) to enact single-payer Medicare for All. It is only the third option that can make affordable, comprehensive health care accessible for our entire population. As the debate goes forward over these alternatives during this election season, the likelihood of major change through a new system of national health insurance is becoming increasingly realistic. Rebuilding primary care and public health is a high priority as we face a new normal in US health care that places the public interest above that of corporate stakeholders and Wall Street investors.

Glutamine metabolism provides the required substances for glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation and affects the homeostasis of carbohydrate，fat and protein metabolism to induce the chemoresistance of tumor cells. Combination of chemotherapeutic agents with inhibitors specific to different components of glutamine metabolic pathway has obtained favorable clinical results on various tumors. Glutamine metabolic pathway plays a role in drug resistance of tumor cells in various ways. Firstly，the dynamic change of glutamine transporters can directly affect intracellular glutamine content thereby causing drug resistance; secondly，tumor stromal cells including adipocyte，fibroblast and metabolite from tumor microenvironment would give rise to immune-mediated drug resistance; thirdly，the expression and activity of key enzymes in glutamine metabolism also has a critical role in drug resistance of tumors.

Additionally, the maximum doses of adenovirus-based vaccines are limited by vector-induced toxicity, causing vector elimination and diminished immune responses against the target antigen. In order to increase immune responses to the transgene, while maintaining a moderate vector dose, new technologies for improved transgene presentation have been developed for adenoviral vaccine vectors.Areas covered:This review provides an overview of different genetic-fusion adjuvant technologies that aim to improve antigen presentation in the context of adenoviral vector-based vaccines. The influence on both T cell and B cell responses are discussed, with a main focus on two technologies: MHC class II-associated invariant chain and virus-like-vaccines.Expert opinion:Different strategies have been tested to improve adenovirus-based vaccinations with varying degrees of success. The reviewed genetic adjuvants were designed to increase antigen processing and MHC presentation, or promote humoral immune responses with an improved conformational antigen display.

Despite the growing evidence pointing to an increasing prevalence of CKD across Africa, there has not been an Africa-wide concerted effort to provide reliable estimates that could adequately inform health services planning and policy development to address the consequences of CKD. Therefore, we established the CKD in Africa (CKD-Africa) Collaboration.

DESIGN : Multicenter, randomized, prospective, controlled trial with blinded primary end-point ascertainment. STUDY PROCEDURES Key entry criteria include: age 22-85; National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ≥8 and <30; clinical and imaging findings consistent with acute ischaemic stroke; patient ineligible or failed intravenous tissue plasminogen activator; accessible occlusion in M1 or M2 middle cerebral artery, internal carotid artery, basilar artery, or vertebral artery; and patient able to be treated within 8 h of onset. Sites first participate in a roll-in phase, treating two patients with the SOLITAIRE device, before proceeding to the randomized phase. In patients unresponsive to the initially assigned therapy, after the angiographic component of the primary end-point is ascertained (reperfusion with the initial assigned device), rescue therapy with other reperfusion techniques is permitted. OUTCOMES The primary efficacy end-point is successful recanalization with the assigned study device (no use of rescue therapy) and with no symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. Successful recanalization is defined as achieving Thrombolysis In Myocardial Ischemia 2 or 3 flow in all treatable vessels. The primary safety end-point is the incidence of device-related and procedure-related serious adverse events. A major secondary efficacy end-point is time to achieve initial recanalization. Additional secondary end-points include clinical outcomes at 90 days and radiologic haemorrhagic transformation.","Saver, J L; Jahan, R; Levy, E I; Jovin, T G; Baxter, B; Nogueira, R; Clark, W; Budzik, R; Zaidat, O O",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,145,24

The indications for LRN have expanded to include larger (>7 cm) lesions. METHODS The Institutional Minimally Invasive Urologic Surgery Database (1994 to the present) was reviewed for patients undergoing LRN for >7-cm masses (American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical Stage T2N0M0). RESULTS Of 200 patients, 138 (69.0%) had tumors >7.0-10 cm and 62 (31.0%) had tumors >10 cm. The patients with tumors >10 cm presented more often with symptoms, most often hematuria, and more often had high-grade tumors (68% vs 44%, P = .005). Also, a greater proportion were papillary renal cell carcinoma (23% vs 14%, P = .09) and were more often upstaged (21% vs 9%, P = .02). Of the 200 tumors, 74 (37%) were upstaged, 58 (29%) with perinephric extension and 26 (13%) with renal vein invasion. Larger tumors had greater blood loss on average (406 vs 288 mL, respectively, P = .1) and were converted to open surgery more often (13.8% vs 2.1%, P = .001). A total of 47 patients (22.3%) experienced a postoperative complication. The 5-year recurrence-free survival and cancer-specific survival rate was 62.4% and 92.9%, respectively. The significant predictors of recurrence-free survival in the multivariate model were clear cell histologic type, high Fuhrman grade, renal vein invasion, and perinephric extension. Of note, pT2b was not a predictor of recurrence. CONCLUSION LRN can have favorable perioperative and oncologic outcomes for large (>7 cm) renal masses, with an open conversion rate and complication rate of 5% and 20%, respectively. Clear cell histologic features, high-grade tumors, renal vein invasion, and perinephric extension, but not tumor size, were poor prognostic indicators in this cohort.","Pierorazio, Phillip M; Hyams, Elias S; Lin, Brian M; Mullins, Jeffrey K; Allaf, Mohamad E",Urology,145,33

However, in contrast to conventional 1D- and 3D-networked macromolecules, the synthesis of such 2D networks provides challenges for polymer chemists because of the nature of the networking polymerisation reaction, which occurs in a spatially random fashion when conventional solution-phase synthesis is performed. Here we report a versatile synthesis of polymeric monosheets with unimolecularly thick networking architectures by exploiting the 2D nanospaces of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as reaction templates. Crosslinking radical polymerisation in the 2D nanospaces of pillared-layer-type MOFs affords monosheets of typical vinyl polymers and can be carried out on the gram scale. Remarkably, the prepared polymer monosheets are highly soluble in organic solvents and show atypical thermal and rheological properties that result from their 2D-regulated conformations that cannot be adopted by their 1D or 3D analogues.","Hosono, Nobuhiko; Mochizuki, Shuto; Hayashi, Yuki; Uemura, Takashi",Nature communications,145,1

Nepal also instructed all the educational institutions to shut down, medical colleges being no exception. One month into the lockdown all the medical colleges in Nepal started online classes to keep pace with the academic calendar. This preliminary survey analyses the students' perspective on newly introduced online medical education system. METHODS This cross-sectional survey used an online questionnaire typed in Google forms. The link to the survey was then emailed to the student representative of each semester of Lumbini Medical College, Palpa, Nepal, who were then instructed to forward it to their classmates. The questionnaire consisted of demographic variables and perspective of medical undergraduates towards online classes and also a space to comment or opine their perspective on current medical education. RESULTS A total of 226 students responded the survey. Almost one-third of the students (n=173, 76.5%) admitted of never having attended the online classes. Most of the students used smartphones to attend online classes; broadband internet service being the source of internet in 65.5%. Two-third of the students rated online classes to be poorer than the traditional classroom teaching and 77.8% of the students preferred traditional classroom teaching in future. CONCLUSIONS Medical students did not find online classes as effective as the traditional classroom teachings; it could be made more interactive and productive by introducing interactive and brainstorming sessions complementing the conventional face?to?face education.","Nepal, Samata; Atreya, Alok; Menezes, Ritesh G; Joshi, Ruban Raj",Journal of Nepal Health Research Council,145,32

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the clinical outcomes of neurolysis for the management of peroneal nerve palsy (PNP). METHODS Preferred Reporting Systems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed for this meta-analysis. Four databases were queried, and randomized clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and case series with n > 10 published in English that evaluated clinical outcomes of neurolysis for the treatment of PNP and foot drop were included. Two reviewers completed screening and data extraction. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS A total of 493 articles were identified through literature search. Title and abstract screening identified 39 studies for full-text screening. Ten articles met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis, and 8 had complete data for meta-analysis.Overall, there were 368 patients (370 nerves) who had neurolysis of the CPN for PNP, of which 59.2% (n = 218) were men and 40.8% (n = 150) were women. The mean age of the patients was 47.1 years (SD, 10.0 years), mean time to surgery was 9.65 months (SD, 6.3 months), and mean follow-up time was 28 months (SD, 14.0 months). The median preoperative Medical Research Council (MRC) score was 1 (IQR 0, 3), with 42.2% (n = 156) having MRC score of 0. The median postoperative MRC score was 5 (IQR 4, 5), with 53.9% (n = 199) having MRC score of 5. Complications of neurolysis of the peroneal nerve for treatment of PNP included postoperative infection (0.54%, n = 2), wound dehiscence (0.27%, n = 1), hematoma (0.54%, n = 2), bleeding (0.27%, n = 1), relapse of PNP (0.27%, n = 1), and 1 case of mortality due to sepsis. CONCLUSIONS Our meta-analysis shows that neurolysis of the CPN is safe and improves ankle dorsiflexion strength in patients with PNP. Future studies should use a standardized method of measuring sensory outcomes, and studies of higher levels of evidence are needed to better assess the clinical outcomes of neurolysis for treatment of PNP.","Chow, Amanda L; Levidy, Michael F; Luthringer, Margaret; Vasoya, Devin; Ignatiuk, Ashley",Annals of plastic surgery,145,1

However, type 3 differs from classic achalasia. Although opiates affect esophageal motility, opiate use and achalasia have not been studied. Patients with a new diagnosis of achalasia at Mayo Clinic Rochester between June 1, 2012 and January 3, 2014 were identified. Clinical records were reviewed to assess symptoms, opiate use, and therapy. Fifty-six patients with achalasia were identified, 14 (25%) were on opiates. Opiate prescription was unrelated to achalasia in all cases, with chronic back and joint pain constituting the majority. Of patients on opiates, five (36%) had type 3 achalasia compared with four (10%) not on opiates (P = 0.02). No patients on opiates had type 1 achalasia. Clinical presentation did not differ with opiates, although those on opiates were more likely to report chest pain (39 vs. 14%, P = 0.05) and less likely to have esophageal dilation (62 vs. 82%, P = 0.13), none with greater than 5-cm diameter. Contractile vigor was greater with opiate use, with distal contractile integral of 7149 versus 2615.5 mmHg/cm/second (P = 0.08). Treatment response was inferior on opiates, with persistent symptoms in 22% compared with 3% without opiates (P = 0.06). Opiate use is common in type 3 achalasia, with the majority of patients on opiates. No patients on opiates were diagnosed with type 1 achalasia. Manometric findings of type 3 achalasia mimic those induced by opiates, suggesting a physiologic mechanism for opiate induced type 3 achalasia. Treatment outcome is inferior with opiates, with opiate cessation perhaps preferable. Further studies assessing opiate use and achalasia are needed.","Ravi, K; Murray, J A; Geno, D M; Katzka, D A",Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,145,19

Using giant unilamellar vesicles, we show that pUL31 and pUL34 are sufficient for membrane budding and scission. pUL34 function can be bypassed by membrane tethering of pUL31, demonstrating that pUL34 is required for pUL31 membrane recruitment but not for membrane remodeling. pUL31 can inwardly deform membranes by oligomerizing on their inner surface to form buds that constrict to vesicles. Therefore, a single viral protein can mediate all events necessary for membrane budding and abscission.","Lorenz, Michael; Vollmer, Benjamin; Unsay, Joseph D; Klupp, Barbara G; García-Sáez, Ana J; Mettenleiter, Thomas C; Antonin, Wolfram",The Journal of biological chemistry,145,29

Methods This is a prospective diagnostic accuracy study. Setting Sampling was carried out at renal outpatient clinic and healthcare worker testing sites at Imperial College London NHS Trust. Laboratory analyses were performed across Imperial College London sites and university facilities. Participants Two cohorts of patients were recruited; the first was a cohort of 108 renal transplant patients attending clinic following SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster, the second cohort comprised 40 healthcare workers attending for first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and 21 day follow up. A total of 186 paired samples were collected. Interventions During the participants visit, capillary blood samples were analysed on LFIA device, while paired venous sampling was sent for serological assessment of antibodies to the spike protein (anti-S) antibodies. Anti-S IgG were detected using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quant II CMIA. Main outcome measures The accuracy of Fortress LFIA in detecting IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 compared to anti-spike protein detection on Abbott Assay. Results Using the threshold value for positivity on serological testing of [≥]7.10 BAU/ml, the overall performance of the test produces an estimate of sensitivity of 91.94% (95% CI 85.67% to 96.06%) and specificity of 93.55% (95% CI 84.30% to 98.21%) using the Abbott assay as reference standard.

However, smooth muscles and cardiomyocytes do not generally fuse. In C. elegans, the body wall muscles (BWMs), the physiological equivalents of skeletal muscles, are mononuclear. Here, to determine what would be the consequences of fusing BWMs, we express the cell-cell fusogen EFF-1 in these cells. We find that EFF-1 induces paralysis and dumpy phenotypes. To determine whether EFF-1-induced muscle fusion results in these pathologies we injected viruses pseudotyped with AFF-1, a paralog of EFF-1, into the pseudocoelom of C. elegans. When these engineered viruses encounter cells expressing EFF-1 or AFF-1 they are able to infect them as revealed by GFP expression from the viral genome. We find that AFF-1 viruses can fuse to EFF-1-expressing muscles revealing multinucleated fibers that cause paralysis and abnormal muscle morphogenesis. Thus, aberrant fusion of otherwise non-syncytial muscle cells may lead to pathological conditions. Graphical abstract Significance statement Most cells are individual units that do not mix their cytoplasms. However, some cells fuse to become multinucleated in placenta, bones and muscles. In most animals, muscles are formed by myofibers that originate by cell-cell fusion. In contrast, in C. elegans the body wall muscles are mononucleated cells that mediate worm-like movement. EFF-1 and AFF-1 fusogens mediate physiological cell fusion in C. elegans. By ectopically expressing EFF-1 in body wall muscles we induce their fusion resulting in behavioral and morphological deleterious effects, revealing possible causes of congenital myopathies in humans. Using AFF-1-coated pseudoviruses we infect EFF-1-expressing muscle cells retargeting viral infection into these cells. We suggest that virus retargeting can be utilized to study myogenesis, neuronal regeneration, gamete fusion and screens for new fusogens in different organisms. In addition, our virus retargeting system can be used in gene-therapy, viral-based oncolysis and to study viral-host interactions.","Meledin, Anna; Li, Xiaohui; Matveev, Elena; Gildor, Boaz; Katzir, Ofer; Podbilewicz, Benjamin",bioRxiv,145,16

I will then discuss the tenuous reasons why this pandemic might contain some silver linings, further unpack a small portion of the reasons why this pandemic is inarguably a bad thing, and explore some of the as-yet unknowns related to the pandemic as it exists today. The chapter will conclude with some thoughts as to potential future impacts and possible directions as to where we, as a global community, can go from here. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, J.

This paper presents the generation of a plausible data set related to the needs of COVID-19 patients with severe or critical symptoms. Possible illness' stages were proposed within the context of medical knowledge as of January 2021. The parameters chosen in this data set were customized to fit the population data of the Valencia region (Spain) with approximately 2.5 million inhabitants. They were based on the evolution of the pandemic between September 2020 and March 2021, a period that included two complete waves of the pandemic. Contrary to expectation and despite the European and national transparency laws (BOE-A2013-12887, 2013;European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2019), the actual COVID-19 pandemic-related data, at least in Spain, took considerable time to be updated and made available (usually a week or more). Moreover, some relevant data necessary to develop and validate hospital bed management models were not publicly accessible. This was either because these data were not collected, because public agencies failed to make them public (despite having them indexed in their databases), the data were processed within indicators and not shown as raw data, or they simply published the data in a format that was difficult to process (e.g., PDF image documents versus CSV tables). Despite the potential of hospital information systems, there were still data that were not adequately captured within these systems. Moreover, the data collected in a hospital depends on the strategies and practices specific to that hospital or health system. This limits the generalization of ""real"" data, and it encourages working with ""realistic"" or plausible data that are clean of interactions with local variables or decisions (Gunal, 2012;Marin-Garcia et al., 2020). Besides, one can parameterize the model and define the data structure that would be necessary to run the model without delaying till the real data become available. Conversely, plausible data sets can be generated from publicly available information and, later, when real data become available, the accuracy of the model can be evaluated (Garcia-Sabater and Maheut, 2021). This work opens lines of future research, both theoretical and practical. From a theoretical point of view, it would be interesting to develop machine learning tools that, by analyzing specific data samples in real hospitals, can identify the parameters necessary for the automatic prototyping of generators adapted to each hospital. Regarding the lines of research applied, it is evident that the formalism proposed for the generation of sound patients is not limited to patients affected by SARS-CoV- 2 infection. The generation of heterogeneous patients can represent the needs of a specific population and serve as a basis for studying complex health service delivery systems.","Marin-Garcia, J.

While studying these therapies amid the pandemic, threats to patient care were reported, including (1) maintaining adequate safeguards as clinical effectiveness and safety data evolves, (2) risks from online counterfeit medications, and (3) disruption of the global pharmaceutical supply chain. This article discusses these patient safety threats and suggests strategies that promote patient safety, foster medication intelligence, and mitigate drug shortages. As the world continues to develop safe and effective treatments for Covid-19, patient safety is paramount. In response to the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Safety Challenge: Medication Without Harm, leaders must establish effective approaches to improve medication safety during the pandemic.

Besides, when generating the illness, they have a higher risk of death. Recognizing clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality in the elderly is necessary to prevent mortality in similar infectious diseases. Methods & Materials This descriptive research explored the data of all geriatrics admitted following COVID-19 in the medical centers affiliated with Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. These data were collected from February 20, 2020, to February 20, 2021. Data analysis was performed by SPSS using logistic regression analysis. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Of the total 54523 patients admitted to the medical centers in the 12 months, 25218 patients were elderlies. In total, 51.05% and 12343 of the patients were female and male, respectively. In total, 3512 elderlies were expired. The death cases included 1814 (51.65%) males and the rest were females. Moreover, 16203 patients were in the age group of youngest-old, aged 60-75 years;8270 patients were middle-old, 76-90 years;and the oldest-old category included 745 patients in the age group of >= 90 years. There was a significant relationship between age, gender, and COVID-19-induced death in the elderly (P<0.05). Older adults presented the highest death rate due to this disease Men were 10% more prone to die from COVID-19 than women. Major comorbidities recorded in this population were kidney diseases (92%), cancer (76%), diabetes (32%), and cardiovascular diseases (17%). Conclusion Preventive measures to support the elderly are essential to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, it is essential to focus on the specific health needs of the elderly, such as proper nutrition, wellbeing, and mental health promotion.","Hadinejad, Z.; Tabari, Y.

With millions of students around the world unable to physically attend lectures and other activities at universities, distance learning soon became a pivotal solution to allow studying from home. On the other hand, online resources as a complement or alternative to physical attendance have been part of the academic context for more than a decade. Still, they were usually not intended for replacing in-person didactics in an emergency setting. In this paper, we consider a module in Linear Algebra and Geometry at the University of Turin. The module was originally intended as blended, with lessons and activities in presence supported by asynchronous remote activities, but it had to be redesigned as purely online a few weeks after the beginning of the semester. The use of a Digital Learning Environment, with technologies and methodologies, which already proved crucial in a blended setting, was fundamental in giving an immediate response while transitioning to distance during these pandemic times. We discuss this transition using students' answers to two questionnaires and through the analysis of students' activities in relation to their exam results.

A successful SC design and management plan should consider pandemic spatiotemporal characteristics as well as its effects on production and logistical operations, and on the SC workforce at risk. In this paper, a stochastic mixed integer linear programming model is developed to maximise the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of SC profit given a set of pandemic scenarios. An exemplar SC network from the literature is utilised, along with randomly generated pessimistic and optimistic pandemic scenarios. The proposed model is demonstrated by obtaining SC designs for different cases pertaining to pandemic influence and strategic policies. The resultant SC designs are used to contrast the performance of management plans across different pandemic scenarios and for different levels of workforce at risk. Supply chains for socially critical products, such as ventilators, are studied separately to examine the impact of SC network expansion on maximizing satisfied demand. Finally, we investigate the effects of diversifying network node locations across different administrative regions on SC performance. Several managerial insights are presented for SC planners to aid in creating viable designs and management plans.","Salama, M. R.; McGarvey, R. G.",International Journal of Production Research,145,1

Here we report that intranasal vaccinations with adenovirus 5 and 19a vectored vaccines following a systemic DNA or mRNA priming result in strong systemic and mucosal immunity in mice. In contrast to two intramuscular injections with an mRNA vaccine, the mucosal boost with adenoviral vectors induced high levels of IgA and tissue-resident memory T cells in the respiratory tract. Mucosal neutralization of virus variants of concern was also enhanced by the intranasal boosts. Importantly, priming with mRNA provoked a more comprehensive T cell response consisting of circulating and tissue-resident memory T cells after the boost, while a DNA priming induced mostly mucosal T cells. Concomitantly, the intranasal boost strategies provided protection against symptomatic disease. Therefore, a mucosal booster immunization after mRNA priming is a promising approach to establish mucosal immunity in addition to systemic responses.","Lapuente, Dennis; Fuchs, Jana; Willar, Jonas; Antão, Ana V; Eberlein, Valentina; Uhlig, Nadja; Issmail, Leila; Schmidt, Anna; Oltmanns, Friederike; Peter, Antonia Sophia; Mueller-Schmucker, Sandra; Irrgang, Pascal; Fraedrich, Kirsten; Cara, Andrea; Hoffmann, Markus; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Ensser, Armin; Pertl, Cordula; Willert, Torsten; Thirion, Christian; Grunwald, Thomas; Überla, Klaus; Tenbusch, Matthias",bioRxiv,145,24

At the same time, it is a large-scale stressor that has led to multiple changes in the lifestyle around the world. In this crisis, the well-being and health of medical students who belong to the individuals with a high risk of distress in the population are very important for society. The purpose of this research is to study the impact of COVID- 19-related stay-at-home policy, social isolation, online academic learning, and working on the medical students' lifestyle and well-being focusing on their self-perception of telecommunication technologies, social media, as well as on the psychophysiological state, and eating behavior of medical students of Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University (LNMU). Methods. A prospective, cohort study was carried out on 273 medical students of the LNMU via an anonymous online survey using Google Forms. 273 people of diff erent ethnicities answered the original questionnaire, which includes: 1) general questions (age, gender, ethnicity, family, education, work, and economic status);2) issues related to the use of social media;3) questions about the impact of social distancing on lifestyle;4) the scale of stress perception. Results: The cohort for the study consisted of 166 women and 107 men in the following age groups: From 17 to 24 - 92%, 25-31 - 4%, 35-44 - 2%, and over 45 years - 2%. Ethnic groups included Asian - 47%, Caucasian - 41%, African - 7%, Hispanic - 3%, and multiracial people - 2%. Social exclusion during COVID-19 was found to be caused by a change in the use of social media, more time spent on using them by all respondents. Among these, 88% acknowledge that social media have a great impact and 71% of responders learn basic information about the pandemic via social media. However, 52% doubt the reliability of the information. The feeling of anxiety, panic, which characterized the perception of stress caused by information on social media, was reported by 56% of respondents. Almost all respondents changed their lifestyle, which was characterized by physical inactivity and changed eating behavior. About 60% of respondents reported overeating in the evening and at night (19:00 - 5:00) and almost half of all respondents reported weight gain in the last year. All respondents know about the benefi ts of physical activity to overcome signs of psycho-emotional stress, but only about 10% of respondents exercise regularly. There were no diff erences in the responses from students belonging to the Caucasian group or other ethnicities. Conclusions. The lifestyle of student youth, their eating behavior, and psycho-emotional state are being modifi ed during COVID-19.

Early on, isolated studies around the world described reduced hospital admissions. Reports from some US hospitals also described declines in catheterization laboratory activations, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke admissions. However, there have been few population-based analyses of emergency department (ED) visits to verify these initial reports and describe longer term impacts of the pandemic on care seeking behavior. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that AMI and stroke ED visits in North Carolina (NC) would decrease substantially after a statewide stay-at-home order was announced on March 27, 2020. Methods: We analyzed all ED visits from January 5 to August 28, 2020 using data collected by the NC Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool, a syndromic surveillance system that automatically gathers ED data in near-real time for all EDs in NC. Counts of AMI and stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) were ascertained using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. We compared weekly 2020 ED visit data before and after NC's stay-at-home order, and to 2019 ED visit data. Results: Overall ED volume declined by 44% in the weeks before and after the stay-at-home order(Figure) while the prior year's ED volume stayed steady at ∼100,000 visits per week. From January5 to March 28, there were 593 AMI and 791 stroke/TIA visits per week on average. By April 11, EDvisits reached a nadir at 426 AMI and 543 stroke/TIA visits per week, representing a 28% and 31%decrease, respectively. Since June, AMI and stroke/TIA ED visits have rebounded slightly but haveyet to reach pre-pandemic levels. Conclusions: We observed swift declines in AMI and stroke/TIA ED visits following NC's stay-at-home order. These findings potentially reflect the avoidance of medical care due to fears of COVID-19 exposure and may eventually result in higher associated case fatality.","Wong, E.; Rosamond, W. D.; Patel, M.

In metazoa, RtcB functions as part of a five-subunit tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC) along with Ddx1, Cgi-99, Fam98B and Ashwin. The human tRNA-LC or its individual subunits have been implicated in additional cellular processes including microRNA maturation, viral replication, DNA double-strand break repair and mRNA transport. Here we present a biochemical analysis of the inter-subunit interactions within the human tRNA-LC along with crystal structures of the catalytic subunit RTCB and the N-terminal domain of CGI-99. We show that the core of the human tRNA-LC is assembled from RTCB and the C-terminal alpha-helical regions of DDX1, CGI-99, and FAM98B, all of which are required for complex integrity. The N-terminal domain of CGI-99 displays structural homology to calponin-homology domains, and CGI-99 and FAM98B associate via their N-terminal domains to form a stable subcomplex. The crystal structure of GMP-bound RTCB reveals divalent metal coordination geometry in the active site, providing insights into its catalytic mechanism. Collectively, these findings shed light on the molecular architecture and mechanism of the human tRNA ligase complex, and provide a structural framework for understanding its functions in cellular RNA metabolism.","Kroupova, Alena; Ackle, Fabian; Boneberg, Franziska M.; Chui, Alessia; Weitzer, Stefan; Faini, Marco; Leitner, Alexander; Aebersold, Ruedi; Martinez, Javier; Jinek, Martin",bioRxiv,145,16

The cases were revealed to be associated with a different coronavirus type was named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease was identified as Covid-19. It is known that the disease occurs in all age groups. We aimed to evaluate the differences in clinical and laboratory features between adult and pediatric patients. Method: The study is a retrospective cross-sectional study and consists of 206 patients with a definitive diagnosis of Covid-19 confirmed by a positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. They hospitalized in health institutions connected to City Health Administrative of Bolu, Turkey between 11.03.2020 and 19.04.2020. The number of the pediatric patients (0-17 age group) was 106, that of the adult patients (18 and above age group) was 100. Data concerning the patients consisted of age, symptoms, laboratory parameters such as hemogram, biochemistry, coagulation. Results: The mean values of platelet (PLT), platocrit (PCT), percentage of monocytes (MONO %) and MONO in the “0-17” age group were found to be significantly higher than the mean values in the “18 and above” age group. The hemoglobin (HGB) mean value of the “0-17” age group was significantly lower than that of the “18 and above” age group. The mean C - reactive protein (CRP) value of the “0-17” age group (4.55;min: 1.20 – max: 11.80) was significantly lower than that of the “18 and above” age group (5.35;min 1.25- max: 19.77) with no statistically significance. In pediatric group, the most common symptoms were other symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting and joint pain whereas the adult patients had fever and cough often with statistically significant. Conclusion: Clinical findings and laboratory abnormalities in Covid-19 are less common in children. Although it seems that Covid-19 is less symptomatic in children, they are also affected by the disease. Performing RT-PCR test based on the contact history of the children may help to minimize morbidity with an early diagnosis. Multicenter studies with more numbers of patients should be performed.","Demirkol, Muhammed Emin Kaya Musa Balci Mehmet Ozsari Emine",Experimental Biomedical Research,145,25

Material and Methods: This retrospective study included analysis of tongue images obtained from patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Evaluation of coronavirus disease severity (mild, moderate, severe, critical) was provided, considering clinical symptomatology and results of laboratorial and instrumental diagnostic methods. Each picture was analyzed considering the parameters of color of the tongue and color of the tongue plaque by two dental specialists. Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used to evaluate associations between the tongue color and tongue plaque color, and coronavirus disease severity. Results: The most prevalent tongue colors were pale pink, red and dark red (burgundy color). A total of 64.29% of patients with mild disease demonstrated pale pink color of the tongue. Patients with moderate coronavirus disease were characterized with the adverse trend: 62.35% of them presented with red-colored tongue, while in 37.64% of cases, the tongue was pale pink. Severe COVID-19 patients, almost in 90% of the cases, had either red or burgundy color of the tongue. Conclusion: SARS-COV-2 infection is not manifested by tongue-targeted or tongue-specific signs and features; however, coronavirus disease itself provokes changes within the tongue color and tongue plaque color similar to those registered during other internal pathologies.","Horzov, Liudmyla; Goncharuk-Khomyn, Myroslav; Hema-Bahyna, Natalia; Yurzhenko, Anastasia; Melnyk, Volodymyr",Pesqui. bras. odontopediatria clín. integr,145,12

It is predicted that, before herd immunity is achieved globally via vaccination, people around the world will have to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic using precautionary steps. This paper suggests a COVID-19 identification and control system that operates in real-time. The proposed system utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) platform to capture users’ time-sensitive symptom information to detect potential cases of coronaviruses early on, to track the clinical measures adopted by survivors, and to gather and examine appropriate data to verify the existence of the virus. There are five key components in the framework: symptom data collection and uploading (via communication technology), a quarantine/isolation center, an information processing core (using artificial intelligent techniques), cloud computing, and visualization to healthcare doctors. This research utilizes eight machine/deep learning techniques—Neural Network, Decision Table, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, OneR, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Dense Neural Network (DNN), and the Long Short-Term Memory technique—to detect coronavirus cases from time-sensitive information. A simulation was performed to verify the eight algorithms, after selecting the relevant symptoms, on real-world COVID-19 data values. The results showed that five of these eight algorithms obtained an accuracy of over 90%. Conclusively, it is shown that real-world symptomatic information would enable these three algorithms to identify potential COVID-19 cases effectively with enhanced accuracy. Additionally, the framework presents responses to treatment for COVID-19 patients.","Aljumah, Abdullah",Electronics,145,25

Food insecurity among college students is associated with poor nutrition, higher stress levels, and poorer academic outcomes. First-generation, low-income, and students of color are at higher risk of food insecurity. To assess food security at a private university during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Fall 2020 at a private, Midwestern university with approximately 5,400 students. Participants were recruited via email. An online survey was administered to 393 students, aged 18-53 years (M = 20.69 ± 4.07). Participants were predominantly White (n = 338, 86%), US citizens (n = 383, 98%), majority female (n = 300, 76%), mostly undergraduate (n = 361, 92%), and 113 (29%) were first-generation students. Eighty-one (21%) participants reported living with a parent/guardian. The USDA's 18-item Household Food Security Survey was used to assess food security. A total food security score was calculated, and participants categorized as high, marginal, low, or very low food security. A t test was performed to determine if a difference existed between food security scores for participants who were/were not first-generation students. Of the 393 participants, 199 (50.6%) reported high food security, 73 (18.6%) marginal, 51 (13.0%) low, and 70 (17.8%) very low. Based on the USDA classification, 69.2% were food secure while 30.8% were food insecure. First-generation students had significantly greater food insecurity (M = 3.22 ± 3.40) than non-first-generation students (M = 1.67 ± 2.63), [t(169.27) = 4.37, P &lt; 0.000]. Food security among participants was higher than estimates for college students pre-COVID-19. One possible explanation is that more students may have been living at their permanent residences due to remote learning. First-generation students continue to be at high risk for food insecurity. Nutrition educators can collaborate with administrators and other stakeholders to provide resources to increase food security among students. None.

Several compounds are widely used as disinfectants that contain hydrogen peroxide, chlorhexidine, EDTA, chlorine dioxide, hypochlorite, sodium hypochlorite, bleaching powder solutions. In addition, quaternary ammonium, organic acid, alcohol, aldehyde, iodine, and several halogenated compounds have strong positive effects for several microorganisms. It was supposed to be that the use of disinfection is beneficial in preventing infectious diseases and they assumed that several compounds like phenolic, chlorine, and ethanoic products inhibit transmission of rhinoviruses and rotavirus from stainless steel disks to finger pads. The combination of disinfectants during preparation and use causes respiratory irritation and can release potentially lethal gases, especially wheamalgamated with hypochlorite solution. Besides, to destroy SARS-CoV-2, spraying on porous surfaces, such as unpaved walkways and sidewalks was less effective. Streets and sidewalks are not known as infection reservoirs for COVID-19 and it can be unsafe for human health to spray disinfectants, even outdoors. Researchers were highlighted significant adverse health effects, even deaths that may occur after the consumption of methanol-containing hand sanitiser. Burn injuries and death occurred due to unconscious handling of flammable hand sanitizer followed by lighting a cigarette. Due to having the enormous noxious effect of spraying disinfectants, it should be wise to wash hands, use face mask, and maintain personal distance rather than use disinfectants tunnels and air spray to prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission among peoples.","Sohel, M.; Mahmod, M.

The challenges of such transition included the need for enhanced infrastructure facilities, compliance to directives from regulatory bodies, providing an equivalent learning experience in the virtual learning environment (VLE) and ensuring the end user capacity to utilise the VLE created. Methods: To accomplish this task a suitable instructional design and transition model was utilised to create an integrated Moodle and Microsoft Teams platform as the VLE. The curriculum was recreated in the VLE through review of existing infrastructure and resources, deconstructing the demands of the curriculum, reconstructing the learning experiences of curriculum in VLE and innovating to improve. The end user training was also provided using the same VLE created, which ensured capacity building. Virtual Clinical Assessments (VCA) were created to ensure the completion of assessment tasks. Results: The utilisation of the ACTIONS transition model resulted in the evolution of instructional delivery from a Web Enhanced approach to a customised Web Centric approach and implementation of Virtual Clinical Assessments. Students expressed their satisfaction in the learning experience through VLE, but were anxious about their clinical training and connectivity issues. Conclusion: This transition demonstrated the need of future directions in terms of learner readiness to be more self-directed and self-determined, design thinking for transformation to a Web Centric curriculum, faculty readiness to change and develop the competency of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK).

Methods: We carried out cross-sectional analyses of electronic health records (EHR) of Veterans with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder that received treatment at any United States Veterans Affairs Medical Center from January 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. Logistic regression was applied to estimate unadjusted and adjusted (including age, sex, race, marital status, BMI, and a medical comorbidity score) odds ratios (ORs) for COVID-19 positivity in suicide attempters relative to non-attempters. Results: A total of 101,032 Veterans [mean age 56.67 SD 13.13 years; males 91,715 (90.8%)] were included in the analyses. There were 2,703 (2.7%) suicide attempters and 719 (0.7%) patients were positive for COVID-19. There was effect modification by age and BMI in the association of history of suicide attempt with COVID-19 positivity such that the association was only significant in patients younger than 59 years and in obese (BMI [≥] 30) patients respectively (adjusted OR 3.42, 95% CI 2.02 - 5.79 and OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.65 - 4.94 respectively). Conclusions: Young or obese suicide attempters with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder have higher rates of COVID-19 diagnosis; due to possible long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of infection with SARS-CoV-2, such patients should be monitored closely.","Okusaga, O.

This fact, combined with the functional impairment of the disease, increases the risk of fractures. However, information about the prevalence and the risk factors of LBMD in Spanish patients with MS is still quite limited1-3. Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of LBMD and low vitamin D in patients with MS from a unique center from the east of Spain, describing the clinical features of these patients. Methods: Type of study: observational, cross-sectional, descriptive. Patients with MS from a local cohort have been consecutively recruited for this study since Apr-2020. A cross-sectional visit which included a clinical interview, analytic test (blood and urine) and a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed. We defined LBMD as T score ≤-1SD in postmenopausal women and men over 50 years and a Z score ≤-2SD in premenopausal women and men under 50 years. Low levels of vitamin D were defined as < 20ng/mL. A descriptive and associative analysis of these data was carried out using the SPSS software. Results: From a cohort of 288 MS patients, due to the COVID-19 pandemia, we have only been able to assess 60 patients, and only 48 out of them have undergone all the tests required. These were 30 women and 18 men, with a mean age of 49 (SD 11,6) years. The main type of MS was relapsing-remiting (77,1%) and 25% of them were not taking any maintenance treatment. Some of the classical factors related to a LBMD are shown in table a1. A 43,8% of the patients had a LBMD and 40,5% had low levels of vitamin D. Despite these results, as far as 89% of patients had never received any specific treatment, not even calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation. Furthermore, 13 patients (27,1%) must have received specific treatment, according to latest guidelines4, and only 4 of them (8,5%) were being adequately treated. Conclusion: These preliminary results show that almost half of the MS patients have LBMD and a low vitamin D, most of them without taking any specific treatment. Taking this in mind, it is necessary to integrate the early diagnosis of LBMDin MS patients, working together with neurologists, to prevent the appearance of fractures and protect the quality of life of these patients. An analysis of our whole cohort of MS patients will help us in correctly assessing the magnitude of this problem.","Flores-Fernández, E.; Valera-Ribera, C.; Vázquez-Gómez, I.; Orenes Vera, A.

Data was collected through one-to-one interviews with all student participants and the facilitator (n=10). Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis.ResultsOur analysis identified four main discussion themes: transition to clinical environment, gender in the workplace, building professional identity and family and support systems. The students who continued the RP group over zoom during the COVID-19 pandemic particularly identified with the theme of support systems and solidarity. The smooth transition to zoom and its effectiveness in a time of social distancing were discussed.

Intervention in the form of the ‘Covid 19 Communication Pathway’ was implemented Trust-wide. It links the senior management with front-line doctors directly paving the way for stronger working relationships and teamwork. Updated information was sent down the pathway and queries were simultaneously escalated up.Post intervention, a second questionnaire was repeated in July 2020 seeking feedback regarding the effectiveness of the pathway. Positive feedback was also received by the CEO and the Medical Director in acknowledgement of the C19 Pathway being a formal mode of communication during the pandemic.In terms of leadership, this project highlights the importance of liaising with multiple members of staff to ensure that everyone is working towards a common goal. It provides doctors with a reliable platform through which to escalate queries and concerns. It has helped allay a lot of staff anxiety stemming of uncertainties faced at the peak of the pandemic.

We interviewed 9 survey respondents and from their responses we identified four important factors that make AC successful: commitment (how the organizer and attendees participate in AC), environment (how conducive and comfortable AC is conducted), content (the discussed topics in AC and how they are presented), and objective (the main goal/s of conducting AC). We also present the format of our AC, an elective class which was evaluated during the Spring Semester 2020 (March 2020 - June 2020). Our evaluation with the attendees showed that enrollees (those who are enrolled and are required to present papers regularly) tend to be more committed in attending compared to audiences (those who are not enrolled and are not required to present papers regularly). In addition, participants tend to find papers outside their research field harder to read. Finally, we showed an improvement in the weekly number of papers read after attending AC of those who present papers regularly, and a high satisfaction rating of our AC. We summarize the areas of improvement in our AC implementation, and we encourage other institutions to evaluate their own AC in accordance with the four aforementioned factors to assess the effectiveness of their AC in reaching their goals.","Santos, Daryl Joe D.; Goto, Tomotsugu; Lu, Ting-Yi; Ho, Simon C.-C.; Wang, Ting-Wen; On, Alvina Y.

To reveal the relationship between lipids and preeclampsia, we conduct lipidomic profiling of maternal serums of 44 severe preeclamptic and 20 healthy pregnancies from a multi-ethnic cohort in Hawaii. Correlation network analysis shows that oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) have increased inter-correlations and connections in preeclampsia, while other lipids, including triacylglycerols (TAGs), have reduced network correlations and connections. Thirty-one lipid species from various lipid classes demonstrate predominantly reductions and causal relationships with preeclampsia. They include phosphatidylglycerol (PG), TAG, diacylglycerol (DAG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesterol esters (CE), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), ceramides (Cer-NS), hexosyl ceramides (HexCer-NS), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), and free fatty acid (FFA). Many of these lipids are also selected as important features by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier with high predictive accuracy (F-1 statistic 0.941 and balanced accuracy 0.88), indicating their potential to serve as biomarkers for severe preeclampsia. Our study supports the hypothesis of a phospholipid (PL) centered, dysregulated lipidomic metabolic atlas. That is, severe preeclampsia may be originated from hypoxia, which induces the accumulation of OxPLs through oxidative stress whereas reduces many other lipids (eg. reduced PCs, TAGs and ceramides). These molecular changes coherently lead to dysregulated biological functions, such as insulin signaling and inflammation/infections. Moreover, the lipid changes may also be responsible for the comorbidity between preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, a clinically known risk factor for preeclampsia.","Garmire, L.",,145,26

We sought to determine the impact this policy had on contemporary surgical wait times. Moreover, a discussion about the impact of delays in treatment has never been more timely than in the context of the current COVID19 pandemic, which has burdened health care systems around the world. Our primary objective was to establish whether longer wait time to surgery is a predictor of survival in patients with high grade endometrial cancer. This was a retrospective cohort study, which included patients diagnosed with non-endometrioid high-grade endometrial cancer (serous, carcinosarcoma, clear cell, and undifferentiated) between 2003 and 2017. A total of 2 regionalization periods were defined, before and after January 2014 to allow 6 months for knowledge translation after guideline publication. Patients were identified in population-based administrative provincial data sources. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with a spline function was used to model the relationship between wait time and overall survival, as measured from time of surgery. We identified 3518 patients with high grade endometrial cancer. Median wait time between diagnosis and surgery for the entire cohort did not significantly change with regionalization of care (50 vs 52 days, p=0.14). Patients who had surgery with a gynecologic oncologist had a median surgical wait time from diagnosis to hysterectomy of 55 days compared to 59 days pre-regionalization (p=0.0002), and from first gynecologic oncology consultation to hysterectomy of 29 days compared to 32 days pre-regionalization (p=0.0006). Survival was worst for patients who had surgery within 14 days of diagnosis (HR death 2.7, 95% CI 1.61-4.51 for 1-7 days and HR death 1.96, 95% CI 1.5-2.57 for 8-14 days), indicating disease severity. Decreased survival occurred with surgical wait times of more than 45 days from the patient's first gynecologic-oncology appointment (HR death 1.19, 95% CI 1.04-1.36 for 46-60 days and HR death 1.42, 95% CI 1.11-1.82). [Display omitted] Regionalization of surgery for high grade endometrial cancer has not had a negative impact on surgical wait times. Impact on survival is seen with patients who have surgery more than 45 days after surgical consultation.

This study was planned to evaluate the sleep quality and mental health of undergraduate students amidst the COVID-19 lockdown of 2021. Materials and Methods: This observational cross-sectional study was conducted in Lahore, Pakistan, where 261 undergraduate medical and dental students enrolled at a private medical and dental school were approached from March to May 2021. The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to identify the sleep quality along with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to establish anxiety symptoms and the Physical Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression symptoms. Results: The results show that 212 (81.2%) female and 49 (18.8%) male students participated in the study. Of the participants 75.1% experienced poor sleep quality, 90% had symptoms of depression, and 85.4% had symptoms of anxiety. The mean score on the PSQI scale was 8.59+4.10, on the GAD-7 scale was 11.36+5.94 and on the PHQ-9 scale was 13.70+6.81. Multiple regression analysis showed that anxiety symptoms ({beta} = 0.315, p = 0.000) and depression symptoms ({beta} = 0.398, p = 0.000) were significant predictors of sleep quality amongst the undergraduate medical and dental students. Conclusion: A high majority of the study participants are experiencing poor sleep quality along with suffering from depression and anxiety amidst the COVID-19 lockdown. It is concluded from the analysis that anxiety and depression symptoms are significant predictors of sleep quality. Relevant authorities need to set up systems that help undergraduate medical students in alleviating and coping with these symptoms midst the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sheikh, N.

In this work, a suitable predictive, agent-based model is used to predict the spread of COVID-19 in different settings as well as to evaluate strategies to block the spread. The agent-based modelling work is based on the simulation platform, Complex Organization and Bifurcation Within Environmental Bounds, or COBWEB. COBWEB simulates how a system of autonomous agents adapts to variation and sudden changes in the resource base or other features of their environment. Previous COBWEB simulation results illustrate that the tool is useful for predicting the evolution of COVID-19 spread and the effectiveness of various preventive actions including self-isolation of symptomatic people, social/physical distancing, effective PPE use, and 'shielding' (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in such a setting, in particular by shifting the distribution of risk severity towards ineffective PPE use, self-isolation and poor social distancing, which expectedly shows upward trend of the spread of the COVID-19. Ultimately, governments and industry can apply the predicted trends, as well as apply the model to specific settings, to make more informed decisions on the additional measures and preventative strategies to curb the spread of COVID-19.

However, elderly and populations with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension are more likely to be at risk of severe pulmonary infection and death. Many therapies have been proposed and assed for treating (COVID-19). In April 2020, two papers appeared that suggested clinical trials of low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) for COVID19 pneumonia. Following that, some researchers carried out some studies, and they modify the amount of doses and fractionation. Regarding the aging, some study using a sensitive age that ranged from 18 to 50 years, are more likely to have stochastic effects that cannot analyzed directly as it needs more time to experience these effects.

A single dose of low-dose radiotherapy can be effective in both cost and time and could potentially relieve symptoms of respiratory rapidly. However, such treatment would not be without obstacle and it can be difficult since it is necessary to recognize those few patients who are more benefit from radiation treatment and identifying short and long-term impacts. clinical stage of disease should be known. Additionally, it is not acceptable to report that LDRT would be superior to any type treatment that are currently under taking, until results from clinical trial will be released.","Amin, S. S.

These efforts result in many acoustic recordings that must be classified by a bat biologist with expertise in call classification in order to obtain useful information. The rarity of this expertise and time constraints have prompted efforts to automatically classify bat species in acoustic recordings using a variety of learning methods. There are several software programs available for this purpose, but they are imperfect and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service often recommends that a qualified acoustic analyst review bat call identifications even if using these software programs. We sought to build a model to classify bat species using modern computer vision techniques. We used images of bat echolocation calls (i.e., plots of the pulses) to train deep learning computer vision models that automatically classify bat calls to species. Our model classifies 10 species, five of which are protected under the Endangered Species Act. We evaluated our models using standard model validation procedures, but we also performed two out-of-distribution tests. For the out-of-distribution tests, an entire dataset was withheld from the procedure before splitting the data into training and validation sets. We found that our validation accuracy (93%) and out-of-distribution accuracy (90%) were higher than when we used Kaleidoscope Pro and BCID software (65% and 61% accuracy, respectively) to evaluate the same calls. Our results suggest that our approach is effective at classifying bat species from acoustic recordings, and our trained model will be incorporated into new bat call identification software: WEST-EchoVision.","Tabak, Michael A.; Murray, Kevin L.; Lombardi, John A.; Bay, Kimberly J.",bioRxiv,145,5

Methods: The nationwide Flatiron Health database is a longitudinal electronic health record (EHR)- derived database, comprising de-identified, patient-level structured and unstructured data, curated via technology-enabled abstraction. These data originated from approximately 280 cancer clinics. We compared patients diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer during the early pandemic period (March 1 - June 30, 2020;group 1) with those diagnosed in the four month period prior (November 1, 2019 - February 29, 2020;group 2) and those diagnosed during the same period one year earlier (March 1 - June 30, 2019;group 3). Results: There were 174 patients in group 1, 277 in group 2, and 348 in group 3. Overall, 591 (74.1%) were ER/PR+HER2-, 100 (12.6%) were HER2+, and 106 (13.3%) were triple negative (TN).

Conclusions: Despite similar clinicopathologic features as earlier time periods, there was an increased use of NT during the early pandemic when compared to the same period in the prior year.

This information will help identify patients at risk of severe disease and assist in the optimal allocation of limited medical resources. The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of systemic-immune-inflammation index (SII), lymphocyte-to-CRP ratio (LCR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and mean thrombocyte volume-to-platelet count ratio (MPV/PLT) values compared with the commonly used laboratory parameters of absolute lymphocyte count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), as prognostic biomarkers of COVID-19. METHODS: The medical records of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia between March 2020 and May 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. The NLR, PLR, LCR, SII, and MPV/PLT values were calculated based on laboratory parameters. The need for oxygen support, non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV), and intensive care treatment were documented, as well as mortal outcomes. The patients were divided into a non-severe group and a severe disease group, which was defined by a respiratory rate of >30/minute or an oxygen saturation <90%. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were enrolled, including 62 (73.8%) males. The mean age of the study group was 54.07+or-15.70 years. Thirty-seven had at least 1 comorbidity. Twenty-eight patients (33.3%) had severe disease, with 13 (15.5%) requiring NIMV and 13 (15.5%) needing intensive care. Eleven patients died during the study period. Elevated CRP and NLR and decreased absolute lymphocyte counts were statistically significant in predicting disease severity, need for intensive case treatment, and mortality. The SII and PLR findings also reached statistical significance in the prediction of disease severity and the need for intensive care, and the LCR value was a significant predictor of all 3 outcomes. The MPV/PLT ratio was significant only in forecasting mortality. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that inflammatory indexes can be used as prognostic predictors in COVID-19 pneumonia. These index measurements are cost-effective and readily available, and therefore can aid in the early identification and timely medical management of severe cases.","Turan, D.; Cinarka, H.; Cortuk, M.; Tanriverdi, E.; Chousein, E.

Using this pipeline, we created and characterized comprehensive single point mutation libraries for AcrIIA4 and AcrIIA5, two potent inhibitors of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9. The resulting mutational fitness landscapes revealed that both Acrs possess a considerable mutational tolerance as well as an intrinsic redundancy with respect to Cas9 inhibitory features, suggesting evolutionary pressure towards high plasticity and robustness. Finally, to demonstrate that our pipeline can inform the optimization and fine-tuning of Acrs for genome editing applications, we cross-validated a subset of AcrIIA4 mutants via gene editing assays in mammalian cells and in vitro affinity measurements.

Of the 12,960 students, 1,556 (12.0%) tested positive for COVID-19 during the 103 day period. Of the positive cases, 1,198 reported sufficient health check data (7 days prior and 7 days post diagnosis) to be classified as asymptomatic or symptomatic. Main Outcome: Secondary attack rate, based on presentation or absence of symptoms and type of symptoms calculated with respect to confirmed close contacts and a 14-day incubation period, varies on the type of symptom, timing of symptoms, and absence of symptoms. A quantifiable understanding of SAR on the longitudinal data of more than one thousand subjects in a university environment provides keen insights about developing strategies to respond to the continued prevalence of COVID-19 in the unvaccinated world and growth of variants. Results: 32.5% of all cases reported no symptoms within a 15-day window centered on their positive test (7 days prior, the day of the positive test, and 7 days after). The secondary attack rate (SAR) of asymptomatic COVID-19 index cases was 19.1%. The SAR of symptomatic index cases was 25.4%, and while the onset timing of symptoms did not affect transmission, the presence of certain symptoms like fever, shortness of breath, and dry cough increased the SAR as high as 30.0%. Conclusions and Relevance: Asymptomatic rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are much higher than has been estimated in prior studies and continue to pose a significant and ongoing risk in the pandemic, especially with the prevalence of variants like the Delta variant. In addition, different symptoms are associated with varying rates of transmission, posing a significant challenge in how to diagnose or assess risk through mechanisms such as daily health checks for symptom reporting, a practice commonly in place for entry into schools, offices, restaurants, etc. Given the uncertain nature of symptoms and varied transmission rates, this study suggests a broader embrace of masking, social distancing and testing might be needed to counter the variants until higher global vaccination rates can be achieved.","Krieg, S.

A challenge in digital therapeutic care is how to develop and maintain a supportive, collaborative therapeutic relationship, built upon mutual trust and respect;intrinsic values of relationships that are often implied through complex non-verbal cues. Online practitioners are eager to learn how to adapt to online delivery, although platform-specific training is limited. The aim of the current study was to focus upon the therapist experience of online therapeutic relationships with young people, exploring a range of factors through their perspectives, including the impact of anonymity. Methods: Eight e-therapy practitioners were recruited from Kooth, an online mental health service. Narrative interviews undertaken via Skype facilitated reflective conversational one-to-one discussions, based upon the practitioners’ individual experiences, led by the interviewee. Following transcription and anonymisation, a narrative analysis was undertaken to explore participants’ experiences, perspectives and reflections. Results: Four analytic layers arose from the narratives, which explored the challenging learning experience of translating existing therapeutic skills to online working, rapidly building therapeutic relationships, managing risk in the online therapeutic relationship, and techniques for maintaining a digital therapeutic relationship. Conclusion: The study provides novel insights into the flexibility and adjustments therapists can make to improve online interventions and delivery through the development and maintenance of positive therapeutic relationships. Recommendations are also made in relation to platform-specific training, communicative adaptations, risk management and practitioner support.","Wood, M. J.; Wilson, H. M. N.; Parry, S.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tunisia, have adopted community containment to manage the spread of the virus. However, COVID-19 restrictions can alter psychological wellbeing and limit access to treatment for SpA patients. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on psychological health and treatment adherence on Tunisian SpA patients. Methods: This is a cross sectional study including patients with SpA (ASAS criteria). A survey comprising questions about adherence to stay home warnings;the obligation to go outside for work;satisfaction with the medical support or information received for COVID-19;showing up to medical check-ups, proper use of the medications;medications that the patient stopped taking. Anxious and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Arabic version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. Results: We included thirty patients. the average age was: 39,7 years-old and the sex ratio was: 13,3. 75 % of patients were married. The SpA was axial in 25%, peripheral in 20%, and both in 55 %. Most patients had a moderate activity and the mean activity scores were: BASDAI = 2.60, ASDAScrp:2.65 38% of patients were on biologics, 36 % on sulfasalazine and NSAIDs and 26 % on NSAIDs only. It seemed that significant number of patients strictly adhered to stay home warnings (> 89%) only 11% were obliged to go out for work during general lockdown while only 24 % adhered to it after general lockdown. Most of the patient 78 % were not satisfied with the medical support or information about COVID 19. 88% of patients requested information from TV while 10 % requested it from social media and 2 % from relatives and friends working in health care field. After the outbreak, 23% of the patients who had a scheduled chek-up visit attended the appointment as it was before.The remaining either 'did not want to come' (43%), wanted to come but could not contact anyone in the hospital (11%), was advised to postpone their visits (10%), or couldn't find means of transport (13%).A significant number of patients decreased or skipped their dose (69%), while only 13% continued their medications and 16%stopped taking NSAIDs. Biological DMARDs(anti-TNF agents) were the most frequent drugs which patients decreased their dose, skipped or stopped taking 33%. sulfasalazine and NSAIDs were least likely 17% to be skipped or stopped. 43% of patients Had a HADS anxiety level more than or equal to 11: 87 % women and 13 % men. The highest anxiety scores were found among patients aged less than 45 years old (87%) married with children .32% of patients had a HADS depression level more than or equal to 11: 54 % women and 44 % men. the highest depression scores were found among patients aged less than 45 years old married with children. No significant relationship was found between anxiety and depression levels regarding biologic treatment. Conclusion: Our results suggest that patients with SpA were less likely to comply strictly to 'stay home' restrictions, most probably due to the male predominance and relatively younger age. Additionally, we noticed that SpA patients treated with anti-TNF agents were the patients that regular drug use had been considerably disrupted. COVID 19 pandemic has heightened the need to care for patients with SpA in an increasingly virtual environment. Additionally, we found that being female, having a lower level of education, having a child, living in a crowded family is correlated to higher levels of anxiety and depression.","Rachdi, M.; Feki, A.; Gassara, Z.; Ben Jemaa, S.; Ghali, M.; Ezzeddine, M.; Kallel, M.

In this paper, Haynes 230 (H230), a solid solution strengthened Ni-based superalloy, was chosen to meet the material requirements of a microchannel solar receiver (MSR) needed to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of solar thermal power generation. A MPD was developed to enable the cost-effective production of the MSR. This MPD revealed the need to increase the height-to-diameter aspect ratio of posts using electrically-assisted (EA) forming to reduce the mass and cost of MSR fluidic interconnects. Preliminary efforts to validate the MPD through fabrication of sub-scale MSR test articles resulted in several process failures. Among them, die and platen failure, accelerated creep during bonding due to grain refinement as a result of forming. This resulted in poorly formed channels in the final bonded devices. Suggestions for EA forming die material and adjusted forming setup geometry to reduce feature variability are discussed. Results suggest the need to perform solutionizing heat treatments of H230 after EA forming, prior to diffusion bonding, in order to meet the requirements of the MSR.

However, whether obesity is a risk factor in cancer pts remains unknown. Herein, we have conducted a systematic review/meta-analysis of obesity and all-cause mortality in cancer pts with COVID-19. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines,a systematic search of PubMed and Embase as well as major conference proceedings (ASCO/ESMO/AACR) was conducted for publications from inception to 14 January 2020. Observational studies that reported all-cause mortality in cancer pts with lab confirmation or clinical diagnosis of COVID19 and BMI (obese (>30 kg/m2 ) vs. non-obese) were included in the analysis. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated with the fixed-effects model based on low heterogeneity. Small sample publication bias was evaluated using the Begg's Funnel Plot and Egger's test. Results: After reviewing 3387 studies,3 retrospective cohort studies of 419 obese and 1694 non-obese cancer pts (N=2117) with COVID-19 in both inpatient/outpatient settings that reported outcomes based on obesity were found. The 3 studies were conducted multi-nationally in North America, in France, and in the Netherlands respectively. The median ages of the cohorts ranged 66-68. All studies included various cancers of various stages and were of high quality per Newcastle Ottawa scale (scores 7-9). Fixed effects metaanalysis showed no association between obesity and all-cause mortality (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.74- 1.23) in cancer pts with COVID-19. Heterogeneity was low (I2= 33%). No significant funnel plot asymmetry was detected per Egger's test (P=0.2273). The reported OR of each study is outlined in the table. Conclusions: In contrast to the general population, our analysis reveals that obesity is not associated with increased all-cause mortality in cancer pts with COVID-19. Limitations of this study include a limited number of included studies, reliance on retrospective studies, non-use of ethnicityspecific WHO BMI criteria, and limited granularity of the study-reported BMI. Future prospective studies are warranted to assess the complex interplay among anthropomorphic measures, cachexia/sarcopenia, comorbidities associated with the metabolic syndrome, and COVID-19 outcomes in the cancer pt population.

As shear stress is inversely related to vascular diameter, nitric oxide (NO) production acts as a brake to vasoconstriction. OBJECTIVE To assess whether pretreatment by NO synthesis modulators protects gastrointestinal MBF during transgastric peritoneoscopy. METHODS Fourteen pigs submitted to cholecystectomy by endoscope CO2 insufflation for 60 min were randomized into 2 groups: (1) 150 mg/kg of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, n = 7) and (2) 4 ml/kg of hypertonic saline 7.5 % (HS, n = 7), and compared to a non-treated NOTES group (n = 7). Five animals made up a sham group. Colored microspheres were used to assess changes in MBF. RESULTS The average level of intra-abdominal pressure was similar in all groups (9 mmHg). In NOTES group microcirculation decrease compared with baseline was greater in renal cortex, mesocolon, and mesentery (41, 42, 44 %, respectively, p < 0.01) than in renal medulla, colon, and small bowel (29, 32, 34, respectively, p < 0.05). NAC avoided the peritoneoscopy effect on renal medulla and cortex (4 and 14 % decrease, respectively) and reduced the impact on colon and small bowel (20 % decrease). HS eliminated MBF changes in colon and small bowel (14 % decrease) and modulated MBF in renal medulla and cortex (19 % decrease). Neither treatment influenced mesentery MBF decrease. CONCLUSIONS Both pretreatments can effectively attenuate peritoneoscopy-induced deleterious effects on gastrointestinal MBF.","Taurà, Pilar; Ibarzabal, Aitnitze; Vendrell, Marina; Adelsdorfer, Cedric; Delitala, Alberto; de Lacy, Borja; Deulofeu, Ramon; Delgado, Salvadora; Lacy, Antonio M",Surgical endoscopy,145,20

BALF samples were periodically collected from 6 pigs infected with PRRS virus and 3 non-inoculated control pigs by means of fiber-optic bronchoscope between post-inoculation day (PID) 0 and 56. The mean ratio of macrophages in BALF collected from infected group was 92.7 +/- 3.2% before inoculation and gradually decreased from PID 14. On the other hand, the ratio of lymphocytes was 4.8 +/- 3.2% before inoculation and increased from PID 21 and indicated 41.8 +/- 9.1% on PID 28. After that, they decreased gradually and that of macrophages correspondingly increased. The ratio of neutrophils maintained between 0.7% and 5.1%. The ratios of macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils collected from control group were almost stable through the examination. Intracellular PRRS virus antigens in AM were detected from PID 2 by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). PRRS virus was first isolated from BALF samples collected from inoculated group between PID 2 and 49. From serum, virus was isolated between PID 2 and 21. Antibodies in sera measured by IIFA to PRRS virus were first detected on PID 14 and the antibody titer rose to 1:640 or 1:1,280.

RECENT FINDINGS Community-acquired pneumonia has traditionally been treated with a 7-14-day course of antimicrobial therapy. Since there have been few well controlled trials regarding the optimal duration of therapy, however, there has been no consensus on length of therapy among different organizational guidelines. Several recent studies have demonstrated that shorter course antibiotic regimens are effective in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. SUMMARY Short-course antibiotic therapy is equivalent to standard length of therapy for clinical cure and bacterial eradication. Minimization of drug exposure, however, reduces selection pressure for resistant strains, strengthens patient compliance, and potentially reduces adverse events such as Clostridium difficile infections.","Scalera, Nikole M; File, Thomas M",Current opinion in infectious diseases,145,28

In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and protective effects of nesfatin in IR damage developing in liver. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-four male Wistar-Albino rats were divided to three groups which contained eight rats in all groups. The rats were subjected to 30 minutes of hepatic pedicule occlusion followed by 2h of reperfusion to induce I/R damage. Nesfatin1 (10 μg/ kg) was administered, 30 min prior to ischemia and immediately before the reperfusion period. RESULTS The findings showed that while the blood levels of AST, ALT and LDH were markedly elevated in the I/R group, they returned to normal levels upon treatment in the Nesfatin group. While IL-1 α, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and IFN- γ levels in blood and tissue were lower after therapy in the Nesfatin group compared to the I/R group, statistically significant decreases were only noted in IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and IFN- γ levels. TAS levels increased in the treatment group, while upon nesfatin treatment statistically significant decreases were noted in TOS and OSI levels. Histopathological investigations also showed statistically significant decreases in Bax and Caspase-3 staining intensity and the number of stained cells in the Nesfatin group.

To characterize more fully previously detected strains that could not be assigned unequivocally to one particular genotype based on the RNA polymerase, we have sequenced a region in the capsid gene and, in some cases, in the junction between open reading frame 1 (ORF 1) and ORF 2. The results allowed us to identify several recombinant noroviruses: GGIIb viruses were detected for the first time in France in August 2000 and then spread through France and to Europe during the following winter. Here we present the characterization of three other probable GII recombinants which showed different phylogenetic positions depending on their ORF 1 and ORF 2 sequences. Analysis of the region located between ORF 1 and ORF 2 by a nucleotide identity window search showed a sudden shift in similarities. Moreover, recombination breakpoints were identified upstream and downstream of the beginning of ORF 2 by using a statistical test, thus confirming the involvement of this region in recombination. Unlike GGIIb, the three recombinants described here do not seem to have diffused widely in the community: one was found in a waterborne outbreak, and the other two were found in sporadic cases. Recombination is important for the evolution of RNA viruses and has already been described for noroviruses. Our results suggest that recombination is not a rare phenomenon among noroviruses, but not all these presumed recombinants that formed during RNA replication are able to spread widely.","Ambert-Balay, K; Bon, F; Le Guyader, F; Pothier, P; Kohli, E",Journal of clinical microbiology,145,5

Two ArkDPI-derived vaccines that contain a higher proportion of viruses with S1 genes that become selected during replication in chickens exhibited more rapid establishment of those selected subpopulations in chickens, produced significantly higher viral loads in tears, and induced higher antibody responses compared with two other ArkDPI vaccines with lower proportions of viruses that become selected in chickens. The presence of higher proportions of selected subpopulations was also associated with a significantly higher incidence of respiratory signs early after vaccination and in some cases more severe tracheal lesions. However, one of the ArkDPI-derived vaccines with a lower proportion of selected subpopulations, despite producing a lower viral load in tears, also induced a higher incidence of respiratory signs later after vaccination and more severe tracheal lesions. Furthermore, one of the ArkDPI-derived vaccines with a higher proportion of selected subpopulations, despite producing a higher viral loads in tears, resulted in less severe tracheal damage. These discrepancies suggest that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) load in tears may not always predict degree of tracheal damage and that phenotypic characteristics other than S1 may also be involved in severity of vaccine reactions following ArkDPI vaccine administration. We observed lower antibody responses to the vaccines that produced lower viral loads, which might contribute to the persistence of Ark serotype IBV vaccines observed in commercial flocks.","Ndegwa, Eunice N; Joiner, Kellye S; Toro, Haroldo; van Ginkel, Frederik W; van Santen, Vicky L",Avian diseases,145,1

We updated a systematic review to incorporate recent epidemiological data. METHODS We searched for articles published between 15 January 2014 and 15 January 2016 and hand-searched reference lists. We identified longitudinal studies comparing users of a specific hormonal contraceptive method against either nonusers of hormonal contraception or users of another specific hormonal contraceptive method. We added newly identified studies to those in the previous review, assessed study quality, created forest plots to display results, and conducted a meta-analysis for data on DMPA versus non-use of hormonal contraception. RESULTS We identified 10 new reports of which five were considered 'unlikely to inform the primary question'. We focus on the other five reports, along with nine from the previous review, which were considered 'informative but with important limitations'. The preponderance of data for oral contraceptive pills, injectable norethisterone enanthate, and levonorgestrel implants do not suggest an association with HIV acquisition, though data for implants are limited. The new, higher quality studies on DMPA (or nondisaggregated injectables), which had mixed results in terms of statistical significance, had hazard ratios between 1.2 and 1.7, consistent with our meta-analytic estimate for all higher quality studies of hazard ratio 1.4. CONCLUSION Although confounding in these observational data cannot be excluded, new information increases concerns about DMPA and HIV acquisition risk in women. If the association is causal, the magnitude of effect is likely hazard ratio 1.5 or less. Data for other hormonal contraceptive methods, including norethisterone enanthate, are largely reassuring.","Polis, Chelsea B; Curtis, Kathryn M; Hannaford, Philip C; Phillips, Sharon J; Chipato, Tsungai; Kiarie, James N; Westreich, Daniel J; Steyn, Petrus S",AIDS,145,20

Protoplasts inoculated with transcripts derived from a PVX cDNA clone or from clones containing mutations in their 5' nontranslated regions (NTRs) were assayed for RNA production by S1 nuclease protection assays. A time course of plus- and minus-strand-RNA accumulation indicated that both minus- and plus-strand PVX RNAs were detectable at 0.5 h postinoculation. Although minus-strand RNAs accumulated more rapidly than plus-strand RNAs, maximum levels of plus-strand RNAs were 40- to 80-fold higher. On the basis of these data, time points were chosen for determination of RNA levels in protoplasts inoculated with PVX clones containing deletions or an insertion in their 5' NTRs. Deletions of more than 12 nucleotides from the 5' end, internal deletions, and one insertion in the 5' NTR resulted in substantially decreased levels of plus-strand-RNA production. In contrast, all modified transcripts were functional for minus-strand-RNA synthesis, suggesting that elements in the 5' NTR were not essential for minus-strand-RNA synthesis. Further analysis of the 5' NTR deletion mutants indicated that all mutations that decreased genomic plus-strand-RNA synthesis also decreased synthesis of the two major subgenomic RNAs. These data indicate that cis-acting elements from different regions of the 5' NTR are required for plus-strand-RNA synthesis and that this process may be linked to synthesis of subgenomic RNAs.","Kim, K H; Hemenway, C",Journal of virology,145,16

Here we report a mammalian gene, Edr, which provides the first example of -1 translational recoding in a eukaryotic cellular gene. In addition to bearing functional frameshift elements that mediate expression of distinct polypeptides, Edr bears both CCHC zinc-finger and putative aspartyl protease catalytic site retroviral-like motifs, indicative of a relic retroviral-like origin for Edr. These features, coupled with conservation of Edr as a single copy gene in mouse and man and striking spatio-temporal regulation of expression during embryogenesis, suggest that Edr plays a functionally important role in mammalian development.","Shigemoto, K; Brennan, J; Walls, E; Watson, C J; Stott, D; Rigby, P W; Reith, A D",Nucleic acids research,145,1

PPE must be available, safe, and effective. There is increasing evidence that the use of PPE can cause physical health problems. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to further examine PPE-related physical problems experienced by nurses as well as the role of wear time on these problems. METHODS Using a descriptive cross-sectional design, a survey was conducted among nurses working for state or university hospitals across Turkey who actively cared for patients with COVID-19. Survey questions included demographic variables, type of PPE used, physical problems experienced, and length of time PPE was worn (4 hours or less, or more than 4 hours). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS Three hundred and seven (307) nurses completed the survey. The most commonly reported problems were sweating when wearing a surgical (50.9%) or N95 (64.2%) mask, dry hands from wearing gloves (73.9%), perspiration when wearing overalls/gowns (84.1%), and vision problems when wearing goggles/face shields (47.9%). Logistic regression analysis indicated a signifcant relationship between > 4 hours length of use and the occurrence of the following: redness of the cheeks, dry mouth, redness of the nose bridge, and redness of the ears for N95 masks; dryness of the mouth when wearing surgical masks; skin dryness, sweating, and redness from wearing gloves; headaches from wearing goggles/face shields; and sweating when wearing overalls or a gown (P < .05 for all variables). CONCLUSION The results of this study show that physical problems related to the use of PPE are common and increase when PPE is worn for more than 4 hours. The availability, safety, and effectiveness of PPE are crucial to help protect nurses. Studies to examine PPE quality, characteristics, efficacy, and optimal use are necessary to maintain the healthy workforce needed to care for patients during this pandemic.","Atay, Selma; Cura, Şengül Üzen",Wound management & prevention,145,1

METHODS Data were collected from 50 children aged 12-54 months with a history of at least three episodes of wheeze associated with colds over the previous winter, but few or no interval symptoms; 24 were given one dose of fluticasone aqueous nasal spray (50 micro g) into each nostril twice daily and 26 received an indistinguishable placebo spray. Episodes of lower respiratory illness occurring within 2 days of the onset of a cold were identified from daily symptom diaries. The main outcome was nocturnal symptom score during the first 7 days of an episode. RESULTS The groups were well balanced on entry except that the treatment group had a history of more prolonged episodes. During the trial there was no significant difference in the number of episodes in the treatment and control groups (27 and 37, respectively), in the severity of nocturnal symptoms (mean score 1.33 and 1.22, respectively, confidence interval of difference -0.24 to +0.47) or in daytime symptoms, activity or total scores during episodes.

Each cluster was investigated because diagnostic evaluations were unrevealing, and in each a common donor was recognized. METHODS We examined clinical specimens from the two donors and eight recipients, using viral culture, electron microscopy, serologic testing, molecular analysis, and histopathological examination with immunohistochemical staining to identify a cause. Epidemiologic investigations, including interviews, environmental assessments, and medical-record reviews, were performed to characterize clinical courses and to determine the cause of the illnesses. RESULTS Laboratory testing revealed lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in all the recipients, with a single, unique strain of LCMV identified in each cluster. In both investigations, LCMV could not be detected in the organ donor. In the 2005 cluster, the donor had had contact in her home with a pet hamster infected with an LCMV strain identical to that detected in the organ recipients; no source of LCMV infection was found in the 2003 cluster. The transplant recipients had abdominal pain, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, elevated aminotransferase levels, coagulopathy, graft dysfunction, and either fever or leukocytosis within three weeks after transplantation. Diarrhea, peri-incisional rash, renal failure, and seizures were variably present. Seven of the eight recipients died, 9 to 76 days after transplantation.

Such a complex array of stressors may lead to symptoms of adjustment disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder. This research protocol describes a study launched by the European Society of Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS) to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on symptoms of adjustment disorder across European countries. Objective: The longitudinal online cohort study aims (1) to explore psychosocial reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic across ten European countries; (2) to examine the relationships between risk and resilience factors, stressors and symptoms of adjustment disorder during the pandemic; and (3) to investigate whether these relationships are moderated by coping behaviours. Method: In ten countries (Austria, Croatia, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Sweden), between 1,000 and 2,000 participants will be recruited, depending on the size of the country. Participants will be assessed at two timepoints with a six-month interval. Following a conceptual framework based on the WHO’s social framework of health, an assessment of risk and resilience factors, COVID-19 related stressors and pandemic-specific coping behaviours will be measured to estimate their contribution to symptoms of adjustment disorder. The Adjustment Disorder New Module 8 (ADNM-8) will be used to assess symptoms of adjustment disorder. As a secondary measure, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder will be measure using the Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5). Data analysis: The relative contribution of risk factors, resilience factors, and stressors on symptoms of adjustment disorder or symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder will be estimated using multilevel analysis. To determine the moderating effects of different types of coping behaviours on these relationships, a multilevel mediation analysis will be carried out.","Lotzin, Annett; Acquarini, Elena; Ajdukovic, Dean; Ardino, Vittoria; Böttche, Maria; Bondjers, Kristina; Bragesjö, Maria; Dragan, Małgorzata; Grajewski, Piotr; Figueiredo-Braga, Margarida; Gelezelyte, Odeta; Javakhishvili, Jana Darejan; Kazlauskas, Evaldas; Knefel, Matthias; Lueger-Schuster, Brigitte; Makhashvili, Nino; Mooren, Trudy; Sales, Luisa; Stevanovic, Aleksandra; Schäfer, Ingo",Eur.

Due to exposure to heavy IS, intestinal transplant (ITx) recipients may be at particular high risk for severe COVID-19. COVID-19 and its potential gastroenterological manifestations have not been reported after isolated ITx. Case Description: A 41-year-old female ITx recipient was hospitalized because of dehydration and electrolyte disturbances during the second European COVID-19 wave in November 2020. One year earlier, she had undergone an intestinal re-transplantation for chronic allograft enteropathy, 14 years after first ITx for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. IS consisted of Tacrolimus, Azathioprine, and low-dose corticosteroids. On admission, her COVID-19 PCR was negative. Six days after admission, she tested positive on a screening COVID-19 nasopharyngeal PCR swab. At that time, she was asymptomatic and had normal inflammatory markers and a normal chest X-ray. Azathioprine was temporarily halted, and Tacrolimus slightly raised. Prophylactic low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was administered because of elevated D-dimers. One week after the positive test, she developed anosmia, mild dyspnea and a mild increase in CRP (25mg/L) was seen. Remdesivir was started at 200mg and continued at 100mg/day for 5 days. She presented a high stomal output 2 days in a row. An ileoscopy and biopsy showed no signs of infection or rejection. She was discharged after 4 weeks and remains in good health since then. Discussion: Despite presenting a mild form of COVID-19 infection, we preventively treated our ITx patient with LMWH and Remdesivir. Like for other solid organ Tx, azathioprine was temporarily halted/reduced. A transient increase in stomal output was observed but without proven rejection or infection. Conclusion: This is a first report of COVID-19 after isolated ITx. The disease was mild and the treatment similar to other organ transplant recipients. Registry data are needed to determine the real incidence and severity of COVD-19 after ITx and its potential gastrointestinal manifestations.","Clarysse, M.; Wauters, L.; Gilbo, N.; Monbaliu, D.; Pirenne, J.; Vanuytsel, T.",Transplantation,145,1

The purpose of this clinical tutorial is (a) to describe how the Early Language and Literacy Acquisition in Children with Hearing Loss study, a longitudinal study involving speech-language assessment with children with and without hearing loss, transitioned from in-person to virtual assessment and (b) to provide tips for optimizing virtual assessment procedures. Method We provide an overview of our decision making during the transition to virtual assessment. Additionally, we report on a pilot study that calculated test-retest reliability from in-person to virtual assessment for a subset of our preschool-age participants. Results Our pilot study revealed that most speech-language measures had high or adequate test-retest reliability when administered in a virtual environment. When low reliability occurred, generally the measures were timed. Conclusions Speech-language assessment can be conducted successfully in a virtual environment for preschool children with hearing loss.

While the majority of cases in most territories around the world have fitted an older age profile, our analysis shows that positive cases in Hong Kong have been concentrated among younger age groups, with the largest incidence of cases reported in the 15-24 age group. This is despite the population's rapidly aging structure and extremely high levels of population density. Using detailed case data from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Department and Immigration Department, we analyze the sex and age distribution of the confirmed cases along with their recent travel histories and immigration flows for the period January to April 2020. Our analysis highlights Hong Kong's high proportion of imported cases and large overseas student population in developing COVID-19 hotspot areas such as the United Kingdom. Combined with community action and targeted and aggressive early policy measures taken to contain the virus, these factors may have contributed to the uniquely younger age structure of COVID-19 cases in the city. Consequently, this young profile of confirmed cases may have prevented fatalities in the territory. Recent research has highlighted the importance of a demographic approach to understanding COVID-19 transmission and fatality rates. The experience in Hong Kong shows that while an older population age structure may be important for understanding COVID-19 fatality, it is not a given. From a social science perspective at least, there is 'no easy answer' to why one area should experience COVID-19 differently from another.","Cruz, Christian Joy Pattawi; Ganly, Rachel; Li, Zilin; Gietel-Basten, Stuart",PLoS One,145,33

Here we show that mice with lung epithelial cell-specific loss of function of Miz1, which we identified as a negative regulator of nuclear factor &#954;B (NF-&#954;B) signaling, spontaneously develop progressive age-related changes resembling COPD. Furthermore, loss of Miz1 up-regulates the expression of Ace2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Concomitant partial loss of NF-&#954;B/RelA prevented the development of COPD-like phenotype in Miz1-deficient mice. Miz1 protein levels are reduced in the lungs from patients with COPD, and in the lungs of mice exposed to chronic cigarette smoke. Our data suggest that Miz1 down-regulation-induced sustained activation of NF-&#954;B-dependent inflammation in the lung epithelium is sufficient to induce progressive lung and airway destruction that recapitulates features of COPD, with implications for COVID-19.","Do-Umehara, Hanh Chi; Chen, Cong; Zhang, Qiao; Misharin, Alexander V; Abdala-Valencia, Hiam; Casalino-Matsuda, S Marina; Reyfman, Paul A; Anekalla, Kishore R; Gonzalez-Gonzalez, Francisco J; Sala, Marc A; Peng, Chao; Wu, Ping; Wong, Catherine C L; Kalhan, Ravi; Bharat, Ankit; Perlman, Harris; Ridge, Karen M; Sznajder, Jacob I; Sporn, Peter H S; Chandel, Navdeep S; Yu, Jindan; Fu, Xiangdong; Petrache, Irina; Tuder, Rubin; Budinger, G R Scott; Liu, Jing",Sci Adv,145,0

Decapod crabs have transitioned from marine to terrestrial environments at least ten times, occupy diverse habitats, and display varying degrees of terrestriality. Previous attempts to categorize land crab diversity relied on single traits, did not explicitly distinguish between brachyuran and anomuran lineages, and did not separate lineages that colonized land via freshwater or marine environments. As a result, critical phylogenetic and ecological constraints were missing from these earlier classifications. In this paper, I reclassify terrestriality in the land crabs by designating four transition pathways that reflect deep phylogenetic relationships between the two decapod crab infraorders and the route-specific nature of this transition. I then describe the adaptive traits that evolved in response to six primary terrestrial selective challenges. I conclude by proposing six grades of terrestriality in this system that describe observable trait-by-environment associations, and propose studies that can test the hypothetical sequence of trait evolution and the nature of convergence in the land crabs using phylogenomic and transcriptomic tools.","Watson-Zink, Victoria M",Arthropod Struct Dev,145,26

Multivariable Poisson's and logistic models were used to calculate adjusted incidence of COVID-19 and the associated rates of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Results: As of 27 May 2020, there were 13,659 elderly COVID-19 patients (people aged 65 years or above) in Florida and 14.9% of them died. Elderly people living in small metropolitan areas might be less likely to be confirmed with COVID-19 infection than those living in large metropolitan areas.

The present COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world to its knees resulting in overstretched healthcare systems, increased health inequalities and disruptions to people's right to health including life-saving routine immunization programs across the world. Design/methodology/approach - This is a commentary paper. Findings - Immunization remains one of the most successful, safe, cost-effective and proven fundamental disease prevention measures in the history of public health. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has effectively thrown the world's immunization practices out of gear, depriving approximately 80 million infants, in rich and poor countries alike, at risk of triggering a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria, measles and polio. It is estimated that each COVID-19 death averted by suspending immunization sessions in Africa could lead to 29-347 future deaths due to other diseases including measles, yellow fever, polio, meningitis, pneumonia and diarrhoea. Originality/value - The value of implementing robust immunization policies cannot be underestimated. Risks associated with postponing immunization services and the fact that COVID-19 is now an integral part of human civilization have resulted in several countries making special efforts to continue their immunization services. However, critical precautionary measures are warranted to prevent COVID-19 among healthcare service providers, facilitators, caregivers and children during the immunization sessions.","Singh, S.; Roy, S.

It remains unclear whether patients with COVID-19 and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) experience worse clinical outcomes compared to similar patients with COVID-19 without RA. AimThe aim of this study is to provide insights on how COVID-19 impacted patients with RA given the nature of the disease and medication used. MethodsRA cases were identified via International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and COVID-19 cases by laboratory results in the U.S. based TriNetX network. Patients with COVID-19 and RA were propensity-score matched based on demographics with patients with COVID-19 without RA at a 1:3 ratio. A hospitalized sub-population was defined by procedure codes. ResultsWe identified 1,014 COVID-19 patients with RA and 3,042 non-RA matches selected from 137,757 patients. The odds of hospitalization (non-RA:23%, RA:24.6%, OR:1.08, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.33) or mortality (non-RA:5.4%, RA:6%, OR:0.93, 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.34) were not significantly different. The hospitalized sub-population included 249 patients with COVID-19 and RA and 745 non-RA matches selected from 21,435 patients. The risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (non-RA:18.8%, RA:18.1%, OR:0.94, 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.45), and inpatient mortality (non-RA:14.4%, RA:14.5%, OR:0.86, 95% CI: 0.53 to 1.40) were not significantly different. ConclusionWe didnt find evidence suggesting patients with COVID-19 and RA are more likely to have severe outcomes than patients with COVID-19 without RA. Key Messages- Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) tend to be older, and often have co-morbidities which could put them at greater risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. - This study is one of the largest studies of COVID-19 infected RA populations to date. We did not find increased risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, or mortality among RA patients vs. matched non-RA patients. - Patients previously exposed to anti-coagulants experienced higher risks of hospitalization and overall mortality.

No prevention strategy specifically addresses this period. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, two-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in nine hospitals in Kenya and Uganda to determine whether 3 months of malaria chemoprevention could reduce morbidity and mortality after hospital discharge in children younger than 5 years of age who had been admitted with severe anemia. All children received standard in-hospital care for severe anemia and a 3-day course of artemether-lumefantrine at discharge. Two weeks after discharge, children were randomly assigned to receive dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (chemoprevention group) or placebo, administered as 3-day courses at 2, 6, and 10 weeks after discharge. Children were followed for 26 weeks after discharge. The primary outcome was one or more hospital readmissions for any reason or death from the time of randomization to 6 months after discharge. Conditional risk-set modeling for recurrent events was used to calculate hazard ratios with the use of the Prentice-Williams-Peterson total-time approach. RESULTS: From May 2016 through May 2018, a total of 1049 children underwent randomization; 524 were assigned to the chemoprevention group and 525 to the placebo group. From week 3 through week 26, a total of 184 events of readmission or death occurred in the chemoprevention group and 316 occurred in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.78; P<0.001). The lower incidence of readmission or death in the chemoprevention group than in the placebo group was restricted to the intervention period (week 3 through week 14) (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.42) and was not sustained after that time (week 15 through week 26) (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.47). No serious adverse events were attributed to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. CONCLUSIONS: In areas with intense malaria transmission, 3 months of postdischarge malaria chemoprevention with monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in children who had recently received treatment for severe anemia prevented more deaths or readmissions for any reason after discharge than placebo.

Besides, results showed a significant moderating effect of PYD qualities in mitigating the negative impact of perceived threat on PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the protective effect of PYD attributes in reducing the negative influence of traumatic situations such as COVID-19 on adolescent mental health. Results underscore the importance of promoting PYD qualities in adolescents in mainland China via effective PYD programs.","Shek, Daniel T L; Zhao, Li; Dou, Diya; Zhu, Xiaoqin; Xiao, Chenghan",J Adolesc Health,145,16

Here, we investigated the clinical, cytokine levels; T-cell proportion; and related gene expression occurring in patients with COVID-19 on admission and after initial treatment. METHODS: Eleven patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with similar initial treatment regimens were enrolled in the hospital. Plasma cytokine, peripheral T cell proportions, and microfluidic quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses for gene expression were conducted. RESULTS: Five patients with mild and 6 with severe disease were included. Cough and fever were the primary symptoms in the 11 COVID-19 cases. Older age, higher neutrophil count, and higher C-reactive protein levels were found in severe cases. IL-10 level significantly varied with disease progression and treatment. Decreased T-cell proportions were observed in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe cases, and all were returned to normal in patients with mild disease after initial treatment, but only CD4+ T cells returned to normal in severe cases. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased with the disease progression, and decreased after initial treatment. All downregulated DEGs in severe cases mainly involved Th17-cell differentiation, cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, and T-cell activation. After initial treatment in severe cases, MAP2K7 and SOS1 were upregulated relative to that on admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that a decreased T-cell proportion with downregulated gene expression related to T-cell activation and differentiation occurred in patients with severe COVID-19, which may help to provide effective treatment strategies for COVID-19.","Ouyang, Yabo; Yin, Jiming; Wang, Wenjing; Shi, Hongbo; Shi, Ying; Xu, Bin; Qiao, Luxin; Feng, Yingmei; Pang, Lijun; Wei, Feili; Guo, Xianghua; Jin, Ronghua; Chen, Dexi",Clin Infect Dis,145,1

We suggest a way to produce value-added chemicals (e.g., aromatic compounds) from the mask with high amounts through catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP). To this end, the effects of zeolite catalyst properties on the upgradation efficiency of pyrolytic products produced from pyrolysis of wasted mask were investigated. The compositions and yields of pyrolytic gases and oils were characterized as functions of pyrolysis temperature and the type of zeolite catalyst (HBeta, HY, and HZSM-5), including the mesoporous catalyst of Al-MCM-41. The mask was pyrolyzed in a fixed bed reactor, and the pyrolysis gases evolved in the reactor was routed to a secondary reactor inside which the zeolite catalyst was loaded. It was chosen 550 °C as the CFP temperature to compare the catalyst performance for the production of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) because this temperature gave the highest oil yield (80.7 wt%) during the non-catalytic pyrolysis process. The large pore zeolite group of HBeta and HY led to 134% and 67% higher BTEX concentrations than HZSM-5, respectively, likely because they had larger pores, higher surface areas, and higher acid site density than the HZSM-5. This is the first report of the effect of zeolite characteristics on BTEX production via CFP.","Lee, Seul Bee; Lee, Jechan; Tsang, Yiu Fai; Kim, Young-Min; Jae, Jungho; Jung, Sang-Chul; Park, Young-Kwon",Environ Pollut,145,1

Optimized immunohistochemistry (IHC) for TP53 has been established as a proxy for the TP53 mutation status in other ovarian tumor types. We aimed to confirm the ability of TP53 IHC to predict TP53 mutation status in ovarian mucinous tumors and to evaluate the association of TP53 mutation status with survival among patients with MBOT and MOC. Tumor tissue from an initial cohort of 113 women with MBOT/MOC was stained with optimized IHC for TP53 using tissue microarrays (75.2%) or full sections (24.8%) and interpreted using established criteria as normal or abnormal (overexpression, complete absence, or cytoplasmic). Cases were considered concordant if abnormal IHC staining predicted deleterious TP53 mutations. Discordant tissue microarray cases were re-evaluated on full sections and interpretational criteria were refined. The initial cohort was expanded to a total of 165 MBOT and 424 MOC for the examination of the association of survival with TP53 mutation status, assessed either by TP53 IHC and/or sequencing. Initially, 82/113 (72.6%) cases were concordant using the established criteria. Refined criteria for overexpression to account for intratumoral heterogeneity and terminal differentiation improved concordance to 93.8% (106/113). In the expanded cohort, 19.4% (32/165) of MBOT showed evidence for TP53 mutation and this was associated with a higher risk of recurrence, disease-specific death, and all-cause mortality (overall survival: HR = 4.6, 95% CI 1.5-14.3, p = 0.0087). Within MOC, 61.1% (259/424) harbored a TP53 mutation, but this was not associated with survival (overall survival, p = 0.77). TP53 IHC is an accurate proxy for TP53 mutation status with refined interpretation criteria accounting for intratumoral heterogeneity and terminal differentiation in ovarian mucinous tumors. TP53 mutation status is an important biomarker to identify MBOT with a higher risk of mortality.","Kang, Eun Young; Cheasley, Dane; LePage, Cecile; Wakefield, Matthew J; da Cunha Torres, Michelle; Rowley, Simone; Salazar, Carolina; Xing, Zhongyue; Allan, Prue; Bowtell, David D L; Mes-Masson, Anne-Marie; Provencher, Diane M; Rahimi, Kurosh; Kelemen, Linda E; Fasching, Peter A; Doherty, Jennifer A; Goodman, Marc T; Goode, Ellen L; Deen, Suha; Pharoah, Paul D P; Brenton, James D; Sieh, Weiva; Mateoiu, Constantina; Sundfeldt, Karin; Cook, Linda S; Le, Nhu D; Anglesio, Michael S; Gilks, C Blake; Huntsman, David G; Kennedy, Catherine J; Traficante, Nadia; DeFazio, Anna; Kaufmann, Scott; Churchman, Michael; Gourley, Charlie; Stephens, Andrew N; Meagher, Nicola S; Ramus, Susan J; Antill, Yoland C; Campbell, Ian; Scott, Clare L; Köbel, Martin; Gorringe, Kylie L",Mod. pathol,145,21

METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched using appropriate keywords till June 8, 2021, to identify observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting adverse clinical outcomes (ICU admission and/or mortality) in COVID-19 patients receiving vitamin D supplementation vs. those not receiving the same. Both prior use and use of vitamin D after COVID-19 diagnosis were considered. Unadjusted/adjusted pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated (PROSPERO registration number CRD42021248488). RESULTS: We identified 13 studies (10 observational, 3 RCTs) pooling data retrieved from 2933 COVID-19 patients. Pooled analysis of unadjusted data showed that vitamin D use in COVID-19 was significantly associated with reduced ICU admission/mortality (OR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.81, p = 0.01, I2 = 66%, random-effects model). Similarly, on pooling adjusted risk estimates, vitamin D was also found to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes (pooled OR 0.27, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.91, p = 0.03, I2 = 80%, random-effects model). Subgroup analysis showed that vitamin D supplementation was associated with improved clinical outcomes only in patients receiving the drug post-COVID-19 diagnosis and not in those who had received vitamin D before diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation might be associated with improved clinical outcomes, especially when administered after the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, issues regarding the appropriate dose, duration, and mode of administration of vitamin D remain unanswered and need further research.","Pal, R; Banerjee, M; Bhadada, S K; Shetty, A J; Singh, B; Vyas, A",J. endocrinol. invest,145,26

The aim of this study was to collect and integrate the results of previous studies to get an accurate representation and interpretation of the clinical symptoms, laboratory and radiological findings, and characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19. We conducted a scientific search in main databases with a combination of related MESH terms and keywords. The outcomes included common clinical symptoms at the time of onset of the disease, common laboratory and radiological findings, the rates of vaginal delivery and Cesarean section, Cesarean section indications, maternal complications, and vertical transmission rates. A total of 51 studies comprising 571 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea, respectively. Elevated C-reactive protein and ground-glass opacities were the most common laboratory and radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively. A total of 114 Cesarean sections were performed due to COVID-19-related concerns. There were 55 cases of intubation (11.6%) and 13 maternal deaths (2.3%). The vertical transmission rate was 7.9%. We conclude that the characteristics of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 in pregnant women do not appear to be different from those in the general population with COVID-19 infections.

Over the past 2.8 million years, humans and tools have co-evolved. However, in the last century, technology is introduced at a rate that exceeds human evolution. The proliferation of computers and, more recently, robots, introduces new cognitive demands, as the human is required to be a monitor rather than a direct controller. The usage of robots and artificial intelligence is only expected to increase, and the present COVID-19 pandemic may prove to be catalytic in this regard. One way to improve overall system performance is to 'adapt the human to the machine' via task procedures, operator training, operator selection, a Procrustean mandate. Using classic research examples, we demonstrate that Procrustean methods can improve performance only to a limited extent. For a viable future, therefore, technology must adapt to the human, which underwrites the necessity of human factors science. Practitioner Summary: Various research articles have reported that the science of Human Factors is of vital importance in improving human-machine systems. However, what is lacking is a fundamental historical outline of why Human Factors is important. This article provides such a foundation, using arguments ranging from pre-history to post-COVID.","de Winter, J C F; Hancock, P A",Ergonomics,145,1

The GPC mixtures were prepared with a quadruple precursor simultaneously containing fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GBFS), metakaolin (MK), and Portland cement (OPC). Setting time, compressive along with adhesive strength and permeability, were tested and interpreted from a perspective of potential applications. The preferred GPC with favorable setting time (not shorter than 120 min) and desirable compressive strength (not lower than 35 MPa) was selected from 85 mixture formulations. The results indicate that balancing strength and setting behavior is viable with the aid of the multi-componential precursor and the mixture design based on total molar ratios of key oxides or chemical elements. Adhesive strength of the optimized GPC mixtures was ranged from 1.5 to 3.4 MPa. The induced charge passed based on a rapid test of coated concrete specimens with the preferred GPC was 30% lower than that of the uncoated ones. Setting time of GPC was positively correlated with Î·[Si/(Na+Al)]. An abrupt increase of setting time occurred when the molar ratio was greater than 1.1. Compressive strength of GPC was positively affected by mass contents of ground granulated blast furnace slag, metakaolin and ordinary Portland cement, and was negatively affected by mass content of fly ash, respectively. Sustained seawater immersion impaired the strength of GPC to a negligible extent. Overall, GPC potentially serves a double purpose of satisfying the usage requirements and achieving a cleaner future.","Jiang, Chenhui; Wang, Aiying; Bao, Xufan; Chen, Zefeng; Ni, Tongyuan; Wang, Zhangfu",,145,2

The virus recognizes the host cell by attaching its Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host receptor ACE2. Therefore, RBD is a primary target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. Here we report the isolation, and biological and structural characterization of two single-chain antibodies (nanobodies, DL4 and DL28) from RBD-immunized alpaca. Both nanobodies bind Spike with affinities that exceeded the detection limit (picomolar) of the biolayer interferometry assay and neutralize the original SARS-CoV- 2 strain with IC50 of 0.086 g mL-1 (DL4) and 0.385 g mL-1 (DL28). DL4 and a more potent, rationally designed mutant, neutralizes the Alpha variant as potently as the original strain but only displays marginal activity against the Beta variant. By contrast, the neutralizing activity of DL28, when in the Fc-fused divalent form, was less affected by the mutations in the Beta variant (IC50 of 0.414 g mL-1 for Alpha, 1.060 g mL-1 for Beta). Crystal structure studies reveal that DL4 blocks ACE2-binding by direct competition, while DL28 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by an uncommon mechanism through which DL28 distorts the receptor-binding motif in RBD and hence prevents ACE2-binding. Our work provides two neutralizing nanobodies for potential therapeutic development and reveals an uncommon mechanism to design and screen novel neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","Li, Dianfan; Li, Tingting; Zhou, Bingjie; Luo, Zhipu; Lai, Yanling; Huang, Suqiong; Zhou, Yuanze; Gautam, Anupriya; Bourgeau, Salome; Wang, Shurui; Bao, Juan; Tan, Jingquan; Lavillette, Dimitri",,145,28

Despite intensive research, most of the existing diagnostic methods remain non-specific, labour-intensive, time-consuming or are not sensitive enough for rapid and timely diagnosis of the onset and progression of sepsis. The present work was undertaken to explore the potential of Raman spectroscopy to identify the biomarkers of sepsis in a label-free and minimally invasive manner using different mouse models of inflammation. The sera of BALB/c mice infected with Salmonella Typhimurium reveal extensive hemolysis, as indicated by the Raman bands that are characteristic of the porphyrin ring of hemoglobin (668, 743, 1050, 1253 and 1397 cm-1) which increase in a kinetic manner. These markers are also observed in a lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock model, but not in a thioglycollate-induced sterile peritonitis model. These data demonstrate that hemolysis is a signature of systemic, but not localised, inflammation. To further validate our observations, sepsis was induced in the nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2-/-) deficient strain which is more sensitive to infection. Interestingly, Nos2-/- mice exhibit a higher degree of hemolysis than C57BL/6 mice. Sepsis-induced hemolysis was also confirmed using resonance Raman spectroscopy with 442 nm excitation which demonstrated a pronounced increase in the resonant Raman bands at 670 and 1350 cm-1 in sera of the infected mice. This is the first study to identify inflammation-induced hemolysis in mouse models of sepsis using Raman spectral signatures for hemoglobin. The possible implications of this method in detecting hemolysis in different inflammatory pathologies, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are discussed.","Verma, Taru; Majumdar, Shamik; Yadav, Shikha; Ahmed, Syed Moiz; Umapathy, Siva; Nandi, Dipankar",Analyst,145,1

COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity.

Its insurance arrangements are aimed to finance packages of health goods and services for the poor, while states play mainly a role of public funds administrators, buying from public and private providers competing in the market.

The present study empirically investigates and theoretically substantiates the results of the impact of social media on young web-users' psychological well-being during the forced self-isolation caused by the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 254). Materials and methods. Standardized valid psycho-diagnostic methods, the author's questionnaire (A. Hudimova, 2021), correlation and factor analyses were used to identify young web users' patterns of social media involvement during the forced self-isolation. Results. The results show that during the global COVID-19 pandemic, young web users give preference for passive social media use rather than for communication. The obtained results showed an expansion in the time spent via social media by young web users. It was found that the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by the participants' experience of negative emotions and fears of the unknown (r = .204;p &lt;.01). It is substantiated that increasing immersion of young web users in social media is a kind of strategy to escape from bad thoughts (r = .271;p &lt;.01). Significantly, it is stated that uncontrolled use of social media causes sleep disorders during isolation (r = .444;p &lt;.01). Conclusions. The study proves that young people spend almost all day online due to the obsessive pattern of social media involvement and/or procrastination, which often provokes withdrawal syndrome upon the attempt to distract from them. The lack of controlled time spending on social media during self-isolation provokes an exacerbation of anxiety, apathy, depressed mood, and a sense of isolation from social reality. The obtained results provide evidence that the causal relations of passive social media use provoke an exacerbation of feelings of alienation, disrupt the healthy rhythm of sleep, and psychological state of young web-users during the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hudimova, A.; Popovych, I.; Baidyk, V.; Buriak, O.; Kechyk, O.",Amazonia Investiga,145,16

Patients recovered from COVID-19 warrant ocular surface surveillance for DED. Pandemic mitigation strategies including remote work/school/leisure and mask wearing affect dry eye practices globally. Heightened reiteration of dry eye management for environmental and behavioral modifications, visual display terminals, and mask wearing with attention to its effects on the ocular surface is increasingly important as this pandemic continues.","Koh, Shizuka; Rhee, Michelle K",Eye Contact Lens,145,22

We conducted a longitudinal experience sampling study (N = 578) during the first 8 weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Germany to test this claim. The results indicate that loneliness has a three-dimensional structure encompassing emotional, social and physical loneliness. Each loneliness dimension explained a unique variance in perceived stress and psychological well-being. However, the three loneliness dimensions differed in their prevalence during the contact restrictions and their associations with age and personality. Physical loneliness was higher during the contact restrictions whereas emotional and social loneliness remained on a normal level. Age was positively associated with social loneliness but negatively associated with physical loneliness. Extraversion was negatively associated with emotional and social loneliness but positively associated with physical loneliness. These findings expand loneliness models, enhance loneliness assessment and improve the prediction of vulnerability to loneliness.","Landmann, Helen; Rohmann, Anette",,145,16

Methods: This retrospective database study used IQVIA’s medical (Dx) and longitudinal prescription claims (LRx) databases. Patients with a new medical claim with a diagnosis code of COVID-19 (ICD-10-CM: U07.1) in April, July or November 2020 were identified (first diagnosis = index date). Demographics, comorbidities and prescriptions within 6-months pre-index and diagnoses (symptoms/complications) and healthcare resource utilization within 14-days pre- or post-index were descriptively assessed by index month. Logistic regression was used to evaluate adjusted odds of serious complication and hospitalization by index month. Results: The study sample comprised 1,401,309 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (330,110 April/452,663 July/618,546 November). Half of April/July/November cohorts were female (53.5/56.0/53.7%) with mean age 57.4/47.3/50.1 years and mean CCI score 1.3/0.7/0.6. Region varied with 20.8/60.2/40.4% located in the South. The top 3 comorbidities were more common in April: hypertension (35.8/23.4/19.6%), T2DM (20.7/13.6/10.6%) and dyslipidemia (19.3/13.6/11.0%). Similarly, the top 3 symptoms were more common in April: cough (25.4/14.8/14.5%), fever (22.7/11.4/8.5%) and shortness of breath (19.8/11.3/9.9%). Pneumonia was the most common serious complication and highest in April (33.4/17.8/16.9%). Proportion with ER visit (42.1/36.1/32.4%) and hospitalization (32.5/17.3/14.7%) was highest in April;conversely, COVID-19 diagnostic testing (24.2/45.0/43.5%) was lowest in April. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, July/November cohorts were associated with 51.4/57.4% lower odds of pneumonia and 49.0/62.1% lower odds of hospitalization compared to the April cohort, respectively (all p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: This research confirms that the underlying population contracting COVID-19 has changed over time. While new cases have increased, the burden and severity of illness appeared to be highest in April. These changing trends likely reflect improvements in the knowledge, treatment and management of the disease, as well as increased testing.","Divino, V.",Value in Health,145,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical and CT data of 238 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in our two hospitals were retrospectively analyzed. One hundred sixty-six patients (103 males; age 43.8 ± 12.3 years) were allocated in the training cohort and 72 patients (38 males; age 45.1 ± 15.8 years) from another independent hospital were assigned in the validation cohort. The primary composite endpoint was admission to an intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed to identify independent predictors. A nomogram was constructed based on the combination of clinical and CT features, and its prognostic performance was externally tested in the validation group. The predictive value of the combined model was compared with models built on the clinical and radiological attributes alone. RESULTS: Overall, 35 infected patients (21.1%) in the training cohort and 10 patients (13.9%) in the validation cohort experienced adverse outcomes. Underlying comorbidity (hazard ratio [HR], 3.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.67-6.71; p < 0.001), lymphocyte count (HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.04-0.38; p < 0.001) and crazy-paving sign (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.03-4.48; p = 0.042) were the independent factors. The nomogram displayed a concordance index (C-index) of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.88), and its prognostic value was confirmed in the validation cohort with a C-index of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.96). The combined model provided the best performance over the clinical or radiological model (p < 0.050). CONCLUSION: Underlying comorbidity, lymphocyte count and crazy-paving sign were independent predictors of adverse outcomes. The prognostic nomogram based on the combination of clinical and CT features could be a useful tool for predicting adverse outcomes of patients with COVID-19.","Zheng, Yingyan; Xiao, Anling; Yu, Xiangrong; Zhao, Yajing; Lu, Yiping; Li, Xuanxuan; Mei, Nan; She, Dejun; Wang, Dongdong; Geng, Daoying; Yin, Bo",Korean J Radiol,145,32

We introduced an innovative course to rapidly on-board a group of non-intensive care unit (ICU) nurse practitioners as they begin to practice working in a critical care setting. Objective: To assess whether a brief educational course could improve non-ICU practitioners' knowledge and comfort in practicing in an intensive care setting. Methods: We implemented a multi-strategy blended 12-week curriculum composed of bedside teaching, asynchronous online learning and simulation. The course content was a product of data collected from a targeted needs assessment. The cognitive learning objectives were taught through the online modules. Four simulation sessions were used to teach procedural skills. Bedside teaching simultaneously occurred from critical care faculty during daily rounds. We assessed learning through a pre and post knowledge multiple choice question (MCQ) test. Faculty assessed learners by direct observation and review of clinical documentation. We evaluated learner reaction and comfort in critical practice by comparing pre and post surveys. Results: All 7 NPs were satisfied with the course and found the format to work well with their clinical schedules. The course also improved their self-reported comfort in managing critically ill patients in a medical ICU. There was an increase in the mean group score from the pre-to the post-course MCQ (60% vs 73%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 Critical Care Course (CCCC) for NPs was implemented in our ICU to better prepare for an anticipated second surge. It focused on delivering practical knowledge and skills as learners cared for critically ill COVID-19 patients. In a short period of time, it engaged participants in active learning and allowed them to feel more confident in applying their education.","Alroumi, F.; Cota, D.; Chinea, J.; Ravikumar, N.; Tiru, B.; Pinto-Plata, V.; Tidswell, M.",Journal of Medical Education &amp; Curricular Development,145,17

As these conditions are associated with high risk of myocardial dysfunction, we investigated the effects of IFNÎ³ on 3D fibrin-based engineered human cardiac tissues (""cardiobundles""). Cardiobundles were fabricated from human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, exposed to 0-20 ng/ml of IFNÎ³ on culture days 7-14, and assessed for changes in tissue structure, viability, contractile force and calcium transient generation, action potential propagation, cytokine secretion, and expression of select genes and proteins. We found that application of IFNÎ³ induced a dose-dependent reduction in contractile force generation, deterioration of sarcomeric organization, and cardiomyocyte disarray, without significantly altering cell viability, action potential propagation, or calcium transient amplitude. At molecular level, the IFNÎ³-induced structural and functional deficits could be attributed to altered balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway (JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1), and reduced expression of myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain-2v, and sarcomeric &#945;-actinin. Application of clinically used JAK/STAT inhibitors, tofacitinib and baricitinib, fully prevented IFNÎ³-induced cardiomyopathy, confirming the critical roles of this signaling pathway in inflammatory cardiac disease. Taken together, our in vitro studies in engineered myocardial tissues reveal direct adverse effects of pro-inflammatory cytokine IFNÎ³ on human cardiomyocytes and establish the foundation for a potential use of cardiobundle platform in modeling of inflammatory myocardial disease and therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, lupus erythematosus, Chagas disease, and others, as well as viral infections including H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 show increased systemic levels of a pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-Î³ (IFNÎ³) and are associated with high risk of heart disease. Here we explored for the first time if chronically elevated levels of IFNÎ³ can negatively affect structure and function of engineered human heart tissues in vitro. Our studies revealed IFNÎ³-induced deterioration of myofibrillar organization and contractile force production in human cardiomyocytes, attributed to decreased expression of multiple sarcomeric proteins and upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. FDA-approved JAK inhibitors fully blocked the adverse effects of IFNÎ³, suggesting a potentially effective strategy against human inflammatory cardiomyopathy.","Zhan, Ren-Zhi; Rao, Lingjun; Chen, Zhaowei; Strash, Nicholas; Bursac, Nenad",Acta Biomater,145,20

Evidence suggests that leadership skills remain of utmost importance during crises as it is the leader who often determines the response of the follower. A descriptive qualitative approach was used to ascertain the essence of nurse executive leadership and innovation during the COVID-19 crisis. Nurse executives were recruited via personal invitations to participate in the study. Participants were asked about their current challenges of COVID-19 on health care delivery, their leadership style, and what innovative processes their teams deployed. Using a thematic analysis approach, 3 themes emerged and resonated from the interviews: the importance of communication; the need for leadership presence; and mental toughness. With any health care crisis, leadership is essential to guide followers. As demonstrated by these findings, communication, leadership presence, and mental toughness are 3 key components to promoting and providing quality care in an austere, complex, and changing health care environment.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the knowledge level, attitudes, and practices of the Iranian population in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: A nationwide study was conducted from March 24 to April 3, 2020, whereby data were collected via an online self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Responses from 12,332 participants were analyzed. Participants' mean knowledge score was 23.2 (SD 4.3) out of 30. Most participants recognized the cause of COVID-19, its routes of transmission, its symptoms and signs, predisposing factors, and prevention measures. Social media was the leading source of information. Participants recognized the dangers of the situation and felt responsible for following social distancing protocols, as well as isolating themselves upon symptom presentation. Participants' mean practice score was 20.7 (SD 2.2) out of 24. Nearly none of the respondents went on a trip, and 92% (n=11,342) washed their hands before touching their faces. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of COVID-19 among people in Iran was nearly sufficient, their attitudes were mainly positive, and their practices were satisfactory.

The unknown parameters of such models need to be estimated from the data. Furthermore, when some of the model variables are not empirically accessible, as in the case of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19, they have to be obtained as an outcome of the model. Here, we introduce a framework to quantify how the uncertainty in the data impacts the determination of the parameters and the evolution of the unmeasured variables of a given model. We illustrate how the method is able to characterize different regimes of identifiability, even in models with few compartments. Finally, we discuss how the lack of identifiability in a realistic model for COVID-19 may prevent reliable forecasting of the epidemic dynamics.","Gallo, Luca; Frasca, Mattia; Latora, Vito; Russo, Giovanni",,145,26

Investigation of the submitting laboratories revealed that two laboratories from the Institute of Hydrobiology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan, China performed the research and submitted the cDNA libraries to GenBank. This institution is very close in proximity to the Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market where SARS-CoV-2 first amplified in the human population.

Home health professionals face unique challenges related to preventing and controlling infections, which are likely to amplify during an infectious disease outbreak (e.g. SARS-CoV-2). Little is known about the current state of infection prevention and control-related policies and outbreak preparedness at U.S. home health agencies. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we conducted a national survey to assess infection prevention and control-related policies, infrastructure, and procedures prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Using a stratified random sample of 1506 U.S. home health agencies, we conducted a 61-item survey (paper and online) from November 9, 2018 to December 31, 2019. METHODS: Survey data were linked to publicly-available data on the quality of patient care, patient satisfaction, and other agency characteristics. Probability weights were developed to account for sample design and nonresponse; Pearson's &#967;2, Fisher's exact, t-tests or linear regression were used to compare the universe of agencies/respondents and urban/rural agencies. RESULTS: 35.6% of agencies responded (n = 536). Most home health personnel in charge of infection prevention and control have other responsibilities; one-third have no formal infection prevention and control training. Rural agencies are more likely to not have anyone in charge of infection prevention and control compared to those in urban areas. About 22% of agencies implement recommended guidelines when administering antibiotics. Less than a third (26.4%) report that their staff vaccination rates were higher than 95% during the last flu season. Only 48.1% of agencies accept patients requiring ventilation, and of those, 40.9% located in rural areas do not have specific infection prevention and control policies for ventilated patients, compared to 20.8% in urban areas (p < 0.001). Only 39.7% of agencies provide N95 respirators to their clinical staff; rural agencies are significantly more likely to provide those supplies than urban agencies (50.7% vs. 37.7%, p = 0.004). Lastly, agencies report their greatest challenges with infection prevention and control are collecting/reporting infection data and adherence to/monitoring of nursing bag technique. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we found that infection prevention and control was suboptimal among U.S. home health care agencies. Consequently, most agencies have limited capacity to respond to infectious disease outbreaks. Staff and personal protective equipment shortages remain major concerns, and agencies will need to quickly adjust their existing infection prevention and control policies and potentially create new ones. In the long-term, agencies also need to improve influenza vaccination coverage among their staff. Tweetable Abstract: Infection prevention and control infrastructure, policies and procedures and outbreak preparedness at U.S. home health agencies was found to be suboptimal in nationally-representative survey conducted just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shang, Jingjing; Chastain, Ashley M; Perera, Uduwanage Gayani E; Dick, Andrew W; Fu, Caroline J; Madigan, Elizabeth A; Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Monika; Stone, Patricia W",Int J Nurs Stud,145,26

We then assessed whether this association is modified by disability status. METHODS: We used three waves of cohort data from the Longitudinal Surveys of Australian Youth. We fitted logistic regression models to account for confounders of the relationship between labour force status (employed, not in the labour force, unemployed and having problems looking for work) at age 21 years and psychological distress at age 22 years. We then estimated whether this association was modified by disability status at age 21 years. RESULTS: Being unemployed and having problems looking for work at age 21 years was associated with odds of psychological distress that were 2.48 (95% CI 1.95 to 3.14) times higher than employment. There was little evidence for additive effect measure modification of this association by disability status (2.52, 95% CI -1.21 to 6.25). CONCLUSIONS: Young people who were unemployed and having problems looking for work had increased odds of poor mental health. Interventions should focus on addressing the difficulties young people report when looking for work, with a particular focus on supporting those young people facing additional barriers to employment such as young people with disabilities.","Shields, Marissa; Dimov, Stefanie; King, Tania L; Milner, Allison; Kavanagh, Anne; Spittal, Matthew J; Disney, George",Occup. environ. med,145,24

It is transmitted through air or contact of contaminated surfaces. Thus, physical and social distancing, hand washing with soap, or hand sanitizer are greatly persuaded. Interestingly, this pandemic does not only affect physical health, but also mental disorder, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that is marked with the presence of either obsession or persistent compulsive behavior, or in the most common form, both are present. Obsession is thought, image or desire that preoccupies someone’s mind which commonly is related to anxiety. Compulsion, in the other hand, is repetitive behavior that strongly derives individual to do so to achieve fulfillment of one’s obsession that is not considered normal on the bases of daily norm. CASE REPORT: A 26-year-old woman as a bank employee admitted of doing repetitively unreasonable hand washing and shower within approximately the past 3 months. She even washes her hands more than 10 times in an hour and takes shower more than 5 times a day.

The development of vaccines against COVID-19 is essential to contain the pandemic. we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Shanghai residents to understand residents' willingness to be vaccinated with any future COVID-19 vaccines and take measures to further improve vaccination coverage. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using self-administered anonymous questionnaires from 1 July to 8 September 2020. The main outcome was willingness of participants, and any children or older individuals living with them, to receive future COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore potential factors associated with vaccination willingness. RESULTS: A total of 1071 participants were asked about their willingness to receive future COVID-19 vaccines, for themselves and at least 747 children and 375 older individuals (&#8805;60 years old) living with them. The highest proportion of expected willingness to vaccinate was among participants (88.6%), followed by children (85.3%) and older individuals (84.0%). The main reasons for reluctance to vaccinate among 119 participants were doubts regarding vaccine safety (60.0%) and efficacy (28.8%). Participants with a self-reported history of influenza vaccination were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines for themselves [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19-2.82], their children (adjusted OR = 2.08; 95%CI: 1.30-3.33), and older individuals in their household (adjusted OR = 2.12; 95%CI: 1.14-3.99).

Chronic exposure to such drugs might lower the risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19).AimTo assess COVID-19 incidence and risk of hospitalisation in a cohort of patients chronically taking chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine.MethodsWe used linked health administration databases to follow a cohort of patients with chronic prescription of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and a control cohort matched by age, sex and primary care service area, between 1 January and 30 April 2020. COVID-19 cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases 10 codes.ResultsWe analysed a cohort of 6,746 patients (80% female) with active prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and 13,492 controls. During follow-up, there were 97 (1.4%) COVID-19 cases in the exposed cohort and 183 (1.4%) among controls. The incidence rate was very similar between the two groups (12.05 vs 11.35 cases/100,000 person-days).

Entry of coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by the spike (S) protein. In our previous ESR studies, the local membrane ordering effect of the fusion peptide (FP) of various viral glycoproteins including the S of SARS-1 and MERS has been consistently observed. We previously determined that the sequence immediately downstream from the S2' cleavage site is the bona fide SARS-1 FP. In this study, we used sequence alignment to identify the SARS-2 FP, and studied its membrane ordering effect. Although there are only three residue differences, SARS-2 FP induces even greater membrane ordering than SARS-1 FP, possibly due to its greater hydrophobicity. This may be a reason that SARS-2 is better able to infect host cells. In addition, the membrane binding enthalpy for SARS-2 is greater. Both the membrane ordering of SARS-2 and SARS-1 FPs are dependent on Ca2+, but that of SARS-2 shows a greater response to the presence of Ca2+. Both FPs bind two Ca2+ ions as does SARS-1 FP, but the two Ca2+ binding sites of SARS-2 exhibit greater cooperativity. This Ca2+ dependence by the SARS-2 FP is very ion-specific. These results show that Ca2+ is an important regulator that interacts with the SARS-2 FP and thus plays a significant role in SARS-2 viral entry. This could lead to therapeutic solutions that either target the FP-calcium interaction or block the Ca2+ channel.","Lai, Alex L; Freed, Jack H",J Mol Biol,145,21

Emerging reports suggest that people living in rural areas in some countries are more susceptible to COVID-19. However, there is a lack of quantitative evidence that can shed light on whether residents of rural areas are more concerned about COVID-19 than residents of urban areas. OBJECTIVE: This infodemiology study investigated attitudes toward COVID-19 in different Japanese prefectures by aggregating and analyzing Yahoo! JAPAN search queries. METHODS: We measured COVID-19 concerns in each Japanese prefecture by aggregating search counts of COVID-19-related queries of Yahoo! JAPAN users and data related to COVID-19 cases. We then defined two indices-the localized concern index (LCI) and localized concern index by patient percentage (LCIPP)-to quantitatively represent the degree of concern. To investigate the impact of emergency declarations on people's concerns, we divided our study period into three phases according to the timing of the state of emergency in Japan: before, during, and after. In addition, we evaluated the relationship between the LCI and LCIPP in different prefectures by correlating them with prefecture-level indicators of urbanization. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that the concerns about COVID-19 in the prefectures changed in accordance with the declaration of the state of emergency. The correlation analyses also indicated that the differentiated types of public concern measured by the LCI and LCIPP reflect the prefectures' level of urbanization to a certain extent (ie, the LCI appears to be more suitable for quantifying COVID-19 concern in urban areas, while the LCIPP seems to be more appropriate for rural areas). CONCLUSIONS: We quantitatively defined Japanese Yahoo users' concerns about COVID-19 by using the search counts of COVID-19-related search queries. Our results also showed that the LCI and LCIPP have external validity.","Gao, Zhiwei; Fujita, Sumio; Shimizu, Nobuyuki; Liew, Kongmeng; Murayama, Taichi; Yada, Shuntaro; Wakamiya, Shoko; Aramaki, Eiji",JMIR Public Health Surveill,145,16

BACKGROUND: Registered nurse/patient ratio and nursing competence are known to affect patient outcomes. The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic entailed novel ways for staffing to meet the expected increased acute care demand, which potentially could impact on quality of care. METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted, using the MISSCARE Survey. A sample of nursing staff during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 130) was compared with a reference sample (n = 157). RESULTS: Few differences between samples concerning elements of missed care and no significant differences concerning reasons for missed care were found. Most participants perceived the quality of care and the patient safety to be good. CONCLUSION: The results may be explained by three factors: maintained registered nurse/patient ratio, patients' dependency levels and that nursing managers could maintain the staffing needs with a sufficient skill mix. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nursing managers impact on the occurrence of MNC; to provide a sufficient registered nurse/patient ratio and skill mix when staffing.

METHODS: This was a retrospective case series of first opinion 'out-of-hours' cases seen at two equine practices between 2011 and 2013. Data were retrieved on case presentation, diagnostic testing, treatment administered and outcome, and diseases categorised using a systems-based coding system. A hierarchical logistic regression, formulated using a generalised linear model, was used to identify clinical variables associated with a binary outcome of 'critical' cases (required hospitalisation or euthanasia or died). RESULTS: Data from 2602 cases were analysed. The most common reasons for 'out-of-hours' visits were colic (35 per cent, n=923/2620), wounds (20 per cent, n=511/2620) and lameness (11 per cent, n=288/2,620). The majority of cases required a single treatment (58 per cent, n=1475/2550), 26 per cent (n=656/2550) needed multiple treatments and 13 per cent (n=339/2550) were euthanased. Eighteen per cent (n=480/2602) of cases had a critical outcome. Increased heart rate at primary presentation was associated with critical outcome in both practices (Practice A, OR 1.07 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.06 to 1.09), Practice B OR 1.08 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.07 to 1.09; p<0.001)). CONCLUSION: Colic, wounds and lameness were the most common equine 'out-of-hours' conditions; 13 per cent of cases were euthanased.

The effectiveness and usefulness of this therapy have been demonstrated for more than a quarter of a century. However, a documented survival benefit has not yet been demonstrable in a large, multicenter, randomized and controlled trial. Following the findings derived from a large sepsis clinical trial with PMX in North America, a new trial is ongoing to determine if PMX has a long-term survival benefit when administered to septic patients. Another approach to support a survival benefit from intervention with PMX is to utilize a detailed analysis available from a large clinical data base. The endotoxin adsorption capacity of PMX columns in vitro and the effectiveness of PMX columns can be further demonstrable in animal models. The capability of PMX and details of its mechanism of action to intervene in the sepsis cascade and impede organ dysfunction in septic patients is not fully understood. The surface antigen expression in monocytes and neutrophils are improved after PMX therapy. Immunomodulatory effects as a result of endotoxin removal and/or other mechanisms of action have been suggested. These effects and other potential immune effects may explain some of the improved effects upon organ dysfunction of sepsis and septic shock patients. Endotoxemia may be involved in the pathophysiology of other diseases than sepsis.

Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) can be characterized as a pandemic. During COVID-19 several immunological alterations have been observed: in plasma of severe patients, inflammatory cytokines are at a much higher concentration (""cytokine storm""). These aspects are associated with pulmonary inflammation and parenchymal infiltrates with an extensive lung tissue damage in COVID-19 patients. To date, clinical evidence and guidelines based on reliable data and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for the treatment of COVID-19 are lacking. In the absence of definitive management protocols, many treatments are currently being evaluated worldwide. Some of these options were soon abandoned due to ineffectiveness, while others showed promising results. As for ventilatory strategies, at the moment there are still no consistent data published about the different approaches and how they may influence disease progression. What will probably represent the real solution to this pandemic is the identification of a safe and effective vaccine, for which enormous efforts and investments are being put in place. This review will summarize the state-of-the-art of COVID-19 current treatment options and those potentially available in the future, as well as high flow oxygen therapy and non-invasive mechanical ventilation approaches.","Menzella, Francesco; Matucci, Andrea; Vultaggio, Alessandra; Barbieri, Chiara; Biava, Mirella; Scelfo, Chiara; Fontana, Matteo; Facciolongo, Nicola Cosimo",Multidiscip Respir Med,145,16

Objective: To examine whether remdesivir administered with or without corticosteroids for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with more rapid clinical improvement in a racially/ethnically diverse population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective comparative effectiveness research study was conducted from March 4 to August 29, 2020, in a 5-hospital health system in the Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, DC, area. Of 2483 individuals with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection assessed by polymerase chain reaction, those who received remdesivir were matched to infected individuals who did not receive remdesivir using time-invariant covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index, body mass index, and do-not-resuscitate or do-not-intubate orders) and time-dependent covariates (ratio of peripheral blood oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate, C-reactive protein level, complete white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, albumin level, alanine aminotransferase level, glomerular filtration rate, dimerized plasmin fragment D [D-dimer] level, and oxygen device). An individual in the remdesivir group with k days of treatment was matched to a control patient who stayed in the hospital at least k days (5 days maximum) beyond the matching day. Exposures: Remdesivir treatment with or without corticosteroid administration. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was rate of clinical improvement (hospital discharge or decrease of 2 points on the World Health Organization severity score), and the secondary outcome, mortality at 28 days. An additional outcome was clinical improvement and time to death associated with combined remdesivir and corticosteroid treatment. Results: Of 2483 consecutive admissions, 342 individuals received remdesivir, 184 of whom also received corticosteroids and 158 of whom received remdesivir alone. For these 342 patients, the median age was 60 years (interquartile range, 46-69 years), 189 (55.3%) were men, and 276 (80.7%) self-identified as non-White race/ethnicity. Remdesivir recipients had a shorter time to clinical improvement than matched controls without remdesivir treatment (median, 5.0 days [interquartile range, 4.0-8.0 days] vs 7.0 days [interquartile range, 4.0-10.0 days]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.22-1.79]). Remdesivir recipients had a 28-day mortality rate of 7.7% (22 deaths) compared with 14.0% (40 deaths) among matched controls, but this difference was not statistically significant in the time-to-death analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.38-1.28). The addition of corticosteroids to remdesivir was not associated with a reduced hazard of death at 28 days (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.67-5.57). Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness research study of adults hospitalized with COVID-19, receipt of remdesivir was associated with faster clinical improvement in a cohort of predominantly non-White patients. Remdesivir plus corticosteroid administration did not reduce the time to death compared with remdesivir administered alone.","Garibaldi, Brian T; Wang, Kunbo; Robinson, Matthew L; Zeger, Scott L; Bandeen-Roche, Karen; Wang, Mei-Cheng; Alexander, G Caleb; Gupta, Amita; Bollinger, Robert; Xu, Yanxun",JAMA Netw Open,145,18

It is a critical and challenging task to revive public life while minimizing the risk of infection. Reducing interactions between people by social distancing is an effective and prevalent measure to reduce the risk of infection and spread of the virus within a community. Current developments in several countries show that this measure can be technologically accompanied by mobile apps; meanwhile, privacy concerns are being intensively discussed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine central cognitive variables that may constitute people's motivations for social distancing, using an app, and providing health-related data requested by two apps that differ in their direct utility for the individual user. The results may increase our understanding of people's concerns and convictions, which can then be specifically addressed by public-oriented communication strategies and appropriate political decisions. METHODS: This study refers to the protection motivation theory, which is adaptable to both health-related and technology-related motivations. The concept of social trust was added. The quantitative survey included answers from 406 German-speaking participants who provided assessments of data security issues, trust components, and the processes of threat and coping appraisal related to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection by social distancing. With respect to apps, one central focus was on the difference between a contact tracing app and a data donation app. RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses showed that the present model could explain 55% of the interindividual variance in the participants' motivation for social distancing, 46% for using a contact tracing app, 42% for providing their own infection status to a contact tracing app, and 34% for using a data donation app. Several cognitive components of threat and coping appraisal were related to motivation measurements. Trust in other people's social distancing behavior and general trust in official app providers also played important roles; however, the participants' age and gender did not. Motivations for using and accepting a contact tracing app were higher than those for using and accepting a data donation app. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed some important cognitive factors that constitute people's motivation for social distancing and using apps to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Concrete implications for future research, public-oriented communication strategies, and appropriate political decisions were identified and are discussed.","Kaspar, Kai",J Med Internet Res,145,21

Among the restrictive measures, air traffic suspension is certainly quite effective in reducing the mobility on the global scale in the short term but it also has high socio-economic impact on the long and short term. The main focus of this study is to collect and prepare data on air passengers traffic worldwide with the scope of analyze the impact of travel ban on the aviation sector. Based on historical data from January 2010 till October 2019, a forecasting model is implemented in order to set a reference baseline. Making use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and on-line booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to these hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02% to 0.12% according to the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss could be as high as 1.41-1.67% and job losses may reach the value of 25-30 millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66-1.98% by the end of 2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case scenarios. Some countries will be more affected than others in the short run and most European airlines companies will suffer from the travel ban. We hope that that these preliminary results may be of help for informed policy making design of exit strategies from this global crisis.","Iacus, Stefano Maria; Natale, Fabrizio; Santamaria, Carlos; Spyratos, Spyridon; Vespe, Michele",Saf Sci,145,29

SARS-CoV-2 has many similarities with SARS-CoV. Both viruses rely on a protease called the main protease, or Mpro, for replication. Therefore, inhibiting Mpro may be a successful strategy for treating COVID-19. Structures of the main proteases of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with and without inhibitor N3 are available in the Protein Data Bank. Comparing these structures revealed residue interaction network changes associated with N3 inhibition. Comparing network clustering with and without inhibitor N3 identified the formation of a cluster of residues 17, 18, 30-33, 70, 95, 98, 103, 117, 122, and 177 as a network change in both viral proteases when bound to inhibitor N3. Betweenness and stress centrality differences as well as differences in bond energies and relative B-factors when comparing free Mpro to inhibitor-bound Mpro identified residues 131, 175, 182, and 185 as possibly conformationally relevant when bound to the inhibitor N3.

An extensive review of reported studies revealed a few reported cases. In the present report, we have described the clinical presentation, radiological findings, and outcome of large-vessel occlusion in a young patient with COVID-19 and reviewed the pertinent reported data on this condition. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year-old woman was in her usual state of health until she had presented with a 3-day history of right-sided weakness, slurred speech, and decreased vision. The patient had been taken to several hospitals where she had been treated conservatively with analgesics and discharged. Shortly thereafter, her weakness had become progressive. She had become severely dysarthric and unresponsive. On arrival to the emergency department, her physical examination revealed that she was stuporous, with a Glasgow coma scale of 10 (eye response, 3; verbal response, 2; motor response, 5). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 19 on presentation. Brain computed tomography and computed tomography venography revealed an occluded left internal carotid artery and left middle cerebral artery with subacute left middle cerebral artery territory infarction and midline shift. Computed tomography angiography revealed complete occlusion of the left common carotid artery. An emergent decompressive craniectomy was successfully performed. The patient was shifted to the intensive care unit. She was later found to be positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, patients with COVID-19 can present with large-vessel occlusion.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Sciences, and SCOPUS were searched for retrospective or prospective observational studies reporting data on cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Univariable and multivariable age-adjusted analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the occurrence of in-hospital death. RESULTS: The analysis included 45 studies enrolling 18,300 patients. The pooled estimate of in-hospital mortality was 12% (95% CI 9-15%). The univariable meta-regression analysis showed a significant association between age (coefficient: 1.06; 95% CI 1.04-1.09; p < 0.001), diabetes (coefficient: 1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.07; p < 0.001) and hypertension (coefficient: 1.01; 95% CI 1.01-1.03; p = 0.013) with in-hospital death.

At multivariable age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, diabetes was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (coefficient: 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.05; p = 0.043); conversely, hypertension was no longer significant after adjustment for age (coefficient: 1.00; 95% CI 0.99-1.01; p = 0.820). A significant association between age and in-hospital mortality was confirmed in all multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that older age and diabetes are associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, male sex, hypertension, and smoking did not independently correlate with fatal outcome.","Silverio, Angelo; Di Maio, Marco; Citro, Rodolfo; Esposito, Luca; Iuliano, Giuseppe; Bellino, Michele; Baldi, Cesare; De Luca, Giuseppe; Ciccarelli, Michele; Vecchione, Carmine; Galasso, Gennaro",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,145,28

To prevent this scenario a nationwide relocation concept was developed. METHODS: For the development of the concept publicly available infection rates of the leading infection authority in Germany were used. Within this concept six medical care regions (clusters) were designed around a center of maximum intensive care (ECMO option) based on the number of intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants. The concept describes the management structure including a structural chart, the individual tasks, the organization and the cluster assignment of the clinics. The transfers of intensive care patients within and between the clusters were recorded from 11 December 2020 to 31 January 2021. RESULT: In Germany and Baden-Württemberg, 1.5% of patients newly infected with SARS-CoV­2 required intensive care treatment in mid-December 2020. With a 7-day incidence of 192 new infections in Germany, the hospitalization rate was 10% and 28-35% of the intensive care beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients. Only 16.8% of the intensive care beds were still available, in contrast to 35% in June 2020. The developed relocation concept has been in use in Baden-Württemberg starting from 10 December 2020. From then until 7 February 2021, a median of 24â¯± 5/54 intensive care patients were transferred within the individual clusters, in total 154 intensive care patients. Between the clusters, a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 15 (median 12.5) patients were transferred, 21 intensive care patients were transferred to other federal states and 21 intensive care patients were admitted from these states. The total number of intensive care patients transferred was 261. CONCLUSION: If the number of infections with SARS-CoV­2 increases, a nationwide relocation concept for COVID-19 intensive care patients and non-COVID-19 intensive care patients should be installed at an early stage in order not to overwhelm the capacities of hospitals. Supply regions around a leading clinic with maximum intensive care options are to be defined with a central management that organizes the necessary relocations in cooperation with regional and superregional rescue service control centers. With this concept and the intensive care transports carried out, it was possible to effectively prevent the overload of individual clinics with COVID-19 patients in Baden-Württemberg. Due to that an almost unchanged number of patients requiring regular intensive care could be treated.","Pfenninger, Ernst G; Naser, J; Träger, K; Dennler, U; Jungwirth, B; Schindler, S; Henn-Beilharz, A; Geldner, G; Bürkle, H",Anaesthesist,145,20

The current state-of-the-art deep learning models for detection of COVID-19 are heavy models that may not be easy to deploy in commonly utilized mobile platforms in point-of-care testing. In this work, we develop a light weight mobile friendly efficient deep learning model for detection of COVID-19 using lung ultrasound images. Three different classes including COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy were included in this task. The developed network, named as Mini-COVIDNet, was bench-marked with other light weight neural network models along with state-of-the-art heavy model. It was shown that the proposed network can achieve the highest accuracy of 83.2% and requires training time of only 24 minutes. The proposed Mini-COVIDNet has 4.39 times less number of parameters in the network compared to its next best performing network and requires a memory of only 51.29 MB, making the point-of-care detection of COVID-19 using lung ultrasound imaging plausible on a mobile platform. Deployment of these light weight networks on embedded platforms shows that the proposed Mini-COVIDNet is highly versatile and provides optimal performance in terms of being accurate as well as having latency in the same order as other light weight networks.

Historically constrained by poor aviation infrastructure, economic uncertainty, currency devaluations, labor unrest, comparatively weak passenger demand, and operational barriers to low-cost carriers (LCCs), Argentina's airline networks have experienced deep restructuring in both providers and network interactions. With less than 0.3 trips per capita in Argentina, compared to 3.0 in the mature U.S. aviation market, analysts argue that there is significant potential for moving bus and automobile travelers to airlines, and to expanding Argentina's airline connectivity profitably throughout the region. LCCs such as Flybondi, Norwegian, Air Europa, Sky, JetSmart, and others are challenging long-standing transportation relationships in the region and developing new routes for consumers.

NTD-specific antibodies formed two distinct groups: the first was highly potent against infectious virus, whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant neutralization activity. Mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred neutralization resistance to NTD-specific antibodies. This work demonstrates that neutralizing antibodies targeting subdominant epitopes should be considered when investigating antigenic drift in emerging variants.","Graham, Carl; Seow, Jeffrey; Huettner, Isabella; Khan, Hataf; Kouphou, Neophytos; Acors, Sam; Winstone, Helena; Pickering, Suzanne; Galao, Rui Pedro; Dupont, Liane; Lista, Maria Jose; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M; Laing, Adam G; Wu, Yin; Joseph, Magdalene; Muir, Luke; van Gils, Marit J; Ng, Weng M; Duyvesteyn, Helen M E; Zhao, Yuguang; Bowden, Thomas A; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Rosa, Annachiara; Cherepanov, Peter; McCoy, Laura E; Hayday, Adrian C; Neil, Stuart J D; Malim, Michael H; Doores, Katie J",Immunity,145,16

Unfortunately, there is currently no specific drug or treatment for COVID-19. Among all structural proteins in SARS-CoV, the spike protein is the main antigenic component responsible for inducing host immune responses, neutralizing antibodies, and/or protecting immunity against virus infection. Molecular docking is a technique used to predict whether a molecule will bind to another. It is usually a protein to another or a protein to a binding compound. Natural products are potential binders in several studies involving coronavirus. The structure of the ligand plays a fundamental role in its biological properties. The nuclear magnetic resonance technique is one of the most powerful tools for the structural determination of ligands from the origin of natural products. Nowadays, molecular modeling is an important accessory tool to experimentally got nuclear magnetic resonance data. In the present work, molecular docking studies aimed is to investigate the limiting affinities of trans-dehydrocrotonin molecule and to identify the main amino acid residues that could play a fundamental role in their mechanism of action of the SARS-CoV spike protein. Another aim of this work is all about to evaluate 10 hybrid functionalities, along with three base pairs using computational programs to discover which ones are more reliable with the experimental result the best computational method to study organic compounds. We compared the results between the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the molecules, and the smallest number between them was the best result.

SAUD is notably characterized by an overactivation of the reflexive/reward system when confronted with alcohol-related cues. Such overreactivity generates a preferential allocation of attentional resources toward these cues, labeled as attentional biases (AB). Theoretical assumptions have been made regarding the characteristics of AB and their underlying processes. While often considered as granted, these assumptions remain to be experimentally validated. AIMS: We first identify the theoretical assumptions made by previous studies exploring the nature and role of AB. We then discuss the current evidence available to establish their validity. We finally propose research avenues to experimentally test them. METHODS: Capitalizing on a narrative review of studies exploring AB in SAUD, the current limits of the behavioral measures used for their evaluation are highlighted as well as the benefits derived from the use of eye-tracking measures to obtain a deeper understanding of their underlying processes. We describe the issues related to the theoretical proposals on AB and propose research avenues to test them. Four experimental axes are proposed, respectively, related to the determination of (a) the genuine nature of the mechanisms underlying AB; (b) their stability over the disease course; (c) their specificity to alcohol-related stimuli and (d) their reflexive or controlled nature. CONCLUSIONS: This in-depth exploration of the available knowledge related to AB in SAUD, and of its key limitations, highlights the theoretical and clinical interest of our innovative experimental perspectives capitalizing on eye-tracking measures.","Bollen, Zoé; D039,; Hondt, Fabien; Dormal, Valérie; Lannoy, Séverine; Masson, Nicolas; Maurage, Pierre",Alcohol alcohol,145,30

Candidemia, a fungal healthcare-associated infection, has been described in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. However, studies of candidemia and COVID-19 co-infection have been limited in sample size and geographic scope. We assessed differences in patients with candidemia with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a case-level analysis using population-based candidemia surveillance data collected through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infections Program during April-August 2020 to compare characteristics of candidemia patients with and without a positive test for COVID-19 in the 30 days before their Candida culture using chi-square or Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: Of the 251 candidemia patients included, 64 (25.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Liver disease, solid organ malignancies, and prior surgeries were each >3 times more common in patients without COVID-19 co-infection, whereas intensive care unit-level care, mechanical ventilation, having a central venous catheter, and receipt of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants were each >1.3 times more common in patients with COVID-19. All cause in-hospital fatality was two times higher among those with COVID-19 (62.5%) than without (32.1%). CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of candidemia patients had COVID-19. These patients were less likely to have certain underlying conditions and recent surgery commonly associated with candidemia and more likely to have acute risk factors linked to COVID-19 care, including immunosuppressive medications. Given the high mortality, it is important for clinicians to remain vigilant and take proactive measures to prevent candidemia in patients with COVID-19.","Seagle, Emma E; Jackson, Brendan R; Lockhart, Shawn R; Georgacopoulos, Ourania; Nunnally, Natalie S; Roland, Jeremy; Barter, Devra M; Johnston, Helen L; Czaja, Christopher A; Kayalioglu, Hazal; Clogher, Paula; Revis, Andrew; Farley, Monica M; Harrison, Lee H; Davis, Sarah Shrum; Phipps, Erin C; Tesini, Brenda L; Schaffner, William; Markus, Tiffanie M; Lyman, Meghan M",Clin. infect. dis,145,32

The spread of COVID-19 is increasing day by day, imposing human lives and economy at risk. Due to the increased enormity of the number of COVID-19 cases, the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is imperative in the current scenario. AI would be a powerful tool to fight against this pandemic outbreak by predicting the number of cases in advance. Deep learning-based time series techniques are considered to predict world-wide COVID-19 cases in advance for short-term and medium-term dependencies with adaptive learning. Initially, the data pre-processing and feature extraction is made with the real world COVID-19 dataset. Subsequently, the prediction of cumulative confirmed, death and recovered global cases are modelled with Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) and Prophet approaches. For long-term forecasting of COVID 19 cases, multivariate LSTM models employed. The performance metrics are computed for all the models and the prediction results are subjected to comparative analysis to identify the most reliable model. From the results, it is evident that the Stacked LSTM algorithm yields higher accuracy with an error of less than 2% compared to the other considered algorithms for the studied performance metrics. Country-specific analysis of India and city-specific analysis of Chennai COVID-19 cases are predicted and analyzed in detail. Also, statistical hypothesis analysis and correlation analysis are done on the COVID 19 datasets by including the features like temperature, rainfall, population, total infected cases, area and population density during the months of May, June, July and August to find out the best suitable model. Further, Practical significance of predicting COVID-19 cases is elucidated in terms of assessing pandemic characteristics, scenario planning, optimization of models and supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","Devaraj, Jayanthi; Madurai Elavarasan, Rajvikram; Pugazhendhi, Rishi; Shafiullah, G M; Ganesan, Sumathi; Kaarthic Jeysree, Ajay; Ahmad Khan, Irfan; Hossain, Eklas",Results Phys,145,23

BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma from people recovered from COVID-19 with sufficient antibody titres is a potential option for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. However, to date, recruiting and retaining COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors has been challenging. Understanding why those eligible to donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma have not donated is critical to developing recruitment campaigns. METHODS/MATERIALS: A total of 419 UK residents who indicated that they had been infected with COVID-19 and who lived within 50 km of sites collecting COVID-19 convalescent plasma completed an online survey between 25th June and 5th July 2020. Respondents completed items assessing their awareness of convalescent plasma, motivations and barriers to donation and intention to donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma. RESULTS: Awareness of COVID-19 convalescent plasma was low. Exploratory factor analysis identified six motivations and seven barriers to donating. A stronger sense of altruism through adversity and moral and civic duty were positively related to intention to donate, whereas generic donation fears was negatively related. CONCLUSIONS: Once potential donors are aware of convalescent plasma, interventions should focus on the gratitude and reciprocity that those eligible to donate feel, along with a focus on (potentially) helping family and norms of what people ought to do. Fears associated with donation should not be neglected, and strategies that have been successfully used tor recruit whole-blood donors should be adapted and deployed to recruit COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors.","Masser, Barbara M; Ferguson, Eamonn; Thorpe, Rachel; Lawrence, Claire; Davison, Tanya E; Hoad, Veronica; Gosbell, Iain B",Transfus. med,145,23

The objective is to determine how the microscale vortices influence convection heat transfer in turbulent flow inside porous media. The microscale temperature distribution is analyzed using flow visualization in 2D using streamlines and in 3D using Q structures. The pertinent observations are supplemented with the comparison of surface skin friction and heat transfer using: (1) surface skin friction lines and (2) joint PDF of Skin Friction Coefficient, along with the Nusselt number. The microscale flow phenomena observed are corroborated with the features of the frequency spectra of the drag coefficient and macroscale Nusselt number. The Large Eddy Simulation technique is used to investigate the flow field inside a periodic porous medium. The Reynolds number of the flow is 300. The porous medium consists of solid obstacles in the shape of square and circular cylinders. Two distinct flow regimes are represented by using the porosities of 0.50 and 0.87. The results show that the surface Nusselt number distribution is dependent on whether the micro-vortices are attached to or detached from the surface of the obstacle. The spectra of the macroscale Nusselt number and the pressure drag are similar signifying a correlation between the dynamics of heat transfer and the microscale turbulent structures. Both vortex shedding and secondary flow instabilities are observed that significantly influence the Nusselt number. The fundamental insight gained in this paper can inform the development of more robust macroscale models of convection heat transfer in turbulent flow in porous media.","Huang, Ching-Wei; Srikanth, Vishal; Kuznetsov, Andrey V.",,145,27

Objective: To determine the effect of bamlanivimab monotherapy and combination therapy with bamlanivimab and etesevimab on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in mild to moderate COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: The BLAZE-1 study is a randomized phase 2/3 trial at 49 US centers including ambulatory patients (N = 613) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and had 1 or more mild to moderate symptoms. Patients who received bamlanivimab monotherapy or placebo were enrolled first (June 17-August 21, 2020) followed by patients who received bamlanivimab and etesevimab or placebo (August 22-September 3). These are the final analyses and represent findings through October 6, 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive a single infusion of bamlanivimab (700 mg [n = 101], 2800 mg [n = 107], or 7000 mg [n = 101]), the combination treatment (2800 mg of bamlanivimab and 2800 mg of etesevimab [n = 112]), or placebo (n = 156). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in SARS-CoV-2 log viral load at day 11 (±4 days). Nine prespecified secondary outcome measures were evaluated with comparisons between each treatment group and placebo, and included 3 other measures of viral load, 5 on symptoms, and 1 measure of clinical outcome (the proportion of patients with a COVID-19-related hospitalization, an emergency department [ED] visit, or death at day 29). Results: Among the 577 patients who were randomized and received an infusion (mean age, 44.7 [SD, 15.7] years; 315 [54.6%] women), 533 (92.4%) completed the efficacy evaluation period (day 29). The change in log viral load from baseline at day 11 was -3.72 for 700 mg, -4.08 for 2800 mg, -3.49 for 7000 mg, -4.37 for combination treatment, and -3.80 for placebo. Compared with placebo, the differences in the change in log viral load at day 11 were 0.09 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.52; P = .69) for 700 mg, -0.27 (95% CI, -0.71 to 0.16; P = .21) for 2800 mg, 0.31 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.76; P = .16) for 7000 mg, and -0.57 (95% CI, -1.00 to -0.14; P = .01) for combination treatment. Among the secondary outcome measures, differences between each treatment group vs the placebo group were statistically significant for 10 of 84 end points. The proportion of patients with COVID-19-related hospitalizations or ED visits was 5.8% (9 events) for placebo, 1.0% (1 event) for 700 mg, 1.9% (2 events) for 2800 mg, 2.0% (2 events) for 7000 mg, and 0.9% (1 event) for combination treatment. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 9 patients (6 bamlanivimab, 2 combination treatment, and 1 placebo). No deaths occurred during the study treatment. Conclusions and Relevance: Among nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness, treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab, compared with placebo, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load at day 11; no significant difference in viral load reduction was observed for bamlanivimab monotherapy. Further ongoing clinical trials will focus on assessing the clinical benefit of antispike neutralizing antibodies in patients with COVID-19 as a primary end point.

Since the first report of COVID-19 on December 31, 2019, 179,111 cases were confirmed in 160 countries/regions with 7426 deaths as of March 17, 2020. However, there have been no vaccines approved in the world to date. In this study, we analyzed the biological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, Pro330-Leu650 (SARS-CoV-2-SPL), using biostatistical methods. SARS-CoV-2-SPL possesses a receptor-binding region (RBD) and important B (Ser438-Gln506, Thr553-Glu583, Gly404-Aps427, Thr345-Ala352, and Lys529-Lys535) and T (9 CD4 and 11 CD8 T cell antigenic determinants) cell epitopes. High homology in this region between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV amounted to 87.7%, after taking the biological similarity of the amino acids into account and eliminating the receptor-binding motif (RBM). The overall topology indicated that the complete structure of SARS-CoV-2-SPL was with RBM as the head, and RBD as the trunk and the tail region. SARS-CoV-2-SPL was found to have the potential to elicit effective B and T cell responses. Our findings may provide meaningful guidance for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design.","Su, Qiu-Dong; Yi, Yao; Zou, Ye-Ning; Jia, Zhi-Yuan; Qiu, Feng; Wang, Feng; Yin, Wen-Jiao; Zhou, Wen-Ting; Zhang, Shuang; Yu, Peng-Cheng; Bi, Sheng-Li; Shen, Li-Ping; Wu, Gui-Zhen",Vaccine,145,30

Established cancer referral pathways were modified in response to reduced diagnostic availability. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of COVID-19 on colorectal cancer referral, presentation and stage. METHODS: This was a single centre, retrospective cohort study performed at a tertiary referral centre. Patients diagnosed and managed with colorectal adenocarcinoma between January and December 2020 were compared with patients from 2018 and 2019 in terms of demographics, mode of presentation and pathological cancer staging. RESULTS: In all, 272 patients were diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma during 2020 compared with 282 in 2019 and 257 in 2018. Patients in all years were comparable for age, gender and tumour location (P > 0.05). There was a significant decrease in urgent suspected cancer referrals, diagnostic colonoscopy and radiological imaging performed between March and June 2020 compared with previous years. More patients presented as emergencies (P = 0.03) with increased rates of large bowel obstruction in 2020 compared with 2018-2019 (P = 0.01). The distribution of TNM grade was similar across the 3 years but more T4 cancers were diagnosed in 2020 versus 2018-2019 (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a relatively short-term impact on the colorectal cancer referral pathway can have significant consequences on patient presentation leading to higher risk emergency presentation and surgery at a more advanced stage. It is therefore critical that efforts are made to make this pathway more robust to minimize the impact of other future adverse events and to consolidate the benefits of earlier diagnosis and treatment.","Shinkwin, Michael; Silva, Louise; Vogel, Irene; Reeves, Nicola; Cornish, Julie; Horwood, James; Davies, Michael M; Torkington, Jared; Ansell, James",Colorectal dis,145,23

Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 1003 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was conducted. Longitudinal liver function tests and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: Abnormal liver function parameters were observed, both at admission (ALT 13.2%, AST 8.5%, ALP 2.0%, GGT 7.4%, LDH 37.6%, TBIL 4.0%, DBIL 7.8%, Albumin 10.1%) and peak hospitalization (ALT 29.4%, AST 17.5%, ALP 2.6%, GGT 13.4%, LDH 49.4%, TBIL 10.1%, DBIL 18.0%, Albumin 30.6%) in patients with COVID-19. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients had markedly higher liver function parameters from baseline to 30 days after hospital admission. Abnormal ALT and LDH at hospital admission and some medications use (Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Traditional Chinese medicines) were associated with peak hospitalization ALT > 5× the upper limit unit of normal (ULN). On multivariate analysis, age >60 years, male, obesity, comorbidity, abnormal LDH and albumin at hospital admission and peak hospitalization were associated with progression to severe COVID-19 (OR > 1; p < 0.05). COX analysis revealed that ALT > 2 ULN (HR=7.0, p=0.011), AST > 2 ULN (HR=34.7, p < 0.001), and TBIL > 2 ULN (HR=54.6, p < 0.001) were associated with a higher mortality.

AIM: To determine how patients are interacting with telephone and online channels for accessing general practice services and information, and to analyse how this varies according to patient characteristics and health status. DESIGN & SETTING: A cross-sectional self-administered survey of adult patients in general practices across the West Midlands, UK. METHOD: Descriptive statistics were used to show participants' awareness of and interaction with online information sources and remote access. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the relationships between demographic and health characteristics, and awareness and use of online services and alternatives to face-to-face consultations (for example, telephone). RESULTS: A total of 2789 patients (19.0% response rate) from 43 general practices participated. The study found 60.8% (n = 1651/2715) of participants were aware of online services and 30.3% (n = 811/2674) reported having used one. Daily internet usage and frequently visiting the GP showed the strongest associations with knowledge and use of online services. CONCLUSION: The study shows that there is the potential for inequitable awareness and use of telephone and online services in general practice populations. Given that their use has greatly increased owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, future service design will need to ensure equity is taken into account.","Bryce, Carol; O039,; Connell, Matthew Dl; Dale, Jeremy; Underwood, Martin; Atherton, Helen",,145,21

A PHEIC is defined as an extraordinary event that constitutes a public health risk to other states through international spread and requires a coordinated international response. The WHO Director-General convenes Emergency Committees (ECs) to provide their advice on whether an event constitutes a PHEIC. The EC rationales have been criticised for being non-transparent and contradictory to the International Health Regulations (IHR). This first comprehensive analysis of EC rationale provides recommendations to increase clarity of EC decisions which will strengthen the IHR and WHO's legitimacy in future outbreaks. METHODS: 66 EC statements were reviewed from nine public health outbreaks of influenza A, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, polio, Ebola virus disease, Zika, yellow fever and coronavirus disease-2019. Statements were analysed to determine which of the three IHR criteria were noted as contributing towards the EC's justification on whether to declare a PHEIC and what language was used to explain the decision. RESULTS: Interpretation of the criteria were often vague and applied inconsistently. ECs often failed to describe and justify which criteria had been satisfied. DISCUSSION: Guidelines must be developed for the standardised interpretation of IHR core criteria. The ECs must clearly identify and justify which criteria have contributed to their rationale for or against PHEIC declaration. CONCLUSION: Striving for more consistency and transparency in EC justifications would benefit future deliberations and provide more understanding and support for the process.","Mullen, Lucia; Potter, Christina; Gostin, Lawrence O; Cicero, Anita; Nuzzo, Jennifer B",,145,16

Using carefully designed experiments involving high-speed imaging along with physics-based analysis, we show that high-momentum, large-sized (>250 micrometer) surrogate cough droplets can penetrate single- or double-layer mask material to a significant extent. The penetrated droplets can atomize into numerous much smaller (<100 micrometer) droplets, which could remain airborne for a significant time. The possibility of secondary atomization of high-momentum cough droplets by hydrodynamic focusing and extrusion through the microscale pores in the fibrous network of the single/double-layer mask material needs to be considered in determining mask efficacy. Three-layer masks can effectively block these droplets and thus could be ubiquitously used as a key tool against COVID-19 or similar respiratory diseases.","Sharma, Shubham; Pinto, Roven; Saha, Abhishek; Chaudhuri, Swetaprovo; Basu, Saptarshi",Sci.

Secondary inflammatory responses from virus reinfections may induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a viremic phenomenon that may be an alternative mechanism of cellular infection and should be considered when designing vaccines or immunotherapies involving the stimulation of neutralizing antibodies or the use of monoclonal antibodies. Currently, no vaccines or treatments demonstrate safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19. However, the results from phase III clinical trials which involve the application of an mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) nucleic acid vaccine and an antiviral drug (remdisivir), are yet to be concluded.

METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective study of public data analysing geopolitical and immigration activities that occurred between 02 April and 08 September 2020. The Chi-square test of independence was used to tabulate sex and age-related fatality ratios among deaths due to COVID-19-related complications. RESULTS: The drivers for COVID-19 spread were mass gatherings secondary to the country's political landscape and repatriation of citizens from high-risk areas coupled with minimum use of public health interventions. The prevalence was higher in people aged 50-59 years, males and in urban areas. Men had an increased risk of COVID-19-related deaths (Case Fatality Ratio: 1.58 (95% CI 1.11-2.22) compared with women. Furthermore, men and women aged &#8805;40 years were 16.1 times and 7.1 times more likely to die of COVID-related complications, respectively. Men aged &#8805;40 years had a 62% increased risk of deaths compared with women of the same age group. CONCLUSION: Mass political gatherings and cross-border immigration from high-risk areas were drivers for infection. Males, older age and urban residence were associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. To control the spread of COVID-19 there is a need to regulate mass gatherings and repatriation of citizens, and strengthen the use of preventive health interventions. Men, the older age groups and urban areas should be prioritised for COVID-19 prevention strategies.","Nyasulu, Juliet Charity Yauka; Munthali, Richard Junganiko; Nyondo-Mipando, Alinane Linda; Pandya, Himani; Nyirenda, Laywell; Nyasulu, Peter Suwirakwenda; Manda, Samuel",Int J Infect Dis,145,0

Neurologic symptoms secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis occurred within 24 hours of the onset of the respiratory and constitutional symptoms in 58% of cases, and 75% had venous infarction, hemorrhage, or both on brain imaging. Management consisted of anticoagulation, endovascular thrombectomy, and surgical hematoma evacuation. The mortality rate was 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Early evidence suggests a higher-than-expected frequency of cerebral venous thrombosis among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Cerebral venous thrombosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of neurologic syndromes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Al-Mufti, F; Amuluru, K; Sahni, R; Bekelis, K; Karimi, R; Ogulnick, J; Cooper, J; Overby, P; Nuoman, R; Tiwari, A; Berekashvili, K; Dangayach, N; Liang, J; Gupta, G; Khandelwal, P; Dominguez, J F; Sursal, T; Kamal, H; Dakay, K; Taylor, B; Gulko, E; El-Ghanem, M; Mayer, S A; Gandhi, C",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,145,1

However, SARS-CoV-2 variants have begun to emerge and raise concerns, as they may potentially compromise vaccine efficiency. Here, we monitored neutralization potency of convalescent or Pfizer-BTN162b2 post-vaccination sera against pseudoviruses displaying spike proteins derived from wild-type SARS-CoV-2, or its UK-B.1.1.7 and SA-B.1.351 variants. Compared to convalescent sera, vaccination induces high titers of neutralizing antibodies, which exhibit efficient neutralization potential against pseudovirus carrying wild-type SARS-CoV-2. However, while wild-type and UK-N501Y pseudoviruses were similarly neutralized, those displaying SA-N501Y/K417N/E484K spike mutations moderately resist neutralization. Contribution of single or combined spike mutations to neutralization and infectivity were monitored, highlighting mechanisms by which viral infectivity and neutralization resistance are enhanced by N501Y or E484K/K417N mutations. Our study validates the importance of the Pfizer vaccine but raises concerns regarding its efficacy against specific SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants.","Kuzmina, Alona; Khalaila, Yara; Voloshin, Olga; Keren-Naus, Ayelet; Boehm-Cohen, Liora; Raviv, Yael; Shemer-Avni, Yonat; Rosenberg, Elli; Taube, Ran",Cell Host Microbe,145,24

Older adults have been found as a vulnerable group for developing severe forms of disease and increased mortality. Objective: The objective of the study was to propose a pathway to assist the decision-making process for hospital resource allocation for older adults with COVID-19 using simple geriatric assessment-based tools. Methods: We reviewed the available literature at this point of the COVID-19 outbreak, focusing in older adult care to extract key recommendations for those health-care professionals who will be treating older adults in the hospital emergency ward (HEW) in developing countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: We listed a series of easy recommendations for non-geriatrician doctors in the HEW and suggested simple tools for hospital resource allocation during critical care evaluation of older adults with COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries. Conclusions: Age must not be used as the sole criterion for resource allocation among older adults with COVID-19. Simple and efficient tools are available to identify components of the comprehensive geriatric assessment, which could be useful to predict outcomes and provide high-quality care that would fit the particular needs of older adults in resource-limited settings amidst this global pandemic.","Gómez-Moreno, Carolina; Hernández-Ruiz, Virgilio; Hernández-Gilsoul, Thierry; Avila-Funes, José A",Rev Invest Clin,145,10

One of the most significant issues that require close attention in the treatment and rehabilitation of patients with coronovirus infection is the analysis of the nutritional status of patients and the development of approaches to nutritional support for patients. Aim of study. Analysis of nutritional status of patients infected with COVID-19 and studying the effectiveness of specialized products dietary therapeutic and preventive nutrition during illness and recovery period. Materials and methods. A survey of 283 patients with mild and moderate severity was conducted. The survey showed a significant change in eating behavior in patients during the disease. To assess the effectiveness of nutritional support during the disease and during the recovery period, 36 individuals took a specialized product of dietary therapeutic and preventive nutrition “Detoxifying Kissel” LEOVIT DETOX daily after the diagnosis of COVID-19, both throughout the entire period of the disease, and within 2 weeks after the disease and going to work. Results and discussion. The survey showed the presence of a significant range of eating disorders in patients with coronavirus disease. It was found that in 90% of the respondents during the day, the main meal was 3 or more times. During the disease, the number of main meals decreased in 40% of individuals, and only in 4% of patients this figure increased. When using nutritional support with dietary therapeutic and prophylactic foods during the disease, patients noted a significant decrease in weakness and fatigue, temperature fluctuations, fears, anxiety, suspiciousness and other symptoms began to disappear. The continuation of the intake in the post-ovoid period of the use of nutritional support with the dietary therapeutic and preventive food product “Detoxifying Kissel” LEOVIT DETOX, contributes to a faster recovery of patients. Conclusion. The use of the dietary therapeutic and preventive food product “Detoxifying Kissel” LEOVIT DETOX is an effective method of nutritional support both during the disease and in the post-ovoid period. Long-term use of detoxification products (at least 3–6 months) after the disease is recommended. © 2021, Remedium Group Ltd. All rights reserved.","Pilat, T. L.; Alekseenko, S. N.; Krutova, V.

It has been shown that mortality in people with underlying diseases including diabetes has been very high. The present study aimed to measure diabetes related worries (outcome) and their associations with social support and lifestyle (exposures) amongst people with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was completed by 928 respondents (>18 years) between 15-11-2020 and 12-12-2020. The questionnaire comprised four sections: socio-demographic details, diabetic-related worries, social support, and behavioral changes due to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, correlations and hierarchical regression analysis were performed in the study. RESULTS: Data from 928 respondents (51.61% male; mean age = 52.48 [SD = 11.76]; age range = 18-86 years) were analyzed. The mean score for COVID-19 specific diabetes worries was 3.13 out of 8. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that the mean COVID-19-specific diabetes worries score was significantly associated with lower age, cigarette smoking, perceived poor health status, presence of other diabetic complications. Lack of social support from family, friends, work colleagues and diabetes care team and also eating more than usual were also significantly associated with COVID-19 specific diabetes worry. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes related worries were strongly associated with a lack of social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings suggest the need of social support as well as improving knowledge and guidelines is important for people with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sujan, Md Safaet Hossain; Tasnim, Rafia; Islam, Md Saiful; Ferdous, Most Zannatul; Apu, Md Abdur Rahman; Musfique, Md Miftah; Pardhan, Shahina",Prim. care diabetes,145,1

In order to define the epidemiological, clinical and diagnostic features of these infections, a prospective study was conducting from September 2018 to May 2019, at the University Hospital of Tizi-Ouzou (Algeria). PATIENTS: All patients addressed to the Laboratory of Parasitology-Mycology of the University Hospital of Tizi-Ouzou for a suspected Tinea capitis, were included in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Before sampling, contact with animals or soil, presence of similar lesions in the family circle, and previous antifungal or corticosteroid treatment were searched. Mycological examination included direct microscopic examination of the samples, and culture on Sabouraud agar slants at 27°C for up to 4weeks. RESULTS: Out of the 87 samples examined, 46 allowed us to confirm the diagnosis of Tinea capitis, representing a positivity rate of 52.9%. The sex ratio was 1.09 (52.2% males vs. 47.8% females among the infected patients), and the infection mainly involved children of 4-6years (43.3%). Thirty-four strains of dermatophytes were isolated. Microsporum canis was the most frequent species identified (44.1%), followed by Trichophyton mentagrophytes (38.2%). During this study, Trichophyton tonsurans, an unusual dermatophyte species in Algeria, was identified for the first time in our hospital. CONCLUSION: Tinea capitis are still common in Algeria, mainly affecting school-aged children and preschool children. Microsporum canis and T. mentagrophytes are the major causative agents, in agreement with previous studies showing a decrease in frequency of anthropophilic species, in favour of zoophilic species.","Kheffache, H; Seklaoui, N; Bouchara, J P; Boukhemza-Zemmouri, N; Boukhemza, M",J Mycol Med,145,1

DESIGN/SETTING: Technical and nontechnical skill multiple mini-interviews (MMIs) were performed virtually and assessed for 109 applicants during virtual general surgery interviews over 2 days at a tertiary academic medical center. RESULTS: We demonstrate the feasibility of virtually assessing general surgery residency applicants' technical and non-technical skills. Using a virtual MMI format during general surgery interviews, we assessed communication, emotional intelligence, anatomical knowledge, interpretation of medical tests, knot tying, and suturing. Four tasks (communication, emotional intelligence , anatomical knowledge, and interpretation of tests) were assessed synchronously by trained general surgery interns. Applicants submitted a recording of themselves performing knot tying and suturing tasks, which were asynchronously assessed after the interview day. Applicants rated the MMI experience highly (4.3/5) via postinterview day survey and the majority of applicants felt that station objectives were met in the virtual format. CONCLUSIONS: We report a successful experience implementing technical and nontechnical virtual MMIs with capacity for 120 applicants during general surgery residency interviews. In the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to assess surgical leaners virtually is essential. Virtual skills assessments may provide a more comprehensive picture of applicants and enable residency programs to better assess residents when gathering in person is not feasible.","Lund, Sarah; Shaikh, Nizamuddin; Yeh, Vicky J-H; Baloul, Mohamed; de Azevedo, Rafael; Peña, Alvaro; Becknell, Mark; Que, Florencia; Stulak, John; Rivera, Mariela",J. surg. educ,145,16

Aggregate data, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration, were obtained from study authors. The study was registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42020190633). Findings: We identified 45 eligible RCTs (total 73,384 participants). Data were obtained for 46,331 (98.0%) of 47,262 participants in 42 studies, aged 0 to 95 years. For the primary comparison of vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo, the intervention reduced risk of ARI overall (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.99; P for heterogeneity 0.01). No statistically significant effect of vitamin D was seen for any of the sub-groups defined by baseline 25(OH)D concentration. However, protective effects were seen for trials in which vitamin D was given using a daily dosing regimen (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93); at daily dose equivalents of 400-1000 IU (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89); and for a duration of &#8804;12 months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.93). No significant interaction was seen between allocation to vitamin D vs. placebo and dose frequency, dose size, or study duration. Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09). Risk of bias within individual studies was assessed as being low for all but three trials. A funnel plot showed left-sided asymmetry (P=0.008, Egger's test). Interpretation: Vitamin D supplementation was safe and reduced risk of ARI, despite evidence of significant heterogeneity across trials. Protection was associated with administration of daily doses of 400-1000 IU vitamin D for up to 12 months. The relevance of these findings to COVID-19 is not known and requires investigation. Funding: None.","Jolliffe, David A; Camargo, Carlos A; Sluyter, John D; Aglipay, Mary; Aloia, John F; Ganmaa, Davaasambuu; Bergman, Peter; Borzutzky, Arturo; Damsgaard, Camilla T; Dubnov-Raz, Gal; Esposito, Susanna; Gilham, Clare; Ginde, Adit A; Golan-Tripto, Inbal; Goodall, Emma C; Grant, Cameron C; Griffiths, Christopher J; Hibbs, Anna Maria; Janssens, Wim; Khadilkar, Anuradha Vaman; Laaksi, Ilkka; Lee, Margaret T; Loeb, Mark; Maguire, Jonathon L; Majak, Pawel; Mauger, David T; Manaseki-Holland, Semira; Murdoch, David R; Nakashima, Akio; Neale, Rachel E; Pham, Hai; Rake, Christine; Rees, Judy R; Rosendahl, Jenni; Scragg, Robert; Shah, Dheeraj; Shimizu, Yoshiki; Simpson-Yap, Steve; Kumar, Geeta Trilok; Urashima, Mitsuyoshi; Martineau, Adrian R",,145,29

We had previously published the results of a survey to the affected patients from 6 institutions. We now present the results of a larger distribution of this survey, through May and June 2020, to electively scheduled patients representing different regions of the United States. Methods: Fifteen centers identified through the AAHKS Research Committee participated in a survey study of THA and TKA patients. Patients scheduled for primary elective THA or TKA but canceled due to the COVID-19 elective surgery stoppage (3/2020-5/2020) were included in the study. Descriptive statistics along with subgroup analysis with Wilcoxon rank were performed. Results: In total, surveys were distributed to 2135 patients and completed by 848 patients (40%) from 15 institutions. Most patients (728/848, 86%) had their surgery postponed or canceled by the surgeon or hospital. Unknown length of surgical delay remained the highest source of anxiety among survey participants. Male patients were more likely to be willing to proceed with surgery in spite of COVID-19. There were minimal regional differences in responses. Only 61 patients (7%) stated they will continue to delay surgery for fear of contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital. Conclusion: Similar to the previous study, the most anxiety-provoking thought was the uncertainty over if and when the canceled joint replacement surgery could be rescheduled. Patients suffering from the daily pain of hip and knee arthritis that have been scheduled for elective arthroplasty remain eager to have their operation as soon as elective surgery is allowed to resume.","Brown, Timothy S; Bedard, Nicholas A; Rojas, Edward O; Anthony, Christopher A; Schwarzkopf, Ran; Stambough, Jeffrey B; Nandi, Sumon; Prieto, Hernan; Parvizi, Javad; Bini, Stefano A; Higuera, Carlos A; Piuzzi, Nicholas S; Blankstein, Michael; Wellman, Samuel S; Dietz, Matthew J; Jennings, Jason M; Dasa, Vinod",,145,16

However, the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients is unknown. Vitamin B1, B6, B12, vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D), folate, selenium, and zinc levels were measured in 50 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Overall, 76% of the patients were vitamin D deficient and 42% were selenium deficient. No significant increase in the incidence of deficiency was found for vitamins B1, B6, and B12, folate, and zinc in patients with COVID-19. The COVID-19 group showed significantly lower vitamin D values than the healthy control group (150 people, matched by age/sex). Severe vitamin D deficiency (based on a cut-off of &#8804;10 ng/dl) was found in 24.0% of the patients in the COVID-19 group and 7.3% in the control group. Among 12 patients with respiratory distress, 11 (91.7%) were deficient in at least one nutrient. However, patients without respiratory distress showed a deficiency in 30/38 cases (78.9%; p = 0.425). These results suggest that a deficiency of vitamin D or selenium may decrease the immune defenses against COVID-19 and cause progression to severe disease. However, more precise and large-scale studies are needed.","Im, Jae Hyoung; Je, Young Soo; Baek, Jihyeon; Chung, Moon-Hyun; Kwon, Hea Yoon; Lee, Jin-Soo",Int J Infect Dis,145,16

There is no adequate information to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute appendicitis and its surgical management. The present comparative study reports successful appendectomy and infection control in patients with appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic and last year covering the same period. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted in acute appendicitis-treated patients from 13.03.19 to 13.05.19 and from 13.03.20 to 13.05.20, respectively. RESULTS: This study included 150 patients (110 patients in 2019; 40 patients in 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic)). The patients were named as Group A (Normal period) and Group B (Pandemic period), respectively. The groups were comparable as there was no significant difference between the mean age, mean BMI, and mean length of stay. There is a significant difference between the comorbidities of Group A and Group B (p=0.033). There was no significant difference between the laboratory and radiological findings of Group A and Group B. There was a significant difference between the perforation number of Group A and Group B (p=0.029). There was no significant difference between the needs of ICU and conversion from laparoscopic to conventional appendectomy of Group A and Group B. CONCLUSION: The findings obtained in this study suggest that late admission to the hospital caused complicated cases and made acute appendicitis management more difficult during the pandemic period, which was already a troubling period. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the principles applied to emergency surgery for infected patients should be applied to both suspected and confirmed cases.","Meriç, Serhat; Vartanoglu Aktokmakyan, Talar; Tokocin, Merve; Aktimur, Yunus Emre; Hacim, Nadir Adnan; Gülcicek, Osman Bilgin",Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg,145,4

While COVID-19 continues to threaten global healthcare delivery systems and populations, its impact on nursing has been profound. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to document nurses' immediate reactions, major stressors, effective measures to reduce stress, coping strategies, and motivators as they provided care during COVID-19. DESIGN: Mixed-methods, cross sectional design. Participants responded to objective and open-ended questions on the COVID-19 Nurses' Survey. PARTICIPANTS: The survey, was sent to nurses employed in health care settings during the pandemic; 110 nurses participated. RESULTS: Immediate reactions of respondents were nervousness and call of duty; major stressors were uncertainty, inflicting the virus on family, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), and protocol inconsistencies. Effective measures to reduce stress identified were financial incentives and mental health support. Most frequently used coping strategies were limiting televised news about the virus, talking with family and friends, and information, Motivators to participate in future care included having adequate PPE and sense of duty. Bivariate analysis of outcomes by age group, education, work setting, and marital status was performed. Nurse respondents with higher advanced degrees had significantly less fear than those with BSN-only degrees (p < .05).Of respondents who were married/living with a partner, 85.9% listing ""uncertainty about when the pandemic will be under control"" as a major stressor (p < .05), while 62.8% of those who were single/divorced/widowed (p = .015) did so. Further, 75% of respondents working in critical care listed ""mental health services"" as important (p = .054). Four major qualitative themes emerged: What is going on here?; How much worse can this get?; What do I do now?; What motivates me to do future work? CONCLUSION: The study found nurses were motivated by ethical duty to care for patients with COVID-19 despite risk to self and family, leaving nurses vulnerable to moral distress and burnout. This research articulates the need for psychological support, self- care initiatives, adequate protection, information, and process improvements in the healthcare systems to reduce the risk of moral distress, injury and burnout among nurses.","Gray, Kathleen; Dorney, Paulette; Hoffman, Lori; Crawford, Albert",Appl Nurs Res,145,11

Most of the vaccine and drug development has focused on the spike proteins and viral RNA-polymerases and main protease for viral replication. Using the bioinformatics and structural modelling approach, we modelled the structure of the envelope (E)-protein of novel SARS-CoV-2. The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS- CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminus regions. Incidentally, compared to spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences. Using homology modelling, we found that the most favorable structure could function as a gated ion channel conducting H+ ions. Combining pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds which was further validated by insertion of the E protein in an ERGIC-mimic membrane. Additionally, two distinct ""core"" structures were visible, the hydrophobic core and the central core, which may regulate the opening/closing of the channel. We propose this as a mechanism of viral ion channeling activity which plays a critical role in viral infection and pathogenesis. In addition, it provides a structural basis and additional avenues for vaccine development and generating therapeutic interventions against the virus.","Sarkar, Manish; Saha, Soham",PLoS One,145,17

No original studies exist on audiological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients. The main objective was to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 may affect auditory function in clinically ill COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: COVID-19 patients with moderate-severe disease and without prior history of hearing abnormalities were enrolled from a tertiary referral center, and matched with controls. Participants performed an audiometric evaluation, and thresholds were compared. Results: 120 ears from 60 patients were enrolled. Patients with COVID-19 showed worse mean auditory thresholds starting from 1000 Hz through higher frequencies, when compared to controls (1000 Hz: 18.52 ± 5.49 dB HL in controls vs 25.36 ± 6.79 dB HL in COVID-19, p<0.001; 2000Hz: 17.50 ± 5.57 dB HL in controls vs 21.96 ± 7.05 dB HL in COVID-19, p=0.010; 3000Hz: 17.97 ± 8.07 dB HL in controls vs 25 ± 9.38 dB HL in COVID-19, p=0.003; 4000 Hz: 20.16 ± 10.12 dB HL in controls vs 29.55 ± 11.26 dB HL in COVID-19, p=0.001; 8000 Hz: 31.09 ± 12.75 dB HL in controls vs 40.71 ± 19.40 dB HL in COVID-19, p=0.030; Pure Tone Average: 20.42 ± 4.29 dB HL in controls vs 24.85 ± 5.62 dB HL in COVID-19, p=0.001). Statistical significance persisted after adjusting for confounders such as age, gender and various comorbidities (p<0.05). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 may affect hearing in COVID-19 patients with moderate-severe disease. Results are in line with the previous suggested effects of COVID-19 on auditory system.

In this work, we consider a setting in which time series live on different spaces without a sensible ground metric, causing DTW to become ill-defined. To alleviate this, we propose Gromov dynamic time warping (GDTW), a distance between time series on potentially incomparable spaces that avoids the comparability requirement by instead considering intra-relational geometry.

We aimed to identify factors associated with changes in alcohol and tobacco consumption during the strictest period of PHSM 'lockdown'. METHODS: Logistic regression analysis were conducted using secondary data from the Central Statistics Office Social Impact Survey collected during lockdown in Ireland (April 23rd-May 1st, 2020). RESULTS: Of the 1,362 (33.8%) individuals that responded to the survey, 80.6% were current drinkers and 26.0% were smokers. The majority of smokers (60.9%) and drinkers (60.6%) reported no change in consumption. However, 30.5% of smokers and 22.2% of drinkers reported increased consumption. Being concerned about household stress from confinement (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.9, p = 0.002), working from home (aOR 2.1, 95 CI 1.4-3.3, p < 0.001) and urban living (aOR 2.0, 95 CI 1.5-2.9, p < 0.001) were associated with increases in alcohol consumption.

CONCLUSION: A mixed picture was evident in terms of changes in consumption among current smokers and drinkers. Increased consumption was more commonly reported than reductions. Increased consumption was associated with psychological distress and socio-economic factors. Policies and services should consider a response to widening inequalities in harmful consumption.","Reynolds, Ciara M E; Purdy, Joanna; Rodriguez, Lauren; McAvoy, Helen",Eur. j. public health,145,24

Early and fast detection of COVID-19 from infected individuals is critical to limit its spreading. Here, we report an innovative approach to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein by combining DNA/RNA oligomers as aptamers and a graphene oxide (GO) coated optical microfiber as a sensor system. The DNA/RNA aptamers can effectively capture the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in vitro, with the GO coated optical microfiber aptasensor for real-time monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Due to the extremely high surface-to-volume ratio and excellent optical and biochemical properties of the GO surface layer, the fixing effect of the microfiber surface is significantly improved and the lowest limit of detection (LOD) is 6.25 × 10-19 M. Furthermore, in order to prove the feasibility of this sensing method in clinical applications, we use this sensor to detect the N protein mixed in fetal bovine serum (FBS) samples. The experimental results show that the biosensor can quickly and effectively detect the N protein (1 × 10-9 M) in a complex sample matrix within 3 minutes. These findings suggest that this approach can be utilized for quantitative monitoring of coronavirus particles due to its high sensitivity, which can help to quickly exclude patients who do not have the infection. Collectively, the optical microfiber sensor system could be expected to become an important platform for the diagnosis of coronavirus due to its simple detection scheme and easy miniaturization.","Jia, Hao; Zhang, Ao; Yang, Yuquan; Cui, Yaqi; Xu, Jianrong; Jiang, Hewei; Tao, Shengce; Zhang, Dawei; Zeng, Heping; Hou, Zhaoyuan; Feng, Jijun",Lab Chip,145,26

METHODS: A sample of 2619 US-licensed psychologists completed a survey assessing telepsychology use and aspects of both models in May 2020. RESULTS: Cross-sectional TRA and TAM path models evidenced excellent fit in explaining psychologists' telepsychology use. The TRA indicated that psychologists' attitudes concerning telepsychology and subjective norms were associated with intentions to use telepsychology, which related to percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology. The TAM showed that perceived usefulness of telepsychology and perceived ease of use were associated with attitudes toward telepsychology. Perceived usefulness was associated with psychologists' intention to use telepsychology, as was perceived ease of use.

Easy to handle antigen tests can provide timely results, which is of particular importance in a primary care setting. However, concerns exist regarding their sensitivity, which led us to evaluate four commercially available tests in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed in parallel nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs from 154 consecutive patients admitted to our department with moderate to severe COVID-19, using quantitative RT-PCR (Cobas, Roche) and up to four antigen tests from different distributors. Antigen test results were linked to Ct (cycle threshold) values as markers for patients' infectivity. RESULTS: We found that two out of four antigen tests correctly identified subjects with high viral loads (Ct&#8804;25), and three out of four tests detected more than 80% of subjects with a Ct&#8804;30, which is considered the threshold for infectivity. However, one test investigated had a poor clinical performance. When investigating subjects with Ct values >30, we found that the antigen test was still positive in up to 45% of those cases. CONCLUSION: Most antigen tests had a sufficient sensitivity to identify symptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 and with transmissible infection. On the other hand, antigen testing may not be suitable to identify loss of infectivity in COVID-19 subjects during follow-up. Newly introduced antigen tests need to be validated in a clinical or primary care setting to define their clinical usefulness.","Thommes, Lis; Burkert, Francesco Robert; Öttl, Karla-Wanda; Goldin, David; Loacker, Lorin; Lanser, Lukas; Griesmacher, Andrea; Theurl, Igor; Weiss, Günter; Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa",Int J Infect Dis,145,16

Method: This paper uses Bacchi's ?What is the Problem Represented to Be? framework to analyse the Emergency Requirements for Remote Communities Determination under Subsection 477(1) of the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth). Results: Despite the leadership of community-controlled health services and regional councils, and the actions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, the policy response constructs Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as vulnerable and mobility as a problem that needs a law and order response. Conclusions: The policy response perpetuates an ongoing paternalistic discourse where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people must be controlled for the sake of their health, informed by notions of Indigeneity as deficient. This stands in contrast with the work of community-controlled health organisations, advocacy by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for and against restrictions, and examples of communities protecting themselves. Implications for public health: Unilateral government intervention creates limiting discourses of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In contrast, ongoing COVID-19 responses can build on the strengths of and work done by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, leaders, and communities.","Donohue, Monica McDowall Ailie",Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health,145,15

Ferritin and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are significant prognostic biomarkers used in COVID-19 patients, although they are affected by other factors such as comorbidities and age. Aging changes the immune system through immunosenescence and inflammaging; however, there are limited number of studies evaluating its effect on ferritin and NLR as part of the complete assessment for intensive care requirement and mortality risk. A single-center retrospective cohort study of 295 COVID-19 patients was performed at the Siloam Hospitals Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia from April to August 2020. After admission, all patients were followed up for clinical outcomes. Patients were grouped into strata based on age (<50 years vs. &#8805;50 years) and risk groups (low-risk ferritin vs. high-risk ferritin; low-risk NLR vs. high-risk NLR). The endpoints of the study were the intensive care requirements and mortality. Among the 295 COVID-19 patients, 264 survived and 31 deceased. Ferritin and NLR had higher area under curve (AUC) values than other inflammatory parameters and had significantly different outcomes in both mortality and intensive care requirement groups. The combination of ferritin and NLR showed higher AUC values for intensive care requirement and mortality (AUC, 0.783; 95% confidence interval, 0.703-0.864). Multivariate analysis showed that both endpoints were strongly affected by age, ferritin level, and NLR. Age significantly multiplied clinical endpoints in low-risk group patients but not in high-risk group patients. The combination of ferritin and NLR had a better predictive value for intensive care requirement and mortality risk. However, age strongly affects clinical outcome in low-risk groups of both ferritin and NLR groups; hence, it should be considered as an early predictive factor of COVID-19 disease progression.","Rasyid, Haerani; Sangkereng, Alvin; Harjianti, Tutik; Soetjipto, Audrey S",Physiol Rep,145,14

One solution may be to decontaminate equipment such as facemasks for reuse. AIM: To collect and synthesize existing information on decontamination of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) using microwave and heat-based treatments, with special attention to impacts on mask function (aerosol penetration, airflow resistance), fit, and physical traits. METHODS: A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020177036) of literature available from Medline, Embase, Global Health, and other sources was conducted. Records were screened independently by two reviewers, and data was extracted from studies that reported on effects of microwave- or heat-based decontamination on N95 FFR performance, fit, physical traits, and/or reductions in microbial load. FINDINGS: Thirteen studies were included that used dry/moist microwave irradiation, heat, or autoclaving. All treatment types reduced pathogen load by a log10 reduction factor of at least three when applied for sufficient duration (>30 s microwave, >60 min dry heat), with most studies assessing viral pathogens. Mask function (aerosol penetration <5% and airflow resistance <25 mmH2O) was preserved after all treatments except autoclaving. Fit was maintained for most N95 models, though all treatment types caused observable physical damage to at least one model. CONCLUSIONS: Microwave irradiation and heat may be safe and effective viral decontamination options for N95 FFR reuse during critical shortages. The evidence does not support autoclaving or high-heat (>90°C) approaches. Physical degradation may be an issue for certain mask models, and more real-world evidence on fit is needed.","Gertsman, S; Agarwal, A; O039,; Hearn, K; Webster, R; Tsampalieros, A; Barrowman, N; Sampson, M; Sikora, L; Staykov, E; Ng, R; Gibson, J; Dinh, T; Agyei, K; Chamberlain, G; McNally, J D",J Hosp Infect,145,20

It is important to characterize a virus at the nucleotide level to discover the virus's genomic sequence variations and similarities relative to other viruses that could have an impact on the functions of its genes and proteins. This entails a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the viral genomes of interest for preferred nucleotides, codon bias, nucleotide changes at the 3rd position (NT3s), synonymous codon usage and relative synonymous codon usage. In this study, the variations in the N proteins among 13 different coronaviruses (CoVs) were analysed at the nucleotide and amino acid levels in an attempt to reveal how these viruses adapt to their hosts relative to their preferred codon usage in the N genes. The results revealed that, overall, eighteen amino acids had different preferred codons and eight of these were over-biased. The N genes had a higher AT% over GC% and the values of their effective number of codons ranged from 40.43 to 53.85, indicating a slight codon bias. Neutrality plots and correlation analyses showed a very high level of GC3s/GC correlation in porcine epidemic diarrhea CoV (pedCoV), followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS CoV), porcine delta CoV (dCoV), bat CoV (bCoV) and feline CoV (fCoV) with r values 0.81, 0.68, -0.47, 0.98 and 0.58, respectively. These data implied a high rate of evolution of the CoV genomes and a strong influence of mutation on evolutionary selection in the CoV N genes. This type of genetic analysis would be useful for evaluating a virus's host adaptation, evolution and is thus of value to vaccine design strategies.","Sheikh, Abdullah; Al-Taher, Abdulla; Al-Nazawi, Mohammed; Al-Mubarak, Abdullah I; Kandeel, Mahmoud",J Virol Methods,145,16

METHODS: Patients taking immune checkpoint inhibitors at a single centre from January 1, 2010 to February 29, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed for clinical characteristics, treatments and concurrent systemic adverse effects. RESULTS: Of 996 patients, 28 (2.8%) experienced an ophthalmic side effect that came to the attention of an eye care provider. Mean age at presentation of the side effect was 63 years (median 64, range 25-88). The checkpoint inhibitor most often preceding side effects was pembrolizumab in 12 (43%). The most common side effect was dry eye in 16 (57%), followed by uveitis in 4 (14%) patients, and singular cases of ptosis and binocular diplopia, among others. Ocular surface adverse effects occurred more frequently with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) targeting therapy. There were no significant differences in the frequency of orbit/ocular adnexa and uveitis or retinal side effects based on checkpoint targets. Follow-up was available in 13 (46%) patients, with mean duration of 20 months (median 16, range 2-52 months). Of these patients, the ophthalmic side effects were controlled without discontinuing therapy in 12 (92%). Checkpoint inhibitor cessation was required in one patient with panuveitis. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic immune-related adverse events are rare but could be more common than previously estimated. PD-L1-directed checkpoint inhibitors may have a slight predilection for ocular surface adverse effects. Most ophthalmic events can be treated with targeted therapy without discontinuation of life-prolonging immunotherapy.","Fortes, Blake Hugo; Liou, Harris; Dalvin, Lauren A",Br. j. ophthalmol,145,30

Some people have greater susceptibility which influences both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 severity. Smoking is associated with increased ACE-2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which facilitates its entry through the lung. However, despite the widespread use of e-cigarettes, also known as 'vaping', little is known regarding the effects of vaping on ACE-2 expression and how this affects SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the added effect of nicotine in the vapor is also unknown. Thus, we tested whether vaping induces ACE-2 expression in the mouse lung. BALB/c mice exposed to e-cigarette vapor (+/-nicotine) resulted in a significant increase in peribronchiolar inflammation and influx of immune cells into the airways. Vapor increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin 1beta, and KC levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in both sexes, which were further enhanced by nicotine (whereas increase in interleukin 6 was sex and nicotine independent). The reduction in basal inspiratory capacity with vapor exposure occurred independent of sex or nicotine. The increase in methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness was independent of sex;however, in female mice it was only significant in the nicotine-exposed group. Lung ACE-2 expression was increased in male mice in a nicotine-dependent manner as compared with female mice. Collectively, while vaping (+/-nicotine) induced airway inflammation and impaired lung function, the induction of lung ACE-2 occurred to a significantly greater degree in males exposed to vapor containing nicotine as compared with females.

A questionnaire comprising the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale was used to define mental health. RESULTS: The overall mean score for well-being was 42.4, indicating that 51.9% of adults suffered from poor mental health. And within that 48% of males and 57% of females were depressed. The mean scores for government workers, unemployed workers, and business employees were 45.1, 39.6, and 39.5, respectively. Confounding adjustments in multivariable linear regression models revealed that married women, unemployed and business communities, and individuals returning to villages were heavily depressed. Stay-at-home orders had significant repercussions on mental health and created a gender disparity in depression among adults. Suggestions include promoting mental health for women, unemployed, and business individuals. Married women need to be taken into special consideration as their mental well-being is worse. Older people (50 years of age and over) reported a high day-to-day variation in their mental health.

Arachidonic acid (AA) and other unsaturated fatty acids (especially eicosapentaenoic acd, EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA) are known to inactivate enveloped viruses and inhibit proliferation of various microbial organisms. The pro-inflammatory metabolites of AA and EPA such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes induce inflammation whereas lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins derived from AA, EPA and DHA not only suppress inflammation but also enhance would healing and augment phagocytosis of macrophages and other immunocytes and decrease microbial load. In view of these actions, it is suggested that AA and other unsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites may serve as endogenous anti-viral compounds and their deficiency may render humans susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS and other similar viruses' infections.

Here we report the surprising result that visual experience is critical for the alignment of vDSGC dendrites to their preferred direction. Interestingly, vDSGCs in dark-reared mice lose their inhibition-independent dendritic contribution to direction-selective tuning while maintaining asymmetric inhibitory input.

Under the action of homogeneous H3O+ and distinct Lewis acid sites on the catalyst, the production of lactic acid from microalgae residue underwent three main reaction steps: hydrolysis, isomerization, and retro-aldol condensation. Results demonstrated that the lipid component had a strong inhibitory effect on the production of lactic acid due to the formation of aromatics, esters, and complex nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds, which covered or poisoned the Lewis acid sites of the catalyst. The protein component acted as a chemical buffer that enhanced the production of lactic acid by controlling the release of monosaccharides from the carbohydrate fraction of microalgae and maintaining the catalytic activity of the catalyst.

This study was designed to detect the influences and regulatory mechanism of lncRNA PDCD4-AS1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). METHODS: qRT-PCR and Western blot were utilized to investigate the expression levels of PDCD4-AS1, miR-10b-5p and IQGAP2 in TNBC tissues and cells. Online software and luciferase reporter gene system were employed to testify the interactions among these molecules. Loss and gain of function of PDCD4-AS1, miR-10b-5p or IQGAP2 were performed before MTT and colony formation assay, TUNEL staining in addition to Transwell and scratch assays were applied to measure the cell biological functions. RESULTS: In this work, PDCD4-AS1 and IQGAP2 were lowly expressed while miR-10b-5p was strongly expressed in TNBC tissues and cells. PDCD4-AS1 or IQGAP2 overexpression effectively attenuated TNBC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and increased the apoptosis rate, while this effect was abandoned in response to miR-10b-5p mimics transfection. miR-10b-5p bound to IQGAP2 and acted as a downstream target of PDCD4-AS1.

Anticipating a need for such therapies during the pandemic, our center created a targeted protocol for ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients that allows us to provide this life-saving therapy to our sickest patients without overburdening already stretched resources or excessively exposing healthcare staff to infection risk. METHODS: As a major regional referral program, we used the framework of our well-established ECMO service-line to outline specific team structures, modified patient eligibility criteria, cannulation strategies, and management protocols for the COVID-19 ECMO program. RESULTS: During the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts, 6 patients were placed on VV ECMO for refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure. The median (interquartile range) age was 47 years (43-53) with most patients being male (83%) and obese (67%). All cannulations were performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit in patients who had undergone a trial of rescue therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome including lung protective ventilation, paralysis, prone positioning, and inhaled nitric oxide. At the time of this report, 83% (5/6) of the patients are still alive with 1 death on ECMO, attributed to hemorrhagic stroke. 67% of patients (4/6) have been successfully decannulated, including 2 that have been successfully extubated and one who was discharged from the hospital. The median duration of VV ECMO therapy for patients who have been decannulated is 12 days (4-18 days). CONCLUSIONS: This is 1 the first case series describing VV ECMO outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

This study aimed to analyze its influence on patient care and healthcare management in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nationwide survey of the German Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was performed. Individual questionnaires containing 10 questions for university as well as non-university hospitals and 15 questions for private practices (PPs) for OMFS were created to collect data for patient numbers and surgical procedures conducted, usage of personal protection equipment (PPE), SARS-CoV-2 tests, and economic aspects. RESULTS: Fifty-four hospitals and 240 PPs participated in the study. The reduction in ward capacities and number of surgical procedures ranged from 17 to 78%. PPE consisted of standard surgical masks (58% hospitals, 64% PPs) and FFP2/N95/KN95 respirators (45% hospitals, 48% PPs). Preoperative SARS-CoV-2 tests were more frequently performed in hospitals (34% vs 2%). At PPs, turnover for medical and dental procedures billed to the public insurance had reduced to 58.81% and 62.43%, respectively, of the corresponding values for 2019, and 58.75% of the PPs had applied for short-time allowances. CONCLUSION: With the exception of some elective procedures, primary patient care in OMFS has been assured during the pandemic. However, the immense economic burden on hospitals and PPs cannot be conclusively assessed at this point. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: For OMFS, the German healthcare system has shown the ability to adapt to emergency situations such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Adequate surgical capacities in OMFS are necessary even during pandemics.","Pabst, Andreas; Zeller, Alexander-N; Sader, Robert; Wiegner, Jörg-Ulf; Schneider, Matthias; Ehrenfeld, Michael; Hoffmann, Jürgen",Clin. oral investig,145,6

Here we examined the relationship between trait aggression as measured by Buss and Warren's Aggression Questionnaire and personality traits measured with Big Five Questionnaire-Children in 77 primary-school children, and recorded resting-state brain activity (fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, fALFF) and functional connectivity (rsFC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The present results showed that trait aggression was negatively correlated with agreeableness and positively correlated with neuroticism. The brain analyses showed that children with a higher propensity for aggression had a lower fALFF mainly in the left superior temporal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and left supramarginal gyrus. Physical and total aggression were negatively associated with rsFC between the right parahippocampal gyrus and the right putamen. Further analysis revealed that this rsFC could moderate the influence of neuroticism on total aggression. Moreover, the results suggest the presence of a sex difference in the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying aggression in middle childhood. Overall, our findings indicate that aggressive children have lower agreeableness and higher neuroticism, and the underlying neural systems are mainly implicated in social judgment and empathy.","Li, Qingqing; Xiao, Mingyue; Song, Shiqing; Huang, Yufei; Chen, Ximei; Liu, Yong; Chen, Hong",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,145,16

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Single institution across 3 hospital sites during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients who were intubated for respiratory wean tracheotomy underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasal, throat, and endotracheal tube swabs at the time of the procedure. These were assessed via quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. The tracheal tissue excised during the tracheotomy was cultured for SARS-CoV-2 with Vero E6 and Caco2 cells. Serum was assessed for antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 via neutralization assays. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in this study. The mean number of days intubated prior to undergoing surgical tracheotomy was 27.8. At the time of the surgical tracheotomy, PCR swab testing yielded 8 positive results, but none of the 35 individuals who underwent tissue culture were positive for SARS-CoV-2. All 18 patients who had serum sampling demonstrated neutralization antibodies, with a minimum titer of 1:80. CONCLUSION: In our series, irrespective of positive PCR swab, the likelihood of infectivity during tracheotomy remains low given negative tracheal tissue cultures. While our results do not undermine national and international guidance on tracheotomy after day 10 of intubation, given the length of time to procedure in our data, infectivity at 10 days cannot be excluded.

This case series study was conducted to determine the incidence rate and the course of Covid-19 infection in MS/NMOSD patients treated with Rituximab. METHODS: In this study, we designed a web-based questionnaire. Baseline information such as patient- reported walking disability, total number of Rituximab infusions received, delayed injections, occurrence of any relapse, and the use of corticosteroids during the pandemic were collected. Also, information regarding the Covid-19 pandemic such as adherence to self-isolation, any recent exposure to an infected individual and the presence of suggestive symptoms were collected. In case of positive test results, patients were grouped into 2 categories; mild to moderate and seriously ill and outcomes were evaluated as favorable (improved/ discharged) and unfavorable (expired). RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-eight patients with Multiple Sclerosis were enrolled in this study, 9 of the subjects (3.4%) were confirmed positive for Covid-19, five of which required hospitalizations (55.5%), two patients required ICU admission (22.2%) and 2 two patients died (22.2%). None of these patients ever mentioned using corticosteroids during the pandemic. In comparison to MS patients who were not receiving disease modifying therapy (DMT), our study indicated a higher incidence of Covid-19 infection, higher ratio of serious illness and a higher fatality ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab seems not to be safe enough during the pandemic.","Esmaeili, Sara; Abbasi, Mohammad Hossein; Abolmaali, Meysam; Mojtahed, Mohammad; Alavi, Seyedeh Niloufar Rafiei; Soleimani, Sevim; Mokhtari, Mahisa; Hatam, Jaber; Khotbehsara, Samaneh Tanhapour; Motamed, Mohammad Reza; Joghataei, Mohammad Taghi; Mirzaasgari, Zahra; Moghaddasi, Mehdi",BMC Neurol,145,1

COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease in elective and emergency admissions in the majority of neurosurgical centers. The main hypothesis was that fear of COVID-19 may have prevented patients with critical medical or surgical emergencies from actively presenting in emergency departments and outpatient clinics. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective, observational study searching our institutional data regarding the incidence of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and compare the admissions in two different periods: the pre COVID-19 with the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: The study cohort was comprised of a total of 99 patients. The mean (SD) weekly case rate of patients with SAH was 1.1 (1.1) during the pre-COVID-19 period, compared to 1.7 (1.4) during the COVID-19 period. Analysis revealed that the volume of admitted patients with SAH was 1.5-fold higher during the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period and this was statistically significant (ExpB = 1.5, CI 95% 1-2.3, p = 0.044). Difference in mortality did not reach any statistical significance between the two periods (p = 0.097), as well as patients' length of stay (p = 0.193). CONCLUSIONS: The presented data cover a more extended time period than so far published reports; it is reasonable that our recent experience may well be demonstrating a general realistic trend of overall increase in aneurysmal rupture rates during lockdown. Hospitalization of patients with SAH cannot afford any reductions in facilities, equipment, or personnel if optimum outcomes are desirable.","Theofanopoulos, Andreas; Fermeli, Dionysia; Boulieris, Spyros; Kalantzis, George; Kefalopoulou, Zinovia; Panagiotopoulos, Vasilios; Papadakos, Dimitrios; Constantoyannis, Constantine",Neurol Sci,145,24

We investigated the impact of a strict lockdown policy on the characteristics of neonatal and pediatric attendances to our pediatric emergency department (PED). The clinical features of PED visits in March-April 2020 (COVID-19) and March-April 2019 (non-COVID-19) were analyzed. During the COVID-19 lockdown period, visits reduced by 67%, from 3159 to 1039. Neonatal access decreased from 78 to 59, mainly due to fewer pathological conditions, with a complete disappearance of respiratory infections. On the other hand, minor neonatal clinical conditions rose from 44 (56.4%) to 48 (81.4%), mostly due to feeding-related issues. Communicable diseases, particularly respiratory infections and gastroenteritis, dropped from 1552 (49.1%) to 288 (27.7%). Accident-related visits also decreased during COVID-19, from 535 (16.9%) to 309 (29.7%), becoming the most common cause of PED access. Hospital admissions reduced from 266 to 109, while PICU (pediatric intensive care unit) admissions decreased from 27 to 11, with a comparable rate of 10.1% in both periods. The lockdown due to COVID-19 had a substantial impact on our PED visits, which markedly decreased, mainly due to fewer respiratory infections. Unexpectedly, neonatal visits for minor conditions did not decline, but rather slightly increased. Among the children admitted to the PICU, none had respiratory disease.","Silvagni, D.; Baggio, L.; Lo Tartaro Meragliotta, P.; Soloni, P.; La Fauci, G.; Bovo, C.; Ielo, S.; Biban, P.",Pediatric Reports,145,16

This study aimed to assess epidemiological and intergenerational clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients associated with cluster outbreaks to provide valuable data for the prevention and control of COVID-19. METHODS: We identified the first employee with COVID-19 at a supermarket and screened the close contacts of this index patient. Confirmed cases were divided into two groups according to the generation (first generation comprising supermarket employees [group A] and second or third generations comprising family members or friends of the supermarket employees [group B]). The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the two groups were retrospectively compared. RESULTS: A total of 8437 people were screened, and 24 COVID-19 patients were identified. Seven patients (29.2%) were asymptomatic; three patients were responsible for six symptomatic cases. The interval from the confirmation of the first case to symptom onset in symptomatic patients was 5-11 days. The clinical manifestations of symptomatic patients upon admission were non-specific. All patients (including the seven asymptomatic patients) were admitted based on chest computed tomography features indicative of pneumonia. There were 11 cases in group A (first generation) and 13 cases in group B (second generation, 11 cases; third generation, 2 cases), with no significant differences in clinical and epidemiological characteristics between the two groups, except for sex, duration from symptom onset to hospitalization, and underlying disease (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For cluster outbreaks, it is important to comprehensively screen close the contacts of the index patient. Special attention should be paid to asymptomatic cases. The clinical management of cluster patients is similar to that of other COVID-19 patients.","Tian, Suochen; Wu, Min; Chang, Zhenqin; Wang, Yunxia; Zhou, Guijie; Zhang, Wenming; Xing, Junmin; Tian, Hui; Zhang, Xihong; Zou, Xiuli; Zhang, Lina; Liu, Mingxin; Chen, Juan; Han, Jian; Ning, Kang; Chen, Shuangfeng; Wu, Tiejun",BMC Public Health,145,24

We surveyed a sample of people during September 2020: a group of the general population without a history of any chronic medical problems, people with epilepsy, people with diabetes mellitus (DM), and people with cardiac problems. The survey included four general questions and two COVID-19 specific questions [contracting COVID-19, relatives with COVID-19]. Furthermore, the survey included the DASS (Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale)-21 questionnaire. 487 people were surveyed (154 people with epilepsy, 127 patients with DM, 98 people with cardiac problems, and 108 healthy individuals). Among people without a history of any chronic medical illnesses, 14% had any psychological problems. The highest rates of depression and anxiety were observed among patients with DM (52% and 57%, respectively), and the highest rate of increased stress was observed among people with cardiac problems (40%). The existence of any underlying medical problem was significantly associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and stress among the participants.

Immunocompromised patients, older adults, and postoperative patients are at greater risk for VAP. With the dynamic changes in the empirical world, updated evidence must be used to guide the standard of practice. This literature review assimilates the recent evidence for VAP prevention. METHOD: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis framework guided the selection of the included research articles. Medline, EBSCO host, CINAHL, UpToDate and Google Scholar databases explored, for relevant publications between 2010 and 2020. The quality of evidence for the 14 studies selected were rated using the hierarchy of quantitative research designs. RESULTS: Evidence-based VAP preventive strategies are prevention of aspiration, minimizing ventilator days, reducing the pathogen load, safe endotracheal suction practices, and pharmaceutical preventive measures. The mandates for VAP preventive measures among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is included. CONCLUSION: Though some of these themes identify with the past, the nuances in their implementation are highlights of this review. The review reiterates the need to revisit ambiguous practices implemented for VAP prevention.

Lock-downs and visitor restrictions that were meant to protect older adults created an isolation that often led to declining health. Ageist stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination are internalized by older adults as they face being devalued and viewed as a burden.

Behaviours, such as hand hygiene, screening and cohorting of patients, and the appropriate use of antibiotics have long been recommended in surgery, but their implementation has often been patchy. METHODS: The current crisis presents an opportunity to learn about how to improve infection prevention and control and surveillance (IPCS) behaviours. The improvements made were mainly informal, quick and stemming from the frontline rather than originating from formal organizational structures. The adaptations made and the expertise acquired have the potential for triggering deeper learning and to create enduring improvements in the routine identification and management of infections relating to surgery. RESULTS: This paper aims to illustrate how adopting a human factors and ergonomics perspective can provide insights into how clinical work systems have been adapted and reconfigured in order to keep patients and staff safe. CONCLUSION: For achieving sustainable change in IPCS practices in surgery during COVID-19 and beyond we need to enhance organizational learning potentials.","Toccafondi, Giulio; Di Marzo, Francesco; Sartelli, Massimo; Sujan, Mark; Smyth, Molly; Bowie, Paul; Cardi, Martina; Cardi, Maurizio",Int J Qual Health Care,145,8

In a race to contain the infection, researchers and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with COVID-19. To help laboratories decide what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered. Here we validated a modified version of the CDC assay and used it as a reference to evaluate the performance of the NeuMoDxTM SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin SimplexaTM Covid-19 Direct assays. In silico analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primers/probes designed by the CDC were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD of 200 copies/mL. The performance of the three assays were analyzed using 159 nasopharyngeal swabs specimen tested within 1-5 days after routine testing. A 100 % agreement was observed between the commercial assays and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. A deeper look at the Ct values showed no significant difference between NeuMoDx and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, whereas DiaSorin had lower overall Ct values than the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. NeuMoDx and DiaSorin workflows were much easier to perform. NeuMoDx has the highest throughput and shortest TAT, whereas although the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay has comparable throughput to DiaSorin, it has the longest hands-on time and highest TAT.","Lima, Amorce; Healer, Vicki; Vendrone, Elaine; Silbert, Suzane",J Clin Virol,145,20

ENT & Skull base surgeons need to do several aerosol generating procedures (AGP). Most of the endoscopic and microscopic ENT & skull base surgery are AGP; like-mastoid surgery, sinus surgery, surgery of pituitary, tympanomastoid paraganglioma, temporal bone malignancy, tracheostomy etc. All of we know, COVID negative by RT-PCR test is not always COVID negative. In COVID-19 pandemic-routine, even cancer surgeries are avoided or postponed for the sake of safety of HCPs. Moreover, in case of surgical emergency there's no way to refuse a patient for not having a report of COVID test. We thought about neutralizing or destroying the novel coronavirus from it's route of entry zone, as well as preventing aerosol to be transmitted in the air of OT. We designed a novel approach, i.e. 'POLIDON' (POLIDON = Polythene + Povidone Iodine), which can be the solution for these patients as well as surgeons or HCPs of above mentioned specialties. Use of Povidone Iodine as mouthwash and nasal spray or irrigation for both patient and HCPs prior to surgery is proposed. Then, use of simple polythene as barrier drape of patient or operative area for prevention of spread of aerosol in OT during surgery is the other component. With the POLIDON' approach-all these ENT & skull base surgeries can be done with more safety and confidence.","Arefin, Mostafa Kamal; Arafat, Muhammad Shaharior; Talukder, Debesh Chandra; Rumi, Sk Nurul Fattah; Islam, Md Nazmul; Rahman, Sheikh Hasanur; Tarafder, Kamrul Hassan; Islam, Md Ashraful",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,145,24

It is not important in which sector it operates, whether it is a private or public one, but profits and safety are two elements every enterprise is not able to function without. The low performance of these two measures can cause a number of difficulties for managers. To avoid this, leading companies, especially the smallest ones, should optimize the trade credit management policy. Most often, SMEs' (small and medium-sized enterprises) owners try to work together as part of a group purchasing organization, which positively affects trade credit management. The aim of the paper is to present the trade credit management strategy in Polish group purchasing organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study uses data on the construction sector because it is one of the most important segments of the Polish economy, which is financed to a large extent with trade credit. The paper indicates the mechanisms whose applications allowed SMEs operating in purchasing groups to change trade credit management strategies in such a way that these units could operate calmly and safely in the market. These changes could be observed in purchasing goods with a large reserve, strictly controlling all receivables, switching to cash sales or limiting sales on long-term trade credit. The analysis showed that enterprises changed trade credit management strategies from moderately conservative to highly conservative.","Zimon, Grzegorz; Dankiewicz, Robert",Sustainability,145,16

Its initial emergence in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) not only highlighted the vulnerability of its patients and residents, but also the limited clinical support that led to national headlines. Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic heightened the need for improved collaboration among healthcare organizations and local and state public health. METHODS: The University of Washington Medicine's (UWM's) Post-Acute Care (PAC) Network developed and implemented a three-phase approach within its pre-existing network of SNFs to help slow the spread of the disease, support local area SNFs from becoming overwhelmed when inundated with COVID-19 cases or persons under investigation, and help decrease the burden on area hospitals, clinics, and emergency medical services. RESULTS: Support of local area SNFs consisted of the following phases that were implemented at various times as COVID-19 impacted each facility at different times. Initial Phase: This phase was designed to (1) optimize communication, (2) review infection control practices, and (3) create a centralized process to track and test the target population. Delayed Phase: The goals of the Delayed Phase were to slow the spread of the disease once it is present in the SNF by providing consistent education and reinforcing infection prevention and control practices to all staff. Surge Phase: This phase aimed to prepare facilities in response to an outbreak by deploying a ""Drop Team"" within 24 hours to the facility to expeditiously test patients and exposed employees, triage symptomatic patients, and coordinate care and supplies with local public health authorities. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 Three-Phase Response Plan provides a standardized model of care that may be implemented by other health systems and SNFs to help prepare and respond to COVID-19.

Immune protection will most likely be mediated by antibodies that bind to the viral entry protein, spike (S). Here, we used Phage-DMS, an approach that comprehensively interrogates the effect of all possible mutations on binding to a protein of interest, to define the profile of antibody escape to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein using coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma. Antibody binding was common in two regions, the fusion peptide and the linker region upstream of the heptad repeat region 2. However, escape mutations were variable within these immunodominant regions. There was also individual variation in less commonly targeted epitopes. This study provides a granular view of potential antibody escape pathways and suggests there will be individual variation in antibody-mediated virus evolution.","Garrett, Meghan E; Galloway, Jared; Chu, Helen Y; Itell, Hannah L; Stoddard, Caitlin I; Wolf, Caitlin R; Logue, Jennifer K; McDonald, Dylan; Weight, Haidyn; Matsen, Frederick A; Overbaugh, Julie",Cell,145,16

However, the question to whether continue or withdraw metformin therapy in COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus remains contentious. This study aims to investigate the association between metformin and poor COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: Eligible studies published up to 21 October 2020 were included and appraised for validity, importance, and applicability. The included studies were further ranked according to the level of evidence (LOE). Results: Nine studies were included for further assessments, of which seven studies stated that metformin was not associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes (LOE II-V), while the other two with poorer designs stated otherwise (LOE V). Although metformin may increase the risk of developing acidosis and lactic acidosis (LOE IV), the observed risks were more accentuated in patients with severe COVID-19 disease or kidney impairment and in patients with > 2 daily metformin doses. Interestingly, one study revealed that metformin may even yield therapeutic role in reducing the risk of COVID-19 mortality (LOE II), although further studies are required to confirm these findings. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that metformin may be safely continued in COVID-19 patients. The benefit of metformin therapy with simultaneous continuous monitoring of COVID-19 severity and kidney function may outweigh the risks of lactic acidosis, of which incidence is relatively rare.

DESIGN: Multicenter observational study. SETTING: Fifteen PICUs across the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to United Kingdom PICUs with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 between March 14, 2020, and May 20, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Deidentified data collected as part of routine clinical care were analyzed. All children were diagnosed and staged for acute kidney injury based on the level of serum creatinine above the upper limit of reference interval values according to published guidance. Severe acute kidney injury was defined as stage 2/3 acute kidney injury. Uni- and multivariable analyses were performed to study the association between demographic data, clinical features, markers of inflammation and cardiac injury, and severe acute kidney injury. Over the study period, 116 patients with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 were admitted to 15 United Kingdom PICUs. Any-stage acute kidney injury occurred in 48 of 116 patients (41.4%) and severe acute kidney injury in 32 of 116 (27.6%) patients, which was mostly evident at admission (24/32, 75%). In univariable analysis, body mass index, hyperferritinemia, high C-reactive protein, Pediatric Index of Mortality 3 score, vasoactive medication, and invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with severe acute kidney injury. In multivariable logistic regression, hyperferritinemia was associated with severe acute kidney injury (compared with nonsevere acute kidney injury; adjusted odds ratio 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; p = 0.04). Severe acute kidney injury was associated with longer PICU stay (median 5 days [interquartile range, 4-7 d] vs 3 days [interquartile range, 1.5-5 d]; p < 0.001) and increased duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (median 4 days [interquartile range, 2-6 d] vs 2 days [interquartile range, 1-3 d]; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Severe acute kidney injury occurred in just over a quarter of children admitted to United Kingdom PICUs with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Hyperferritinemia was significantly associated with severe acute kidney injury. Severe acute kidney injury was associated with increased duration of stay and ventilation. Although short-term outcomes for acute kidney injury in pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 appear good, long-term outcomes are unknown.","Deep, Akash; Upadhyay, Gaurang; du Pré, Pascale; Lillie, Jon; Pan, Daniel; Mudalige, Nadeesha; Kanthimathinathan, Hari Krishnan; Johnson, Mae; Riphagen, Shelley; Dwarakanathan, Buvana; Raffaj, Dusan; Sundararajan, Santosh; Davies, Patrick; Mohammad, Zoha; Shetty, Nayan; Playfor, Stephen; Jardine, Michelle; Ross, Oliver; Levin, Richard; Waters, Gareth; Sinha, Ruchi; Scholefield, Barnaby R; Boot, Elizabeth; Koul, Ashwani; Freire-Gomez, Xabier; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan",Crit Care Med,145,23

Risks of hospitalization, including significant functional decline, are important considerations when deciding whether to treat a resident in the nursing home or transfer to a hospital. Little is known about postdischarge functional status, relative to baseline, of nursing home residents hospitalized for pneumonia. We sought to determine the risk of severe functional limitation or death for nursing home residents following hospitalization for treatment of pneumonia. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants included Medicare enrollees aged &#8805;65 years, hospitalized from a nursing home in the United States between 2013 and 2014 for pneumonia. METHODS: Activities of daily living (ADL), patient sociodemographics, and comorbidities were obtained from the Minimum Data Set (MDS), an assessment tool completed for all nursing home residents. MDS assessments from prior to and following hospitalization were compared to assess for functional decline. Following hospital discharge, all patients were evaluated for a composite outcome of severe disability (&#8805;4 ADL limitations) following hospitalization or death prior to completion of a postdischarge MDS. RESULTS: In 2013 and 2014, a total of 241,804 nursing home residents were hospitalized for pneumonia, of whom 89.9% (192,736) experienced the composite outcome of severe disability or death following hospitalization for pneumonia. Although we found that prehospitalization functional and cognitive status were associated with developing the composite outcome, 53% of residents with no prehospitalization ADL limitation, and 82% with no cognitive limitation experienced the outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Hospitalization for treatment of pneumonia is associated with significant risk of functional decline and death among nursing home residents, even those with minimal deficits prior to hospitalization. Nursing homes need to prepare for these outcomes in both advance care planning and in rehabilitation efforts.","Griffith, Matthew F; Levy, Cari R; Parikh, Toral J; Stevens-Lapsley, Jennifer E; Eber, Leslie B; Palat, Sing-I T; Gozalo, Pedro L; Teno, Joan M",J Am Med Dir Assoc,145,8

Two criteria, prior fall history and gait and balance abnormalities, were applied either independently or sequentially in 19 CPG fall risk screening algorithms. Fall risk assessment components were more varied across CPGs but commonly included: detailed fall history; detailed evaluation of gait, balance, and/or mobility; medication review; vision; and environmental hazards assessment. Despite these similarities, more work is needed to streamline assessment approaches for heterogeneous and complex older adult populations across the care continuum.

In June 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warnings about methanol or 1-propanol contaminated brands of hand sanitizer. Exposure to methanol, including dermally, can cause kidney damage, blindness and death. Exposure to 1-propanol can cause severe acidosis and death. Chronic exposure may be more likely due to increased hand sanitizer use in 2020. METHODS: We used generic codes for ABHS to characterize exposures reported to the Texas Poison Control Network in 2019 and 2020. For 2020 cases, we also used case narratives to identify cases considered COVID-19 -related and cases where the caller reported exposure to unknown ABHS with safety concerns, specifically identified brands on the FDA warning list or before that warning was made in June 2020. RESULTS: Reported exposures to ABHS increased 72.5% between 2019 and 2020. In 2020, 10% of the cases were COVID-19 -related. COVID-19 -related cases in 2020 were likely to be older, to have a lower portion of young children exposed and to report chronic use of hand sanitizer. Similar trends were reported among cases who reported possible exposures to potentially unsafe ABHS products, including products on the FDA list. Most exposures were not referred for medical attention, and no deaths were reported among the Texas cases. DISCUSSION: Callers reporting exposures to ABHS related to use prompted by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) and specific exposure to unsafe products differ from the traditional callers in being older, reporting chronic use and in healthcare facility (HCF) referral. The 72.5% increase in 2020 calls compared to 2019 cases differ from typical exposures, which often involve young children. Changes in manufacturing processes by additional manufacturers have produced potential exposure to toxic alcohol-containing products and others in Texas.","Phillips, Todd; Schulte, Joann M; Smith, Eric Anthony; Roth, Brett; Kleinschmidt, Kurt C",Clin Toxicol (Phila),145,21

We aimed to analyze outcomes associated with obesity in a large cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study at a tertiary care health system of adult patients with COVID-19 who were admitted between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Patients were stratified by body mass index (BMI) into obese (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m 2) and non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m 2) cohorts. Primary outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, and 30-day readmission. RESULTS: A total of 1983 patients were included of whom 1031 (51.9%) had obesity and 952 (48.9%) did not have obesity. Patients with obesity were younger (P < 0.001), more likely to be female (P < 0.001) and African American (P < 0.001) compared to patients without obesity. Multivariable logistic models adjusting for differences in age, sex, race, medical comorbidities, and treatment modalities revealed no difference in 60-day mortality and 30-day readmission between obese and non-obese groups. In these models, patients with obesity had increased odds of ICU admission (adjusted OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-1.76; P = 0.012) and intubation (adjusted OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.04-1.80; P = 0.026).

As part of the effort to control transmission in the United States, many businesses either closed or instituted nonpharmaceutical control measures and allowed only essential workers on-site. During summer and fall of 2020, employers began formulating ""return to work"" strategies designed to mitigate the risk of transmission among employees. On a population level, several countries implemented national testing and surveillance strategies that proved effective in mitigating citizen-to-citizen transmission and contributed to suppressing COVID-19. A crucial component of many such strategies is population-based testing to identify and engage individuals with asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection, which also is relevant to return-to-work strategies. The authors describe an approach that multisite employers might use to help mitigate transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace. This approach leverages a bioinformatics platform informed by real-time PCR test data at the county and subcounty (eg, Public Use Microdata Area) level, allowing for population-based testing to be selectively targeted for employees in geographies with elevated SARS-CoV-2 positivity. A ""Command Center"" application integrates data from multiple sources (eg, local infection trends, employee symptom diaries, Bluetooth thermometers) in real time, which can be used to inform decisions regarding surveillance and employee self-isolation or quarantine; a mobile phone-based application provides for rapid, secure communication with employees. This overview is based on peer-reviewed literature and the early experience of a large employer with implementing bioinformatics tools to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the workplace.","Plantes, Peter J; Fragala, Maren S; Clarke, Charles; Goldberg, Zachary N; Radcliff, Jeff; Goldberg, Steven E",Popul Health Manag,145,32

One of the most dangerous consequences of the prothrombotic imbalance is the increased incidence of micro- and macrothrombotic phenomena, especially deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). METHODS: We investigated the correlation between radiological and clinical-biochemical characteristics in a cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: PE was confirmed in 14/61 (23%) patients, five (35.7%) had DVT. The radiographic findings, quantified by Qanadli score calculated on CT angiography, correlated with the clinical score and biochemical markers. The ratio between the right and left ventricle diameter measured at CT angiography correlated with the length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: In our cohort radiological parameters showed a significant correlation with clinical prognostic indices and scores, thus suggesting that a multidisciplinary approach is advisable in the evaluation of PE in COVID-19 patients.","Wu, Maddalena Alessandra; Colombo, Riccardo; Arquati, Massimo; Ippolito, Sonia; Taino, Alba; Ruggiero, Diego; Tonelli, Francesca; Trombetta, Lucia; Facchinetti, Pietro; Glielmo, Pierluigi; Cogliati, Chiara; Flor, Nicola",Int J Clin Pract,145,20

The rapid spread of COVID-19 necessitates the development of cost-effective technology platforms for the production of vaccines, drugs, and protein reagents for appropriate disease diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we explored the possibility of producing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and an anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibody (mAb) CR3022 in Nicotiana benthamiana. Both RBD and mAb CR3022 were transiently produced with the highest expression level of 8 µg/g and 130 µg/g leaf fresh weight respectively at 3 days post-infiltration. The plant-produced RBD exhibited specific binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Our findings highlight that male reproductive tissues could be targeted by SARS-CoV-2, particularly the testis since it co-expresses the receptor (ACE2) and the protease (TMPRSS) needed for viral entry. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection could have repercussions on the fertility status of male individuals Potential infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in reproductive tissues should be considered in reproductive medicine and management of in vitro fertilization in present and future generations.","Zupin, Luisa; Pascolo, Lorella; Zito, Gabriella; Ricci, Giuseppe; Crovella, Sergio",J Assist Reprod Genet,145,24

AIMS: To evaluate the risk factors and clinical outcomes associated with LI in a large inpatient cohort of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Adult patients with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 30, 2020, were included. LI was defined as peak levels of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase that were 3 times the ULN or peak levels in alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin that were 2 times the ULN. Mild elevation in liver enzymes (MEL) was defined as abnormal peak liver enzyme levels lower than the threshold for LI. Patients with MEL and LI were compared to a control group comprising patients with normal liver enzymes throughout hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 1935 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 1031 (53.2%) had MEL and 396 (20.5%) had LI. Compared to control patients, MEL and LI groups contained proportionately more men. Patients in the MEL cohort were older compared to control, and African-Americans were more highly represented in the LI group. Patients with LI had an increased risk of mortality (relative risk [RR] 4.26), intensive care unit admission (RR, 5.52), intubation (RR, 11.01), 30-day readmission (RR, 1.81), length of hospitalization, and intensive care unit stay (10.49 and 10.06 days, respectively) compared to control. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that patients with COVID-19 who presented with LI had a significantly increased risk of mortality and poor clinical outcomes.","Siddiqui, Mohammad Arsalan; Suresh, Suraj; Simmer, Stephen; Abu-Ghanimeh, Mouhanna; Karrick, Megan; Nimri, Faisal; Musleh, Maher; Mediratta, Vivek; Al-Shammari, Mustafa; Russell, Sarah; Jou, Jessica; Dang, Duyen; Salgia, Reena; Zuchelli, Tobias",Dig. dis. sci,145,17

I use the model to evaluate the effects of isolating symptomatic individuals, of increasing social distancing and of tests such as polymerase chain reaction - PCR - or Rapid Diagnostic Test that discriminate between currently infected agents, and its combination with a serology test like Neutralization Assay that is able to discriminate between immune and vulnerable healthy individuals, together with the role of enforcement to prevent interactions involving infected but asymptomatic agents. I find that isolating symptomatic individuals has a large effect at delaying and reducing the pick of infections. The combination of this policy with a PCR test is likely to represents only a negligible improvement in the absence of enforcement, whereas with full enforcement there is an additional delaying and reduction in the pick of infections. Social distancing alone cannot achieve similar effects without incurring in enormous output losses. I explore the combined effect of social distancing at early stages of the epidemic with a following period of tests and find that the best outcome is obtained with a light reduction of human interaction for about three months together with a subsequent test of the population over 40 days. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021.","Obiols-Homs, F.",B.E.

Such apps can now be downloaded in many countries, but as second waves of COVID-19 are raging, these apps are playing a less important role than anticipated. We argue that this is because most countries have opted for app configurations that cannot provide a means of rapidly informing users of likely infections while avoiding too many false positive reports. Mathematical modelling suggests that differently configured apps have the potential to do this. These require, however, that some pseudonymised data be stored on a central server, which privacy advocates have cautioned against. We contend that their influential arguments are subject to two fallacies. First, they have tended to one-sidedly focus on the risks that centralised data storage entails for privacy, while paying insufficient attention to the fact that inefficient contact tracing involves ethical risks too. Second, while the envisioned system does entail risks of breaches, such risks are also present in decentralised systems, which have been falsely presented as 'privacy preserving by design'. When these points are understood, it becomes clear that we must rethink our approach to digital contact tracing in our fight against COVID-19.","White, Lucie; van Basshuysen, Philippe",J. med. ethics,145,20

In his influential book published in 1971, Minimal Brain Dysfunction in Children, Wender3 reviewed historical accounts of the 1918 pandemic and suggested that viral infection had selective brain effects on catecholamine nuclei, and behavioral sequelae in some children emerged and overlapped with symptoms that now define attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and behavioral sequelae emerged in some adults that overlapped with symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Based on this and several excitotoxic models of behavioral disorders (ie, Volpe, Altman, Amsel, Benveniste, and Lou) related to arterial architecture and patterns of blood flow to the brain, previously our group4 proposed etiologic subtypes of ADHD based on a dopamine-deficit hypothesis and assumption that dopamine neurons might be particularly sensitive to a variety of environmental insults. We speculate that residual effects of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may selectively affect brain regions underlying attention and motivation deficits associated with ADHD, as documented by positron emission tomography imaging studies of adults (see Volkow et al.5), which could increase risk for an infection-triggered etiologic subtype of ADHD.","Swanson, James M; Volkow, Nora D",J.

We propose a model that directly relates a pathogen's evolution to its spatial contagion dynamics -- effectively combining the two epidemiological paradigms of phylogenetic inference and self-exciting process modeling -- and apply this \emph{phylogenetic Hawkes process} to a Bayesian analysis of 23,422 viral cases from the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The proposed model is able to detect individual viruses with significantly elevated rates of spatiotemporal propagation for a subset of 1,610 samples that provide genome data. Finally, to facilitate model application in big data settings, we develop massively parallel implementations for the gradient and Hessian of the log-likelihood and apply our high performance computing framework within an adaptively preconditioned Hamiltonian Monte Carlo routine.","Holbrook, Andrew J.; Ji, Xiang; Suchard, Marc A.",,145,5

We evaluated the change in case volume for interventional radiology (IR), gastroenterology (GI), and surgery (OR) during the lockdown period (LDP) for COVID-19 at a tertiary care hospital in New York State. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of the surgical procedures performed at a New York State tertiary care center during the LDP was performed. Comparison was made between LDP time period from March 15, 2020, to May 17, 2020 (LDP COVID), the 9-weeks immediately prior to LDP January 12, 2020, to March 15, 2020 (2020 pre-COVID), and the same time period in 2019 (2019 non-COVID), was performed. A univariable analysis was conducted for all IR procedures with specific attention paid to a subset of emergent procedures with overlap between the 3 specialties (percutaneous abscess drainage, gastrostomy, nephrostomy and cholecystectomy tube placement vs. percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and cystoscopy stent placements). P values were calculated with a two-sample t-test. Statistical significance threshold was set at 5%. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. Results: A total of 2105 IR procedures (LDP COVID: 551;2020 pre-COVID: 721;2019 non-COVID: 833) were included. During LDP COVID, case volume decreased by 23.6% (P &lt; 0.023) and 33.9% (P &lt; 0.117) when compared with 2020 pre-COVID and 2019 non-COVID, respectively, these were not statistically significant. Specifically examining the subgroup of emergent IR procedures, there was a 41.7% (188 vs. 322, P &lt; 0.064) and 38.0% (188 vs. 303 P &lt; 0.045) decrease from the LDP compared to 2020 pre-COVID and 2019 non-COVID time intervals, respectively. For other procedural specialties, there was a 62.1% (113 vs. 298, P &lt; 0.066) and 65.3% (113 vs. 326 P &lt; 0.041) decrease in cases performed when compared to 2020 pre-COVID and 2019 non-COVID. Conclusions: The census of our hospital during the height of the pandemic was over 40% COVID positive patients. This led to drastic changes to the schedule and workflow of patients. Volume in procedural specialties decreased as a result of the COVID pandemic. Non-IR specialties experienced a more prominent decrease in procedural volume during the LDP when compared to similar times before the pandemic. This is in stark contrast to IR, which did not see a statistically significant drop in the total amount of procedures performed due to the large volume of minimally invasive procedures performed in critically ill in-patients.","Perez, I.; Shen, B.; Patel, M.; Berry-Tony, S.; Rice, S.; Rambhia, S.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,145,5

The results, based on a difference in difference (DID) estimation, suggest a significant additional increase in the volatility of stocks with a higher degree of sensitivity to EPU after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Moreover, this effect is most pronounced for consumer, less-profitable, and high leverage stocks. Further multi-period analyses indicate that the impact of EPU associated with pandemic takes effect at the time of lockdown announcement and persist for a short-term trend.","Yang, Jianlei Yang Chunpeng",Pacific-Basin Finance Journal,145,13

The aims of this multicenter retrospective cohort study were to disentangle the association of BMI and associated metabolic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, current smoking) in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study enrolled patients admitted in intensive care for COVID-19, in 21 centers (Europe, Israel, USA) between 02/19/2020 and 05/19/2020. Primary and secondary outcomes were the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,461 patients were enrolled, median(IQR) age was 64 years (40.9-72.0); 73.2% males; BMI 28.1 kg/m2 (25.4-32.3); 1,080 patients (73.9%) required IMV; the 28-day mortality estimate was 36.1% (95%CI, 33.0-39.5). Adjusted mixed logistic regression model showed a significant linear relation between BMI and IMV: OR 1.27 (95%CI, 1.12-1.45) per 5 kg/m2 . Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model showed a significant association between BMI and mortality, which was only increased in obesity class III (&#8805;40 kg/m2 ) (HR 1.68 (95%CI 1.06-2.64). CONCLUSION: In critically ill COVID-19 patients, we observed a linear association between BMI and the need for IMV, independent of other metabolic risk factors, and a non-linear association between BMI and mortality risk.

The incidence and characteristics of neurological complications are unclear. For this reason, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) core COVID-19 Task Force initiated a survey on neurological symptoms observed in patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A 17-question online survey was made available on the EAN website and distributed to EAN members and other worldwide physicians starting on 9 April 2020. RESULTS: By 27 April 2020, proper data were collected from 2343 responders (out of 4199), of whom 82.0% were neurologists, mostly from Europe. Most responders (74.7%) consulted patients with COVID-19 mainly in emergency rooms and in COVID-19 units. The majority (67.0%) had evaluated fewer than 10 patients with neurological manifestations of COVID-19 (neuro COVID-19). The most frequently reported neurological findings were headache (61.9%), myalgia (50.4%), anosmia (49.2%), ageusia (39.8%), impaired consciousness (29.3%) and psychomotor agitation (26.7%). Encephalopathy and acute cerebrovascular disorders were reported at 21.0%. Neurological manifestations were generally interpreted as being possibly related to COVID-19; they were most commonly recognized in patients with multiple general symptoms and occurred at any time during infection. CONCLUSION: Neurologists are currently and actively involved in the management of neurological issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey justifies setting up a prospective registry to better capture the prevalence of patients with neuro COVID-19, neurological disease characteristics and the contribution of neurological manifestations to outcome.","Moro, E; Priori, A; Beghi, E; Helbok, R; Campiglio, L; Bassetti, C L; Bianchi, E; Maia, L F; Ozturk, S; Cavallieri, F; Zedde, M; Sellner, J; Bereczki, D; Rakusa, M; Di Liberto, G; Sauerbier, A; Pisani, A; Macerollo, A; Soffietti, R; Taba, P; Crean, M; Twardzik, A; Oreja-Guevara, C; Bodini, B; Jenkins, T M; von Oertzen, T J",Eur. j. neurol,145,30

Methods: A total of 164 patients confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively enrolled from 6 hospitals. All patients were divided into the mild type (136 cases) and the severe type (28 cases) according to their clinical manifestations. The total CT severity score and quantitative CT features were calculated by AI pneumonia detection and evaluation system with correction by radiologists. The clinical and CT imaging features of different types were analyzed. Results: It was observed that patients in the severe type group were older than the mild type group. Round lesions, Fan-shaped lesions, crazy-paving pattern, fibrosis, ""white lung"", pleural thickening, pleural indentation, mediastinal lymphadenectasis were more common in the CT images of severe patients than in the mild ones. A higher total lung severity score and scores of each lobe were observed in the severe group, with higher scores in bilateral lower lobes of both groups. Further analysis showed that the volume and number of pneumonia lesions and consolidation lesions in overall lung were higher in the severe group, and showed a wider distribution in the lower lobes of bilateral lung in both groups. Conclusions: Chest CT of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia showed more consolidative and progressive lesions. With the assistance of AI, CT could evaluate the clinical severity of COVID-19 pneumonia more precisely and help the early diagnosis and surveillance of the patients.","Hu, Xiaofei; Zeng, Wenbing; Zhang, Yuhan; Zhen, Zhiming; Zheng, Yalan; Cheng, Lin; Wang, Xianqi; Luo, Haoran; Zhang, Shu; Wu, Zifeng; Sun, Zeyu; Li, Xiuli; Cao, Yang; Xu, Ming; Wang, Jian; Chen, Wei",J Thorac Dis,145,24

Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common among African American (AA) communities, where the COVID-19 infection rate is three-fold higher, and the mortality rate nearly six-fold higher, compared with rates in predominantly white communities. COVID-19 infection primarily affects the lungs and airways. Previous reports have linked 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency with subclinical interstitial lung disease. AA are at risk for lower cellular glutathione (GSH) levels, and GSH deficiency epigenetically impairs VD biosynthesis pathway genes. Compared with vitamin D alone, co-supplementation of vitamin D and L-cysteine (a GSH precursor) showed a better efficacy in improving levels of GSH and VD-regulatory genes at the cellular/tissue level, increasing 25(OH) vitamin D levels, and reducing inflammation biomarkers in the blood in mice studies. We propose that randomized clinical trials are needed to examine the potential of co-supplementation with anti-inflammatory antioxidants, vitamin D and L-cysteine in correcting the 25(OH)VD deficiency and preventing the 'cytokine storm,' one of the most severe consequences of infection with COVID-19, thereby preventing the adverse clinical effects of COVID-19 infection in the vulnerable AA population.","Jain, Sushil K; Parsanathan, Rajesh",J Am Coll Nutr,145,1

Currently, there are no targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease, and effective treatment options remain very limited. Here we describe the results of a programme that aimed to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, by combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening. This programme focused on identifying drug leads that target main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2: Mpro is a key enzyme of coronaviruses and has a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for SARS-CoV-25,6. We identified a mechanism-based inhibitor (N3) by computer-aided drug design, and then determined the crystal structure of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with this compound. Through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed more than 10,000 compounds-including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials and other pharmacologically active compounds-as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these compounds inhibited Mpro, showing half-maximal inhibitory concentration values that ranged from 0.67 to 21.4 µM. One of these compounds (ebselen) also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no specific drugs or vaccines are available.","Jin, Zhenming; Du, Xiaoyu; Xu, Yechun; Deng, Yongqiang; Liu, Meiqin; Zhao, Yao; Zhang, Bing; Li, Xiaofeng; Zhang, Leike; Peng, Chao; Duan, Yinkai; Yu, Jing; Wang, Lin; Yang, Kailin; Liu, Fengjiang; Jiang, Rendi; Yang, Xinglou; You, Tian; Liu, Xiaoce; Yang, Xiuna; Bai, Fang; Liu, Hong; Liu, Xiang; Guddat, Luke W; Xu, Wenqing; Xiao, Gengfu; Qin, Chengfeng; Shi, Zhengli; Jiang, Hualiang; Rao, Zihe; Yang, Haitao",Nature,145,16

Existing studies typically examine whether mobility in specific localities increases or decreases at specific points in time and relate these changes to certain pandemic and policy events. In this paper, we study mobility change in the US through a five-step process using mobility footprint data. (Step 1) Propose the delta Time Spent in Public Places (Delta-TSPP) as a measure to quantify daily changes in mobility for each US county from 2019-2020. (Step 2) Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the Delta-TSPP time series of each county to lower-dimensional latent components of change in mobility. (Step 3) Conduct clustering analysis to find counties that exhibit similar latent components. (Step 4) Investigate local and global spatial autocorrelation for each component. (Step 5) Conduct correlation analysis to investigate how various population characteristics and behavior correlate with mobility patterns. Results show that by describing each county as a linear combination of the three latent components, we can explain 59% of the variation in mobility trends across all US counties. Specifically, change in mobility in 2020 for US counties can be explained as a combination of three latent components: 1) long-term reduction in mobility, 2) no change in mobility, and 3) short-term reduction in mobility. We observe significant correlations between the three latent components of mobility change and various population characteristics, including political leaning, population, COVID-19 cases and deaths, and unemployment. We find that our analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of mobility change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Elarde, Justin; Kim, Joon-Seok; Kavak, Hamdi; Zufle, Andreas; Anderson, Taylor",,145,13

Simulation training may enhance skills, but simulators must be accurate enough for trainees to engage in a realistic way-for example, detection of excessive injection pressure. The soft-embalmed Thiel cadaver is a life-like, durable simulator that is used for dedicated practice and mastery learning training in regional anesthesia. We hypothesized that injection opening pressure in perineural tissue, at epineurium and in subepineurium were similar to opening pressures measured in experimental animals, fresh frozen cadavers, glycol soft-fix cadavers and patients. METHODS: We systematically reviewed historical data, then conducted three validation studies delivering a 0.5 mL hydrolocation bolus of embalming fluid and recording injection pressure. First, we delivered the bolus at 12 mL/min at epimysium, perineural tissue, epineurium and in subepineurium at 48 peripheral nerve sites on three cadavers. Second, we delivered the bolus at using three infusion rates: 1 mL/min, 6 mL/min and 12 mL/min on epineurium at 70 peripheral nerve sites on five cadavers. Third, we repeated three injections (12 mL/min) at 24 epineural sites over the median and sciatic nerves of three cadavers. RESULTS: Mean (95%) injection pressure was greater at epineurium compared with subepineurium (geometric ratio 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9 to 1.6)), p=0.04, and perineural tissue (geometric ratio 5.1 (95% CI: 3.7 to 7.0)), p<0.0001.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the population pharmacokinetics of darunavir in SARS-CoV-2 patients compared with HIV patients. METHODS: Two separate models were created by means of a nonlinear mixed-effect approach. The influence of clinical covariates on each basic model was tested and the association of significant covariates with darunavir parameters was assessed at multivariate regression and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses. Monte Carlo simulation assessed the influence of covariates on the darunavir concentration versus time profile. RESULTS: A one-compartment model well-described darunavir concentrations in both groups. In SARS-CoV-2 patients (n = 30), interleukin (IL)-6 and body surface area were covariates associated with darunavir oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (Vd), respectively; no covariates were identified in HIV patients (n = 25). Darunavir CL/F was significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients compared with HIV patients (4.1 vs. 10.3 L/h; p < 0.001). CART analysis found that an IL-6 level of 18 pg/mL may split the SARS-CoV-2 population in patients with low versus high darunavir CL/F (mean ± standard deviation 3.47 ± 1.90 vs. 8.03 ± 3.24 L/h; proportion of reduction in error = 0.46). Median (interquartile range) darunavir CL/F was significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients with IL-6 levels &#8805; 18 pg/mL than in SARS-CoV-2 patients with IL-6 levels < 18 pg/mL or HIV patients (2.78 [2.16-4.47] vs. 7.24 [5.88-10.38] vs. 9.75 [8.45-13.79] L/h, respectively; p < 0.0001). Increasing IL-6 levels affected darunavir concentration versus time simulated profiles. We hypothesized that increases in IL-6 levels associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 disease may downregulate the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated metabolism of darunavir. CONCLUSIONS: This is a proof-of-concept of SARS-CoV-2 disease-drug interactions, and may support the need for optimal dose selection of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients.","Cojutti, Pier Giorgio; Londero, Angela; Della Siega, Paola; Givone, Filippo; Fabris, Martina; Biasizzo, Jessica; Tascini, Carlo; Pea, Federico",Clin Pharmacokinet,145,23

The visits began between 21:00 and 21:15, and finished by 00:00. Each tree was visited simultaneously by up to three bats. Visits lasted on average 8 minutes, with intervals about 20 to 25 minutes. Depending on the position of the leaves, two approaching strategies were used by the bats. Many leaves still connected to tree branches exhibited several bite marks, suggesting that the bats consumed small fragments of leaves and that a leaf could receive more than one visit. Discarded leaf pellets were found beneath a day roost, indicating the use of the liquid portion of the leaves. Aspects of foraging schedule and seasonality of leaf consumption by bats are discussed.","Estefano D. Bobrowiec, Paulo; Matos Cunha, Ramon",Chiropt. neotrop.,145,16

The disease was first detected in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, in December 2019 and has since spread globally, especially to Europe and North America, resulting in the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic disaster of 2019-2020. Although most cases have mild symptoms, there is some progression to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure and death. More than 4.6 million cases have been registered across 216 countries and territories as of 19 April 2020, resulting in more than 311,000 deaths. Risk to communities with continued widespread disease transmission depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people; the severity of resulting illness; and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccines or medications that can treat the illness) and the relative success of these. In the absence of vaccines or medications, non-pharmaceutical interventions were the most important response strategy based on community interventions such as person-to-person distancing, mask-wearing, isolation and good personal hygiene (hand-washing)-all of which have been demonstrated can reduce the impact of this seemingly unstoppable globally spreading natural disaster. This paper presents the results of quantitative research regarding the level of citizen preparedness for disasters caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Serbia. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire that was requested and then collected online among 975 respondents during disaster in April 2020. The questionnaire examined citizens' basic socio-economic and demographic characteristics, their knowledge, preparedness, risk perception and preventive measures taken individually and as a community to prevent the death and widespread transmission of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in the Republic of Serbia. Based on the findings that there are major differences in the public's perception of risks posed by communicable disease threats such as presented by COVID-19, emergency management agencies should use these differences to develop targeted strategies to enhance community and national preparedness by promoting behavioral change and improving risk management decision-making.","Cvetkovic, Vladimir M; Nikolic, Neda; Radovanovic Nenadic, Una; Öcal, Adem; K Noji, Eric; Zecevic, Miodrag",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),145,26

Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel anti-infective materials with broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic activity. In the present study, a fluorinated polycationic coating was synthesized on a hydrophilic and negatively charged polyester textile via one-step initiated chemical vapor deposition of poly(dimethyl amino methyl styrene-co-1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl acrylate) (P(DMAMS-co-PFDA), PDP). The surface characterization results of SEM, FTIR, and EDX demonstrated the successful synthesis of PDP coating. Contact angle analysis revealed that PDP coating endowed the polyester textile with the hydrophobicity against the attachment of different aqueous foulants such as blood, coffee, and milk, as well as the oleophobicity against paraffin oil. Zeta potential analysis demonstrated that the PDP coating enabled a transformation of negative charge to positive charge on the surface of polyester textile. The PDP coating exhibited excellent contact-killing activity against both gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with the killing efficiency of approximate 99.9%. In addition, the antiviral capacity of PDP was determined by a green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression-based method using lentivirus-EGFP as a virus model. The PDP coating inactivated the negatively charged lentivirus-EGFP effectively. Moreover, the coating showed good biocompatibility toward mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. All the above properties demonstrated that PDP would be a promising anti-pathogenic polymeric coating with wide applications in medicine, hygiene, hospital, etc., to control the bacterial and viral transmission and infection.","Song, Qing; Zhao, Ruixiang; Liu, Tong; Gao, Lingling; Su, Cuicui; Ye, Yumin; Chan, Siew Yin; Liu, Xinyue; Wang, Ke; Li, Peng; Huang, Wei",Chem Eng J,145,1

Mucosal immunity, particularly salivary antibodies, may be short-lived although long-term studies are lacking. METHODS: Using a multiplex bead-based array platform, we investigated antibodies specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins in 256 saliva samples from convalescent patients 1-9 months after symptomatic COVID-19 (n=74, Cohort 1), undiagnosed individuals with self-reported questionnaires (n=147, Cohort 2), and individuals sampled pre-pandemic time (n= 35, Cohort 3). RESULTS: Salivary IgG antibody responses in Cohort 1 (mainly mild COVID-19) were detectable up to nine months post-recovery, with high correlations between spike and nucleocapsid specificity. At nine months, IgG remained in both blood and saliva in majority of patients. Salivary IgA was rarely detected at this timepoint. In Cohort 2, salivary IgG and IgA responses were significantly associated with a recent history of COVID-19 like symptoms. Salivary IgG also tolerated temperature and detergent pre-treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA that appeared short-lived, the specific IgG in saliva appeared stable even after mild COVID-19 as noted for blood serology. This non-invasive saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 antibody test with home self-collection may therefore serve as a complementary alternative to conventional blood serology.","Alkharaan, Hassan; Bayati, Shaghayegh; Hellström, Cecilia; Aleman, Soo; Olsson, Annika; Lindahl, Karin; Bogdanovic, Gordana; Healy, Katie; Tsilingaridis, Georgios; De Palma, Patricia; Hober, Sophia; Månberg, Anna; Nilsson, Peter; Pin, Elisa; Sällberg Chen, Margaret",J. infect. dis,145,20

However, as effective treatments for this disease are still unclear, safe and efficient therapies are urgently needed. Qingfei Paidu decoction (QPD)3 is strongly recommended in the Chinese Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Provisional 6th Edition). However, clinical research data on the effects of QPD on COVID-19 are scarce. Our study aimed to explore the effects of combined treatment with QPD and Western medicine on COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, 63 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed. During the first 14 days of hospitalization, patients with deteriorating symptoms were administered QPD along with Western medicine therapy (the antiviral medicine selected from interferon, lopinavir, or arbidol). The clinical characteristics and blood laboratory indices (blood routine, inflammatory factors, and multi-organ biochemical indices) were examined, and the total lung severity scores were evaluated in each patient by reviewing chest computed tomography before treatment and at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Before QPD treatment, the combined treatment group showed higher blood C-reactive protein levels and more severe pulmonary inflammation and clinical symptoms than the Western medicine treatment group. Both groups met the discharge criteria after a similar length of hospitalization. At the end of treatment, circulating white blood cells, total lymphocyte count, and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase levels improved dramatically in both groups (Pâ¯<â¯ 0.05). In contrast, C-reactive protein, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-myocardial band, lactate dehydrogenase, and blood urea nitrogen levels were improved only in the combined treatment group (Pâ¯<â¯ 0.05), and C-reactive protein and creatine kinase were the most pronounced (Pâ¯<â¯ 0.01). Compared with baseline, at the end of treatment, the proportion of patients with normal values of C-reactive protein, total lymphocyte count, and lactate dehydrogenase were increased in the combined treatment group (P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference was observed in the Western medicine treatment group (Pâ¯>â¯ 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of QPD with Western medicine demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects compared with those of only Western medicine in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19; however, neither mortality nor length of hospitalization was affected.

We designed a research with the objective of finding the frequency of respiratory viruses, particularly WU and KI polyomaviruses (WUPyV & KIPyV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human parechovirus (HPeV) in hospitalized children who were influenza negative. Materials and Methods: Throat swabs were collected from children younger than 5 years who have been hospitalized for SARI and screened for WUPyV, KIPyV, HCoVs, HRSV and HPeV using Real time PCR. Results: A viral pathogen was identified in 23 (11.16%) of 206 hospitalized children with SARI. The rate of virus detection was considerably greater in infants &lt;12 months (78.2%) than in older children (21.8%). The most frequently detected viruses were HCoVs with 7.76% of positive cases followed by KIPyV (2%) and WUPyV (1.5%). No HPeV and HRSV were detected in this study. Conclusion: This research shown respiratory viruses as causes of childhood acute respiratory infections, while as most of mentioned viruses usually causes mild respiratory diseases, their frequency might be higher in outpatient children. Mean-while as HRSV is really sensitive to inactivation due to environmental situations and its genome maybe degraded, then for future studies, we need to use fresh samples for HRSV detection.

This multimorbid and frail population requires attention and a personalized comprehensive assessment in order to avoid the occurrence of adverse outcomes. As other diseases, the COVID-19 presentation in older patients is often atypical with less severe and unspecific symptoms. These subjects both at home and during hospitalization suffer isolation and the lack of support of caregivers. The geriatric care in COVID-19 wards is often missing. The application of additional instruments would be necessary to facilitate and personalize the clinical approach, not only based on diseases but also on functional status. This narrative review starts from diagnostic evaluation, continues with adapted pharmacologic treatment and ends with the recovery phase targeting the nutrition and physical exercise. We developed a check-list of respiratory, gastro-intestinal and other less-specific symptoms, summarized in a table and easily to be filled-up by patients, nurses and general practitioners. As second step, we reported the clinical phases of this disease. Far to be considered just viral infective and respiratory, this disease is also an inflammatory and thrombotic condition with frequent bacterial over-infection. We finally considered timing and selection of treatment, which depend on the disease phase, co-administration of other drugs and require the monitoring of renal, liver and cardiac function.

ObjectiveWe developed and validated a fit-for-purpose, disease-specific instrument to assess symptoms in patients with COVID-19 to inform endpoints in an interventional trial for non-hospitalized patients. DesignThe initial drafting of the 23-item Symptoms Evolution of COVID-19 (SE-C19) Instrument was developed based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention symptom list and available published literature specific to patients with COVID-19 as of Spring 2020. The measurement principles in the Food and Drug Administration patient-reported outcomes guidance and the four methodological Patient-Focused Drug Development Guidances were also considered. SettingInterviews were conducted virtually with patients recruited through a healthcare research firm. ParticipantsSemi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 30 non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 InterventionInterviews involved two stages: (1) concept elicitation, to obtain information about the symptoms experienced as a result of COVID-19 in patients own words, and (2) cognitive debriefing, for patients to describe their understanding of the SE-C19 instructions, specific symptoms, response options, and recall period to ensure the content of the SE-C19 is relevant and comprehensive. Five clinicians treating COVID-19 outpatients were interviewed to obtain their insights on symptoms experienced by patients and provide input on the SE-C19. Main Outcome and MeasurePatients reported no issues regarding the relevance or appropriateness of the SE-C19 instructions, including the recall period. The comprehensiveness of the SE-C19 was confirmed against the conceptual model developed in the qualitative research. Minor conceptual gaps were revealed to capture nuances in the experience of nasal and gustatory symptoms, and systemic manifestations of sickness. Almost all items were endorsed by patients as being appropriate and well understood. The clinicians largely approved all items, response options, and recall period. Conclusions and RelevanceThe qualitative research provided supportive evidence of the content validity of the SE-C19 instrument to assess the symptoms of outpatients with COVID-19 and its use in clinical trials to evaluate the benefit of treatment.

The reported anthraquinone derivatives were retrieved from an open-source database and filtered based on a positive druglikeness score. Compounds with positive druglikeness scores were predicted for their targets using DIGEP-Pred and the interaction among modulated proteins was evaluated using STRING. Further, the associated pathways were recorded concerning the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database. Finally, the docking was performed using autodock4 to identify the binding efficacy of anthraquinone derivatives with 3C-like protease, papain-like protease, and spike protein.

We introduce ASMODEE (automatic selection of models and outlier detection for epidemics), a new tool for detecting sudden changes in COVID-19 incidence. Our approach relies on automatically selecting the best (fitting or predicting) model from a range of user-defined time series models, excluding the most recent data points, to characterize the main trend in an incidence. We then derive prediction intervals and classify data points outside this interval as outliers, which provides an objective criterion for identifying departures from previous trends. We also provide a method for selecting the optimal breakpoints, used to define how many recent data points are to be excluded from the trend fitting procedure. The analysis of simulated COVID-19 outbreaks suggests ASMODEE compares favourably with a state-of-art outbreak-detection algorithm while being simpler and more flexible. As such, our method could be of wider use for infectious disease surveillance. We illustrate ASMODEE using publicly available data of National Health Service (NHS) Pathways reporting potential COVID-19 cases in England at a fine spatial scale, showing that the method would have enabled the early detection of the flare-ups in Leicester and Blackburn with Darwen, two to three weeks before their respective lockdown.

The simplest invertible iterated map, exponential growth and decay, emerges from country-wide histograms whenever Tchebychev's inequality is satisfied to within several decimal places. This is one point. Another is that failed covid-19 pandemic model predictions have been reported repeatedly by the news media. Model predictions fail because the observed infection rates are beyond modeling: any model that uses fixed rates or uses memory or averages of past rates cannot reproduce the data on active infections. When those possibilities are ruled out, then little is left. Under lockdown and social distancing, the rates unfold daily in small but unforeseeable steps, they are algorithmically complex. We can, however, use two days in the daily data, today and any single day in the past (generally yesterday), to make a useful forecast of future infections. No model provides results better than this simple forecast. We analyze the actual doubling times for covid-19 data and compare them with our predicted doubling times. Flattening and peaking are precisely defined. We identify and study the separate effects of social distancing vs recoveries in the daily infection rates. Social distancing can only cause flattening but recoveries are required in order for the active infections to peak and decay. Three models and their predictions are analyzed.

In the present study, we conducted a literature review about the potential infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in different biological tissues and the influence of various tissue processing and sterilization procedures on viral inactivation. The search revealed that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor to penetrate human cells. These receptors are present in skin cells, musculoskeletal tissue, amniotic membranes, cardiovascular tissue and ocular tissues, including the cornea. In general, we found that coronaviruses are stable at low temperatures, and inactivated upon exposure to extreme heat and pH.

We describe COVID-19 testing and positivity proportions in 6 large geographically and demographically diverse cohorts of PWH and PWOH. Methods: The Corona-Infectious-Virus Epidemiology Team (CIVET) is comprised of five COVID-19 clinical cohorts within a health system (Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA;Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States, Rockville, MD;University of North Carolina Health, Chapel Hill, NC;Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN;Veterans Aging Cohort Study) and one established classical HIV cohort (MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study). Each participating cohort is restricted to individuals who were alive and “in-cohort” in 2020 (definitions of which were operationalized to fit the structure of each cohort). We calculated the percentage of patients in-cohort who were COVID-19 tested, and the proportion COVID-19 positive monthly, by HIV status, from March 1 to August 31, 2020. We report findings from the classical cohort separately because results are based on self-reported information. Results: In the 5 clinical cohorts, PWH ranged from N=2,515 to 31,040, and N=77,019 to 3,710,360 PWOH. Over the 6 month study period, the percentage of PWH who were tested for COVID-19 (13.5%-21.2%) was slightly higher than PWOH (10.8%-14.3%) in each of the cohorts (p-values in each cohort &lt;0.001). However, among those tested, the percentage of patients with positive COVID-19 tests was similar regardless of HIV status (Figure). In the classical cohort that contributed self-reported testing and positive information (PWH N=2,222;PWOH N=1,417), the proportion tested was similar by HIV status (PWH 38.1% vs. PWOH 37.4%), but PWH had a greater positivity proportion (9.0%) compared with PWOH (5.3%, p-value=0.012). Conclusion: Although PWH had higher testing rates compared with PWOH, we did not find evidence of increased positivity among those tested in 5 clinical cohorts with large diverse populations across the US. We will continue to monitor testing, positivity, and COVID-19 related health outcomes in PWH and PWOH using our multiple data sources and leveraging the expertise of established longitudinal cohort studies in the CIVETS collaboration.","Park, L.

However, success on this strategy depends not only on the timing of its implementation, but also on the relaxation measures adopted within each community. We developed a mathematical model to evaluate the impacts of the lockdown implemented in Hermosillo, Mexico. We compared this intervention with some hypothetical ones, varying the starting date and also the population proportion that is released, breaking the confinement. A Monte Carlo study was performed by considering three scenarios to define our baseline dynamics. Results showed that a hypothetical delay of two weeks, on the lockdown measures, would result in an early acme around May 9 for hospitalization prevalence and an increase on cumulative deaths, 42 times higher by May 31, when compared to baseline. On the other hand, results concerning relaxation dynamics showed that the acme levels depend on the proportion of people who gets back to daily activities as well as the individual behavior with respect to prevention measures. Analysis regarding different relaxing mitigation measures were provided to the Sonoran Health Ministry, as requested. It is important to stress that, according to information provided by health authorities, the acme occurring time was closed to the one given by our model. Hence, we considered that our model resulted useful for the decision-making assessment, and that an extension of it can be used for the study of a potential second wave.","Tocto-Erazo, Mayra R; Espíndola-Zepeda, Jorge A; Montoya-Laos, José A; Acuña-Zegarra, Manuel A; Olmos-Liceaga, Daniel; Reyes-Castro, Pablo A; Figueroa-Preciado, Gudelia",PLoS One,145,24

Using a theoretical framework informed by legitimacy theory, the authors predict the strategies used by FSC. The study applied qualitative document analysis method and examined archival data such as scholarly articles, newspaper articles, and annual reports' data for the periods covering from 2014 to 2018. The means of triangulation was challenging as interviews with the relevant participants were not possible due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns. The findings of the study highlight that FSC has strategically utilized its existence and continuation to emphasize the economic and social dislocation its closure will create to the people of Fiji who depend on the sugar industry for their livelihood. This strategy has enabled FSC to receive Government's continued support together with the unachievable promises that FSC is making all these years which is to improve its financial performances. The findings also suggest that FSC has smartly accepted its operational failures but has manipulated the cause of the failures beyond its control. The study contributes to the academic discussion on the strategies that an organization can adopt to maintain its legitimacy and continuation.","Azam, M. R.; Nandan, R.

METHODS: A prospective study was conducted of 40 consecutive patients presenting with epistaxis referred to our tertiary otolaryngology unit. A group of 40 age-matched controls were also included. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Symptoms of fever, cough and anosmia were noted in the study group. RESULTS: The mean age was 66.5 ± 22.4 years in the study group. There were 22 males (55 per cent) and 18 females (45 per cent). The mean age in the control group was 66.3 ± 22.4 years (p = 0.935). There were six positive cases for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (15 per cent) in the epistaxis group and one case (2.5 per cent) in the control group.

Incidence and severity of COVID-19 are higher in the elderly population (65 years and older). This may be due to higher frequency of comorbidities, but increased frailty and immunosenescence linked with aging may also contribute. Moreover, in elderly individuals, SARS-CoV-2 may adopt different molecular strategies to strongly impact on cardiac aging that culminate in exacerbating a pro-inflammatory state (cytokine storm activation), which, in turn, may lead to pulmonary vascular endothelialitis, microangiopathy, diffuse thrombosis, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and acute coronary syndromes. All these events are particularly relevant in elderly patients, and deserve targeted cardiovascular treatments and specific management of repurposed drugs against COVID-19.

Autopsy revealed firm, consolidated lungs or lobar pneumonia. Histology of the lungs showed changes of diffuse alveolar damage with fibrin membrane formation, thickened alveolar walls and interstitium with lymphocytic infiltrate, and type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia with shedding into the alveolar space. This series is the first in the world to describe autopsy findings in individuals dying suddenly in the community, not previously known to have COVID-19 infection, and the first autopsy series in the UK. During a time when testing in the UK is currently primarily offered to patients in hospital or symptomatic key workers, with limited testing available in community settings, it highlights the importance of testing for COVID-19 at autopsy. Two deaths occurred in care homes where a diagnosis of COVID-19 allowed the health protection team to provide support in that 'closed setting' to reduce the risks of onward transmission.

Background: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, strict infection control measures were in force in long-term residential care in Germany that burdened staff and isolated residents socially. Both are considered risk factors for violence in long-term residential care. Questions: How does violence develop in nursing homes under pandemic conditions from the point of view of managers and how do strategies for preventing violence change? Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with staff in 43 nursing homes: 25 with service managers, 15 with nurse managers, 28 with nursing team leaders and 10 with registered nurses with extended tasks. The interviews were recorded as audio, transcribed and analysed in five steps following the ""Thematic Framework Analysis"". Results: The infection control measures were partly perceived as deprivation of freedom. Residents, relatives and staff partly reacted most with verbal violence. Nevertheless, the issue of violence was not a major concern for management and preventive measures were not carried out.

METHODS: Prospectively collected data were extracted for adults with COVID-19 undergoing percutaneous or open tracheostomy between April 4 and June 2, 2020 at a major medical center in New York City. The primary endpoint was weaning from mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes included sedation weaning, decannulation, and discharge. RESULTS: 101 patients underwent tracheostomy, including 48 percutaneous (48%) and 53 open (52%), after a median intubation time of 24 days (IQR 20, 31). The most common complication was minor bleeding (n = 18, 18%). The all-cause mortality rate was 15% and no deaths were attributable to the tracheostomy. Eighty-three patients (82%) were weaned off mechanical ventilation, 88 patients (87%) were weaned off sedation, and 72 patients (71%) were decannulated. Censored median times from tracheostomy to sedation and ventilator weaning were 8 (95% CI 6-11) and 18 (95% CI 14-22) days, respectively (uncensored: 7 and 15 days). Median time from tracheostomy to decannulation was 36 (95% CI 32-47) days (uncensored: 32 days). Of those decannulated, 82% were decannulated during their index admission. There were no differences in outcomes or complication rates between percutaneous and open tracheostomy. Likelihood of discharge from the ICU was inversely related to intubation time, though the clinical relevance of this was small (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.943-0.998; p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Tracheostomy by either percutaneous or open technique facilitated sedation and ventilator weaning in patients with COVID-19 after prolonged intubation. Additional study on the optimal timing of tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 is warranted. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 This article is protected by copyright.

Currently, viable therapeutic options that are cost effective, safe and readily available are desired, but lacking. Nevertheless, the pandemic is noticeably of lesser burden in African and Asian regions, where the use of traditional herbs predominates, with such relationship warranting a closer look at ethnomedicine. From a molecular viewpoint, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the crucial first phase of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Here, we review plants with medicinal properties which may be implicated in mitigation of viral invasion either via direct or indirect modulation of ACE2 activity to ameliorate COVID-19. Selected ethnomedicinal plants containing bioactive compounds which may prevent and mitigate the fusion and entry of the SARS-CoV-2 by modulating ACE2-associated up and downstream events are highlighted. Through further experimentation, these plants could be supported for ethnobotanical use and the phytomedicinal ligands could be potentially developed into single or combined preventive therapeutics for COVID-19. This will benefit researchers actively looking for solutions from plant bioresources and help lessen the burden of COVID-19 across the globe.","Abubakar, M.

SHOULD I GET VACCINATED?: It is recommended to receive a booster after SARS-CoV-2 infection with a mRNA vaccine. IS A COVID-19 VACCINATION DESPITE ONGOING IMMUNOSUPPRESSION POSSIBLE?: Patients receiving immunosuppression have a reduced humoral response, and this is especially observed when anti-CD20 therapy is used. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT THE VACCINE PROVOKES REJECTION OF MY TRANSPLANTED KIDNEY OR RELAPSE OF MY GLOMERULAR DISEASE?: Several reports were published in the last months highlighting new-onset diseases, recurrences and relapses of different glomerular diseases, which occurred after the receipt of the first or second vaccine dose. As a clear association of vaccines and induction of autoimmunity still needs to be established, most of these diseases are treatable, and COVID-19 in patients under immunosuppression is often fatal, there is a clear net benefit of vaccination. DO I HAVE A PERMANENT PROTECTION AFTER VACCINATION?: The antibody titers and likely the cellular immune response is significantly reduced in patients with kidney diseases, and titers are reducing at a fast pace under ongoing immunosuppression. A booster dose should be considered, especially taking into consideration the evolvement of virus variants and their impact on vaccine efficacy. AFTER THE FIRST SERIES OF VACCINATION, NO OR ONLY A MARGINAL AMOUNT OF ANTIBODIES WERE DETECTABLE. ARE THERE STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE VACCINE RESPONSE?: Many countries recommend the application of a third dose for vulnerable patient cohorts, especially because of a weakened response and their risk to develop a severe disease course of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values of the Rivalta test for FIP and to identify correlations between a positive Rivalta test and variables measured in effusion fluid and peripheral blood. METHODS: In this retrospective study, medical records of cats with effusions were reviewed, and cats with conclusive results for the Rivalta test were included. The prevalence of FIP in this population was determined, and sensitivity, specificity, and PPV and NPV of the Rivalta test were calculated. Variables measured in effusion fluid and peripheral blood were compared between cats that had positive or negative Rivalta tests using the Mann–Whitney U‐test and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of 851 cats with effusions, 782 had conclusively positive or negative results for the Rivalta test. A definitive final diagnosis was made in 497 of these cats. Prevalence of FIP in cats with effusion and a conclusive Rivalta test result was 34.6%. The Rivalta test had a sensitivity of 91.3%, specificity of 65.5%, PPV of 58.4%, and NPV of 93.4% for the diagnosis of FIP. These values increased when cats with lymphoma or bacterial infections were excluded, or when only cats ≤ 2 years were considered. Increased effusion cholesterol concentration and specific gravity as well as decreased serum albumin:globulin ratio and hyperbilirubinemia were positively correlated with positive Rivalta test results. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of the Rivalta test for the diagnosis of FIP were lower than previously reported except when used in young cats. The components in effusions that lead to a positive Rivalta test remain unknown, but the positivity is not simply related to high total protein concentration.","Fischer, Yvonne; Sauter‐Louis, Carola; Hartmann, Katrin",Vet Clin Pathol,145,20

In a pilot clinical trial, T1D, but not latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA), exhibited lower blood sugars after multidose BCG. Using a glucose transport assay, monocytes from T1D subjects showed a large stimulation index with BCG exposures; LADA subjects showed minimal BCG-induced sugar responsiveness. Monocytes from T1D, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and non-diabetic controls (NDC) were all responsive in vitro to BCG by augmented sugar utilization. Adults with prior neonatal BCG vaccination show accelerated glucose transport decades later. Finally, in vivo experiments with the NOD mouse (a T1D model) and obese db/db mice (a T2D model) confirm BCG's blood-sugar-lowering and accelerated glucose metabolism with sufficient dosing. Our results suggest that BCG's benefits for glucose metabolism may be broadly applicable to T1D and T2D, but less to LADA.","Shpilsky, Gabriella F.; Takahashi, Hiroyuki; Aristarkhova, Anna; Weil, Michele; Ng, Nathan; Nelson, Kacie J.; Lee, Amanda; Zheng, Hui; Kühtreiber, Willem M.; Faustman, Denise L.",iScience,145,24

We aimed to quantify the dynamic changes of lung and pneumonia on three-dimensional CT (3D-CT) images in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients during hospitalization. Methods: A total of 110 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who underwent chest CT from January 3 to February 29, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Pneumonia lesions were classified as four stages: early, progressive, peak, and absorption stages on chest CT. A computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system calculated the total lung volume (TLV), the percentage of low attenuation areas (LAA%), the volume of pneumonia, the volume of ground-glass opacities (GGO), the volume of consolidation plus the GGO/consolidation ratio. The CT score was visually assessed by radiologists. Comparisons of lung and pneumonia parameters among the four stages were performed by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc tests. The relationship between the CT score and the volume of pneumonia, and between LAA% and the volume of pneumonia in four stages was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation analysis. Results: A total of 534 chest CT scans were performed with a median interval of 4 days. TLV, LAA%, and the GGO/consolidation ratio were significantly decreased, while the volume of pneumonia, GGO, and consolidation were significantly increased in the progressive and peak stages (for all, P < 0.05). The CT score was significantly correlated with the pneumonia volume in the four stages (r = 0.731, 0.761, 0.715, and 0.669, respectively, P < 0.001). Conclusion: 3D-CT could be used as a useful quantification method in monitoring the dynamic changes of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Chen, Qiuying; Chen, Lv; Liu, Shuyi; Chen, Luyan; Li, Minmin; Chen, Zhuozhi; You, Jingjing; Zhang, Bin; Zhang, Shuixing",Front Med (Lausanne),145,24

However, recent approvals in tissue-agnostic indications may also benefit other NMSCs including cutaneous adnexal solid tumors with high tumor mutation burdens or microsatellite instability. Furthermore, while FDA-approved indications will likely continue to expand, continued studies are needed to support the role of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and refractory settings. SUMMARY: Immunotherapy is emerging as the standard of care for several advanced NMSCs not amenable to surgery and radiation.

Cognitive tests have an ubiquitous place in both of these topics, i.e., the important fields of cognitive ageing and cognitive epidemiology, respectively. The cognitive tests that have sprouted in these fields are often brief and not mainstream, large psychometric test batteries; I refer to them as ‘irregulars’. These two problems are not separate, because results found with mental/cognitive/intelligence tests have produced a growing understanding that intelligence and health have a reciprocal, life-long relationship.

The virus exists in a wide variety of genetically distinct viral types, and both phylogenetic analysis and measures of pairwise similarity among nucleotide or amino acid sequences have been used to classify IBV strains. However, there is currently no consensus on the method by which IBV sequences should be compared, and heterogeneous genetic group designations that are inconsistent with phylogenetic history have been adopted, leading to the confusing coexistence of multiple genotyping schemes. Herein, we propose a simple and repeatable phylogeny-based classification system combined with an unambiguous and rationale lineage nomenclature for the assignment of IBV strains. By using complete nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene we determined the phylogenetic structure of IBV, which in turn allowed us to define 6 genotypes that together comprise 32 distinct viral lineages and a number of inter-lineage recombinants. Because of extensive rate variation among IBVs, we suggest that the inference of phylogenetic relationships alone represents a more appropriate criterion for sequence classification than pairwise sequence comparisons. The adoption of an internationally accepted viral nomenclature is crucial for future studies of IBV epidemiology and evolution, and the classification scheme presented here can be updated and revised novel S1 sequences should become available.","Valastro, Viviana; Holmes, Edward C.; Britton, Paul; Fusaro, Alice; Jackwood, Mark W.; Cattoli, Giovanni; Monne, Isabella",Infect Genet Evol,145,12

We also discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic has generated further opportunities for future collaborations that could benefit both programs. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created new needs, such as real-time data and access to personnel important to both programs, such as information technologists and infectious diseases specialists. It has also increased concerns about rising rates of antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections, both of which overlap significantly and are key focus areas for both ASPs and IPPs. These emergent issues have highlighted the need for enhanced program infrastructure and new team models. The shift towards telecommunication and telework has facilitated the creation of enhanced infrastructures for collaboration on activities ranging from data access and reporting to providing telehealth services to remote hospitals.

COVID-19 often causes asymptomatic or mild disease in children; however, delayed routine childhood immunization is a concern, as it could increase the risk of vaccine-preventable disease. No study has evaluated the status of childhood vaccinations in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study evaluated the number of vaccine doses administered to children in 4 Japanese cities (2 cities in the Tokyo metropolitan area and 2 cities far from Tokyo) during the period from 2016 to 2020. Vaccine doses administered between January and September 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared, by month, with those given during 2016–2019. Age-stratified demographic data were collected to determine whether factors other than change in the child population over time affected vaccination trends. RESULTS: In all cities the decrease in vaccine doses administered was most apparent in March and April 2020, i.e., just before or coincident with the declaration of a nationwide COVID-19 emergency on April 7, 2020. The decrease started as early as February in the Tokyo metropolitan area. As child age increased, the decrease became more apparent. Before the lift of national emergency on May 25, catch-up of the vaccination was observed in all age groups in all cities. Vaccine doses persistently increased in older age groups but not in infants. The overall vaccination trends did not differ significantly among the 4 cities. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected routine childhood immunization in Japan. Thus, a nationwide electronic surveillance system and announcements for guardians to encourage timely routine immunization are warranted.","Aizawa, Yuta; Katsuta, Tomohiro; Sakiyama, Hiroshi; Tanaka-Taya, Keiko; Moriuchi, Hiroyuki; Saitoh, Akihiko",Vaccine,145,32

Although empirical research has demonstrated that these resources have promise, the available evidence for their benefit in women requires further investigation. Evidence supports the capacity of interventions that are sex-, gender-, and trauma-informed to improve treatment access and outcomes and to reduce health system challenges and disparities. Indeed, both sex- and gender-specific approaches are critical to improve health and gender equity. Violence and trauma are frequent among those with substance use concerns, but they disproportionately affect those who identify as female or women, further underscoring the need for trauma-informed care as well. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the evidence supporting the efficacy or effectiveness of online or mobile interventions for risky or harmful substance use in adults who identify as female or women, or who report a history of trauma. METHODS: This scoping review is based on an academic search in MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL, as well as a grey literature search in US and Canadian government and funding agency websites. Of the 7807 records identified, 465 remained following title and abstract screening. Of these, 159 met all eligibility criteria and were reviewed and synthesized. RESULTS: The 159 records reflected 141 distinct studies and 125 distinct interventions. Investigations and the interventions evaluated predominantly focused on alcohol use or general substance use. Evaluated digital health resources included multisession and brief-session interventions, with a wide range of therapeutic elements. Multisession online and mobile interventions exhibited beneficial effects in 86.1% (105/122) of studies. Single-session interventions similarly demonstrated beneficial effects in 64.2% (43/67) of study conditions.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to 2 new RICUs built specifically in our institution to face the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, from April 1 until May 30, 2020. RESULTS: During this period, 106 COVID-19 patients were admitted to these 2 RICUs, 65 of them (61%) transferred from an ICU (step-down) and 41 (39%) from the ward or emergency room (step-up). Most of them (72%) were male and mean age was 66 ± 12 years. 31% of them required support with oxygen therapy via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and 14% non-invasive ventilation (NIV). 42 of the 65 patients stepping down (65%) had a previous tracheostomy performed and most of them (74%) were successfully decannulated during their stay in the RICU.

RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty‐three doctors of median age 27 (IQR: 25‐30) were included with the majority (56.8%, n = 422) being male. Two‐thirds of doctors were in a training post (66.5%, n = 494), 52.9% (n = 393) in a surgical specialty and 53.0% (n = 394) in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Sixty‐nine point two percent (n = 514) reported an overall perceived negative impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on their training. A significant decline was noted amongst non‐virtual teaching methods such as face‐to‐face lectures, tutorials, ward‐based teaching, theatre sessions, conferences, simulation sessions and morbidity and mortality meetings (P ≤ .05). Low or middle‐income country doctors’ training was associated with perceived inadequate supervision while performing invasive procedures under general, local or regional anaesthetic. (P ≤ .05). CONCLUSION: In addition to the detrimental impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on healthcare infrastructure, this international survey reports a widespread perceived overall negative impact on medical and surgical doctors’ training globally. Ongoing adaptation and innovation will be required to enhance the approach to doctors’ training and learning in order to ultimately improve patient care.","Laloo, Ryan; Santhosh Karri, Rama; Wanigasooriya, Kasun; Beedham, William; Darr, Adnan; Layton, Georgia R; Logan, Peter; Tan, Yanyu; Mittapalli, Devender; Patel, Tapan; Mishra, Vivaswan Dutt; Odeh, Osama Faleh; Prakash, Swathi; Elnoamany, Salma; Peddinti, Sri Ramya; Daketsey, Elorm Adzoa; Gadgil, Shardool; Bouhuwaish, Ahmad; Ozair, Ahmad; Bansal, Sanchit; Elhadi, Muhammed; Godbole, Aditya Amit; Axiaq, Ariana; Rauf, Faateh Ahmad; Ashpak, Ashna",Int J Clin Pract,145,23

Although neuroinflammation is a descriptive denominator in multiple sclerosis based on histopathological observations, namely the penetration of leukocytes into the central nervous system, the clinical symptoms of relapses, remissions and progressive paralysis are the result of losses of myelin and neurons. In the absence of etiological factors as targets for prevention and therapy, the definition of molecular mechanisms that form the basis of inflammation, demyelination and toxicity for neurons have led to a number of treatments that slow down disease progression in specific patient cohorts, but that do not cure the disease. Current therapies are directed to block the immune processes, both innate and adaptive, that are associated with multiple sclerosis. In this review, we analyze the role of cytokines in the multiple sclerosis pathogenesis and current/future use of them in treatments of multiple sclerosis.","Amedei, Amedeo; Prisco, Domenico; D’Elios, Mario Milco",Int J Mol Sci,145,1

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-section survey-based study amongst doctors working within Obstetrics and Gynaecology in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 207 doctors completed the survey. Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reported significantly higher rates of both Major Depressive Disorder ( versus, p = 0.023) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder ( versus, p = 0.044) as compared to the UK-wide estimates. Sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was more common amongst female doctors as compared to males ( versus, p = 0.047). Although the prevalence of GAD was higher amongst registrars compared to their Consultant and/or Senior House Officer counterparts, this was not statistically significant. Respondents felt that the most significant factor for work-related changes to mental health was keeping up to date with frequently changing guidelines and protocols related to COVID-19. Only of respondents felt able to talk to colleagues about their mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Key findings include the high prevalence of mental health conditions amongst doctors, demonstration of the persistent taboo that mental health carries within the speciality and the key contributory factors to poor mental health. Further work should be done to assess if changes to the way new and updating guidelines, protocols and pathways are disseminated reduces the impact on the mental health of doctors. With the threat of a second COVID-19 peak looming, now more than ever, it is vital that steps are taken to break the stigmatisation of mental health amongst doctors, encouraging doctors to seek help when required.","Shah, Neha; Raheem, Ali; Sideris, Michail; Velauthar, Luxmi; Saeed, Ferha",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,145,16

Immunoperoxidase (PAP) labeling of viral antigen, concomitantly with infectivity assays and histological examination of each selected sample, were carried out. As from the 2nd week post-infection (pi), neurological disease inducing 100% mortality at 1 month was evident. At day 5 pi, viral antigen was first detected at footpad level in epidermic and dermic cells, as well as in neighbouring myocytes; labeled macrophages infiltrating small nerve branches were also disclosed. As from 10–15 days pi, viral antigen became apparent along ipsilateral sciatic nerve structures and within lumbar spinal ganglion neurons, followed by a fast viral spread throughout CNS neurons that involved spinal cord and brain. Concurrent histopathology featured minimal inflammatory reaction together with generalized astrocytic activation. Hematogenous viral transport was negligible, since JV was isolated much earlier and in higher infectivity titers in neural tissues than in blood. It may be concluded that after viral replication in footpad, JV neural route was demonstrated by its PAP labeling from peripheral nerves to cerebral cortex.","Lascano, E. F.; Lerman, G.

SARS‐CoV‐2 has the potential to cause both direct and indirect brain vascular endothelial damage through infection and inflammation that may result in long‐term neurological signs and symptoms. We sought to illuminate persistent neuro‐ophthalmological deficits that may be seen following posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) due to COVID‐19. METHODS: We identified three individuals with PRES due to COVID‐19 in our hospital system. One patient was identified on presentation to our neuro‐ophthalmology clinic. The other patients were identified through internal records search. These cases were compared to published reports of PRES in COVID‐19 identified through systematic literature search of PubMed/LitCOVID. RESULTS: All three patients were hospitalized with severe COVID‐19 and developed altered mental status with new onset seizures that led to the recognition of PRES through diagnostic imaging. During recovery, two patients had persistent visual dysfunction including visual field deficits. One patient also experienced hallucinatory palinopsia and visual hallucinations. Literature search identified 32 other cases of PRES in the context of COVID‐19. Visual disturbances were described in 14 cases (40%), with only seven cases (50%) reporting full recovery by the time of publication. CONCLUSIONS: As we learn about enduring neurological complications of COVID‐19, it is possible that complications may be underrecognized and underreported. Understanding the range of complications can help in postcare evaluation and management changes in the critical care setting to potentially allow intervention before persistent deficits occur due to COVID‐19.","Hixon, Alison M.; Thaker, Ashesh A.; Pelak, Victoria S.",Eur J Neurol,145,8

Methods: a literature overview was performed including clinical trials, in vitro studies, reviews and published guidelines regarding the present paper topic. A descriptive synthesis was performed to evaluate recent insights and the effectiveness of therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, infants and pregnant subjects. Results: Insufficient data are available regarding the relationship between COVID-19 and the clinical risk of spontaneous abortion and premature foetus death. A decrease in the incidence of COVID-19 could be correlated to a minor expression of ACE2 in childrens’ lungs. At present, a modulation of the dose-effect posology for children and infants is necessary. Conclusions: Pregnant vertical transmission has been hypothesised for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Although most infections resulted in respiratory illness, some severe cases resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe form of acute lung injury (ALI) that further contributes to morbidity. To date, no effective drugs that improve the clinical outcome of influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected patients have been identified. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are involved in several pathologies such as cardiovascular functions, renal disease, and acute lung injury. In the current study, we report that ACE2 could mediate the severe acute lung injury induced by influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in an experimental mouse model. Moreover, ACE2 deficiency worsened the disease pathogenesis markedly, mainly by targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1). The current findings demonstrate that ACE2 plays a critical role in influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced acute lung injury, and suggest that might be a useful potential therapeutic target for future influenza A (H7N9) outbreaks.","Yang, Penghui; Gu, Hongjing; Zhao, Zhongpeng; Wang, Wei; Cao, Bin; Lai, Chengcai; Yang, Xiaolan; Zhang, LiangYan; Duan, Yueqiang; Zhang, Shaogeng; Chen, Weiwen; Zhen, Wenbo; Cai, Maosheng; Penninger, Josef M.; Jiang, Chengyu; Wang, Xiliang",Sci Rep,145,16

The rapid growth of the epidemic, a health system that had collapsed, and mass gravesites for coping with growing numbers of dead, were broadcast by the media around the world. Moreover, a majority of the local Amazonian indigenous communities were physically distant from appropriate medical services, to the point where warnings of genocide were issued. In a recent Science paper (December 2020), Buss et al. reported that some 76% of the residents of the city of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, had been infected by October 2020. This estimate of the COVID-19 attack rate was based on a seroprevalence analysis of blood donor data, which despite its shortcomings was thought to be a sufficiently reliable proxy of the larger population. An attack rate of this magnitude (76%) implied that herd immunity had already been reached and the community was relatively protected from further infection. Yet in December 2020, a harsh second wave of COVID-19 struck Manaus, and currently appears to be even larger than the first wave. Here we use mathematical modelling of mortality data in Manaus, and in various states of Brazil, to understand why a second wave appeared against all expectations.

Thus, early identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes is critical. Our objective was to analyse SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum as a severity biomarker in COVID-19. Retrospective observational study including 193 patients admitted for COVID-19. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (viremia) was performed with samples collected at 48–72 h of admission by two techniques from Roche and Thermo Fischer Scientific (TFS). Main outcome variables were mortality and need for ICU admission during hospitalization for COVID-19. Viremia was detected in 50–60% of patients depending on technique. The correlation of Ct in serum between both techniques was good (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.612; p < 0.001). Patients with viremia were older (p = 0.006), had poorer baseline oxygenation (PaO(2)/FiO(2); p < 0.001), more severe lymphopenia (p < 0.001) and higher LDH (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p = 0.021), C-reactive protein (CRP; p = 0.022) and procalcitonin (p = 0.002) serum levels. We defined ""relevant viremia"" when detection Ct was < 34 with Roche and < 31 for TFS. These thresholds had 95% sensitivity and 35% specificity. Relevant viremia predicted death during hospitalization (OR 9.2 [3.8–22.6] for Roche, OR 10.3 [3.6–29.3] for TFS; p < 0.001). Cox regression models, adjusted by age, sex and Charlson index, identified increased LDH serum levels and relevant viremia (HR = 9.87 [4.13–23.57] for TFS viremia and HR = 7.09 [3.3–14.82] for Roche viremia) as the best markers to predict mortality. Viremia assessment at admission is the most useful biomarker for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients. Viremia is highly reproducible with two different techniques (TFS and Roche), has a good consistency with other severity biomarkers for COVID-19 and better predictive accuracy.","Rodríguez-Serrano, Diego A.; Roy-Vallejo, Emilia; Zurita Cruz, Nelly D.; Martín Ramírez, Alexandra; Rodríguez-García, Sebastián C.; Arevalillo-Fernández, Nuria; Galván-Román, José María; Fontán García-Rodrigo, Leticia; Vega-Piris, Lorena; Chicot Llano, Marta; Arribas Méndez, David; González de Marcos, Begoña; Hernando Santos, Julia; Sánchez Azofra, Ana; Ávalos Pérez-Urria, Elena; Rodriguez-Cortes, Pablo; Esparcia, Laura; Marcos-Jimenez, Ana; Sánchez-Alonso, Santiago; Llorente, Irene; Soriano, Joan; Suárez Fernández, Carmen; García-Vicuña, Rosario; Ancochea, Julio; Sanz, Jesús; Muñoz-Calleja, Cecilia; de la Cámara, Rafael; Canabal Berlanga, Alfonso; González-Álvaro, Isidoro; Cardeñoso, Laura",Sci Rep,145,16

Despite the tremendous value conferred by currently available vaccines toward public health, the implementation of additional vaccine platforms is also of key importance. In fact, currently available vaccines possess shortcomings, such as inefficient triggering of a cell-mediated immune response and the lack of protective mucosal immunity. In this regard, recent work has been focused on vaccine delivery systems, as an alternative to injectable vaccines, to increase antigen stability and improve overall immunogenicity. In particular, novel strategies based on edible or intradermal vaccine formulations have been demonstrated to trigger both a systemic and mucosal immune response. These novel vaccination delivery systems offer several advantages over the injectable preparations including self-administration, reduced cost, stability, and elimination of a cold chain. In this review, the latest findings and accomplishments regarding edible and intradermal vaccines are described in the context of the system used for immunogen expression, their molecular features and capacity to induce a protective systemic and mucosal response.","Criscuolo, E.; Caputo, V.; Diotti, R.

Data was analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression using an interaction model to estimate the change in trends. After the first lockdown, incidence trends were considerably reduced in both countries. However, although the slopes have been flattened for all outcomes, the trends kept rising. During the second lockdown, implementing more restrictive measures for mobility, it has been a change in the trend slopes for both countries in daily incident cases and ICUs. This improvement indicates that the efforts overtaken are being successful in flattening the epidemic curve, and reinforcing the belief that we must hold on.","Tobías, Aurelio",Science of The Total Environment,145,24

The effects of melatonin have also been studied in Protozoan parasites, especially in the synchronization of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum via a complex downstream signalling pathway. Melatonin activates protein kinase A (PfPKA) and requires the activation of protein kinase 7 (PfPK7), PLC-IP(3), and a subset of genes from the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In other parasites, such as Trypanosoma cruzi and Toxoplasma gondii, melatonin increases inflammatory components, thus amplifying the protective response of the host’s immune system and affecting parasite load. The development of melatonin-related indole compounds exhibiting antiparasitic properties clearly suggests this new and effective approach as an alternative treatment.

With the lack of availability of vaccines, there is an urgent need to avert resurgence of infections by putting some measures, such as contact tracing, in place. While digital tools, such as phone applications are advantageous, they also pose challenges and have limitations (eg, wireless coverage could be an issue in some cases). On the other hand, wearable devices, when coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT), are expected to influence lifestyle and healthcare directly, and they may be useful for health monitoring during the global pandemic and beyond. In this work, we conduct a literature review of contact tracing methods and applications. Based on the literature review, we found limitations in gathering health data, such as insufficient network coverage. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel intelligent tool that will be useful for contact tracing and prediction of COVID‐19 clusters. The solution comprises a phone application combined with a wearable device, infused with unique intelligent IoT features (complex data analysis and intelligent data visualization) embedded within the system to aid in COVID‐19 analysis. Contact tracing applications must establish data collection and data interpretation. Intelligent data interpretation can assist epidemiological scientists in anticipating clusters, and can enable them to take necessary action in improving public health management. Our proposed tool could also be used to curb disease incidence in future global health crises.","Jahmunah, Vicnesh; Sudarshan, Vidya K.; Oh, Shu Lih; Gururajan, Raj; Gururajan, Rashmi; Zhou, Xujuan; Tao, Xiaohui; Faust, Oliver; Ciaccio, Edward J.; Ng, Kwan Hoong; Acharya, U.

METHODS: The number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, recovered cases, and during the period 20 February 2020-21 April 2020 in 21 countries in EMR were extracted from the WHO situation reports. The Curve Estimation procedure was used to produce different curve estimation regression models for the observed data in each country. RESULTS: During this observed period, the total number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths in the region were 138673, 71343, and 6291, respectively. The overall fatality rate in the region was 4.5%. The quadratic model and the cubic model follows the observed data points fairly well during the observed time period in five and nine countries, respectively. The exponential model (Y = b0 * (e**(b1 * t))), the growth model (Y = e**(b0 + (b1 * t))), and the compound model (Y = b0 * (b1**t)) were the best fit for data during the observed time period in two, three, and two countries, respectively. CONCLUSION: The pattern of COVID-19 spread differed between countries in the EMR. This might reflect the variations in testing and implementation of public health measures. The best curve-fitting model was demonstrated for each country and it can be used for very short-term predictions.","Al Nsour, Mohannad Abed Alfattah; Khader, Yousef Saleh; Nazzal, Haitham Majed",Pan Afr Med J,145,21

Such measures have heavy negative consequences both on public health and the economy. However, these same measures have positive outcomes as “side effects” that are worth mentioning since they contribute to the improvement of some aspects of the population health. For instance, mask wearing helps to reduce allergies as well as the transmission of other airborne disease-causing pathogens. Physical distancing and social contact limitation help limit the spread of communicable diseases, and economic shutdown can reduce pollution and the health problems related to it. Decision makers could get inspired by these positive “side effects” to tackle and prevent diseases like allergies, infectious diseases and noncommunicable diseases, and improve health care and pathology management. Indeed, the effectiveness of such measures in tackling certain health problems encourages inspiration from COVID-19 measures towards managing selected health problems. However, with the massive damage COVID-19-related measures have caused to countries’ economies and people’s lives, the question of how to balance the advantages and disadvantages of these measures in order to further optimize them needs to be debated among health care professionals and decision makers.","Ghanemi, Abdelaziz; Yoshioka, Mayumi; St-Amand, Jonny",Medicines (Basel),145,2

Alternative fundoscopy technologies are increasingly available, yet valid comparisons between fundoscopy technologies are lacking. We aimed to assess medical students’ perceptions of usefulness and ease of use of traditional and contemporary fundus-viewing technologies including smartphone fundoscopy. METHODS: One hundred forty-six second-year medical students participated in a cross-sectional, randomised, cross-over study of fundoscopy methods. Medical students completed small group training sessions using six current fundoscopy technologies including: a non-mydriatic fundus camera; two types of direct fundoscopy; and three types of smartphone fundoscopy. A novel survey of perceived usefulness and ease of use was then completed by students. RESULTS: Repeated-measures ANOVA found students rated both the perceived usefulness (p< 0.001) and ease of use (p< 0.001) of smartphone fundoscopy significantly higher than both the non-mydriatic camera and direct fundoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone fundoscopy was found to be significantly more useful and easier to use than other modalities. Educators should optimise student access to novel fundoscopy technologies such as smartphone fundoscopy which may mitigate the technical challenges of fundoscopy and reinvigorate use of this valuable clinical examination.

Better understanding the implementation context of contact tracing for pandemics, including individual- and systems-level predictors of success, is critical to preparing for future epidemics. Methods: We carried out a prospective implementation study of an emergency volunteer contact tracing program established in New Haven, Connecticut between April 4 and May 19, 2020. We assessed the yield and timeliness of case and contact outreach in reference to CDC benchmarks, and identified individual and programmatic predictors of successful implementation using multivariable regression models. We synthesized our findings using the RE-AIM implementation framework. Results: Case investigators interviewed only 826 (48%) of 1,705 cases and were unable to reach 545 (32%) because of incomplete information and 334 (20%) who missed or declined repeated outreach calls. Contact notifiers reached just 687 (28%) of 2,437 reported contacts, and were unable to reach 1,597 (66%) with incomplete information and 153 (6%) who missed or declined repeated outreach calls. The median time-to-case-interview was 5 days and time-to-contact-notification 8 days. However, among notified contacts with complete time data, 457 (71%) were reached within 6 days of exposure. The least likely groups to be interviewed were elderly (adjusted relative risk, aRR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61–0.89, p = 0.012, vs. young adult) and Black/African-American cases (aRR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80–0.97, pairwise p = 0.01, vs. Hispanic/Latinx). However, ties between cases and their contacts strongly influenced contact notification success (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) 0.60). Surging caseloads and high volunteer turnover (case investigator n = 144, median time from sign-up to retirement from program was 4 weeks) required the program to supplement the volunteer workforce with paid public health nurses. Conclusions: An emergency volunteer-run contact tracing program fell short of CDC benchmarks for time and yield, largely due to difficulty collecting the information required for outreach to cases and contacts. To improve uptake, contact tracing programs must professionalize the workforce; better integrate testing and tracing services; capitalize on positive social influences between cases and contacts; and address racial and age-related disparities through enhanced community engagement.","Shelby, Tyler; Schenck, Christopher; Weeks, Brian; Goodwin, Justin; Hennein, Rachel; Zhou, Xin; Spiegelman, Donna; Grau, Lauretta E.; Niccolai, Linda; Bond, Maritza; Davis, J.

The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of 410 vertebrates, including 252 mammals, to study cross-species conservation of ACE2 and its likelihood to function as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We designed a five-category ranking score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between receptor and virus, classifying all species from very high to very low. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories, and only catarrhine primates in the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 binding, and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (<0.1%) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we observed evidence of positive selection in ACE2 in multiple species, including bats. Utilized appropriately, our results may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, justify the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care.","Damas, Joana; Hughes, Graham M.; Keough, Kathleen C.; Painter, Corrie A.; Persky, Nicole S.; Corbo, Marco; Hiller, Michael; Koepfli, Klaus-Peter; Pfenning, Andreas R.; Zhao, Huabin; Genereux, Diane P.; Swofford, Ross; Pollard, Katherine S.; Ryder, Oliver A.; Nweeia, Martin T.; Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin; Teeling, Emma C.; Karlsson, Elinor K.; Lewin, Harris A.",bioRxiv,145,1

This new microfluidic system integrates one-way micropumps, a four-membrane-type micromixer, two-way micropumps and an on-chip microcoil array in order to simultaneously perform the rapid detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM). An IgM/IgG titer in serum is used to confirm the presence of dengue virus infection. By utilizing microfluidic technologies and virus-bound magnetic beads, IgG and IgM in the serum samples are captured. This is followed by purification and isolation of these beads utilizing a magnetic field generated from the on-chip array of microcoils. Any interfering substances in the biological fluids are washed away automatically by the flow generated by the integrated pneumatic pumps. The fluorescence-labelled secondary antibodies are bound to the surface of the IgG/IgM complex attached onto the magnetic beads. Finally, the entire magnetic complex sandwich is transported automatically into a sample detection chamber. The optical signals are then measured and analyzed by a real-time optical detection module. The entire process is performed automatically on a single chip within 30 min, which is only 1/8th of the time required for a traditional method. More importantly, the detection limit has been improved to 21 pg, which is about 38 times better when compared to traditional methods.

The Zika epidemic demanded major efforts from the public health system to address the full range of disease consequences. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the role of Primary Health Care pharmacists working in the city of Campo Grande in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul. METHODS: A qualitative cross-sectional interview-based study with pharmacists working in municipal Primary Health Care services was carried out to investigate knowledge about the disease and involvement in the response to the health emergency. Informed consent was obtained. After coding, the corpus underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS: The data show that few professionals had received specific training in public health. Knowledge largely encompassed disease transmission by the mosquito and collective and individual preventive measures. Findings highlight knowledge gaps relating to signs and symptoms, diagnosis, consequences of infection, and the role of epidemiological surveillance. Most professionals mentioned at least one of the recommendations on the use of medicines in symptom management protocols. The practical implications surrounding knowledge gaps and misconceptions were reflected in pharmacists´ role in response, restricted to counselling on preventive measures. Few respondents participated in institutional groups and committees or in multiprofessional teams involving case management. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified important knowledge gaps and showed that the involvement of pharmacy professionals in the response to the Zika epidemic was timid or inadequate. The results also suggest that pharmacists failed to recognize their role in interventions related to the ZIKV epidemic. Findings highlight the need to increase the involvement of primary care pharmacists in community-based actions, for communication and reduction of health risks, and emergency preparedness and response.","Santos-Pinto, Cláudia B.; Osorio-De-Castro, Claudia S.; Ferreira, Larissa M.; Miranda, Elaine S.",Pharm Pract (Granada),145,23

Members of the DEAD-box helicase family have roles throughout cellular RNA metabolism from biogenesis to decay. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that cellular RNA helicases, including DEAD-box helicases, play roles in the recognition of foreign nucleic acids and the modulation of viral infection. As intracellular parasites, viruses must evade detection by innate immune sensing mechanisms and degradation by cellular machinery while also manipulating host cell processes to facilitate replication. The ability of DEAD-box helicases to recognize RNA in a sequence-independent manner, as well as the breadth of cellular functions carried out by members of this family, lead them to influence innate recognition and viral infections in multiple ways. Indeed, DEAD-box helicases have been shown to contribute to intracellular immune sensing, act as antiviral effectors, and even to be coopted by viruses to promote their replication. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these interactions, as well as the cellular roles of DEAD-box helicases themselves, is limited in many cases.

Using correlational and quasi-experimental analyses, results indicated that for people who perceive greater disease risk, the association between group-serving bias and restrictive policy support is weakened. This weakened association occurred because people who felt more vulnerable to these diseases increased support for ingroup-protective actions more strongly than xenophobic thoughts.

METHOD: Single-blind, randomised parallel group in situ simulation. Participants were on-duty nurses/midwives who regularly prepared intravenous medicines. Using a training manikin in their clinical area, participants administered a voriconazole infusion, a high-risk medicine requiring several steps to prepare. They were randomised to use current IMG guidelines or IMG guidelines revised with user-testing. Direct observation was used to time the simulation and identify errors. Participant confidence was measured using a validated instrument. The primary outcome was the percentage of simulations with at least one moderate-severe IMG-related error, with error severity classified by an expert panel. RESULTS: In total, 133 participants were randomised to current guidelines and 140 to user-tested guidelines. Fewer moderate-severe IMG-related errors occurred with the user-tested guidelines (n=68, 49%) compared with current guidelines (n=79, 59%), but this difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio: 0.82; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.02).

Due to the frequency of cancer diagnoses and the increasing costs of treatment, financial stress is common among cancer patients. Guided by the Family Systems Illness Model (FSI), a cross-sectional study of individuals and family members where there was an active cancer diagnosis (n = 53) was conducted. The study utilized structural equation modeling to examine the impact of cancer stress and financial stress on maladaptive family coping mechanisms, and in turn, their effect on family communication and satisfaction. Findings indicate individuals with higher financial stress reported greater cancer stress. In turn, individuals with higher cancer stress, reported higher rigidity in their family coping which was associated with less family satisfaction. Additionally, as individuals reported greater family disengagement and chaos, lower levels of family communication and satisfaction were found. These findings provide evidence to the complex stresses experienced by cancer patients and their families. Therapeutic implications of how emotionally focused therapy may support these families dealing with a cancer diagnosis are discussed.","Johnson, Emily M.; Ross, Donald Bruce",Contemp Fam Ther,145,27

Recent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine (CQ). Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages in patients with established severe COVID-19. Methods We performed a parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial, aiming to assess safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with SARS in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Eligible participants were allocated to receive orally or via nasogastric tube high dose CQ (600mg CQ twice daily for 10 days or total dose 12g); or low dose CQ (450mg for 5 days, twice daily only on the first day, or total dose 2.7g). In addition, all patients received ceftriaxone and azithromycin. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04323527. Findings Out of a pre-defined 440 patients sample size, 81 patients were enrolled. The high dose CQ arm presented more QTc>500ms (25%), and a trend toward higher lethality (17%) than the lower dosage. Fatality rate was 13.5% (95%CI=6.9-23.0%), overlapping with the CI of historical data from similar patients not using CQ (95%CI=14.5-19.2%). In 14 patients with paired samples, respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only one patient. Interpretation Preliminary findings suggest that the higher CQ dosage (10-day regimen) should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of its potential safety hazards. Such results forced us to prematurely halt patient recruitment to this arm. Given the enormous global push for the use of CQ for COVID-19, results such as the ones found in this trial can provide robust evidence for updated COVID-19 patient management recommendations.","Borba, Mayla Gabriela Silva; Val, Fernando de Almeida; Sampaio, Vanderson Sousa; Alexandre, Marcia Almeida Ara&uacutejo; Melo, Gisely Cardoso; Brito, Marcelo; Mour&atildeo, Maria Paula Gomes; Brito Sousa, José Diego; Baia-da-Silva, Djane Clarys; Guerra, Marcus Vinitius Farias; Hajjar, Ludhmila Abrahāo; Pinto, Rosemary Costa; Balieiro, Antonio Alcirley Silva; Naveca, Felipe Gomes; Xavier, Mariana Simāo; Salomão, Alexandre; Siqueira, André Machado; Schwarzbolt, Alexandre; Croda, Júlio Henrique Rosa; Nogueira, Maurício Lacerda; Romero, Gustavo Adolfo Sierra; Bassat, Quique; Fontes, Cor Jesus; Albuquerque, Bernardino Cláudio; Daniel-Ribeiro, Cláudio Tadeu; Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo; Lacerda, Marcus Vinícus Guimarães",,145,12

Methods: Disaster-related mental health interventions consisted of: (1) screening high-risk evacuees with high psychological distress (Kessler 6 score ≥ 13) or binge drinking; and (2) visiting selected high-risk individuals and providing them counseling through outreach in evacuee housing. These activity records were compiled from existing material in the Sendai City Office; therefore, no new interviews or questionnaire surveys were conducted. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced telephone counseling and shortened the time of support as a result of the restrictions. Counselors addressed issues of “loneliness” or “isolation” among evacuees, who had little connection with society due to the pandemic. Moreover, the procedure for obtaining COVID-19 special financial aid was explained to evacuees in financial difficulty. During this period, the suicide rates in the affected area did not increase significantly as compared to the national average. Conclusions: Our report may be instructive in terms of preventing suicide during the pandemic using high-risk approaches and counselors trained in disaster-related mental health interventions.","Orui, Masatsugu; Saeki, Suzuka; Harada, Shuichiro; Hayashi, Mizuho",Int J Environ Res Public Health,145,1

The balance of protective versus pathological immune responses in COVID-19 is incompletely understood. Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are antimicrobial T cells that recognize bacterial metabolites, and can also function as innate-like sensors and mediators of antiviral responses. Here, we investigated the MAIT cell compartment in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe disease, as well as in convalescence. We show profound and preferential decline in MAIT cells in circulation of patients with active disease paired with strong activation, as well as significant MAIT cell enrichment and pro-inflammatory IL-17A bias in the airways. Unsupervised analysis identified MAIT cell CD69high and CXCR3low immunotypes associated with poor clinical outcome. MAIT cell levels normalized in the convalescent phase, consistent with dynamic recruitment to the tissues and subsequent release with disease resolution. These findings indicate that MAIT cells are engaged in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and suggest their involvement in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.","Parrot, T.; Gorin, J.-B.; Ponzetta, A.; Maleki, K.

Integrating operations of poultry industry sections including production, distribution and consumption becomes vital. Although the proper poultry supply chain has been established and made plenty of benefits for a long time, the global outbreak of COVID-19 shows that operations under pandemic are still challenge for the poultry industry. In this paper, the impacts of pandemic on poultry industry is investigated by developing a multi-period multi-modal stochastic poultry supply chain. Two models are developed aiming to mitigate the negative effects of pandemic occurrence through product stocking policy. In the first model, distribution system is in accordance with a multi-component structure, while the second model allows direct connections between suppliers (farmers) and demanders (customers). In both models, poultry productions are negatively affected by COVID 19. Due to the complexity of the model, a hybrid solution approach based on Branch and Cut and Dynamic Programming is developed. To validate the performance of the proposed model and solution procedure, a case study on the broiler industry in the state of Mississippi is performed. The results show that storing poultry products in the pre-pandemic along with direct logistics during pandemic period can save the broiler supply chain cost up to 30%.","Yazdekhasti, Amin; Wang, Jun; Zhang, Li; Ma, Junfeng",Transp Res E Logist Transp Rev,145,20

To quantitatively evaluate its performance, this paper explores air curtains equipped on normal consulting desk to avoid doctor’s direct exposure to the patient exhaled pollutants. A numerical investigation is conducted to evaluate the effects of supply air velocity and angle on cutting off performance. Simulation results show that the average mass fraction of exhaled pollutants decreases significantly (70%–90%) in the consulting ward, indicating satisfying performance of air curtains. Increasing supply air velocity is demonstrated to be conducive in forming full air curtains, whereas an excessively high supply air velocity may be of adverse effects by entraining exhaled flow. Besides, the supply air angle is also critical due to its coupling with supply air velocity. It is found that larger angle (0°–40°) is better where velocity is less than 3 m/s, otherwise a small angle (20°) is preferable where velocity is larger than 3 m/s. Exhaled flow could be well suppressed at the supply air angle 20° but moves over air curtains at 40°. This study can provide effective and intuitive guidance in applying air curtains in consulting wards.

Fortunately, high-quality columns of every type described in this review are commercially available. Most water-soluble proteins may be eluted from size-exclusion, hydrophobic-interaction, ion-exchange, metal chelate, and bioaffinity columns with ease. When this is the case, high recovery and retention of biological activity are the norm. The exception is reversed-phase chromatography where the organic solvents and acids used in polypeptide elution denature many proteins. When problems do occur, they are generally the result of unique structural features of the protein. Very hydrophobic proteins have presented the biggest problem in that they are difficult to solubilize, particularly with retention of biological activity. It has been found that zwitterionic an non-ionic detergents are the most suitable solubilizing agents, but area has also been used in cases where hydrophobic interacts are not as strong. Unfortunately, there is still an element of trial-and-error in selecting the most suitable solubilizing agent. Heterogeneous glycosylation of proteins also presents a problem. Both neutral and charged monosaccharides can be incorporated into proteins through multiple steps at several sites. Thus, there is the potential in a sample for a large number of glycoprotein species which have the same polypeptide backbone and differing amounts of oligosaccharide. A problem arises when size-exclusion, ion-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, reversed-phase and bioaffinity systems begin to discriminate between these very similar glycoprotein species. Chromatographic peaks can become very load, due to incomplete fractionation, and the polypeptide chain of interest can be associated with multiple peaks. The separation of glycoproteins requires much more study before logical procedures can be suggested for column selection and operation. Aggregated species are another class of proteins which present occasional problems. Multimeric proteins are adsorbed to sorbents by a series of forces, among which are hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic forces. These forces are also responsible for the maintenance of quaternary structure in proteins. When the same forces dominate both retention of protein structure and adsorption at the sorbent surface, the quaternary structure of the protein can be disrupted during elution. Very basic proteins also present a problem in some cases. Columns with residual negative charges, such as a silica-based reversed-phase column, adsorb anionic species so strongly that they are difficult to elute. This is the case with ribosomal and nucleoproteins. The solution is to use exhaustively end-capped columns which diminish electrostatic interactions.","Regnier, Fred E.",Journal of Chromatography B: Biomedical Sciences and Applications,145,21

Based on the comparatively high similarity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV, it seems crucial to assay the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with SARS-CoV2 spike (S)-protein. Indeed, developing mAbs targeting SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD could show novel applications for rapid and sensitive development of potential epitope-specific vaccines (ESV). Herein, we present an overview on the discovery of new CoV followed by some explanation on the SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD site. Furthermore, we surveyed the novel therapeutic mAbs for targeting S-protein RBD such as S230, 80R, F26G18, F26G19, CR3014, CR3022, M396, and S230.15. Afterwards, the mechanism of interaction of RBD and different mAbs were explained and it was suggested that one of the SARS-CoV-specific human mAbs, namely CR3022, could show the highest binding affinity with SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future perspective for rapid and sensitive advancement of therapeutic mAbs targeting S-protein RBD were discussed. In conclusion, it may be proposed that this review may pave the way for recognition of RBD and different mAbs to develop potential therapeutic ESV.","Hussain, Arif; Hasan, Anwarul; Nejadi Babadaei, Mohammad Mahdi; Bloukh, Samir Haj; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.H.; Sharifi, Majid; Haghighat, Setareh; Falahati, Mojtaba",Biomed Pharmacother,145,32

Le contexte socio-économique précaire rend inconcevable l’application des recommandations de prévention. Bien que la moitié de la population ait moins de 18 ans ; chez les adultes, la prévalence des facteurs de risque de formes graves fait redouter une saturation de l’unique hôpital de l’île : 38 % d’HTA, 12 % de diabète tandis que l’IMC moyen est de 26,9kg/m2. Matériels et méthodes Afin de comprendre la dynamique et la sévérité du Covid-19 à Mayotte, plusieurs dispositifs de surveillance ont été mis en place. Ce travail décrit l’évolution épidémique du 9/03/20 au 14/03/21 en distinguant deux vagues différentes du fait de l’émergence de variants: 2020 (9/03/20-31/12/20) versus 2021 (01/01/21-14/03/21). Résultats L’épidémie a débuté en mars 2020 avec un pic en mai (taux d’incidence (TI) de 133/100000 hbts). L’âge médian des cas était de 36 ans et la plupart d’entre eux était sans activité professionnelle. Le TI a diminué pour passer début juillet, sous le seuil d’alerte, suggérant une accalmie durant l’hiver austral. Cette première vague s’est avérée relativement peu sévère avec un maximum de cas hospitalisés en S21 : 51 patients hospitalisés dont 11 en réanimation. La circulation virale a continué sans impact sanitaire majeur jusqu’en décembre 2020 où l’Afrique du Sud a signalé l’émergence du variant 501Y.V2. Quelques semaines après les Comores, Mayotte enregistrait une dégradation rapide et intense de la situation: doublement du TI, triplement du taux de positivité Sars-Cov-2 (TP) entre mi-décembre et mi-janvier, y compris chez les 0-14 ans. En S6-2021, le TI a atteint un pic (894/100000 hbts) tout comme le TP culminant à 28 %. Deux enquêtes flash en février ont montré la part majoritaire d’un variant avec la mutation 501Y, représentant 87 % (150/172) des échantillons analysés par criblage. Les indicateurs hospitaliers témoignaient de la sévérité de cette nouvelle vague avec un pic atteint en S18-2021 : 148 patients hospitalisés dont 27 en réanimation, majoritairement des formes oxygéno-requérentes. En 2021, 149 cas ont été admis en réanimation contre 104 en 2020 (sex ratio H/F=1,9). Parmi les patients présentant une forme pulmonaire, le profil des cas admis en réanimation en 2021 a changé par rapport à 2020 : ils étaient significativement plus jeunes (57 vs 62 ans) et présentaient un profil de comorbidités différent. Au total, en un an, 18899 cas ont été confirmés biologiquement et 253 patients admis en réanimation: ils correspondaient à 203 cas de formes pulmonaires, 46 cas de portage asymptomatique et 14 cas de syndrome inflammatoire multi-systématique associé à une infection par le Sars-Cov-2. En 2021, 88 patients sont décédés contre 55 en 2020; âges médians respectifs de 73 et 64 ans. Conclusion Le confinement de février 2021 s’est suivi d’une inversion de la tendance épidémique. Fin mars, l’épidémie se poursuit avec un TI de 63/100000 hbts. Alors que moins de 5000 personnes ont été vaccinées à deux doses, la vigilance est de mise pour ce territoire vulnérable.","Subiros, M.; Parenton, F.; Blonde, R.; Pousset, F.; Diallo, A.; Niang, M.; Chamouine, A.; Iche, L.; Collet, L.; Combe, P.",Infectious Diseases Now,145,16

Design we performed a meta-analysis with available national reports at May 7th 2020 from China, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom and New York State. Analyses were performed by a random effects model and sensitivity analyses were performed for the identification of potential sources of heterogeneity. Setting and Participants: covid-19 positive patients reported in literature and national reports. Measures all-cause mortality by age. Results A total of 611,1583 subjects were analyzed and 141,745 (23.2%) had age ≥80. The percentage of octogenarians was different in the 5 registries being the lowest in China (3.2%) and the highest and the highest in UK and New York State. The overall mortality rate was 12.10% and it varied widely between countries being the lowest in China (3.1%) and the highest in UK (20.8%) and New York State (20.99%). Mortality was <1.1% in patients with age <50 and it increased exponentially after that age in the 5 national registries. As expected, the highest mortality rate was observed in patients ≥80 years old. All age groups had significantly higher mortality compared to the inmediatelly younger age group. The largest increase in mortality risk was observed in patients with age 60-69 compared to 50-59 (OR: 3.13 95% CI 2.61-3.76). Conclusions and implications this metanalysis with more than half-million of Covid-19 patients from different countries highlights the determinant effect of age on mortality with the relevant thresholds on age >50 and, especially, >60.

METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted. A questionnaire assessed perceived risk and collected independent variables, including sociodemographic data. A multivariable linear regression model was used to characterize the relationship between independent variables and perceived risk. RESULTS: We included 1379 respondents in the final analysis with the mean and median of perceived risk score was 19.21% and 10.0%, respectively. Respondents aged between 21 and 30 years had the highest perceived risk, and those who were unmarried had 4.3% higher perceived risk compared with those who were married. Compared with the lowest monthly income group, those making Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) 6-10 million and more than IDR 10 million a month believed they had 4.2% and 8.8% higher risk, respectively. Citizens who lived in cities and health-care workers also had a higher perceived risk compared with those in the rural areas and non–health-care workers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived risk of COVID-19 in Indonesia is relatively low, and this could hamper the adoption of preventive measures of COVID-19.

Predictors of PTSS and Stigma's perception among HCWs were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Overall, 71.4% of the participants were women and 46.9% were front line staff. The prevalence of intrusion, avoidance, and hyper vigilance symptoms was 44.2% (95% CI: 40.8-47.6), 31. 8% (95% CI: 28.8-35.0), and 37.7% (95% CI: 34.5-41.0), respectively. A strong and positive significant correlation was found between stigma score with PTSD total score (coefficient: 0.83) and its components. In multivariate logistic regression model, female gender was associated with intrusion (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.03-2.06) and avoidance (OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.147-2.417) and working in frontline increased the odds of intrusion (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.06-1.97) and hyper vigilance (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.03-1.91). Conclusion: The prevalence of PTSS is high among HCWs during COVID-19 pandemic and it is associated with some demographic characteristics of HCWs. This situation should be considered by health policymakers so that while trying to control the disease, the mental health status of this group of personnel should be given much attention.","Zandifar, Atefeh; Badrfam, Rahim; Mohammadian Khonsari, Nami; Mohammadi, Mohammad Reza; Asayesh, Hamid; Qorbani, Mostafa",Iran J Psychiatry,145,17

Gen. Virol. 66, 719–726). The order of the two glycopolypeptides within So is aminoterminus(N)-Sl-S2-carboxyterminus(C). To locate the N-terminus of S2 we have performed partial amino acid sequencing on S2 from IBV-Beaudette labelled with [3H]serine and from the related strain IBV-M41 labelled with [3H]valine, leucine and isoleucine. The residues identified and their positions relative to the N-terminus of S2 were: serine, 13; valine, 6, 12; leucine, none in the first 20 residues; isoleucine, 2, 19. These results identified the N-terminus of S2 of IBV-Beaudette as serine, 520 residues from the N-terminus of S1, excluding the signal sequence. Immediately to the N-terminal side of residue 520 So has the sequence Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg; similar basic connecting peptides are a feature of several other virus spike glycoproteins. It was deduced that for IBV-Beaudette SI comprises 519 residues (M r 57.0K) or 514 residues (56.2K) if the connecting peptide was to be removed by carboxypeptidase-like activity in vivo while S2 has 625 residues (69.2K). Nucleotide sequencing of the cleavage region of the So gene of IBV-M41 revealed the same connecting peptide as IBV-Beaudette and that the first 20 N-terminal residues of S2 of IBV-M41 were identical to those of the Beaudette strain. IBV-Beaudette grown in Vero cells had some uncleaved So; this was cleavable by 10 μg/ml of trypsin and of chymotrypsin. Partial N-terminal analysis of S1 from IBV-M41 identified leucine and valine residues at positions 2 and 9 respectively from the N-terminus. This confirms the identification made by Binns et al. (1985), of the N-terminus of S1 and the end of the signal sequence of the IBV-Beaudette spike propolypeptide. N-terminal sequencing of [3H]leucine-labelled IBV-Beaudette membrane (M) polypeptide showed leucine residues at positions 8,16 and 22 from the N-terminus; these results confirm the open reading frame identified by M.E.G. Boursnell et al. (1984, Virus Res. 1, 303–313) in the nucleotide sequence of M. The N-terminus of the nucleocapsid (n) polypeptide appeared to be blocked.","Cavanagh, David; Davis, Philip J.; Pappin, Darryl J.C.; Binns, Matthew M.; Boursnell, Michael E.G.; Brown, T.David K.",Virus Research,145,16

Spatial epidemiology, which often uses the inherently identifiable variable of participant address, must balance reproducibility with participant privacy. In this study, we assess the impact of several different data perturbation methods on key spatial statistics and patient privacy. METHODS: We analyzed the impact of perturbation on spatial patterns in the full set of address-level mortality data from Lawrence, MA during the period from 1911 to 1913. The original death locations were perturbed using seven different published approaches to stochastic and deterministic spatial data anonymization. Key spatial descriptive statistics were calculated for each perturbation, including changes in spatial pattern center, Global Moran’s I, Local Moran’s I, distance to the k-th nearest neighbors, and the L-function (a normalized form of Ripley’s K). A spatially adapted form of k-anonymity was used to measure the privacy protection conferred by each method, and its compliance with HIPAA and GDPR privacy standards. RESULTS: Random perturbation at 50 m, donut masking between 5 and 50 m, and Voronoi masking maintain the validity of descriptive spatial statistics better than other perturbations. Grid center masking with both 100 × 100 and 250 × 250 m cells led to large changes in descriptive spatial statistics. None of the perturbation methods adhered to the HIPAA standard that all points have a k-anonymity > 10. All other perturbation methods employed had at least 265 points, or over 6%, not adhering to the HIPAA standard. CONCLUSIONS: Using the set of published perturbation methods applied in this analysis, HIPAA and GDPR compliant de-identification was not compatible with maintaining key spatial patterns as measured by our chosen summary statistics. Further research should investigate alternate methods to balancing tradeoffs between spatial data privacy and preservation of key patterns in public health data that are of scientific and medical importance.","Broen, Kelly; Trangucci, Rob; Zelner, Jon",Int J Health Geogr,145,12

Often, pericarditis and myocarditis occur with viral infections in young adults. It is rare to see viral infections causing cardiac tamponade, which is a potentially fatal complication. Several cases of pericardial effusions and pre-tamponade physiology have been reported in elderly individuals with an extensive history of cardiac disease. Here, we describe the case of a previously healthy young adult who developed COVID-19 related cardiac tamponade without any preceding respiratory symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism had tested positive for the SARS CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus-2) one week prior to presentation. She presented with constant, central chest pain radiating to the back for 2 days. While being evaluated for hypotension, the patient broke into convulsions and was consequently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was elevated at 2,470 pg/mL (normal range: 0 – 450 pg/mL), and cardiac troponin was mildly elevated at 0.63 ng/mL. Initial electrocardiogram showed a low voltage strip with sinus tachycardia, and electrical alternans, suggestive of pericarditis(1). Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast revealed a small non-tappable pericardial effusion. CT head was negative. Over the course of a few hours, significant elevation of cardiac troponin to 5.18 ng/mL, and escalation in vasopressor requirements prompted us to obtain bedside echocardiography, which demonstrated a large pericardial effusion with pre-tamponade physiology. Emergent bedside pericardiocentesis was performed and 250cc of serous pericardial fluid was drained. A pericardial window was kept open to watch for re-accumulation. Post-procedural electrocardiogram had normal voltage, showed no electrical alternans and tachycardia had resolved. The patient was gradually weaned from vasopressor support and other supportive treatment. The pericardial drain was removed. An echocardiogram obtained at a 2-month follow-up showed a healthy heart with a normal ejection fraction. DISCUSSION: On initial evaluation, the differential diagnosis for convulsive syncope in a young patient with hypotension and COVID-19 were pulmonary embolism or a thromboembolic stroke. EKG findings and subsequent clinical course pointed towards a possible pericardial effusion. However, pericardial effusions are commonly idiopathic and only a smaller subset of cases stem from infectious disease. Viral pericarditis causes gradual accumulation of transudate leading to a pericardial effusion. Interestingly, in our patient cardiac tamponade was acute. CONCLUSIONS: This case underscores that an index of suspicion should be held for COVID-19 causing cardiac tamponade in young individuals and that prompt intervention is invaluable.

Timely contact tracing is particularly crucial to limit onwards transmission in settings without established community transmission. METHODS: We conducted an in-depth analysis of the response to a big flight-associated COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam in March 2020 that involved contact tracing, systematic testing and strict quarantine up to third generation contacts. RESULTS: 183 primary contacts from the flight as well as 1,000 secondary and 311 third generation contacts were traced, tested, and quarantined across 15 provinces across Vietnam. The protracted confirmation of the index case at 3 days and 19 hours after arrival resulted in isolation/quarantine delays of 6.8 days (IQR 6.3–6.8) and 5.8 days (IQR 5.8–7.0) for primary and secondary cases, respectively, which generated 84.0 and 26.4 person-days of community exposure from primary and secondary cases, respectively. Nevertheless, only 5 secondary cases occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A large flight-related COVID-19 cluster was successfully contained through timely, systematic and comprehensive public health responses despite delayed index case identification.

Ayurvedic medicines, especially Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, WS), may be beneficial in the management of COVID-19. WS is a widely prescribed Ayurvedic botanical known as an immunomodulatory, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and adaptogenic agent. The chemical profile and pharmacological activities of WS have been extensively reported. Several clinical studies have reported its safety for use in humans. This review presents a research synthesis of in silico, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies on Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal (WS) and discusses its potential for prophylaxis and management of COVID-19. We have collated the data from studies on WS that focused on viral infections (HIV, HSV, H1N1 influenza, etc.) and noncommunicable diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cancer, etc.). The experimental literature indicates that WS has the potential for 1) maintaining immune homeostasis, 2) regulating inflammation, 3) suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, 4) organ protection (nervous system, heart, lung, liver, and kidney), and 5) anti-stress, antihypertensive, and antidiabetic activities. Using these trends, the review presents a triangulation of Ayurveda wisdom, pharmacological properties, and COVID-19 pathophysiology ranging from viral entry to end-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The review proposes WS as a potential therapeutic adjuvant for various stages of COVID-19 management. WS may also have beneficial effects on comorbidities associated with the COVID-19.

We aimed to investigate serial changes in serum ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) concentrations after OT in AHF patients with reduced ejection fraction (EF). Methods: ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) concentrations were measured in 68 AHF patients with reduced EF immediately after admission and 1 and 3 months after OT. These parameters were compared with the healthy individuals at three time points. Results: In the acute phase, Ang-(1-7) and ACE2 concentrations was statistically significantly lower and higher in AHF patients than the healthy individuals (2.40 ± 1.11 vs. 3.1 ± 1.1 ng/ml, P<0.005 and 7.45 ± 3.13 vs. 4.84 ± 2.25 ng/ml, P<0.005), respectively.

The paper uses the ‘weighted sum model’ technique in multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and the ‘additive utility model’ in analytical hierarchical process (AHP) for multi-criteria decision making, to develop the model from first principles. It discusses the development of key performance indicators encapsulated within the analytical model. It concludes by discussing other potential applications of the proposed model and methodology for process automation as part of integrated sustainability appraisal in infrastructure design and construction.

To maintain a rapid turnaround time to support patient management and public health authorities' decisions, we moved from a case-by-case validation of RT-PCR to an automated validation and immediate transmission of the results to clinicians. To maintain high quality and to track possible aberrant results, we developed a quality-monitoring tool based on a homemade algorithm coded in R. We present the results of this quality-monitoring tool applied to 35,137 RT-PCR results corresponding to 30,198 patients. Patients tested several times led to 4,939 pairwise comparisons; 88% concordant and 12% discrepant. Among the 573 discrepancies, 428 were automatically solved by the algorithm.

The guidelines presented are based on a literature review and consensus among all Spanish Ophthalmology Societies regarding protection measures recommended for the ophthalmologic care of patients with or without confirmed COVID‐19 in outpatient, inpatient, emergency and surgery settings. We recommend that all measures be adapted to the circumstances and availability of personal protective equipment at each centre and also highlight the need to periodically update recommendations as we may need to readopt more restrictive measures depending on the local epidemiology of the virus. These guidelines are designed to avoid the transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 among both patients and healthcare staff as we gradually return to normal medical practice, to prevent postoperative complications and try to reduce possible deficiencies in the diagnosis, treatment and follow‐up of the ophthalmic diseases. With this update (5(th)) the Spanish Society of Ophthalmology is placed as one of the major ophthalmology societies providing periodic and systematized recommendations for ophthalmic care during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Gegúndez‐Fernández, José A.; Llovet‐Osuna, Fernando; Fernández‐Vigo, José I.; Mendicute del Barrio, Javier; Pablo‐Júlvez, Luis; Muñoz‐Negrete, Francisco J.; Zarranz‐Ventura, Javier; Durán de la Colina, Juan; de Rojas Silva, Victoria; Jiménez‐Alfaro, Iñigo; Calonge‐Cano, Margarita; Galindo‐Ferreiro, Alicia; Castillo‐Gómez, Alfredo; Mantolán‐Sarmiento, Cristina; Duch‐Samper, Antonio; Álvarez de Toledo‐Elizalde, Juan; Duch‐Mestres, Francesc; Elies‐Amat, Daniel; Ortega‐Usobiaga, Julio; Saornil‐Alvarez, María Antonia; Villarrubia Cuadrado, Alberto; Garay Aramburu, Gonzaga; Fonollosa Carduch, Alejandro; Cordero Coma, José Miguel; García Delpech, Salvador; Cárceles Cárceles, Juan Antonio; Benítez del Castillo Sánchez, José Manuel; Gómez de Liaño Sánchez, Pilar; Harto Castaño, Miguel; Arias Puente, Alfonso; García‐Layana, Alfredo",Acta Ophthalmol,145,1

Here we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein dually regulated innate immune responses, i.e., the low-dose N protein suppressed type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling and inflammatory cytokines, whereas high-dose N protein promoted IFN-I signaling and inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein dually regulated the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3, STAT1, and STAT2. Additionally, low-dose N protein combined with TRIM25 could suppress the ubiquitination and activation of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). Our findings revealed a regulatory mechanism of innate immune responses by the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, which would contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like coronaviruses, and development of more effective strategies for controlling COVID-19.","Zhao, Yinghua; Sui, Liyan; Wu, Ping; Wang, Wenfang; Wang, Zedong; Yu, Yang; Hou, Zhijun; Tan, Guangyun; Liu, Quan; Wang, Guoqing",Signal Transduct Target Ther,145,28

The aim of this study was to analyze SARS-CoV-2-induced acute liver injury (ALI), its association with death risk and prognosis after discharge. Methods: Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients were recruited. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. ALI was evaluated and its prognosis was tracked. The association between ALI and death risk was analyzed. Results: Of 355 COVID-19 patients, 211 were common, 88 severe, and 51 critical ill cases, respectively. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients were with hypoproteinemia, 151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected, ALI was more common in critical ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and lymphocyte reduction were three important independent risk factors predicting ALI among COVID-19 patients. Death risk analysis shows that fatality rate was higher among patients with hypoproteinemia than those without hypoproteinemia (RR=9.471, P<0.001). Moreover, fatality rate was higher among patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (RR=2.182, P<0.05). Follow-up observation found that more than one hepatic functional indexes of two-third patients remained abnormal 14 days after discharge. Conclusions: ALI at early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients.

Exploitation of bioactive compounds from natural sources can aid in the discovery of new drugs, provide the scaffold of new medicines. In the face of challenging diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, for which there was no effective treatment, nature could offer insights as to novel therapeutic options for control measures. However, the environmental impact and supply chain of bioactive production must be carefully evaluated to ensure the detrimental effects will not outweigh the potential benefits gained. History has already proven that highly bioactive compounds can be rare and not suitable for medicinal exploitation; therefore, the sustainability must be accessed before expensive, time-demanding, and large trials can be initialized. A sustainable option to readily produce a phytotherapy with minimal environmental stress is the use of agro-industry wastes, a by-product produced in high quantities. In this review we evaluate the sustainability issues associated with the production of phytotherapy as a readily available tool for pandemic control.","Antonio, A.S.; Wiedemann, L.S.M.; Galante, E.B.F.; Guimarães, A.C.; Matharu, A.S.; Veiga-Junior, V.F.",Heliyon,145,15

Infection by EAV requires the release of the viral genome by fusion with the respective target membrane of the host cell. We have investigated the entry pathway of EAV into Baby Hamster Kindey cells (BHK). Infection of cells assessed by the plaque reduction assay was strongly inhibited by substances which interfere with clathrin-dependent endocytosis and by lysosomotropic compounds. Furthermore, infection of BHK cells was suppressed when clathrin-dependent endocytosis was inhibited by expression of antisense RNA of the clathrin-heavy chain before infection. These results strongly suggest that EAV is taken up via clathrin-dependent endocytosis and is delivered to acidic endosomal compartments.","Nitschke, Matthias; Korte, Thomas; Tielesch, Claudia; Ter-Avetisyan, Gohar; Tünnemann, Gisela; Cardoso, M.

While our group has recently observed acute decrements in vascular function and arterial stiffness, the long‐term implications of SARS‐CoV‐2 on arterial stiffness and vascular architecture in subsequent months is unknown. PURPOSE: : The purpose of this study was to determine the prolonged implications of SARS‐CoV‐2 on carotid stiffness, carotid‐femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and pulse wave analysis (PWA) three months after infection. We hypothesized PWVcf, carotid stiffness, and PWA measures would decrease three months after contracting SARS‐CoV‐2. METHODS: : We assessed 7 young adults (4M/3F) at baseline (3‐4 weeks after testing positive for SARS‐CoV‐2) and at 1‐month and 2‐month follow‐up visits. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess carotid distensibility, stiffness, carotid intima media thickness, and PWVcf. Sphygmocor was utilized to determine carotid distensibility and aortic augmentation (AIx), as well as brachial and aortic arterial pressures. RESULTS: : Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased following infection (BL: 98.7±4.8 mmHg; 1‐month follow‐up: 92.7±10.4mmHg; 2‐month follow‐up: 88.6±5.0mmHg; p<0.05). There was a tendency for brachial systolic blood pressure (BL: 129.7±8.5mmHg; 1‐month follow‐up: 124.9±12.3mmHg; 2‐month follow‐up: 121.4±8.4mmHg; p=0.073), brachial diastolic blood pressure (BL: 74.0±6.7mmHg; 1‐month follow‐up: 73.6±10.6mmHg; 2‐month follow‐up: 67.0±8.9; p=0.066), and aortic systolic pressure (BL: 123.9±7.3mmHg; 1‐month follow‐up: 119.7±11.9mmHg; 2‐month follow‐up: 114.1±7.1mmHg; p=0.089) and aortic diastolic pressure (BL: 74.00±6.6mmHg; 1‐month follow‐up: 73.4±10.7mmHg; 2‐month follow‐up: 67.3±9.4mmHg; p=0.068) to decrease (p<0.1). Carotid stiffness, PWVcf, PWA measures were unaltered months following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. CONCLUSION: : Preliminary results indicate a lack of improvement in arterial stiffness in young adults three months following contraction of SARS‐CoV‐2. The tendency for a decrease in arterial pressures, however, indicates a possible improvement of overall cardiovascular health.","Szeghy, Rachel; Province, Valesha; Koontz, Laurel; Bobo, Landry; Stute, Nina; Stickford, Abigail; Stickford, Jonathon; Ratchford, Stephen",FASEB J,145,21

Uniformed nurses have played a critical role during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines; however, uptake of literature is limited. This study assessed the relationship between quality of nursing work life (QNWL) and nurses’ attitudes and practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional design was used. Participants were recruited from four government hospitals in the Manila metropolitan area of the Philippines. Participants completed three questionnaires in an online survey: a demographic questionnaire, a QNWL questionnaire, and the attitude and practices toward COVID-19 questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, an independent t-test, a one-way analysis of variance, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and hierarchical linear regression were applied for data analysis. (3) Results: The mean age of the participants was 29 years. Most of the participants were single women who were not certified in their specialties. A total of QNWL scores were high, indicating that the participants displayed favorable attitudes and practices in relation to COVID-19. A statistically significant relationship was observed between QNWL, specialty certification, and practices related to COVID-19. Practices related to COVID-19 were a significant predictor of QNWL and one of its subscales, work design. (4) Conclusion: Young adult uniformed nurses in the Philippines have assumed numerous responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing these frontline nurses with comprehensive specialized education and training is crucial.","Navales, Juneffer Villamen; Jallow, Amadou Wurry; Lai, Chien Yu; Liu, Chieh Yu; Chen, Shu Wen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,145,16

Great progress in the mining of novel biomarkers from this diagnostic treasure trove for disease diagnosis and health monitoring has been achieved based on serum samples from healthy individuals and patients and powerful new approaches in biochemistry and systems biology. However, cumulative evidence indicates that many potential LMW protein biomarkers might still have escaped from detection due to their low abundance, the dynamic complexity of serum/plasma, and the limited efficiency of characterization approaches. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge with respect to strategies for the characterization of low-abundant LMW proteins (small intact or truncated proteins) from human serum/plasma, involving prefractionation or enrichment methods to reduce dynamic range and mass spectrometry-based characterization of low-abundant LMW proteins.","Cai, Tanxi; Yang, Fuquan",Enzymes,145,33

In a retrospective analysis of clinical samples collected from a prospectively-enrolled cohort of 358 children we sought associations between physician-attended illness visits and bacterial colonization in the first five years of life. A subset of children was identified by unsupervised clustering analysis as infection and allergy prone (IAP). Several respiratory infection- and allergy-mediated illnesses co-occurred at higher rates in IAP children, while the rates of other illnesses were not significantly different between the groups. Analyses of nasopharyngeal (NP) pathobionts and microbiota commensals showed that early age of first colonization with pathobionts Streptococcus pneumonia, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis was associated with IAP children, and particularly Moraxella abundance was negatively associated with NP microbiome diversity.

Anti-Xa assays can estimate anticoagulant effect for specific FXaI's. The aim of this study was to characterize anti-Xa levels in patients taking apixaban or rivaroxaban with major bleeding events. METHODS: Apixaban and rivaroxaban anti-Xa assays ordered within our hospital system from May 2016 to September 2019 were evaluated. The primary outcome was major bleeding events defined by International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. Median anti-Xa levels for each FXaI were calculated for those with and without major bleeding, as well as those who did and did not receive reversal agents. RESULTS: A total of 606 anti-Xa levels were analyzed. There were 146 major bleeding events documented, with the most common site being intracranial (63%). Median anti-Xa levels in patients with and without major bleeding were similar, whereas those on apixaban therapy who received reversal agents typically had higher anti-Xa levels (73 ng/mL vs. 153 ng/mL, p = 0.0019). Factors significantly associated with increased odds of bleeding were an age > 80 years, inappropriately high dosing regimens, and modest anti-Xa levels (100–300 ng/mL) for rivaroxaban specifically. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and inappropriately high dosing regimens were associated with major bleeding in patients taking apixaban and rivaroxaban.

In this study, by using a monoclonal antibody to the S1 protein of IBV M41 strain, we found that heat shock protein member 8 (HSPA8) could interact with spike protein of IBV. HSPA8 was found to be present on the cell membrane and chicken tissues, with highest expression level in the kidney. Results of co-IP and GST-pull-down assays indicated that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of IBV M41 could interact with HSPA8. The results of binding blocking assay and infection inhibition assay showed that recombinant protein HSPA8 and antibody to HSPA8 could inhibit IBV M41 infection of chicken embryonic kidney (CEK) cells. Further, we found that HSPA8 interacted with the N-terminal 19–272 amino acids of S1 of IBV Beaudette, H120 and QX strains and HSPA8 from human and pig also interacted with IBV M41-RBD. Finally the results of binding blocking assay and infection inhibition assay showed that recombinant HSPA8 protein and antibody to HSPA8 could inhibit IBV Beaudette strain infection of Vero cells that were treated with heparanase to remove heparan sulfate from the cell surface.

METHODS: We performed a multicenter observational study from 26 pediatric hospitals between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, including patients ≤ 18 years with dog bites, consolidating together encounters from patients with multiple encounters within 30 days as a single episode of care. We characterized diagnoses and procedures performed in these patients. We used generalized linear mixed models to identify factors associated with a composite outcome that we term clinically significant injuries (defined as admission, operating room charge, sedation, fractures/dislocations, intracranial/eye injury, skin/soft tissue infection, or in-hospital mortality). RESULTS: 68,833 episodes were included (median age 6.6 years [interquartile range 3.5–10.4 years], 55.5% male) from 67,781 patients. We identified 16,502 patients (24.0%) with clinically significant injuries, including 6653 (9.7%) admitted, 5080 (7.4%) managed in the operating room, 11,685 (17.0%) requiring sedation, 493 (0.7%) with a skull fracture, 32 (0.0%) with a fracture in the neck or trunk, 389 (0.6%) with a fracture of the upper limb, 51 (0.1%) with a fracture in the lower limb, 15 (0.0%) with dislocations, 66 (0.1%) with an intracranial injury and 164 (0.2%) with an injury to the eyeball, 3708 (5.4%) with skin/soft tissue infections, and 5 (0.0%) with in-hospital mortality. In multivariable analysis, younger age (0–4 years, 5–9 years, and 10–14 years relative to 15–18 years), weekday injuries, and an income in the second and third quartiles (relative to the lowest quartile) had higher odds of clinically significant injuries. Black patients (relative to White), Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and private insurance status (relative to public insurance) had lower odds of clinically important injuries. When evaluating individual components within the composite outcome, most followed broader trends. CONCLUSION: Dog bites are an important mechanism of injury encountered in children’s hospitals. Using a composite outcome measure, we identified younger, White, non-Hispanic children at higher risk of clinically significant injuries. Findings with respect to race and ethnicity and dog bite injuries warrant further investigation. Results can be used to identify populations for targeted prevention efforts to reduce severe dog bite injuries.
