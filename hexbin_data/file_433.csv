4124,4124,4124,A bibliometric analysis of IL-35 research from 2009 to 2018,15.336353,3.9929588,2019-10-30,"BACKGROUND: Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is a recently discovered cytokine that plays a role in immune suppression and has therefore been the subject of a great deal of research. A bibliometric analysis of the global research concerning IL-35, however, is rare. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this research was to assess the international scientific output of IL-35 research and explore its hotspots and frontiers from 2009 to 2018 by bibliometric analysis. METHODS: Publications about IL-35 research from 2009 to 2018 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Citespace V was used to analyze years, journals, countries, research institutions, areas of exploration, research hotspots, and trends of publication. RESULTS: We retrieved a total of 416 publications and observed a trend of publications increasing over the past decade. Original articles (351) were the most frequently occurring document type. The largest number of publications belonging to one country and one institution, respectively, was China (202) and Tianjin Medical University (17). Trending keywords may indicate frontier topics, including “infectious tolerance,” “autoimmune,” and “central nervous system.” CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable information on the study of IL-35 so that researchers may identify new research fields.","Cai, Xulong; Zhou, Chenrong; Zhou, Li; Xu, Qiaolan",PeerJ,433,1

The previous two decades have witnessed a combined endeavor across various biological sciences to address this issue in novel ways. The advent of recombinant DNA technologies has provided the tools for producing recombinant proteins that can be used as therapeutic agents. A number of expression systems have been developed for the production of pharmaceutical products. Recently, advances have been made using plants as bioreactors to produce therapeutic proteins directed against infectious diseases and cancers. This review highlights the recent progress in therapeutic protein expression in plants (stable and transient), the factors affecting heterologous protein expression, vector systems and recent developments in existing technologies and steps towards the industrial production of plant-made vaccines, antibodies, and biopharmaceuticals.","Fahad, Shah; Khan, Faheem Ahmed; Pandupuspitasari, Nuruliarizki Shinta; Ahmed, Muhammad Mahmood; Liao, Yu Cai; Waheed, Muhammad Tahir; Sameeullah, Muhammad; Darkhshan; Hussain, Saddam; Saud, Shah; Hassan, Shah; Jan, Amanullah; Jan, Mohammad Tariq; Wu, Chao; Chun, Ma Xiao; Huang, Jianliang",Biotechnol Lett,433,22

We hypothesize that tracheostomy has an independent negative impact on language and cognitive development in infants with severe BPD. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of de-identified data of infants with severe BPD who received tracheostomy at <2 years of age, compared with infants with severe BPD without tracheostomy. The primary outcomes measured were total language and cognitive scores at 2–3 years of age as determined by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients with tracheostomies and 28 patients without tracheostomies were analyzed. There was no significant difference in total language development or cognitive development between patients with tracheostomies and those without. Insurance status had an effect on language and cognition while controlling for trach status.

This study describes the clinical profile and recovery pattern of swallowing following inhalation burn injury. All patients admitted 2008–2017 with confirmed inhalation burns on laryngoscopy and managed by speech-language pathology (SLP) were included. Initial dysphagia presentation and dysphagia recovery pattern were documented using the FOIS. Co-presence of dysphonia was determined clinically and rated present/absent. Persistent laryngeal/pharyngeal injury at 6 months was documented using laryngoscopy. Data were compared to published data from a large adult burn cohort. All patients with confirmed inhalation burns during the study period received SLP input, enabling review of 38 patients (68% male; m = 40.8 years). Percent Total Body Surface Area burn ranged 1–90%, 100% had head and neck burns, 97% required mechanical ventilation (mean 9.4 days), 18% required tracheostomy and 100% had dysphonia. Comparing to non-inhalation burn patients, the inhalation cohort had significantly (p < 0.01) higher dysphagia incidence (89.47% vs 5.6%); more with severe dysphagia at presentation (78.9% vs 1.7%); increased duration to initiate oral intake (m = 24.69 vs 0.089 days); longer duration of enteral feeding (m = 45.03 vs 1.96 days); and longer duration to resolution of dysphagia (m = 29.79 vs 1.67 days). Persistent laryngeal pathology was present in 47.37% at 6 months. This study shows dysphagia incidence in burn patients with inhalation injury is 16 times greater than for those without inhalation injury. Laryngeal pathology due to inhalation injury increases dysphagia severity and duration to dysphagia recovery.","Clayton, N. A.; Ward, E. C.; Rumbach, A. F.; Cross, R. R.; Kol, M. R.; Maitz, P.

Our objective is to expand the phenotype of ADEM. A four-year-old girl was admitted to the pediatric emergency room of a university medical center five days after a common upper respiratory tract infection. Acute symptoms were fever, leg pain, and headaches. She developed meningeal signs, and her level of consciousness dropped rapidly. Epileptic seizure activity started, and she became comatose, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Serial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) illustrated the fulminant development of ADEM. Treatment escalation with high-dose corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, and plasma exchange did not lead to clinical improvement. On day ten, the patient developed treatment-refractory cardiogenic shock and passed away. The postmortem assessment confirmed ADEM and revealed acute lymphocytic myocarditis, likely explaining the acute cardiac failure. Human metapneumovirus and picornavirus were detected in the tracheal secrete by PCR. Data sources–medical chart of the patient. This case is consistent with evidence from experimental findings of an association of ADEM with myocarditis as a postinfectious systemic autoimmune response, with life-threatening involvement of the brain and heart.","Lademann, Hanne; Bertsche, Astrid; Petzold, Axel; Zack, Fred; Büttner, Andreas; Däbritz, Jan; Hauenstein, Christina; Bahn, Erik; Spang, Christian; Reuter, Daniel; Warnke, Philipp; Ehler, Johannes",Medicina (Kaunas),433,1

This study explores patterns of health behaviors among a sample of Australian university students, and determines whether patterns of health behaviors are associated with psychological distress and demographic characteristics. Cross-sectional data from the University of Newcastle Student Healthy Lifestyle Survey 2019 were analyzed. Fruit and vegetable intake, sugar-sweetened beverage intake, physical activity, sitting time, smoking, alcohol intake, drug use, sleep and psychological distress were assessed. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify patterns of health risk behaviors, and latent class regression to explore associations between psychological distress and demographic characteristics with health behavior classes. Analysis included 1965 students (mean age 25.8 ± 8.6 years, 70.7% female). Three patterns of health behaviors were identified: healthier (48.6%), moderate (40.2%) and unhealthy (11.2%) lifestyle classes. Students in the moderate and unhealthy lifestyle classes had higher odds of moderate (OR 1.43 and 2.37) and high/very high psychological distress risk (OR 2.71 and 11.69). Students in the unhealthy and moderate lifestyle classes had a higher odds of being male, younger, enrolled in transition to university and English language courses, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent and to report some financial difficulty. Study findings may be used to inform the design of mental health interventions for university students that target key health risk behaviors.","Hutchesson, Melinda J.; Duncan, Mitch J.; Oftedal, Stina; Ashton, Lee M.; Oldmeadow, Christopher; Kay-Lambkin, Frances; Whatnall, Megan C.",Nutrients,433,22

The objectives of this study were to identify novel genetic variants influencing ATV metabolism and outcomes in Chinese patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). A total of 1079 CAD patients were enrolled and followed for 5 years. DNA from the blood and human liver tissue samples were genotyped using either Global Screening Array-24 v1.0 BeadChip or HumanOmniZhongHua-8 BeadChip. Concentrations of ATV and its metabolites in plasma and liver samples were determined using a verified ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method. The patients carrying A allele for the rs4148323 polymorphism (UGT1A1) showed an increase in 2-hydroxy ATV/ATV ratio (p = 1.69E−07, false discovery rate [FDR] = 8.66E−03) relative to the value in individuals without the variant allele. The result was further validated by an independent cohort comprising an additional 222 CAD patients (p = 1.08E−07). Moreover, the rs4148323 A allele was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.774; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.031–3.052; p = 0.0198).

Although the HPV vaccine is safe and effective, vaccination rates remain below the Healthy People 2030 goal of 80% coverage. Engaging dental providers, who have experience with patient education and oropharyngeal cancer, may prove useful in efforts to increase vaccination rates. Our research explores dental providers’ (dentists, dental hygienists) willingness to participate in continuing education about HPV, educate parents of adolescents, recommend the vaccine for adolescents, and refer parents to medical providers. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods approach and conducted a survey with dental hygienists and semistructured interviews with dental providers. We produced frequencies and descriptive statistics for all variables and used regression modeling to explore factors related to willingness to promote the HPV vaccine. We used a deductive approach to code interview transcripts. RESULTS: Regression models using survey data (n = 470) showed that after controlling for demographic and practice-level characteristics, higher levels of willingness were associated with thinking that parents would act on a recommendation and thinking that engaging in HPV promotion is within the scope of practice. Interview data reflected willingness of dental providers to work on HPV vaccination, but revealed barriers (eg, time, knowledge) that need to be addressed. DISCUSSION: Overall, dental providers expressed a willingness to participate in HPV vaccine promotion, and future efforts should focus on addressing barriers to doing so. Engaging dental providers in HPV vaccine recommendation and referral can help prevent future HPV-related cancers.","Askelson, Natoshia; Ryan, Grace; McKernan, Susan; Scherer, Aaron; Daly, Eliza; Avdic, Lejla",Prev Chronic Dis,433,1

However, it was generally misunderstood and demanding to convey out effectively. Nursing students were not confident and did not feel free to practise clinical skills during practical placements because of the nature of the feedback they received whilst in these placements. Moreover, they experienced feedback as a barrier to completing practical workbooks. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to report on a qualitative study, which explored nursing students’ perceptions of the feedback they received in clinical settings, at a district hospital. METHOD: This study was conducted at a district hospital located in southern Namibia. An explorative qualitative design with an interpretivist perspective was followed. A total of 11 nursing students from two training institutions were recruited by purposive sampling and were interviewed individually. All interviews were audio recorded with a digital voice recorder followed by verbatim transcriptions, with the participants’ permission. Thereafter, data were analysed manually by qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Themes that emerged as findings of this study are feedback is perceived as a teaching and learning process in clinical settings; participants perceived the different nature of feedback in clinical settings; participants perceived personal and interpersonal implications of feedback and there were strategies to improve feedback in clinical settings. CONCLUSION: Nursing students appreciated the feedback they received in clinical settings, despite the challenges related to group feedback and the emotional reactions it provoked. Nursing students should be prepared to be more receptive to the feedback conveyed in clinical settings.","Nuuyoma, Vistolina",Curationis,433,22

They are, therefore, regarded as a potential source for stem cell therapy. Fisetin is a bioactive flavonoid known as an active antioxidant molecule that has been reported to inhibit cell growth in various cell types. Fisetin was shown to play a role in regulating osteogenic differentiation in animal-derived MSCs; however, its molecular mechanism is not well understood. We, therefore, studied the effect of fisetin on the biological properties of human MSCs derived from chorion tissue and its role in human osteogenesis using MSCs and osteoblast-like cells (SaOs-2) as a model. We found that fisetin inhibited proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs as well as human SaOs-2 cells. Fisetin could reduce Yes-associated protein (YAP) activity, which results in downregulation of osteogenic genes and upregulation of fibroblast genes. Further analysis using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggests that fisetin occupied the hydrophobic TEAD pocket preventing YAP from associating with TEA domain (TEAD). This finding supports the potential application of flavonoids like fisetin as a protein–protein interaction disruptor and also suggesting an implication of fisetin in regulating human osteogenesis.","Lorthongpanich, Chanchao; Charoenwongpaiboon, Thanapon; Supakun, Prapasri; Klaewkla, Methus; Kheolamai, Pakpoom; Issaragrisil, Surapol",Antioxidants (Basel),433,1

In KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, South Africa (SA), the epicentre of the country’s HIV epidemic, improving KAP is essential for reduce its incidence amongst individuals with SMI. Comparing the KAP related to HIV between those with SMI and chronic medical illnesses (CMI) such as hypertension and diabetes may expose gaps in KAP related to HIV in the mentally ill who are more vulnerable to HIV. AIM: This study aimed to compare the KAP related to HIV between people living with SMI and CMI. SETTING: Outpatient clinics in Durban, SA. METHODS: A cross-sectional structured questionnaire survey was conducted amongst 214 adult outpatients with SMI and CMI attending two general public sector hospitals in Durban, KZN. The KAP questionnaire consisted of three sections: general information, prevention and transmission of HIV. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 124 patients with SMI and 90 with CMI. Most were female (69.5%), single (57.5%) and unemployed (59.4%). The diagnosis of SMI was associated with poorer general information of HIV (p = 0.02), but not with its prevention and transmission compared with those with CMI. Educational level was associated with poorer performance in all three domains: general information of HIV (p = 0.01), prevention (p = 0.01) and transmission (p = 0.02) amongst all the participants. CONCLUSION: Gaps in the KAP of HIV amongst individuals with SMI compared with those with CMI suggested a need to provide focused health promotion regarding sexual health and HIV to the mentally ill at psychiatric facilities.","Matshoba, Thembeka; Mashaphu, Sibongile; Tomita, Andrew; Paruk, Saeeda",S Afr J Psychiatr,433,1

The survey was an in-person, paper, 26-item survey in which clinicians were asked to estimate the probability of adverse disease outcomes and expected effects of therapies for diseases common in primary care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated chance that treatments would benefit an individual patient. RESULTS: Of 723 clinicians, 585 (81%) responded, and 542 completed all the questions necessary for analysis, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 32 (29-44) years, 287 (53%) women, and 294 (54%) White participants. Clinicians consistently overestimated the chance that treatments would benefit an individual patient. The median (IQR) estimated chance that warfarin would prevent a stroke in the next year was 50% (5%-80%) compared with scientific evidence, which indicates an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 0.2% to 1.0% based on a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 39% to 50%. The median (IQR) estimated chance that antihypertensive therapy would prevent a cardiovascular event within 5 years was 30% (10%-70%) vs evidence of an ARR of 0% to 3% based on an RRR of 0% to 28%. The median (IQR) estimated chance that bisphosphonate therapy would prevent a hip fracture in the next 5 years was 40% (10%-60%) vs evidence of ARR of 0.1% to 0.4% based on an RRR of 20% to 40%. The median (IQR) estimated chance that moderate-intensity statin therapy would prevent a cardiovascular event in the next 5 years was 20% (IQR 5%-50%) vs evidence of an ARR of 0.3% to 2% based on an RRR of 19% to 33%. Estimates of the chance that a treatment would prevent an adverse outcome exceeded estimates of the absolute chance of that outcome for 60% to 70% of clinicians. Clinicians whose overestimations were greater were more likely to report using that treatment for patients in their practice (eg, use of warfarin: correlation coefficient, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.40-0.53; P < .001).

Epigenetic reprogramming in EGFR-activated GBM has recently been suggested to downregulate the expression of tumour suppressor genes. Histone acetylation is important for chromatin structure and function. However, the role and biological function of H2AZK4/7AC in tumours have not yet been clarified. RESULTS: In our study, we found that EGFR-vIII negatively regulated H2AZK4/7AC expression though the PI3K/AKT-HDAC2 axis. Because HDAC1 and HDAC2 are highly homologous enzymes that usually form multi-protein complexes for transcriptional regulation and epigenetic landscaping, we simultaneously knocked out HDAC1 and HDAC2 and found that H2AZK4/7AC and H3K27AC were upregulated, which partially released EGFR-vIII-mediated inhibition of USP11, negative regulator of cell cycle. In addition, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that FK228 induced G1/S transition arrest in GBM with EGFR-vIII mutation. FK228 could enhance anti-tumour activity by upregulating expression of the tumour suppressor USP11 in GBM cells. CONCLUSIONS: EGFR-vIII mutation downregulates H2AZK4/7AC and H3K27AC, inhibiting USP11 expression though the PI3K/AKT-HDAC1/2 axis. FK228 is an effective and promising treatment for GBM with EGFR-vIII mutation.","Zhao, Hongyu; Wang, Yunfei; Yang, Chao; Zhou, Junhu; Wang, Lin; Yi, Kaikai; Li, Yansheng; wang, Qixue; Shi, Jin; Kang, Chunsheng; Zeng, Liang",Clin Transl Med,433,22

Transfection of SARS-CoV spike into Vero E6, HEK293T and HL-CZ cells leads to strong expression of the glycosylated spike protein, as shown by Western blot analyses and immunofluorescent imaging using spike-specific human monoclonal antibodies, indicating the potential utility of these antigens and antibodies as diagnostic reagents. Furthermore, we employed cDNA microarray analysis to probe the changes in host gene transcription attributed to transfection of a codon-optimized spike construct into the HL-CZ cell line of monocyte lineage that is linked to immunological responses. A diverse representation of 100 genes displayed altered transcriptional patterns in response to SARS-CoV spike expression, with 61 upregulated and 39 downregulated genes.

In contrast, genes involved in cell metabolism and cytoskeleton formation were notably downregulated. The transcripts of other functional categories exhibited varied responses to SARS-CoV spike transfection. Collectively, our analyses elucidate numerous and complex transcriptomic events that occur in response to spike protein expression and that contribute towards SARS-CoV pathogenesis.","Narasaraju, T.; Soong, P.

Such large-scale incursion into privacy and data protection is unthinkable during times of normalcy. However, in times of a pandemic the use of location data provided by telecom operators and/or technology companies becomes a viable option. Importantly, legal regulations hardly protect people’s privacy against governmental and corporate misuse. Established privacy regimes are focused on individual consent, and most human rights treaties know derogations from privacy and data protection norms for states of emergency. This leaves little safeguards nor remedies to guarantee individual and collective autonomy. However, the challenge of responsible data use during a crisis is not novel. The humanitarian sector has more than a decade of experience to offer.

Several cases of this disease are reported worldwide annually. Nevertheless, the relationship between the immunogenicity of R. akari and disease development is still poorly understood. Thus, misdiagnosis is frequent. Our study is aiming to identify immunogenic proteins that may improve disease recognition and enhance subsequent treatment. To achieve this goal, two proteomics methodologies were applied, followed by immunoblot confirmation. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixteen unique proteins were identified in the whole-cell extract of R. akari. The most represented protein groups were found to be those involved in translation, post-translational modifications, energy production, and cell wall development. A significant number of proteins belonged to amino acid transport and intracellular trafficking. Also, some proteins affecting the virulence were detected. In silico analysis of membrane enriched proteins revealed 25 putative outer membrane proteins containing beta-barrel structure and 11 proteins having a secretion signal peptide sequence. Using rabbit and human sera, various immunoreactive proteins were identified from which the 44 kDa uncharacterized protein (A8GP63) has demonstrated a unique detection capability. It positively distinguished the sera of patients with Rickettsialpox from other rickettsiae positive human sera. CONCLUSION: Our proteomic analysis certainly contributed to the lack of knowledge of R. akari pathogenesis. The result obtained may also serve as a guideline for a more accurate diagnosis of rickettsial diseases. The identified 44 kDa uncharacterized protein can be certainly used as a unique marker of rickettsialpox or as a target molecule for the development of more effective treatment.","Csicsay, František; Flores-Ramirez, Gabriela; Zuñiga-Navarrete, Fernando; Bartošová, Mária; Fučíková, Alena; Pajer, Petr; Dresler, Jiří; Škultéty, Ľudovít; Quevedo-Diaz, Marco",BMC Microbiol,433,1

For ultimate treatment to cure T2DM, association of diabetes with immune components provides a strong basis for immunotherapies and vaccines developments that could stimulate the immune cells to minimize the insulin resistance and initiate gluconeogenesis through an insulin independent route. METHODOLOGY: Immunoinformatics based approach was used to design a polyvalent vaccine for T2DM that involved data accession, antigenicity analysis, T-cell epitopes prediction, conservation and proteasomal evaluation, functional annotation, interactomic and in silico binding affinity analysis. RESULTS: We found the binding affinity of antigenic peptides with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class-I molecules for immune activation to control T2DM. We found 13-epitopes of 9 amino acid residues for multiple alleles of MHC class-I bears significant binding affinity. The downstream signaling resulted by T-cell activation is directly regulated by the molecular weight, amino acid properties and affinity of these epitopes. Each epitope has important percentile rank with significant ANN IC(50) values. These high score potential epitopes were linked using AAY, EAAAK linkers and HBHA adjuvant to generate T-cell polyvalent vaccine with a molecular weight of 35.6 kDa containing 322 amino acids residues. In silico analysis of polyvalent construct showed the significant binding affinity (− 15.34 Kcal/mol) with MHC Class-I. This interaction would help to understand our hypothesis, potential activation of T-cells and stimulatory factor of cytokines and GLUT1 receptors. CONCLUSION: Our system-level immunoinformatics approach is suitable for designing potential polyvalent therapeutic vaccine candidates for T2DM by reducing hyperglycemia and enhancing metabolic activities through the immune system.","Muhammad, Syed Aun; Ashfaq, Hiba; Zafar, Sidra; Munir, Fahad; Jamshed, Muhammad Babar; Chen, Jake; Zhang, Qiyu",BMC Mol Cell Biol,433,1

One major trend is the fact that students are taking an increasing proportion of their courses online. That is, a growing number of students at not-for-profit private and public colleges and universities are taking some of their course work online and completing other parts in face-to-face courses. What impact does this mix of online and in-person course modalities have on student success? We answer this question by looking at political science majors at a large public university in the USA, taking into account demographics, achievement, and the mix of course modalities the students take (n = 1173). Through descriptive statistics, regression analysis, and predicted probabilities, we analyze how the mix of course modalities students enroll in impacts student success and retention. Results indicate that the success of all students declines as they take a greater proportion of their course load online. As universities seek to address this trend in higher education, they need to be particularly sensitive to ways to increase the success of online learners. Considering the needs of online learners is particularly relevant in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has prompted the shift to online education across the USA and elsewhere, a trend that is likely to continue in the future.","Hamann, Kerstin; Glazier, Rebecca A.; Wilson, Bruce M.; Pollock, Philip H.",Eur Polit Sci,433,1

The role of selenium is mainly played through selenoproteins synthesized by the selenium metabolic system. Selenoproteins have a wide range of cellular functions including regulation of selenium transport, thyroid hormones, immunity, and redox homeostasis. Selenium deficiency contributes to various diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, liver disease, and arthropathy—Kashin–Beck disease (KBD) and osteoarthritis (OA). A skeletal developmental disorder, KBD has been reported in low-selenium areas of China, North Korea, and the Siberian region of Russia, and can be alleviated by selenium supplementation. OA, the most common form of arthritis, is a degenerative disease caused by an imbalance in matrix metabolism and is characterized by cartilage destruction. Oxidative stress serves as a major cause of the initiation of OA pathogenesis. Selenium deficiency and dysregulation of selenoproteins are associated with impairments to redox homeostasis in cartilage. We review the recently explored roles of selenium metabolism and selenoproteins in cartilage with an emphasis on two arthropathies, KBD and OA. Moreover, we discuss the potential of therapeutic strategies targeting the biological functions of selenium and selenoproteins for OA treatment.","Kang, Donghyun; Lee, Jeeyeon; Wu, Cuiyan; Guo, Xiong; Lee, Byeong Jae; Chun, Jang-Soo; Kim, Jin-Hong",Exp Mol Med,433,22

A positive result using Tru‐cut biopsy (TCB) and fine‐needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has high diagnostic specificity, but information about the capacity of these techniques to correctly identify cats with FIP lesions is not available. Objectives: The diagnostic sensitivity of TCB and FNAB for detecting liver and kidney histologic lesions caused by FIP was evaluated. Methods: TCB and FNAB specimens collected mainly at necropsy from 25 cats with FIP were analyzed. Diagnostic sensitivity was calculated on the basis of the number of false‐negative and true‐positive specimens, compared with the number of organs bearing histologic lesions of FIP. Results: Diagnostic sensitivity was higher for hepatic TCB (64%) and FNAB (82%) than for renal (39% and 42%, respectively) procedures. A high percentage of renal cytologic and TCB specimens were inadequate. Combined analysis of TCB and FNAB specimens collected from the same organ increased the diagnostic sensitivity for liver (86%) and kidney (48%). The sensitivity of immunohistochemical/cytochemical analysis was low (11–38% depending on the technique), probably due to variable distribution of feline coronavirus in the lesions. Conclusion: Biopsy of liver and kidney can correctly identify FIP lesions. However, false‐negative results or inadequate samples occur with moderate frequency, especially for immunochemical analysis. Diagnostic sensitivity may be increased when both TCB and FNAB specimens from the same organ are examined.","Giordano, Alessia; Paltrinieri, Saverio; Bertazzolo, Walter; Milesi, Emanuela; Parodi, Margherita",Vet Clin Pathol,433,16

The use of machine learning seems to be a great way to improve the accuracy of empirical equations currently used in this field. Accordingly, this study utilized tree predictive models (i.e., random forest (RF), random tree (RT), and classification and regression trees (CART)) as well as a novel feature selection (FS) technique to introduce a new model capable of estimating the punching shear capacity of the SFRC flat slabs. Furthermore, to automatically create the structure of the predictive models, the current study employed a sequential algorithm of the FS model. In order to perform the training stage for the proposed models, a dataset consisting of 140 samples with six influential components (i.e., the depth of the slab, the effective depth of the slab, the length of the column, the compressive strength of the concrete, the reinforcement ratio, and the fiber volume) were collected from the relevant literature. Afterward, the sequential FS models were trained and verified using the above-mentioned database. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed models for both testing and training datasets, various statistical indices, including the coefficient of determination (R(2)) and root mean square error (RMSE), were utilized. The results obtained from the experiments indicated that the FS-RT model outperformed FS-RF and FS-CART models in terms of prediction accuracy. The range of R(2) and RMSE values were obtained as 0.9476–0.9831 and 14.4965–24.9310, respectively; in this regard, the FS-RT hybrid technique demonstrated the best performance. It was concluded that the three hybrid techniques proposed in this paper, i.e., FS-RT, FS-RF, and FS-CART, could be applied to predicting SFRC flat slabs.","Lu, Shasha; Koopialipoor, Mohammadreza; Asteris, Panagiotis G.; Bahri, Maziyar; Armaghani, Danial Jahed",Materials (Basel),433,1

Vitamin K deficiency result in the failure of the matrix GLA protein (MGP) to undergo carboxylation. MGP is a natural local inhibitor of vascular calcification and the lack of functional carboxylated MGP may contribute to increase vascular calcification. Vitamin K supplement should therefore correct this anomaly and decrease the rate or severity of vascular calcification in this population of patients on long-term maintenance hemodialysis. Our study seeks to evaluate the prevalence and the progression of vascular calcification in a cohort of maintenance hemodialysis patients. It will also evaluate the efficacy of vitamin K supplementation in reducing the progression of vascular calcification in this group of patients. METHODS: This will be a single-center randomized, prospective and open-label interventional clinical trial of end stage renal failure patients on hemodialysis. We aim to recruit 200 patients. Eligible patients will be randomized to either the standard care arm or active treatment arm. Active treatment arm patients will receive standard care plus supplementation with oral vitamin K2 isoform 360 mcg 3 times weekly for a total duration of 18 months. Primary outcome measured will be absolute difference in coronary artery calcification score at 18-month between control and intervention arms. Secondary outcomes will be to compare absolute difference in aortic valve calcification, percentage of patients with regression of coronary artery calcification of at least 10%, absolute difference in aortic and systemic arterial stiffness, mortality from any cause and major adverse cardiovascular over the same period. DISCUSSION: Evidence of successful regression or retardation of vascular calcification will support the conduct of larger and longer-term trials aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in this high-risk population using a safe and inexpensive strategy TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02870829.

We examined environmental, sociodemographic, and behavioral risk factors predicting generalized anxiety among older African Americans in a large metropolitan area during the COVID-19 outbreak. Sixty African American participants (92% female) age 65 and older were recruited from the Wayne State University Institute of Gerontology Healthier Black Elders Center. In addition to initial demographic questions, the scale (5-point Likert scale from “Not At All” to “A Great Deal”) assessed a range of everyday concerns, such as time spent indoors; family relationships; economic problems; restricted freedom of movement; and access to food, cleaning supplies, medical care, and personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants also completed a brief generalized anxiety screener, GAD-7. Of the 60 participants, 5 reported they were COVID-19 infected and their responses were not used for the analyses. Older Black Americans reported that during the pandemic, they were most affected by: Illness in Family (53%), Death in Family (35%) and Isolation (75%). Significant risk factors for anxiety were: Missing Close Ones, Annoyance, Sense of Safety, Media Coverage, and Time Indoors (explaining 58% of variance). The current study highlights everyday risk factors for anxiety in the context of the coronavirus pandemic among city-dwelling African Americans. Identified factors are common concerns that may be ameliorated with reasonable interventions. More research is needed in order to fully understand the scope and correlates of anxiety during these challenging times.","Bass, Dwana; Hanna, Sophie; Shair, Sarah; DiCerbo, Loraine; Giordani, Bruno; Kavcic, Voyko",Innov Aging,433,1

According to CDC, among older adults over 60 years the risk increases with age, with the highest risk of serious illness and death among those over 80 years. While public has been receiving messages about the risks and how to take preventive measures, it is not clear how the care homes serving older adults have been preparing. Data have been collected as part of an ongoing study from 30 independent living, assisted living, and memory care facilities across the United States. The centers were selected with a snowball sampling technique. Administrators of the centers were interviewed with a semi-structured questionnaire. It was apparent that although awareness of risks was high, preparation appears to be inadequate with little resources available at the time of the survey. Variation of preparedness based on the sociodemographic characteristics of the residents suggests that homes that serve predominantly minority and economically disadvantaged have greater likelihood of lacking preventive resources. It is critical that facilities serving older adults be prepared to ensure an effective healthcare response in the wake of novel viruses, such as COVID-19.","Amin, Iftekhar",Innov Aging,433,1

At that time, the NATO Resolute Support mission involved nearly 17,000 troops from 38 partner nations, plus civilians who support the mission, scattered throughout Afghanistan. While Afghanistan did not initially report many confirmed cases, large numbers of cases were reported from neighboring countries with known migration across the borders (sometimes thousands/day). Military medical leaders advised commanders regarding the potential health risks to the force, balancing with risks to the mission. Quarantine and isolation protocols were established. Public health interventions of social distancing, cloth mask wear, enhanced environmental cleaning, active case finding, and emphasis on hand hygiene and cough etiquette were enforced. However, many base locations were unable to alleviate close living quarters. Testing was identified as a means to assess risk to the population. Testing capabilities were limited, particularly PCR. When this testing strategy was established, the utilization and interpretation of antibody tests was quite controversial. With rapid antibody kits, the time to detection of both IgM and IgG are similar; detection of either cannot identify the time since exposure. METHODS: A novel surveillance plan was established whereby subpopulations at highest risk for exposure to the virus were screened with antibody tests from 17 Apr-1 Jun, 2020. High risk populations included: those leaving quarantine, base defense guards, isolation unit guards, medical personnel, dining facility workers, and those who interact with local populations. Individuals with detectable antibody (either IgM or IgG) were further evaluated with PCR tests. RESULTS: In the first six weeks of this testing strategy, 1957 antibody tests were utilized. A total of 37 specimens were identified antibody positives with seroprevalence of 2% (Figure 1). Thirteen were identified to have positive IgG, 22 with IgM, and 2 with both. PCR was performed on those with detectable antibody, 13 (35%) had positive PCR. CONCLUSION: Serosurveillance of populations at high risk for exposure to the virus is a logical way to conserve testing resources in a constrained combat environment. DISCLOSURES: Alex M.

Clinical features included in the MIS-C case definition (e.g fever, elevated inflammatory markers) overlap with features of other childhood infections. The prevalence of non-SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients evaluated for MIS-C has not been described. Patients evaluated for MIS-C, and therapies administered. [Image: see text] METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients < 21 years of age admitted to a freestanding children’s hospital in Boston, MA from May 14-June 6, 2020 who were evaluated for MIS-C. We identified patients undergoing Rheumatology consultation and echocardiogram (per the hospital’s protocol for evaluating children with suspicion for MIS-C). We tabulated patients evaluated for MIS-C found to have non-SARS-CoV-2 infection detected on standard microbiologic testing. RESULTS: 39 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age was 5 years (IQR 2–12 years). Of evaluated patients, 19/39 (49%) were diagnosed with MIS-C according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health case definition; 10/39 (26%) required ICU admission. Non-SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified in 7/39 (18%), of whom 5/7 (71%) had bacterial infections, 1/7 (14%) had viral infection, and 1/7 (14%) had viral and bacterial co-infections; no fungal or parasitic infections were identified. Of patients diagnosed with MIS-C, 2/19 (11%) were found to have non-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, 5/19 (26%) had a positive polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 at time of MIS-C diagnosis, of whom 4/5 (80%) received remdesivir. Of patients evaluated for MIS-C, 17/39 (44%) received intravenous immune globulin, 14/39 (36%) aspirin, 4/39 (10%) anakinra, and 14/39 (36%) methylprednisolone. Additionally, 21/39 (54%) received antibacterial and 5/39 (13%) antiviral therapy (Table). CONCLUSION: In this study, non-SARS-CoV-2 infections were diagnosed in 18% of children evaluated for MIS-C. Clinicians should consider alternative or concomitant infectious diagnoses in patients undergoing MIS-C evaluation.

We report an abnormal EEG pattern in a later-stage elderly patient with septic shock and EEG analysis results. CASE PRESENTATION: An 88-year-old woman with bowel perforation underwent emergency Hartmann surgery. On admission to the operating room, she exhibited septic shock. Her bispectral index value was 30 before anesthesia induction, and the EEG displayed slow waves without burst and suppression throughout the surgery. The relative slow-wave ratio [spectral power (0.5–8 Hz)/(0.5–30 Hz)] from anesthetic induction to the end of surgery was 95.1%, whereas the relative alpha frequency [spectral power (8–13 Hz)/(0.5–30 Hz)] was only 2.4%. Although without preoperative neurological abnormalities, she developed postoperative delirium after admission to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative continuous EEG monitoring in elderly patients with sepsis may be useful to predict sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Therefore, continuous EEG monitoring may improve neurological outcomes.","Kinoshita, Hirotaka; Kushikata, Tetsuya; Takekawa, Daiki; Hirota, Kazuyoshi",JA Clin Rep,433,1

Looking at working days only, we estimate a Swiss-wide decrease in electricity consumption of 7.4%. Assuming industry, services, transport, and agriculture account for 67% of electricity demand, the 4.6% decrease in electricity use implies an almost 7% output reduction in these sectors.

It has been found that the students perceiving activities with gamifications are good learning stimuli in entrepreneurial classrooms as a first step; then, they found it effective to learn and deepen their understanding of theories and models as a second step after the gaming activities, which is a reverse approach from a traditional business education approach. Gamification enables students to think critically on game scenarios via participation in gamifications, which can be strengthened and embedded in their mind by theoretical learning which follows the gaming activities.

RESULTS: The fresh leaves of Cinnamomum cappara was collected from local areas of Thrissur during December 2019. Plants were identified and authenticated by morphological and molecular characterization. The enzymatic action was analyzed by plotting Lineweaver–Burk plot which suggested that the extract possess the Km 185.77 μM for casein as substrate and obeyed Michaelis–Menten kinetics with typical hyperbolic relation with enzyme and increasing concentration of substrate. The effect of extract upon study subject was in directly proportional with concentration of antagonist where higher activities were obtained in high concentrations. The anatomical and histological studies suggested that the activity of extract was due to the degradation of muscular bundle of subject that resulted in the leakage of ceolomic fluid.

To this end, we identified two distinct proglucagons, Gcga and Gcgb, as well as GCG receptors, Gcgra and Gcgrb, in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Using the cAMP response element (CRE)-luciferase reporter system, tilapia GCGa and GCGb could reciprocally activate the two GCG receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that differential expression of the Gcga and Gcgb and their cognate receptors Gcgra and Gcgrb was found in the various tissues of tilapia. In particular, the Gcgrb is abundantly expressed in the neurointermediate lobe (NIL) of the pituitary gland. In primary cultures of tilapia NIL cells, GCGb effectively stimulated SL release, with parallel rises in the mRNA levels, and co-incubation with the GCG antagonist prevented GCGb-stimulated SL release. In parallel experiments, GCGb treatment dose-dependently enhanced intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation with increasing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) concentration and the resulting in transient increases of Ca(2+) signals in the primary NIL cell culture. Using selective pharmacological approaches, the adenylyl cyclase (AC)/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and phospholipase C (PLC)/IP3/Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)/CaMK-II pathways were shown to be involved in GCGb-induced SL release and mRNA expression. Together, these results provide evidence for the first time that GCGb can act at the pituitary level to stimulate SL release and gene expression via GCGRb through the activation of the AC/cAMP/PKA and PLC/IP3/Ca(2+)/CaM/CaMK-II cascades.","Zhang, Chaoyi; Lian, Anji; Xu, Yue; Jiang, Quan",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),433,1

Using the theoretical lens of surveillance, we found that travelers are digitally surveilled not only by their friends and family members on social media, but also by their superiors and colleagues through email and social networks. The expectations of being constantly available and responsive extend into their holiday, which makes it difficult for travelers to truly disconnect and enjoy their digital free travel experience. At the same time, they are inclined to engage in social surveillance of their peers which creates the constant urge to learn about any updates from their private and professional networks. We contribute to the tourism and information systems literature, by explaining how private and professional commitment influence the digital-free travel experience and extend the concept of surveillance to the work context.","McKenna, Brad; Waizenegger, Lena; Cai, Wenjie",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,433,1

Up to 30% of water is lost through leaks in water distribution networks. It is common practice to monitor water usage in large water distribution networks. These monitoring systems unfortunately lack the ability to alert on high flow rates and detect water leaks unless the data is reviewed manually. The paper will explore statistical and Artificial Intelligence approaches to test the viability to detect leaks. This will can then be used as an alerting team to improve operational efficiencies of small teams and reduce repair time of leaks and thus reduces water lost through leaks.,"de Coning, Arno; Mouton, Francois",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,433,12

We are taking into consideration literature related to the term resilience and compile information from local tour operators in order to demonstrate the crisis, the promotion means used, and the option to implement virtual reality in such promotion. Results show that the closure of borders directly affect this area since foreign visitors represent 95% of tourists, so meeting the 80 activities being offered, as well as the specialized culinary services, and the variety of hotels from big and small businesspeople, is affected. Confinement represents a barrier for the national tourist, but it becomes an opportunity for a personalized promotion.

Little has been published toward validation of quantitative adaptability models. This paper proposes a scoring system for evaluating the design-based adaptability of college campus buildings. This system was created to be a tool to guide future designs. Different physical features (i.e., floor-to-floor height and structural span lengths) of the buildings are considered in the scores. Adaptability scores are calculated for four buildings on Clemson University’s campus. Scores are compared to those from an earlier study of the same buildings; the earlier study quantified adaptability by surveying experts through an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Both approaches rank the subject buildings in the same order with respect to adaptability. Additionally, scores from both approaches are linearly correlated. These encouraging results suggest that the proposed scoring system is a starting point for quantifying the adaptability of college campus buildings.","McFarland, Delaney E.; Ross, Brandon E.; Albright, Dustin",Sustainability in Energy and Buildings 2020,433,1

In this study we explore the differences in platelet indices and their kinetics between sepsis survivors and non-survivors. A retrospective cohort-study of 97 cases of culture-positive sepsis at a tertiary-care center in North India. Demographics, clinical and laboratory parameters at admission were assessed. Platelet count (PLT), mean-platelet-volume (MPV), platelet-distribution-width (PDW) and plateletcrit (PCT) on admission, and third, fifth and last days of hospitalization were analyzed. Fractional change in platelet indices (ΔMPV(72h,) ΔPDW(72h), ΔPCT(72h), and ΔPLT(72h)) by day-3 were calculated. Unpaired and paired t-tests were used to compare survivors with non-survivors, and to study the change in platelet indices with time. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. ROC-curves and optimum cut-offs to predict mortality were obtained. There were 64 survivors. Non-survivors had significantly higher ΔMPV(72h,) ΔPDW(72h,) day-1 MPV and PDW, and lower ΔPLT(72h). MPV and PDW increased, and PLT decreased with time among non-survivors. Trends were reversed in survivors. Only MPV and PDW showed significant change by day-3. Both were independent predictors of mortality on multivariate analysis, alongside ΔMPV(72h) and ΔPLT(72h). On ROC analysis, MPV, PDW, ΔMPV(72h,) ΔPDW(72h) and ΔPLT(72h) effectively predicted mortality. Cut-off for MPV was 10.25 fL (sensitivity = 93.9%, specificity = 60.9%), and PDW, 12.6% (sensitivity = 84.8%, specificity = 51.6%). A rise in MPV and a fall in PLT was associated with mortality in this study. MPV and PDW values at admission are effective predictors of mortality and may be used in conjunction with traditional parameters.","Mangalesh, Sridhar; Dudani, Sharmila; Malik, Ajay",Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,433,1

The problem has been exacerbated in recent years due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens especially among bacteria. Despite the many obvious developments in diagnostic technology and infection control practices, morbidity, mortality, and cost of care remains high due to infections in the setting of HSCT. Molecular methods in diagnosis of pathogens, improvement in infection prevention and control practices, and better use of antimicrobial therapy and prophylaxis based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic considerations and immunizations have improved outcome among HSCT patients, but a lot more remains to be achieved. Some unanswered queries persist, for example, the value of surveillance microbiology-based empirical antimicrobial therapy; the absence of decolonization therapy for MDR Gram-negative bacilli; and the role of host microbiome in influencing predilection, course, or outcome in infections.

Thus, no business functions in a vacuum as it must be integrated into a set of inter-organizational relationships facilitating innovation, development, manufacturing and the co-creation of services. A key element within this network of inter-organizational relationships is logistics, or the industry that has been developed to transport and manage inputs that flow between places and across space. Thus, logistic services are one of the catalysts behind internationalization.

Profound interactions between ENPs and biomolecules such as proteins are inevitable to occur when ENPs are administered or exposed to biological systems, for example, through intravenous injection, oral, or respiration. As a key component of these interactions, protein corona (PC) is immediately formed surrounding the outlayer of ENPs. PC formation is crucial because it gives ENPs a new biological identity by altering not only the physiochemical properties, but also the biobehaviors of ENPs. In the past two decades, most investigations about PC formation were carried out with in vitro systems which could not represent the true events occurring within in vivo systems. Most recently, studies of in vivo PC formation were reported, and it was found that the protein compositions and structures were very different from those formed in vitro. Herein, we provide an in-time review of the recent investigations of this in vivo PC formation of ENPs. In this review, commonly used characterization methods and compositions of in vivo PC are summarized firstly. Next, we highlight the impacts of the in vivo PC formation on absorption, blood circulation, biodistribution, metabolism, and toxicity of administered ENPs.

The wide scale of fatalities and morbidities lead to a concurrent pandemic of uncertainty in scientific evidence. Conflicting evidences are released on daily basis about the neonatal outcomes of COVID-19-positive mothers. The aim of this study was to use the relevant case reports and series to determine the percentage of newborns who test positive for COVID-19 who are born to COVID-19-positive mothers. Secondary outcomes included examining laboratory abnormalities among COVID-19-positive neonates, and any depicted placental abnormalities in COVID-19-positive mothers. For this purpose, systematic review was performed on all studies reporting primary data on fetus-mother pairs with COVID-19. Data bases were searched for studies that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Final screening revealed 67 studies, from which the primary data of 1787 COVID-19 mothers were identified and had their pregnancy outcome analyzed. Only 2.8% of infants born to COVID-19-positive mothers tested positive, and this finding is identical to percentages reported in former Coronaviridae outbreaks, whereas 20% manifested with intrauterine hypoxia alongside placental abnormalities suggestive of heavy placental vaso-occlusive involvement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that while vertical transmission is unlikely, there appears to be an underlying risk of placental insufficiency due to the prothrombotic tendency observed in COVID-19 infection. Guidelines for proper prophylactic anticoagulation in COVID-positive mothers need to be established.","AbdelMassih, Antoine; Fouda, Raghda; Essam, Rana; Negm, Alhussein; Khalil, Dalia; Habib, Dalia; Afdal, George; Ismail, Habiba-Allah; Aly, Hadeer; Genedy, Ibrahim; El Qadi, Layla; Makki, Leena; Shulqamy, Maha; Hanafy, Maram; AbdelMassih, Marian; Ibrahim, Marina; Ebaid, Mohamed; Ibrahim, Monica; El-Husseiny, Nadine; Ashraf, Nirvana; Shebl, Noura; Menshawey, Rahma; Darwish, Rama; ElShahawi, Rana; Ramadan, Rana; Albala, Sadra; Imran, Salwa; Ahmed, Sama; Khaldi, Samer; Abohashish, Sara; Paulo, Stavro; Omar, Yasmin; Tadros, Mourad Alfy",Egypt Pediatric Association Gaz,433,16

The most susceptible to coronaviral infection are the healthcare staff due to their daily contact with potential patients. This article proposes a COVID-19 real-time system for tracking and identifying the suspected cases using an Internet of Things platform for capturing user symptoms and notify the authority. The proposed framework addressed four main components: (1) real-time symptom data collection via thermal scanning algorithm, (2) facial recognition algorithm, (3) a data analysis that uses artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, and (4) a cloud infrastructure. A monitoring experiment was conducted to test three different ages, kid, middle, and older, considering the scanning distance influence compared with contact wearable sensors. The results show that 99.9% accuracy was achieved within a (500 ± 5) cm distance, and this accuracy tends to decrease as the distance the camera scanning and objects increased. The results also revealed that the scanning system's accuracy had been slightly changed as the environmental temperature dropped lower than 27 °C.

Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) are a poor prognostic indicator and associated with very poor survival and only a minority of patients survive >1 year despite oncological treatment. The rising prevalence of patients with BCBM represent an increasing unmet healthcare need. However, in the UK there is a paucity of data about prevalence, survival and management. Guidance on managing brain metastases is improving, however it is unclear how this has been applied in the context of BCBM and whether recommended standards are uniformly applied across the UK METHODS: PRIMROSE is a trainee collaborative-led initiative to estimate BCBM prevalence, assess current practice (comparing national/international standards) and determine long term outcomes/sequalae. Anonymised data is being pooled via secure REDCap database collating demographics, clinico-pathological information, prior treatment, BCBM treatment and other key variables. All UK hospitals can register, with recruitment driven by trainees via the UK Breast Cancer Trainees Research Collaborative Group and British Neurosurgical Trainee Research Collaborative. Senior oversight will be provided by a local consultant oncologist or neurosurgeon. RESULTS: Opened in Jan 2020, 180 datasets have been entered, despite significant disrupted due to COVID-19 from Feburary to May). Over 25 sites are open/in the process of joining. Trainee networks have been established in all regions of the UK with the exception of Yorkshire and The Humber, East of England and North East England.

Currently, EPR schemes do not provide sufficient incentives for moving towards the higher levels of the waste hierarchy, e.g. by reducing the amounts of waste through incentivising the design of products with longer lifespans and by enhancing reuse activities through easier collection and repair of end-of-life products. Nevertheless, several municipalities and regional actors around Europe are increasingly promoting reuse activities through a variety of initiatives. Furthermore, even in the absence of legal drivers, many producer responsibility organisations (PROs), who execute their members’ responsibilities in EPR schemes, are considering promoting reuse and have initiated a number of pilot projects. A product group that has been identified as having high commercial potential for reuse is white goods, but the development of large-scale reuse of white goods seems unlikely unless a series of legal and organisational barriers are effectively addressed. Through an empirical investigation with relevant stakeholders, based on interviews, and the analysis of two case studies of PROs that developed criteria for allowing reusers to access their end-of-life white goods, this contribution presents insights on drivers and barriers for the repair and reuse of white goods in EPR schemes and discusses potential interventions that could facilitate the upscale of reuse activities. Concluding, although the reuse potential for white goods is high, the analysis highlights the currently insufficient policy landscape for incentivising reuse and the need for additional interventions to make reuse feasible as a mainstream enterprise.","Dalhammar, Carl; Wihlborg, Emelie; Milios, Leonidas; Richter, Jessika Luth; Svensson-Höglund, Sahra; Russell, Jennifer; Thidell, Åke",Circ.Econ.Sust.,433,1

Social distancing measures meant that routine face-to-face outpatient appointments needed to be cancelled or reimagined. Telemedicine offered an attractive solution. Telemedicine uses technology to increase access to healthcare and has been used internationally in remote clinical settings, the National Health Service’s ‘111’ as well as in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Methods The University Hospital Lewisham Rheumatology Department organised outpatient review of new and follow-up patients via a consultant-supervised registrar telephone clinic 5 days a week during the first-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. 278 patients had a telephone consultation with the registrar over a 3-month period (30 March to 30 June 2020): 197 new and 81 follow-up patients. Results Of the 197 new patient referrals: 2% required urgent face-to-face review (new inflammatory arthritis); 31% were provided with future routine clinic appointments and 44% were discharged: 35 patients without the need for any further investigations and 52 patients following subsequent investigations (e.g. phlebotomy and radiology). Patients were provided with management advice, links to online resources and referred to allied health professionals as indicated, e.g. physiotherapy. Patients were effectively discharged following telephone consultation if the history was sufficient to exclude a condition requiring secondary care management and if relevant community investigations were negative (including inflammatory markers and immunology). 62 of the 197 newly referred patients were offered a routine follow-up appointment. 36 of these patients were reviewed in person when COVID-19 restrictions eased. Of these 36 patients, 20 were subsequently discharged, diagnoses included: chronic pain (5), osteoarthritis (3), mechanical joint pain (6). 11 patients remained for follow up, diagnoses included: Sjögren’s syndrome (2) and palindromic rheumatism (1). 5 patients did not attend. Conclusion The strengths of this model were: the ability to continue to provide an outpatient rheumatology service; provide safe and effective management for new and follow-up patients; provide patient specific advice pertaining to COVID-19 and to support patients and primary care clinicians. The weaknesses of this model were the use of a single practitioner. Video consultation was not available when this model was implemented, but should add further to subsequent services. Our experience with the tele-rheumatology model suggests that a telephone triage system, coupled with relevant investigations prior to referral could lead to an effective virtual management strategy with potential beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. It also has great promise with regards to managing chronic conditions in clinical remission with video or telephone consultations, utilising virtual disease activity scores (ePROMS now available via the BSR) and satellite monitoring of blood tests and urinalysis. As technology continues to advance, we should explore ways to modernise the outpatient services. Disclosure S. Patel: None. P. Lutalo: None. G. Yanni: None. L.

A ‘telephone triage clinic’ was set up for referrals from A&E. Our project evaluated patient and clinician satisfaction on this. METHOD: We carried out a retrospective telephone questionnaire with patients over a one-week period during the pandemic. We focussed on overall satisfaction of the consultation and quality of communication. Consultants were also surveyed for their opinion on the clinics. RESULTS: From 30 patients, 77% said they were ‘very satisfied’ with the overall experience. 80% of patients were ‘very satisfied’ with the overall length of the telephone consultation. 50% of patients felt the clinician was only ‘adequately’ able to assess them over the telephone. The consultants were less satisfied with the overall experience of telephone consultation. A common theme was that they felt ED documentation could be improved to help inform ongoing management. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, patients were satisfied with the consultations. It has been successful in minimising face to face consultations however some presentations necessitate further evaluation. We need to identify those injuries appropriate for virtual follow up and design a local protocol for these.","Holmes, B; Mirza, U; Manning, C; Cooke, R; Jugdey, R",Br J Surg,433,16

In view of the scarcity of studies on the subject in this country, the objective of this research was to determine the signs and symptoms associated with the patients’ physical, social and psychological spheres that allow properly developing palliative care. A longitudinal, prospective and observational study was conducted with ACKD patients. In order to assess the symptomatic burden and suffering of these patients, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System Revised: renal (ESAS-r) for renal patients and the Distress Thermometer (DT) were used. The sample consisted of a total of 246 patients. The most common symptoms that affect them, causing them suffering in their daily lives, are those related to well-being, difficulty falling asleep and itching. It is necessary that health professionals adapt care measures and help patients undergoing renal treatment, especially those who have suffered the disease for a longer period of time, in order to alleviate the patients’ suffering and therefore improve their daily lives. To such an end, a care plan could be designed that includes early palliative care.","Bonilla-Sierra, Patricia; Vargas-Martínez, Ana Magdalena; Leon-Larios, Fatima; Arciniega Carrión, Joselin Valeria; Jiménez Alverca, Tatiana Cecibel; de las Mercedes Lomas-Campos, María; González-López, José Rafael",Int J Environ Res Public Health,433,13

The growing potential of multimodal data streams and deep learning algorithms has contributed to the increasing universality of deep multimodal learning. This involves the development of models capable of processing and analyzing the multimodal information uniformly. Unstructured real-world data can inherently take many forms, also known as modalities, often including visual and textual content. Extracting relevant patterns from this kind of data is still a motivating goal for researchers in deep learning. In this paper, we seek to improve the understanding of key concepts and algorithms of deep multimodal learning for the computer vision community by exploring how to generate deep models that consider the integration and combination of heterogeneous visual cues across sensory modalities. In particular, we summarize six perspectives from the current literature on deep multimodal learning, namely: multimodal data representation, multimodal fusion (i.e., both traditional and deep learning-based schemes), multitask learning, multimodal alignment, multimodal transfer learning, and zero-shot learning. We also survey current multimodal applications and present a collection of benchmark datasets for solving problems in various vision domains. Finally, we highlight the limitations and challenges of deep multimodal learning and provide insights and directions for future research.","Bayoudh, Khaled; Knani, Raja; Hamdaoui, Fayçal; Mtibaa, Abdellatif",Vis Comput,433,1

However, the mechanisms involved in the heterogenic thrombotic presentations in COVID‐19 are poorly understood. One potential contributor to the prothrombotic state in COVID‐19 is von Willebrand Factor (vWF), a multimeric glycoprotein produced by endothelial cells and platelets that is unfolded and activated by shear stress or artificially with ristocetin. vWF has been implicated in pathogenesis of arterial clots including stroke, consistent with its activation by shear. vWF has also been implicated in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a subtype of microvascular thrombosis. Elevated vWF has even been associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis, a classically low shear environment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether vWF had a higher propensity to become activated in COVID‐19, suggestive of an altered configuration. We hypothesized that vWF from patients with COVID‐19 would be more active than healthy controls. Discarded whole blood samples were collected from hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID‐19; blood from healthy donors was collected via venipuncture. Patient and control plasma were rapidly thawed at 37 ℃ then transferred to de‐identified containers to blind performing scientist. Samples were processed in a duplicate manner adding 30 μL of plasma to a solution containing 200 x10(3)/μL lyophilized platelets. We measured vWF activation using two methods: the first involved agglutination with an intermediate concentration of ristocetin (between 0.6 ‐ 0.7 mg/mL) to achieve less than 40% of normal agglutination. The second method involved detection of A1‐12 antibody binding with ELISA. The A1‐12 antibody binds to the N‐terminus of the A1 subunit, a location that is typically obscured by the A2 domain and thus is only accessible with vWF is unfolded. All measured values were compared to normal pooled plasma (NPP) processed in the same experiment. Notably all measures of activation of vWF were significantly higher in COVID‐19 patients compared to healthy controls. The primary slope of the agglutination was the most significantly elevated when compared to controls (162 verses 106 % of NPP, p = 0.002). The absolute amount of vWF was also significantly increased in patients compared to controls (148 verses 100% of NPP, p < 0.001). These preliminary data are suggestive of increased activity of vWF in COVID‐19 infectionin addition to an increased absolute level. vWF may be a significant pathway that becomes dysregulated during the immune response to SARS‐CoV‐2. This study is limited by its use of discarded blood that has undergone one freeze‐thaw cycle. Further work is needed to correlate these results to clinical outcomes.","Bray, Monica; Lam, Fong; Yee, Andrew; Rumbaut, Rolando; Cruz, Miguel",FASEB J,433,16

However, genetic mutations, complex cell wall system of M.tb, and influx–efflux transporter systems are the major permeability barriers that significantly affect the M.tb drugs activity. Thus, most of the small molecules are ineffective to arrest the M.tb cell growth, even though they are effective at the cellular level. To address the permeability issue, different machine learning models that effectively distinguish permeable and impermeable compounds were developed. The enzyme-based (IC(50)) and cell-based (minimal inhibitory concentration) data were considered for the classification of M.tb permeable and impermeable compounds. It was assumed that the compounds that have high activity in both enzyme-based and cell-based assays possess the required M.tb cell wall permeability. The XGBoost model was outperformed when compared to the other models generated from different algorithms such as random forest, support vector machine, and naïve Bayes. The XGBoost model was further validated using the validation data set (21 permeable and 19 impermeable compounds). The obtained machine learning models suggested that various descriptors such as molecular weight, atom type, electrotopological state, hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts, and extended topochemical atoms of molecules are the major determining factors for both M.tb cell permeability and inhibitory activity. Furthermore, potential antimycobacterial drugs were identified using computational drug repurposing. All the approved drugs from DrugBank were collected and screened using the developed permeability model. The screened compounds were given as input in the PASS server for the identification of possible antimycobacterial compounds. The drugs that were retained after two filters were docked to the active site of 10 different potential antimycobacterial drug targets. The results obtained from this study may improve the understanding of M.tb permeability and activity that may aid in the development of novel antimycobacterial drugs.","Nagamani, Selvaraman; Sastry, G.

However, the current research on cutting fluid and its circulating purification technique lacks systematic review papers to provide scientific technical guidance for actual production. In this study, the key scientific issues in the research achievements of eco-friendly cutting fluid and waste fluid treatment are clarified.

The paradox mindset facilitates the reoccurring process of sensemaking and sensegiving about these tensions. This process enables the development of collective “both-and” mindsets, creative approaches, and iterative learning in the crisis. Thus, the paradox perspective enables organizations to deal constructively with tensions and to transform them into chances—it fosters the organizations’ resilience.

Understanding the ophthalmic manifestations in patients and animal models of the novel coronavirus may have implications for disease surveillance. Recognition of the potential for viral transmission through the tear film has ramification for protection of patients, physicians, and the public. Methods Information from relevant published journal articles was surveyed using a computerized PubMed search and public health websites. We summarize current knowledge of ophthalmic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and animal models, risk mitigation measures for patients and their providers, and implications for retina specialists. Results SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted among humans, and while the clinical course is mild in the majority of infected patients, severe complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death can ensue, most often in elderly patients and individuals with co-morbidities. Conjunctivitis occurs in a small minority of patients with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been identified primarily in association with conjunctivitis. Uveitis has been observed in animal models of coronavirus infection and cotton-wool spots have been reported recently. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses have been rarely associated with conjunctivitis. The identification of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the tear film of patients and its highly efficient transmission via respiratory aerosols supports eye protection, mask and gloves as part of infection prevention and control recommendations for retina providers.

New measurements representing pelvic structural characteristics are proposed and analyzed using support vector machines (SVM). METHODS This retrospective study used data from 207 women with different types and stages of prolapse. Their demographic information, clinical history, and dynamic MRI data were obtained from the database. New MRI measurements were extracted and analyzed based on these reference lines: pubococcygeal line (PCL), mid-pubic line (MPL), true conjugate line (TCL), obstetric conjugate line (OCL), and diagonal conjugate line (DCL). A classification model using SVM was designed to assess the impact of the features (variables) in classifying prolapse into low or high stage. RESULTS The classification model using SVM can accurately identified anterior prolapse with very high accuracy (>0.90), and apical and posterior prolapse with good accuracy (0.80 - 0.90). Two newly proposed MRI-based features were found to be significant in the identification of anterior and posterior prolapse: the angle between TCL and MPL for anterior prolapse, and the angle between DCL and PCL for posterior prolapse. The overall accuracy of posterior prolapse identification increased from 47% to 80% when the newly proposed MRI-based features were taken into consideration. CONCLUSIONS The proposed MRI-based measurements are effective in differentiating low and high stages of pelvic organ prolapse, particularly for posterior prolapse.","Onal, S; Lai-Yuen, S; Bao, P; Weitzenfeld, A; Hogue, D; Hart, S",International urogynecology journal,433,1

The therapeutic management of AML requires understanding the mechanisms involved in the fragility and immune dysfunction of AML T lymphocytes. METHODS In this study, T lymphocytes from healthy donors (HD) and AML patients were used. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from leukemic cells were screened for their microRNA content and impact on T lymphocytes. Flow cytometry, transcriptomic as well as lentiviral transduction techniques were used to carry out the research. RESULTS We observed increased cell death of T lymphocytes from AML patients. EVs from leukemia myeloid cell lines harbored several miRNAs, including miR-21, and were able to induce T lymphocyte death. Compared to that in HD, miR-21 was overexpressed in both the bone marrow fluid and infiltrating T lymphocytes of AML patients. MiR-21 induces T lymphocyte cell death by upregulating proapoptotic gene expression. It also increases the immunosuppressive profile of T lymphocytes by upregulating the IL13, IL4, IL10, and FoxP3 genes. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that miR-21 plays a significant role in AML T lymphocyte dysfunction and apoptosis. Targeting miR-21 may be a novel approach to restore the efficacy of the immune response against AML.","Moussa Agha, Douâa; Rouas, Redouane; Najar, Mehdi; Bouhtit, Fatima; Fayyad-Kazan, Hussein; Lagneaux, Laurence; Bron, Dominique; Meuleman, Nathalie; Lewalle, Philippe; Merimi, Makram",Cells,433,16

Its occurrence is associated with reduced exercise capacity, muscle strength, and quality of life. We sought to investigate if the presence of muscle wasting carries prognostic information. METHODS Two hundred sixty-eight ambulatory patients with heart failure (age 67.1 ± 10.9 years, New York Heart Association class 2.3 ± 0.6, left ventricular ejection fraction 39 ± 13.3%, and 21% female) were prospectively enrolled as part of the Studies Investigating Co-morbidities Aggravating Heart Failure. Muscle wasting as assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was present in 47 patients (17.5%). RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 67.2 ± 28.02 months, 95 patients (35.4%) died from any cause. After adjusting for age, New York Heart Association class, left ventricular ejection fraction, creatinine, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and iron deficiency, muscle wasting remained an independent predictor of death (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.01-3.19, P = 0.04). This effect was more pronounced in patients with heart failure with reduced than in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS Muscle wasting is an independent predictor of death in ambulatory patients with heart failure. Clinical trials are needed to identify treatment approaches to this co-morbidity.","von Haehling, Stephan; Garfias Macedo, Tania; Valentova, Miroslava; Anker, Markus S; Ebner, Nicole; Bekfani, Tarek; Haarmann, Helge; Schefold, Joerg C; Lainscak, Mitja; Cleland, John G F; Doehner, Wolfram; Hasenfuss, Gerd; Anker, Stefan D","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle",433,1

Protein-calorie malnutrition (kwashiorkor) affects the gut microbiota and compromises immune development, leading to environmental enteropathy, vaccine failures, and increased susceptibility to enteric diseases in young children. Relationship between diet and reduced vaccine efficacy in developing countries is not well established; therefore, we investigated the interconnections between the host-microbiota-nutrition-HRV vaccine using HRV-vaccinated, human infant faecal microbiota (HIFM)-transplanted neonatal gnotobiotic pigs fed with a protein deficient or sufficient diet. The microbiota from faecal, intestinal (duodenum, ileum, jejunum, and colon), and systemic tissue (liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node [MLN]) samples was analysed before and after HRV challenge using MiSeq 16S rRNA sequencing. Overall, microbiota from deficient fed HIFM pigs displayed, compared to the sufficient group, significantly higher Shannon index, especially in the faeces and lower intestines; higher level of Proteus and Enterococcus, and lower level of Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Streptococcus in the three types of samples collected (P<0.05); and higher unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs), especially in the systemic tissues. Further, the multivariate analysis between microbiota and immunologic data showed that 38 OTUs at the genus level correlated (r2≤0.5 or ≥-0.5; P<0.05) with at least one host immune response parameter (regulatory [Tregs and transforming growth factor-β], effectors [interferon (IFN)-γ+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, IFN-γ and interleukin (IL)-12], and inflammatory [tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-17 and IL-22]) and with opposite trends between diet groups. Differences described above were increased after HRV challenge. We demonstrated that a protein deficient diet affects the composition of the gut microbiota and those changes may further correlate with immune responses induced by HRV and perturbed by the deficient diet. Thus, our findings suggest that the reduced efficacy of HRV vaccine observed in Gn pig model is in part attributed to the altered microbiota composition.","Srivastava, V; Deblais, L; Huang, H-C; Miyazaki, A; Kandasamy, S; Langel, S N; Paim, F C; Chepngeno, J; Kathayat, D; Vlasova, A N; Saif, L J; Rajashekara, G",Beneficial microbes,433,1

The temporal distribution of desaturation has managerial implications because treatment may necessitate the presence of an anesthesiologist. METHODS We retrieved SpO2 values recorded electronically every 30 to 60 seconds from 137,757 PACU patients over n = 80 four-week periods at an academic medical center. Batch mean methods of analysis were used. Onset times of hypoxemic episodes (defined, on the basis of previous studies, as SpO2 <90% lasting at least 2 minutes) were determined and resolution at 3, 5, and 10 minutes was assessed. Episodes beginning <30 minutes and ≥30 minutes after PACU admission were compared. Patients undergoing intubation in the PACU were identified by doing a free text search of electronically recorded nursing notes for phrases suggesting intubation, followed by a confirmatory manual chart review. Intervals from PACU admission to intubation were determined. RESULTS Fewer than half (31.2% ± 0.05%) of episodes of PACU hypoxemia lasting ≥2 minutes occurred <30 minutes after PACU admission. Most (i.e., >50%) occurred ≥30 minutes after admission (P < 0.0001). Few (<1%) anesthesia providers transporting patients to the PACU were still present in the PACU 30 minutes after arrival in the PACU. Fewer than half (37%; 95% confidence interval, 27.4% to 48.8%) of PACU intubations occurred <30 minutes after PACU admission. Most (i.e., >50%) occurred ≥30 minutes after admission (P = 0.029). Hypoxemic episodes in the PACU resolved more slowly than episodes in operating rooms (P < 0.0001). After 3 minutes, 40.9% ± 0.6% were unresolved in the PACU versus 23% (99% upper confidence limit) in operating rooms, and 32.6% ± 0.5% vs 9% (99% upper confidence limit) after 5 minutes. CONCLUSIONS Because most (68.8%) hypoxemic episodes in the PACU occur ≥30 minutes after admission, a time by which the anesthesia provider who transported the patient usually would no longer be present (>99% of cases), the PACU needs to be considered when anesthesiologist operating room staffing and assignment decisions are made.","Epstein, Richard H; Dexter, Franklin; Lopez, Marcos G; Ehrenfeld, Jesse M",Anesthesia and analgesia,433,22

DESIGN Double-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING Department of Surgery of the Min-Sheng General Hospital, National Taiwan University. PATIENTS We studied 60 moderately obese patients (body mass index >25 and <35) aged >30 to <60 years who had poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (hemoglobin A(1c) [HbA(1c)] >7.5%) after conventional treatment (>6 months) from September 1, 2007, through June 30, 2008. Patients and observers were masked during the follow-up, which ended in 2009, 1 year after final enrollment. INTERVENTIONS Gastric bypass with duodenum exclusion (n = 30) vs sleeve gastrectomy without duodenum exclusion (n = 30). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was remission of T2DM (fasting glucose <126 mg/dL and HbA(1c) <6.5% without glycemic therapy). Secondary measures included weight and metabolic syndrome. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS Of the 60 patients enrolled, all completed the 12-month follow-up. Remission of T2DM was achieved by 28 (93%) in the gastric bypass group and 14 (47%) in the sleeve gastrectomy group (P = .02). Participants assigned to gastric bypass had lost more weight, achieved a lower waist circumference, and had lower glucose, HbA(1c), and blood lipid levels than the sleeve gastrectomy group. No serious complications occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS Participants randomized to gastric bypass were more likely to achieve remission of T2DM. Duodenum exclusion plays a role in T2DM treatment and should be assessed.

The burgeoning neurointerventional workforce and the rapid growth in the neurointerventional space on the heels of groundbreaking clinical trials prompted us to assess the fellowship's academic impact and its graduates' perceptions and productivity. An anonymized web-based survey was sent to all former neuroendovascular fellows with specific questions pertaining to current practice, research and funding, and perceptions about the fellowship's impact on their skills, competitiveness, and compensation. Additionally, the h-index was calculated to assess the academic productivity of each graduated fellow. Among 50 former fellows, 42 (84%) completed the survey. The fellows came from various countries, ethnic backgrounds, and specialties including neurosurgery (n = 39, 93%), neurology (n = 2, 5%), and neuroradiology (n = 1, 2%). Twenty (48%) respondents were currently chairs or directors of their practice. Most (n = 30, 71%) spent at least 10% of their time on research activities, with 27 (64%) receiving research funding. The median h-index of all 50 former fellows was 14. The biggest gains from the fellowship were reported to be improvement in endovascular skills (median = 10 on a scale of 0-10 [highest]) and increase in competitiveness for jobs in vascular neurosurgery (median = 10), followed by increase in academic productivity (median = 8), and knowledge of vascular disease (median = 8).

Aim of the present study is to assess epidemiological and clinical characteristics of individuals with DS deceased in Italian hospitals with CoVID-19. METHODS We used a nationwide database of 3,438 patients deceased with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy (10.4% of all deaths with CoVID-19 in the country at the time of analysis). Data on demographics, pre-existing comorbidities and in-hospital complications leading to death were extracted from medical charts obtained from hospitals. Data on individuals with DS deceased with CoVID-19 were obtained from this sample. RESULTS Sixteen cases of death in individuals with DS (0.5% of all charts analyzed) were identified. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in all 16 cases. Compared with individuals without DS, those with DS deceased with CoVID-19 were younger (52.3 ± 7.3 vs. 78.1 ± 10.6 years, p < .001) and presented a higher incidence of superinfections (31.2 vs. 13.0%, p = .029).

UK-produced LICBT guided self-help (GSH) materials were originally used in the MindStep™ program. In 2017, Australian LICBT GSH materials were developed to better suit Australian users. This study explored whether the Australian-produced materials continued to achieve the benchmark recovery rates established in the UK and maintained in recent Australian studies.MethodsBinomial logistic regression was conducted using retrospective client data, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, between 2016 and 2019.ResultsDuring time periods in which the Australian-produced materials were used, equivalent rates of reliable recovery and improvement were achieved compared with time periods in which the UK-produced materials were used. Australian-trained LICBT coaches, using Australian-produced LICBT GSH materials, achieve client recovery rates of up to 60%, reliable improvement rates of 58% and reliable recovery rates of 46% (with the probability of recovery increasing with client age).ConclusionsThese findings are particularly pertinent with COVID-19 changing the landscape of mental health service delivery, requiring greater flexibility in the use of teleservices to ensure access to effective mental health care for populations that may already experience problems with isolation, access and service engagement.What is known about the topic?LICBT is an acceptable, feasible and effective treatment approach for people experiencing mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression in Australia. LICBT GSH materials used with clients in Australia originated from the UK. However, according to guidelines, LICBT GSH materials should be contextualised to suit the audience they are being used with.What does this paper add?This paper demonstrates that LICBT GSH materials tailored to an Australian context can be used in place of UK-produced materials because they yield equivalent and consistent therapeutic outcomes. Although contextualising the LICBT GSH materials for health services users was important, it is likely that the evidence-based cognitive behaviour therapy techniques sitting 'under the hood' of these materials are most important to ensure successful therapeutic outcomes.What are the implications for practitioners?As we face unprecedented challenges following 2020, the physical, social, psychological and economic impacts of life-changing events must not inhibit access to treatments for common mental health conditions. It is anticipated that more non-traditional, alternative providers of mental health services will be needed to scale-up and respond to increasing demand. This paper shows that the provision of telephone-based LICBT in Australia, by trained coaches using Australian-produced GSH materials, is an evidenced-based support pathway that can reduce the access gap to treatments.","Venning, Anthony; Oswald, Tassia K; Barnes, Mary; Glover, Fiona; Lawn, Sharon; Azadi, Leva; Tepper, Nicci; Redpath, Paula",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,433,1

Materials and Methods Turkish patients who underwent TAH and laparoscopic hysterectomy were invited to participate in this study. In this study, 140 patients were examined who underwent hysterectomy in gynecology clinic between 2013 and 2018. The post residual urine volumes of patients were measured in the preoperative period and 8th week of the postoperative period as urodynamic evaluation (with office cystometry and Q tip test). Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis Mann-Whitney U test by using SPSS 22.0 statistical program. Results No statistical significance (P > 0.05) was found between age, parity, menopause, and obesity in our patients who underwent TAH and laparoscopic hysterectomy with high postvoid residual values in the postoperative period. Conclusion In this study, no statistical significance was found between the hysterectomy techniques on urinary tract dysfunction. It can be said that laparoscopy should be more preferable in correctly selected patients for minimal dysfunctional complications.","Sukgen, Gökmen; Türkay, Ünal",Gynecology and minimally invasive therapy,433,1

Since the ongoing climate warming is known to alter nutritional environments encountered by ectotherms, a precise understanding of the integrated effects of these two factors on ectotherm performance is essential for improving the accuracy of predictions regarding how ectotherms will respond to climate warming. Here we employed response surface methodology to examine how multiple life-history traits were expressed across a grid of environmental conditions representing full combinations of six ambient temperatures (13, 18, 23, 28, 31, 33 °C) and eight dietary protein:carbohydrate ratios (P:C = 1:16, 1:8, 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 8:1) in Drosophila melanogaster. Different life-history traits were maximized in different regions in the two-dimensional temperature-nutrient space. The optimal temperature and P:C ratio identified for adult lifespan (13 °C and 1:16) were lower than those for early-life female fecundity (28 °C and 4:1). Similar divergence in thermal and nutritional optima was found between body mass at adult emergence (18 °C and P:C 1:1) and the rate of pre-adult development (28 °C and P:C 4:1). Pre-adult survival was maximized over a broad range of temperature (18-28 °C) and P:C ratio (1:8-8:1). These results indicate that the occurrence of life-history trade-offs is regulated by both temperature and dietary P:C ratio. The estimated measure of fitness was maximized at 23 °C and P:C 2:1. Based on the shape of the response surface constructed for this estimated fitness, we characterized the fundamental thermal and nutritional niche for D. melanogaster with unprecedented detail.","Kim, Keonhee E; Jang, Taehwan; Lee, Kwang Pum",Oecologia,433,1

We present the first global reassessment of 1,199 species in Class Chondrichthyes-sharks, rays, and chimeras. The first global assessment (in 2014) concluded that one-quarter (24%) of species were threatened. Now, 391 (32.6%) species are threatened with extinction. When this percentage of threat is applied to Data Deficient species, more than one-third (37.5%) of chondrichthyans are estimated to be threatened, with much of this change resulting from new information. Three species are Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct), representing possibly the first global marine fish extinctions due to overfishing. Consequently, the chondrichthyan extinction rate is potentially 25 extinctions per million species years, comparable to that of terrestrial vertebrates. Overfishing is the universal threat affecting all 391 threatened species and is the sole threat for 67.3% of species and interacts with three other threats for the remaining third: loss and degradation of habitat (31.2% of threatened species), climate change (10.2%), and pollution (6.9%). Species are disproportionately threatened in tropical and subtropical coastal waters. Science-based limits on fishing, effective marine protected areas, and approaches that reduce or eliminate fishing mortality are urgently needed to minimize mortality of threatened species and ensure sustainable catch and trade of others.

This study aimed to determine the durability of skills acquired after initial training. METHODS For this study, 21 novice medical students were enrolled in institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocols at two institutions. As previously reported, all the participants successfully completed a structured proficiency-based training curriculum by practicing the five FLS tasks in a distributed fashion over a 2-month period. Pre- and posttesting was conducted, and standard testing metrics were used. The participants were recruited for repeat testing 6 months (retention 1) and 1 year (retention 2) after initial curriculum completion. Of the original 21 students, 15 (10 at University of Texas Southwestern and 5 at Uniformed Services University) were available and agreed to participate. The participants had no additional skills lab training and minimal clinical laparoscopic exposure. RESULTS None of the 15 participants demonstrated proficiency at the initial pretest (mean score, 146 ± 65), and performance showed significant improvement (p < 0.001) at the posttest (469 ± 20). The participants retained a very high level of performance at retention 1 (437 ± 39; 93% retention of the posttest score) and retention 2 (444 ± 55; 95% retention of the posttest score). Their performance at both retention testing-intervals was sufficient for passing the certification exam (270 cutoff score for passing) with a comfortable margin. There were no significant differences in performance between the two institutions at any time points. CONCLUSION The proficiency-based FLS skills curriculum reliably results in a high level of skill retention, even in the absence of ongoing simulator-based training or clinical experience. This curriculum is suitable for widespread implementation.","Rosenthal, Madelyn E; Ritter, E Matt; Goova, Mouza T; Castellvi, Antonio O; Tesfay, Seifu T; Pimentel, Elisabeth A; Hartzler, Robert; Scott, Daniel J",Surgical endoscopy,433,19

We demonstrate this design concept for a DPA-TPE (diphenylamine-tetraphenylethylene) chromophore, which is non-emissive in its solvated state due to vibrational quenching. Turning this DPA-TPE into a ditopic linker allows to grow oriented MOF thin films exhibiting pronounced green electroluminescence with low onset voltages.

METHODS We tested six leakage scenarios. Four scenarios were applied to both the respiratory circuits with the SCMVP and without the SCMVP (conventional system), and two scenarios were each specific to one of the systems. Fifteen registered nurses were asked to manage three scenarios each (two mutual and one system-specific scenario). Time to identify the site of the leak was measured and compared between the two systems. RESULTS The SCMVP showed significantly shorter time for troubleshooting in one of the four mutual scenarios and shorter accumulated time for troubleshooting in the four mutual scenarios [18.0 (range, 14.5-19.5) and 48.5 (9.0-180.0) s, respectively] compared with the conventional system [76.0 (47.0-133.8) and 82.5 (16.0-180.0) s, respectively].

DESIGN Case-control study. SETTING Neonatal intensive care unit of the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, The Netherlands. PATIENTS 57 FGR (birth weight <10th percentile) and 57 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) (birth weight 20th-80th percentiles) preterm neonates, matched for gender, gestational age, respiratory and blood pressure support. METHODS The correlation between continuously measured mean arterial blood pressure and regional cerebral oxygen saturation was calculated to generate the cerebral oximetry index (COx). Mean COx was calculated for each patient for each postnatal day. The percentage of time with impaired autoregulation (COx>0.5) was also calculated. RESULTS FGR neonates had higher mean COx values than their AGA peers on day 2 (0.15 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.18) vs 0.09 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.13), p=0.029) and day 3 (0.17 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.20) vs 0.09 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.12), p=0.003) of life. FGR neonates spent more time with impaired autoregulation (COx value >0.5) than controls on postnatal day 2 (19% (95% CI 16% to 22%) vs 14% (95% CI 12% to 17%), p=0.035) and day 3 (20% (95% CI 17% to 24%) vs 15% (95% CI 12% to 18%), p=0.016). CONCLUSION FGR preterm neonates more frequently display impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation compared with AGA peers on days 2 and 3 of life which may predispose them to brain injury. Further studies are required to investigate whether this impairment persists beyond the first few days of life and whether this impairment is linked to poor neurodevelopmental outcome.","Cohen, Emily; Baerts, Willem; Caicedo Dorado, Alexander; Naulaers, Gunnar; van Bel, Frank; Lemmers, Petra M A",Archives of disease in childhood.

Policies of school closure, vaccination and antivirals, together with prophylactic absence from work are evaluated and their cost impacts are estimated. Results suggest GDP losses from the disease of approximately 0.5-2% but school closure and prophylactic absenteeism more than triples these effects.

We evaluated the effect of enrollment volume by site on complication rates in the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial (CREST). METHODS The primary composite end point was any stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 30 days or ipsilateral stroke in follow-up. The 477 approved surgeons performed >12 procedures per year with complication rates <3% for asymptomatic patients and <5% for symptomatic patients; 224 interventionists were certified after a rigorous 2 step credentialing process. CREST centers were divided into tertiles based on the number of patients enrolled into the study, with Group 1 sites enrolling <25 patients, Group 2 sites enrolling 25 to 51 patients, and Group 3 sites enrolling >51 patients. Differences in periprocedural event rates for the primary composite end point and its components were compared using logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, and symptomatic status within site-volume level. RESULTS The safety of carotid angioplasty and stenting and carotid endarterectomy did not vary by site-volume during the periprocedural period as indicated by occurrence of the primary end point (P=0.54) or by stroke and death (P=0.87). A trend toward an inverse relationship between center enrollment volume and complications was mitigated by adjustment for known risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Complication rates were low in CREST and were not associated with center enrollment volume. The data are consistent with the value of rigorous training and credentialing in trials evaluating endovascular devices and surgical procedures.

We previously reported that neutrophils from reproductive-age males are more immature and less activated than their female counterparts. To further characterize the mechanisms that drive differential neutrophil phenotypes, we performed RNA sequencing on circulating neutrophils from healthy adult females and males. Female neutrophils displayed significant up-regulation of type I IFN (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs). Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated that these differences are neutrophil specific, driven by a distinct neutrophil subset and related to maturation status. Neutrophil hyperresponsiveness to type I IFNs promoted enhanced responses to Toll-like receptor agonists. Neutrophils from young adult males had significantly increased mitochondrial metabolism compared to those from females and this was modulated by estradiol. Assessment of ISGs and neutrophil maturation genes in Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) males and in prepubescent children supported that differences in neutrophil phenotype between adult male and female neutrophils are hormonally driven and not explained by X chromosome gene dosage. Our results indicate that there are distinct sex differences in neutrophil biology related to responses to type I IFNs, immunometabolism, and maturation status that may have prominent functional and pathogenic implications.","Gupta, Sarthak; Nakabo, Shuichiro; Blanco, Luz P; O'Neil, Liam J; Wigerblad, Gustaf; Goel, Rishi R; Mistry, Pragnesh; Jiang, Kan; Carmona-Rivera, Carmelo; Chan, Diana W; Wang, Xinghao; Pedersen, Hege L; Gadkari, Manasi; Howe, Katherine N; Naz, Faiza; Dell'Orso, Stefania; Hasni, Sarfaraz A; Dempsey, Caeden; Buscetta, Ashley; Frischmeyer-Guerrerio, Pamela A; Kruszka, Paul; Muenke, Maximilian; Franco, Luis M; Sun, Hong-Wei; Kaplan, Mariana J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,433,24

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term results of SG in morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Diabetic patients who underwent SG at a single center between 2009 and 2011 were included. Outcomes assessed included postoperative complications, weight loss, and resolution or improvement in co-morbidities with an emphasis on diabetes, including glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and medication status. RESULTS Fifty-one diabetic patients underwent SG, 35 females and 16 males, with a collective mean age of 49 years and a mean body mass index of 43.2 kg/m2. On average, patients had had diabetes for 5.4 ± 7.3 years before surgery. Mean HbA1C and fasting glucose levels were 7.9 ± 1.6% and 166.9 ± 63 mg/dL, respectively. Eleven patients (22%) were insulin dependent at the time of surgery. Average body mass index at a mean follow-up of 5 years after surgery was 34.4 ± 5.8 kg/m2, with an average HbA1C of 6.6 ± 1% and an average fasting glucose of 123 ± 60 mg/dL. Only 3 patients remained insulin dependent. CONCLUSION SG offers retainable weight loss results, accompanied by longstanding resolution or improvement of diabetes. Prospective, randomized controlled studies are warranted to better compare long-term outcomes between SG and gastric bypass.","Lessing, Yonatan; Pencovich, Niv; Lahat, Guy; Klausner, Joseph M; Abu-Abeid, Subhi; Meron Eldar, Shai",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,433,26

Environmental organizations and activists serving as social stations collected information about the project and its ecological impact, and communicated this with the general public, social groups, and institutions. The Internet provides social stations and the public with an efficient means for interactive communication and an open space for active information sharing and public participation. For example, while the website of an organization such as an environmental activist group can initially trigger local interest, the Internet allows this information to be disseminated to a much wider audience in a manner unavailable to the traditional media. Interaction among social stations demonstrates an amplifying process of public attention to the risk. Analyses of the volume of readers' comments to online newspaper articles and public opinions posted on message board of public and nonprofit organizations show the ripple effects of the amplification process as measured along temporal, geographical, and sectoral dimensions. Public attention is also influenced by the symbolic connotations of risk information.

Abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is a key factor in the development of tissue remodelling that results in symptoms and impaired lung function in these diseases. Tissue remodelling in the lungs is complex and differs between compartments. Some pathways are common but tissue remodelling around the airways and in the parenchyma have different morphologies. Hence it is critical to evaluate both common fibrotic pathways and those that are specific to different compartments; thereby expanding the understanding of the pathogenesis of fibrosis and remodelling in the airways and parenchyma in asthma, COPD and IPF with a view to developing therapeutic strategies for each. Here we review the current understanding of remodelling features and underlying mechanisms in these major respiratory diseases. The differences and similarities of remodelling are used to highlight potential common therapeutic targets and strategies. One central pathway in remodelling processes involves transforming growth factor (TGF)-β induced fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation that increases ECM production. The current treatments and clinical trials targeting remodelling are described, as well as potential future directions. These endeavours are indicative of the renewed effort and optimism for drug discovery targeting tissue remodelling and fibrosis.","Liu, Gang; Philp, Ashleigh M; Corte, Tamera; Travis, Mark A; Schilter, Heidi; Hansbro, Nicole G; Burns, Chris J; Eapen, Mathew S; Sohal, Sukhwinder S; Burgess, Janette K; Hansbro, Philip M",Pharmacology & therapeutics,433,10

METHODS The ABO blood type of 9 pedigree members were determined by serological methods. Exons 6 and 7 of the ABO gene were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. The patient and her father were also subjected to clone sequencing analysis. RESULTS Serological tests demonstrated that the proband and her younger brother had an ABw subtype, whilst her father and two daughters had Bw subtype. Clone sequencing found that the exon 7 of the ABO gene of the proband had a T>C substitution at position 695, which was identified as a BW.11 allele compared with the reference sequence B.01. This BW.11 allele was also identified in the proband's father, brother and two daughters. Due to allelic competition, the A/BW.11 and BW.11/O alleles demonstrated significantly different phenotypes. CONCLUSION The c.695T>C substitution of the ABO gene may lead to allelic competition in the Bw11 subtype. Combined molecular and serological methods is helpful for precise blood grouping.","Feng, Chenchen; Ren, Weichao; Cheng, Daosheng; Gao, Jingyan; Chen, Jianyong; Li, Weichao; Xiao, Jianyu; Liu, Taixiang; Huang, Chengyin; Chen, Qing",Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,433,1

These measures have led to a reduction of anthropogenic air pollutants, providing an opportunity to observe the contribution of human activities to local air pollution. In this study, the control period was divided into four stages:the before, early, middle, and later stages. Based on a variety of data including meteorological, traffic, and industrial manufacturing datasets, statistical methods were combined with spatial analysis to evaluate changes in air pollution and associated human impacts during each stage. In addition, suggestions are made for further regional air pollution control in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. Key results are as follows:① Overall, the AQI and the concentrations of six air pollutants, especially SO2, PM10, and NO2, were lower during control period than during the equivalent period in 2019 (reductions of 26.5%, 24.3%, and 16.9%, respectively). From the before to later stages, pollutants (except O3) showed a downward trend while O3 increased significantly during the before stage (by 76.2%) and the growth rate slowed during the middle and later stages; ②During the prior stage, Beijing experienced two periods with heavy air pollution days as a result of the local accumulation of pollutants, secondary transformation, and regional transport. The concentration of PM2.5 in February was nearly 60% lower than in February 2014 under similar meteorological conditions in Beijing; ③ Following an increase in traffic volume and industrial activity, changes in air pollutants tended to be stable or slightly increase during the middle and later stages of the control period. The grey relation coefficients between thermal radiation intensity anomalies and the main pollutants in heavy industrial cities were greater than 0.6, which means that the control of industrial emissions remains key to controlling air pollution.","Zhao, Xue; Shen, Nan-Chi; Li, Ling-Jun; Wu, Gao-Feng; Tao, Jing; Zhao, Wen-Ji",Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue,433,31

We aimed to evaluate the safety of Enseal in porcine vessels>7 mm. MATERIALS AND METHODS The lumbar aortas of pigs that were euthanized for unrelated procedures were harvested. A 5- to 6-cm segment of aorta was sealed using the Enseal device. The opposite end was attached to a pressure-testing device to measure pressures at leak or bursting. The bivariate Pearson correlation was used to determine the relationship between diameter and bursting pressure. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine differences between the groups of vessels on the basis of their diameter. RESULTS Ninety samples of 5-cm aorta segments were used to assess bursting pressure. The median diameter was 14 mm (range, 7-18) and bursting pressure was 85 mm Hg (range, 24-650). The Pearson test showed a negative correlation between vessel diameter and bursting pressure (P=.25). One-way analysis of variance did not show any significant difference between vessel diameters grouped by size (P=.517), and neither did the Scheffe post hoc test when comparing diameter with bursting pressure; 31% of specimens failed to seal. CONCLUSIONS Bursting pressures are low and inconsistent after tissue sealing with the Enseal device in porcine vessels>7 mm. These vessels also demonstrated a higher rate of failure to seal. The histologic results of the aorta segments (ie, a low collagen-elastin ratio) may be the cause of the low bursting pressures.","Bibi, Shahida; Alblawi, Saeed; Velchuru, Vamsi; Thripuraneni, Gopichand; Quinteros, Francisco; Coralic, Jasna; Marecik, Slawomir; Park, John; Prasad, Leela M",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,433,31

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty patients with locally advanced ESCC who were treated with NAC followed by radical resection were prospectively enrolled from September 2015 to May 2018. MRI and IVIM were performed within 1 week before and 2-3 weeks after NAC, prior to surgery. Parameters including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and pseudodiffusion fraction (f) before and after NAC were measured. Pathologic response was evaluated according to the AJCC tumor regression grade (TRG) system. The changes in IVIM values before and after therapy in different TRG groups were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis was used to determine the best cutoff value for predicting the pathologic response to NAC. RESULTS Twenty-two patients were identified as TRG 2 (responders), and eighteen as TRG 3 (non-responders) in pathologic evaluation. The ADC, D, and f values increased significantly after NAC. The post-NAC D and ΔD values of responders were significantly higher than those of non-responders. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.722 for post-NAC D and 0.859 for ΔD in predicting pathologic response. The cutoff values of post-NAC D and ΔD were 1.685 × 10-3 mm2/s and 0.350 × 10-3 mm2/s, respectively. CONCLUSION IVIM-DWI may be used as an effective functional imaging technique to predict pathologic response to NAC in locally advanced ESCC. KEY POINTS • The optimal cutoff values of post-NAC D and ΔD for predicting pathologic response to NAC in locally advanced ESCC were 1.685 × 10-3 mm2/s and 0.350 × 10-3 mm2/s, respectively. • Pathologic response to NAC in locally advanced ESCC was favorable in patients with post-NAC D and ΔD values that were higher than the optimal cutoff values. • IVIM-DWI can potentially be used to preoperatively predict pathologic response to NAC in esophageal carcinoma. Accurate quantification of the D value derived from IVIM-DWI may eventually translate into an effective and non-invasive marker to predict therapeutic efficacy.","Song, Tao; Yao, Qi; Qu, Jinrong; Zhang, Hongkai; Zhao, Yan; Qin, Jianjun; Feng, Wen; Zhang, Shouning; Han, Xianhua; Wang, Shaoyu; Yan, Xu; Li, Hailiang",European radiology,433,27

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are newer US FDA-approved alternatives to warfarin and include dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. The efficacy of DOACs is heavily researched, but few studies have evaluated their bleeding risk. OBJECTIVES This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates which DOAC has the lowest bleeding risk in elderly patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). METHODS CINAHL and MEDLINE databases were searched using specific keywords, and 244 results were identified and screened. Inclusion criteria required a major bleeding event requiring hospitalization as an outcome and excluded patients with severe renal failure. Articles that met inclusion criteria were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies. Review Manager (version 5) was used to perform the random-effects model meta-analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Six articles met inclusion criteria and encompassed 446,042 patients in total. Apixaban and dabigatran had statistically significant risk reductions compared with warfarin, whereas rivaroxaban did not (HR 0.60 [95% CI 0.52-0.69], p < 0.00001; HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.70-0.90], p = 0.0005; HR 1.03 [95% CI 0.86-1.22], p = 0.77, respectively.) Data regarding edoxaban were limited and thus not included in the analysis. CONCLUSION Apixaban and dabigatran have a significantly decreased major bleeding risk (40 and 21%, respectively) compared with warfarin. There was no statistical difference in bleeding risk between rivaroxaban and warfarin. Head-to-head prospective randomized controlled trials are required to assess the true bleeding risk of each DOAC.","Lobraico-Fernandez, Jessika; Baksh, Salma; Nemec, Eric",Drugs in R&D,433,31

Among all of the personality disorders, there is strong support for the validity of borderline personality disorder (BPD) diagnosis in adolescence with comparable stability as seen in adulthood. Researchers have put much effort in the analysis of the developmental pathways and etiology of the disorder and currently are relocating their attention to the identification of the possible risk factors associated with the course of BPD symptoms during adolescence. The risk profile provided in previous systematic reviews did not address the possible development and course of BPD features across time. Having this in mind, the purpose of this systematic review is to identify the factors that are associated with the course of BPD symptoms during adolescence. METHODS Electronic databases were systematically searched for prospective longitudinal studies with at least two assessments of BPD as an outcome of the examined risk factors. A total number of 14 articles from the period of almost 40 years were identified as fitting the eligibility criteria. CONCLUSIONS Factors associated with the course of BPD symptoms include childhood temperament, comorbid psychopathology, and current interpersonal experiences. The current review adds up to the knowledge base about factors that are associated with the persistence or worsening of BPD symptoms in adolescence, describing the factors congruent to different developmental periods.","Skabeikyte, Gabriele; Barkauskiene, Rasa",Borderline personality disorder and emotion dysregulation,433,1

Although several Chinese studies, describing the laboratory findings characteristics of this illness have been reported, European data are still scarce. Furthermore, previous studies often analyzed the averaged laboratory findings collected during the entire hospitalization period, whereas monitoring their time-dependent variations should give more reliable prognostic information. Methods We analyzed the time-dependent variations of 14 laboratory parameters in two groups of COVID-19 patients with, respectively, a positive (40 patients) or a poor (42 patients) outcome, admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy). We focused mainly on laboratory parameters that are routinely tested, thus, prognostic information would be readily available even in low-resource settings. Results Statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed for most of the laboratory findings analyzed. We showed that some parameters can be considered as early prognostic indicators whereas others exhibit statistically significant differences only at a later stage of the disease. Among them, earliest indicators were: platelets, lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, white blood cells and neutrophils. Conclusions This longitudinal study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first study describing the laboratory characteristics of Italian COVID-19 patients on a normalized time-scale. The time-dependent prognostic value of the laboratory parameters analyzed in this study can be used by clinicians for the effective treatment of the patients and for the proper management of intensive care beds, which becomes a critical issue during the pandemic peaks.","Ferrari, Davide; Seveso, Andrea; Sabetta, Eleonora; Ceriotti, Daniele; Carobene, Anna; Banfi, Giuseppe; Locatelli, Massimo; Cabitza, Federico",Diagnosis,433,24

This paper conceptualizes integration of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) into national health systems and explores how such integration can contribute to pathways toward UHC. Integration has been variously conceptualized at health system, service delivery, and consumer levels. Integration can be conceptualized based on the level of institutionalization of T&CM in national health systems (i.e. regulation of T&CM, education system, monitoring and health financial scheme). According to it, countries and areas of the Region can be categorized: countries with: 'well-established integration strategies'; 'in-process of developing and implementing integration policies'; 'mixed-level of integration'; or 'indigenous traditional medicine practiced outside the national healthcare system'. Integration of T&CM may offer pathways to advance five health system attributes essential to achieve UHC, namely: quality; efficiency; equity; accountability; and sustainability and resilience. It can contribute to improving quality of healthcare services through regulation of T&CM products, practitioners and services used by communities; meeting population needs in ageing population and managing non-communicable diseases; improving equitable access to care through health insurance coverage of T&CM; improving accountability by monitoring and use of data for informed-policy decisions on T&CM; and strengthening sustainability and resilience through maximizing potentials of T&CM in managing outbreaks of infectious diseases and disasters. Depending on the level of integration, actions to move forward integration of T&CM as a pathway toward UHC will be various.","Park, Yu Lee; Canaway, Rachel",Health systems and reform,433,1

Placement of blood volume sensors such as bio-impedance sensors close to the arterial sites is essential for the accurate measurement of the pulse waveform. The effect of sensor location relative to the wrist arteries on the pulse waveform had not been studied previously on human subjects. In this paper, we explore the effect of arterial and off-arterial placement of the bio-impedance sensor on important pulse waveform features such as pulse transit time (PTT), which is the travel time of the arterial pressure pulse between two sensors, and diastolic peak error (DPE), a measure of pulse signal sharpness. Placing the current injection and voltage sensing electrodes of a bio-impedance sensor on the radial artery provide greater accuracy for such features. We find that arterial PTT has a significantly lower standard deviation compared to off-arterial PTT indicating better signal quality. Similarly, we observe that DPE is much smaller for arterial bio-impedance which confirms our expectations. Based on these features, the location of the artery can be determined using an array of sensors placed around the artery.","Ibrahim, Bassem; Mrugala, Dariusz; Jafari, Roozbeh",Conference proceedings : ...

By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we measured anti-HCoV IgG antibodies in serum and IgA antibodies in nasal wash specimens collected at seven U.S. sites from 105 adults aged 50 years and older (mean age, 67 ± 9 years) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most patients (95 [90%]) had at least one more chronic disease. More patients had serum antibody to each HCoV strain (104 [99%] had antibody to HCoV-229E, 105 [100%] had antibody to HCoV-OC43, 103 [98%] had antibody to HCoV-NL63, and 96 [91%] had antibody to HCoV-HKU1) than had antibody to each HCoV strain in nasal wash specimens (12 [11%] had antibody to HCoV-229E, 22 [22%] had antibody to HCoV-OC43, 8 [8%] had antibody to HCoV-NL63, and 31 [31%] had antibody to HCoV-HKU1), respectively (P < 0.0001). The proportions of subjects with IgA antibodies in nasal wash specimens and the geometric mean IgA antibody titers were statistically higher for HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 than for HCoV-229E and -NL63. A higher proportion of patients with heart disease than not had IgA antibodies to HCoV-NL63 (6 [16%] versus 2 [3%]; P = 0.014). Correlations were highest for serum antibody titers between group I strains (HCoV-229E and -NL63 [r = 0.443; P < 0.0001]) and between group II strains (HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 [r = 0.603; P < 0.0001]) and not statistically significant between HCoV-NL63 and -OC43 and between HCoV-NL63 and -HKU1.

Understanding mechanisms that intrinsically modulate the immune responses to transplants is vital to develop rational treatment for rejection. Here, we have investigated the impact of programed cell death-1 (PD-1) protein, a negative co-stimulatory receptor, on the rejection of MHC incompatible kidney transplants in mice. T cells were found to rapidly infiltrate the kidneys of A/J mice transplanted to C57BL/6 mice, which peaked at six days and decline by day 14. The T cells primarily encircled tubules with limited infiltration of the tubular epithelium. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a marker of tubular injury, also peaked in the urine at day six and then declined. Notably, flow cytometry demonstrated that most of the T cells expressed PD-1 (over 90% of CD8 and about 75% of CD4 cells) at day six. Administration of blocking antibody to PD-L1, the ligand for PD-1, before day six increased T cell infiltrates and urinary LCN2, causing terminal acute rejection. In contrast, blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interactions after day six caused only a transient increase in urinary LCN2. Depleting CD4 and CD8 T cells virtually eliminated LCN2 in the urine in support of T cells injuring tubules. Thus, our data indicate that PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are not just related to chronic antigenic stimulation of T cells but are critical for the regulation of acute T cell responses to renal transplants.","Shim, Young Jun; Khedraki, Raneem; Dhar, Jayeeta; Fan, Ran; Dvorina, Nina; Valujskikh, Anna; Fairchild, Robert L; Baldwin, William M",Kidney international,433,1

Due to high transmission rates from individual to individual, it has progressed to a pandemic. However, indirect transmission from inanimate objects or surfaces that have come in contact with a patient poses an even more significant threat as it is difficult to trace the source of infection in these cases. Therefore, these surfaces and objects require disinfection with chemicals having potent viricidal activity. These include alcohols, aldehydes, quaternary ammonium compounds, chlorhexidine, and chlorine-based disinfectants, among others. They vary in their viricidal activity depending on their structure, concentrations, and mechanism of action. Several studies have looked into these agents and the transmission of the virus related to it. Moreover, certain viricides, if used as constituents of commercially available oral disinfectants, can further aid in preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia and maintain oral hygiene. However, these chemicals are not entirely free of potential hazards. In this review, we have compiled and critically appraised some commonly used viricidal agents in healthcare settings and the role they can play in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Khokhar, Manoj; Roy, Dipayan; Purohit, Purvi; Goyal, Manu; Setia, Puneet",Pathogens and global health,433,1

The ""interactive, no-prep"" approach, using breakout rooms within a videoconferencing system, required no prior learner preparation. METHODS From March to May 2020, learners were invited to participate in a monthly 60-minute virtual MEJC. A needs assessment survey informed article selection. Facilitators developed a presentation to provide background and describe the article's research question(s). In breakout groups, learners generated study designs to answer the research question(s). After the actual study methodology and results were revealed, learners engaged in facilitated open discussion. After the session, learners completed an electronic survey to rate perceived usefulness and suggest improvement areas. RESULTS A total of 15 learners participated; most completed the survey (13/15; 87%). The MEJC was rated as very or extremely useful. Qualitative feedback indicated that it was convenient, allowed creativity, and enabled rich discussion without prior preparation. When possible, improvement suggestions were implemented. DISCUSSION The authors offer an evidence-based MEJC approach that is free, interactive with virtual breakout rooms and requires no prior learner preparation. Early indicators suggest that others navigating the COVID-19 crisis may want to implement this approach.","Cadieux, Magalie; Campos-Zamora, Melissa; Zagury-Orly, Ivry; Dzara, Kristina",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,433,1

However, there has been no report on 10-year outcome of RFA. The objective of this study was to report a 10-year consecutive case series at a tertiary referral center. METHODS We performed 2,982 RFA treatments on 1,170 primary HCC patients and analyzed a collected database. RESULTS Final computed tomography images showed complete tumor ablation in 2,964 (99.4%) of 2,982 treatments performed for the 1,170 primary HCC patients. With a median follow-up of 38.2 months, 5- and 10-year survival rates were 60.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 56.7-63.9%) and 27.3% (95% CI: 21.5-34.7%), respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age, antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), Child-Pugh class, tumor size, tumor number, serum des-γ-carboxy-prothrombin (DCP) level, and serum lectin-reactive α-fetoprotein level (AFP-L3) were significantly related to survival. Five- and 10-year local tumor progression rates were both 3.2% (95% CI: 2.1-4.3%). Serum DCP level alone was significantly related to local tumor progression. Five- and 10-year distant recurrence rates were 74.8% (95% CI: 71.8-77.8%) and 80.8% (95% CI: 77.4-84.3%), respectively. Anti-HCV, Child-Pugh class, platelet count, tumor size, tumor number, serum AFP level, and serum DCP level were significantly related to distant recurrence. There were 67 complications (2.2%) and 1 death (0.03%). CONCLUSIONS RFA could be locally curative for HCC, resulting in survival for as long as 10 years, and was a safe procedure. RFA might be a first-line treatment for selected patients with early-stage HCC.","Shiina, Shuichiro; Tateishi, Ryosuke; Arano, Toru; Uchino, Koji; Enooku, Kenichiro; Nakagawa, Hayato; Asaoka, Yoshinari; Sato, Takahisa; Masuzaki, Ryota; Kondo, Yuji; Goto, Tadashi; Yoshida, Haruhiko; Omata, Masao; Koike, Kazuhiko",The American journal of gastroenterology,433,1

Pulmonary fibrosis, which may be one of the sequela caused by COVID-19, not only brings dyspnea and deterioration of lung function, but also affects patients' life because of its high mortality and poor prognosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor(VEGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor(FGFR) can inhibit the proliferation, activation and migration of fibroblasts by regulating the signal transduction pathway involved in the process of pulmonary fibrosis. Chinese herbal formulas pose a good therapeutic effect on pulmonary fibrosis. Present study explores the intervention effect on pulmonary fibrosis of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) by screening the potential inhibitors of VEGFR and FGFR. The docking models of VEGFR and FGFR were established to obtain the potential active ingredients which were filtered by the docking score. According to 2 prescriptions in the Protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019(7th edition)and 9 prescriptions in Traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for treating blight, 959 and 1 047 potential ingredients were obtained as the inhibitors of VEGFR and FGFR respectively with the screening thres-hold set as eighty percent of the docking score of the initial ligands. The potential herbs were then filtered by the components with a hit rate higher than 30%, such as Scutellariae Radix, Adenophorae Radix, Pinelliae Rhizoma, Coicis Semen, etc. To discuss the rule of TCM in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, the networks of TCM-channel tropism and TCM-efficacy of the potential herbs was constructed. The potential herbs for treating pulmonary fibrosis mostly belong to lung(degree=14) and spleen(degree value=8), and the efficacy is focused on reinforcing deficiency(degree=9). Qiyin Prescription and Buzhong Yiqi Decoction contain the largest number of the potential herbs. The main symptom of COVID-19 is damp-heat stagnating in the lung, which always causes impairment of body fluid and Qi. Clinical observation shows that patients in the recovery period are mostly at the status that the remaining virus toxicity is not exhausted while the vital Qi have not recovered. The results of this study are expected to provide references for clinical medication in preventing and treating pulmonary fibrosis caused by COVID-19.","Bian, Ya-Qian; Ma, Jing; Ren, Yue; Zhang, Yan-Ling; Qiao, Yan-Jiang",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,433,31

Up to now, clinical features and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail. However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation has been scarcely addressed. Our aim is to investigate the blood coagulation function of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In our study, 94 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We prospectively collect blood coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the same period. Results Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the control group (p < 0.001). The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB) in all SARS-CoV-2 cases were substantially higher than those in healthy controls. Moreover, D-dimer and FDP values in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher than those in patients with milder forms. Compared with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity (PT-act) was lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thrombin time in critical SARS-CoV-2 patients was also shorter than that in controls. Conclusions The coagulation function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly deranged compared with healthy people, but monitoring D-dimer and FDP values may be helpful for the early identification of severe cases.","Han, Huan; Yang, Lan; Liu, Rui; Liu, Fang; Wu, Kai-Lang; Li, Jie; Liu, Xing-Hui; Zhu, Cheng-Liang",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,433,24

Large-vessel occlusions were observed in multiple vessels (40%), uncommonly affected vessels, and atypical locations with a large thrombus burden. Systemic thrombosis separate from large-vessel occlusion was not uncommon (26%). At short-term follow-up, stroke etiology remained undetermined in 46% of patients and functional outcome was poor.

This study aims to demonstrate that NMF is as effective in the long term by following up a large number of patients with a mean follow-up of 6 years. The primary outcomes are chronic pain and recurrence rate. METHODS A thorough review of medical records was conducted from a prospectively maintained database of 538 patients who underwent a laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair by a single surgeon working in Sydney from the year 2005 to 2010. Patient demographics, perioperative outcomes, and postoperative complications were extracted from this database. All these patients were then interviewed using a modified questionnaire based on Franneby et al. [10]. RESULT 538 patients had TEP repair between 2005 and 2010. Out of this 11 were excluded as tacks were used for fixation of mesh. Out of the 649 repairs done on 527 patients during this period, 463 hernia repairs in 387 patients could be followed up with a mean follow-up of 6 years and 4 months. The mean age of patients was 63 years. Overall, there were seven (1.5%) recurrences, and the incidence of chronic pain was 1%, however 2.9% patients in total complained of pain. CONCLUSION This is the only study in literature having a long-term follow-up of more than 5 years for the patients having inguinal hernia repair by TEP technique without mesh fixation. It demonstrates that fixation of mesh with tacks or glue is unnecessary for TEP repair of inguinal hernia.","Golani, S; Middleton, P",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,433,7

However, patients with PVT may be symptomatic with complications of portal hypertension, and may thus benefit from TIPSS to reduce portal venous pressure. There is increasing literature discussing the techniques and outcomes of TIPSS in PVT. This review summarises the techniques, indications and outcomes of TIPSS in PVT across published case reports, case series and comparative trials, especially regarding the reduction in portal hypertensive complications such as variceal bleeding. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases MEDLINE and PubMed. Manuscripts published in English between 1st January 1990 and 1st March 2021 were used. Abstracts were screened and data from potentially relevant articles analysed. RESULTS TIPSS in PVT has been reported with high levels of technical success, short-term portal vein recanalisation and long-term PV patency and TIPSS patency outcomes. Several comparative studies, including randomised controlled trials, have shown favourable outcomes compared to non-TIPSS treatment of PVT complications. Outcomes of TIPSS with PVT appear similar to those in TIPSS without PVT. However TIPSS may be more technically difficult in the presence of PVT, and such procedures should be performed in high-volume expert centres to mitigate the risk of procedural complications. CONCLUSIONS The presence of PVT should no longer be considered a contraindication to TIPSS. TIPSS for PVT has been acknowledged as a therapeutic strategy in recent international guidelines, although further studies are needed before recommendations can be strengthened.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) provides the ability to measure gastric content and is being used as a surrogate for aspiration risk in anesthesia. We sought to evaluate the gastric content of pediatric emergency department (PED) patients undergoing PSA using POCUS. METHODS We performed a prospective observational study using a convenience sample of pediatric patients undergoing PSA between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2019. Following a brief history, gastric content was measured using POCUS in both supine and right lateral decubitus positions at 2-hour intervals until the time of PSA. Qualitative content and calculated volume were classified based on the Perlas Model of anesthesia ""Risk"" assessment. RESULTS Ninety-three patients were enrolled with 61.3% male and mean age of 6.5 years. Gastric content was determined in 92 patients. There were 79.3% that had ""high risk"" content at the time of PSA, with a median fasting time of 6.25 hours and no serious adverse events.

However, it requires efficient catalysts to overcome the large overpotentials in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report a novel heterostructure catalyst Co9S8/Cu2S on copper foam (Co9S8/Cu2S/CF) with multistep impregnation and electrodeposition. Due to the strong interfacial interaction, the interfacial electrons transfer from Co sites to S sites, which promote the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates, water molecules, as well as the dissociation of water molecules. Therefore, the heterostructure catalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 195 mV for OER and 165 mV for HER at 10 mA cm-2, respectively. Moreover, it only needs 1.6 V to realize water splitting at 10 mA cm-2 in a two-electrode cell. This work provides an efficient method to tailor the surface electronic structure through specific morphological design and construct a heterostructure interface to achieve alkaline water splitting.","Zang, Zehao; Wang, Xuewei; Li, Xiang; Zhao, Qingling; Li, Lanlan; Yang, Xiaojing; Yu, Xiaofei; Zhang, Xinghua; Lu, Zunming",ACS applied materials & interfaces,433,27

From statistical investigations by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) pattern analysis, we statistically and microscopically resolve the zinc-blende (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ) polytypism within the NWs. The XRD analysis shows a smaller fraction of WZ segments in the NWs with a larger concentration of nitrogen. With increasing nitrogen content in the GaNAs shell, the ZB peak position shifts toward higher angles and the WZ peak intensity decreases. The EBSD measurements also confirm the coexistence of ZB and WZ polytypes in all of the NWs. Their polytype switches along the length. Twin defects are observed in the ZB segments in all of the NWs. The unique grain map and grain size distribution show a decrease of the WZ segments in the GaAs/GaNAs/GaAs NW, in agreement with the XRD results. Microscopically, the local area where the polytype switches from WZ in the inner-core side to ZB toward the outer-shell surface is observed. Overall, we propose that the WZ polytype in the GaAs NWs decreases because of the strain induced by the growth of the GaNAs shell with a smaller lattice constant.","Yukimune, Mitsuki; Fujiwara, Ryo; Mita, Takaya; Ishikawa, Fumitaro",Nanotechnology,433,26

In order to meet this need, the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines public-private partnership initiated the Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19. Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 is a multi-arm, multi-stage platform master protocol, which facilitates the rapid evaluation of the safety and efficacy of novel candidate antiviral therapeutic agents for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Five agents have so far entered the protocol, with rapid answers already provided for three of these. Other agents are expected to enter the protocol throughout 2021. This protocol contains a number of key design and implementation features that, along with challenges faced by the protocol team, are presented and discussed. METHODS Three clinical trial networks, encompassing a global network of clinical sites, participated in the protocol development and implementation. Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 utilizes a multi-arm, multi-stage design with an agile and robust approach to futility and safety evaluation at 300 patients enrolled, with subsequent expansion to full sample size and an expanded target population if the agent shows an acceptable safety profile and evidence of efficacy. Rapid recruitment to multiple agents is enabled through the sharing of placebo, the confining of agent-specific information to protocol appendices, and modular consent forms. In collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration, a thorough safety data collection and Data and Safety Monitoring Board schedule was developed for the study of potential therapeutic agents with limited in-human data in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. RESULTS As of 8 August 2021, five agents have entered the Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 master protocol and a total of 1909 participants have been randomized to one of these agents or matching placebo. There were a number of challenges faced by the study team that needed to be overcome in order to successfully implement Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 across a global network of sites. These included ensuring drug supply and reliable recruitment allowing for changing infection rates across the global network of sites, the need to balance the collection of data and samples without overburdening clinical staff and obtaining regulatory approvals across a global network of sites. CONCLUSION Through a robust multi-network partnership, the Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 protocol has been successfully used across a global network of sites for rapid generation of efficacy data on multiple novel antiviral agents. The protocol design and implementation features used in this protocol, and the approaches to address challenges, will have broader applicability. Mechanisms to facilitate improved communication and harmonization among country-specific regulatory bodies are required to achieve the full potential of this approach in dealing with a global outbreak.","Murray, Daniel D; Babiker, Abdel G; Baker, Jason V; Barkauskas, Christina E; Brown, Samuel M; Chang, Christina C; Davey, Victoria J; Gelijns, Annetine C; Ginde, Adit A; Grund, Birgit; Higgs, Elizabeth; Hudson, Fleur; Kan, Virginia L; Lane, H Clifford; Murray, Thomas A; Paredes, Roger; Parmar, Mahesh Kb; Pett, Sarah; Phillips, Andrew N; Polizzotto, Mark N; Reilly, Cavan; Sandkovsky, Uriel; Sharma, Shweta; Teitelbaum, Marc; Thompson, B Taylor; Young, Barnaby E; Neaton, James D; Lundgren, Jens D",Clinical trials,433,0

Of these patients, 693 with underlying CVDRF were analyzed; patients were divided into age groups (<55, 55-64, 65-79, and ≥80 years) and in-hospital mortality and age-specific clinical and cardiac biomarker profiles on admission evaluated. Overall, the mean age of patients was 68 years, 449 (64.8%) were male, and 693 (45.7%) had underlying CVDRF. Elderly (≥80 years) patients had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality regardless of concomitant CVDRF than younger patients (P<0.001). Typical characteristics related to COVID-19, including symptoms and abnormal findings on baseline chest X-ray and computed tomography scans, were significantly less prevalent in the elderly group than in the younger groups. However, a significantly (P<0.001) higher proportion of elderly patients were positive for cardiac troponin (cTn), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro BNP (NT-proBNP) levels on admission were significantly higher among elderly than younger patients (P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively).

In this study, the binding site prediction is viewed as a semantic segmentation problem. An improved 3D version of the U-Net model based on the dice loss function is utilized to predict the binding sites accurately. The performance of the proposed model on the independent test datasets and SARS-COV-2 shows the segmentation model could predict the binding sites with a more accurate shape than the recently published deep learning model, i.e. DeepSite. Therefore, the model may help predict the binding sites of proteins and could be used in drug design for novel proteins.","Nazem, Fatemeh; Ghasemi, Fahimeh; Fassihi, Afshin; Dehnavi, Alireza Mehri",Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,433,16

Acupuncture is a traditional rehabilitation technique in China, which has been used in rehabilitation for COPD. But whether acupuncture can improve the diaphragm function of COPD patients remains to be verified. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the rehabilitation effects of acupuncture on diaphragm dysfunction in patients with COPD. Methods The authors retrieved in CNKI, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, Ebsco, Web of Science, from inception to November 2020, for relevant randomized control trials. Two researchers independently screened the articles and extracted the data. The quality of the included studies was evaluated by Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. The primary outcome measures were maximal inspiratory pressure and the scale for accessory respiratory muscle mobilization, the secondary outcome measures were pulmonary function-related indicators and arterial blood gas indicators. Results Nine articles were finally obtained. Seven studies added acupuncture to standard treatment for patients with diaphragm dysfunction in COPD and found statistically significant changes in the maximum inspiratory pressure and the scale for accessory respiratory muscle mobilization. Two studies have proved that use acupuncture combined with other Traditional Chinese Medicine methods in the rehabilitation for COPD can effectively improve the diaphragm strength and diaphragmatic motor performance. Seven studies showed that acupuncture has obvious improvement in pulmonary ventilation function. Seven studies reported significant differences in arterial blood gas pre- to post-intervention. Conclusion This systematic review found that acupuncture can effectively enhance the diaphragm strength, relieve respiratory muscle fatigue, it can also play a promoting role in improving lung function, hypoxia, and carbon dioxide retention, as well as preventing and alleviating respiratory failure. The generalizability of these results is limited by the design of the included studies.","Liu, Qinxin; Duan, Hongxia; Lian, Anbei; Zhuang, Min; Zhao, Xianli; Liu, Xiaodan",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,433,31

According to WBE-theory suggested by West, Brown, and Enquist, E should be in the range from -0.6 to -0.7 eV. However, there are many examples of significant deviations of E from the predictions of the theory. Now we have conducted a study of this value using rats in different types of pharmacological hypothermia: 1. Short-term (for several hours) hypothermia induced by anesthetic xylazine; 2. Daily torpor-like state induced by the pharmacological composition developed in our previous study. It has been found that in pharmacological daily hypothermia E = -0.56 ± 0.03 eV, which was close to that in daily heterotherms found in literature, E = -0.57 ± 0.04 eV. In short-term hypothermia E was substantially lower, E = -0.17 ± 0.071 eV. Our analysis revealed that in short-term hypothermia, changes in body temperature may lag behind changes in metabolic rate for a period Δt, affecting E. We propose an approach for estimating Δt and obtaining an adjusted E = -0.68 ± 0.17 eV, which corresponds to theoretical predictions. We assume that a similar consideration of Δt should be done when calculating E of daily heterotherms. We assume that in ectotherms, when the ambient temperature changes rapidly, changes in metabolic rate may lag behind changes in body temperature for a period (-) Δt, that should also be considered in E calculations. The proposed approach may contribute to the further development of the metabolic theory of evolution and may be useful in comparing artificial and natural hypothermia, as well as in studying the energy transformations in ecosystems.","Tarahovsky, Yury S; Khrenov, Maxim O; Kovtun, Anatoly L; Zakharova, Nadezhda M",Journal of thermal biology,433,1

METHODS A retrospective study at a tertiary paediatric centre. Admitted individuals who had prior attempts at ambulatory stabilisation were matched with intervention naïve controls who underwent outpatient intervention. The mean age was 14.6 years in the admitted group and 14.7 years in the ambulatory group. Mean duration of diabetes was 6.1 years in the admitted group and 7.3 years in the ambulatory group. Change in HbA1c from baseline was assessed to 12 months. RESULTS Mean baseline HbA1c was 11.3% (100 mmol/mol), with 11.4% in the admitted group and 11.2% in the ambulatory group. Sustained reduction in HbA1c at 12 months was seen in both groups (n = 35 in each): mean (standard deviation) 10.1% (1.5) in admitted (mean reduction in HbA1c 1.4%) and 9.7% (1.4) in ambulatory (mean reduction in HbA1c 1.5%). Proportions achieving delta HbA1c ≥2% (22 mmol/mol) at 12 months were 25 and 31% in admitted and ambulatory groups, respectively. A sustained reduction in HbA1c of ≥2% (22 mmol/mol) after 12 months was more likely in those who attained this reduction by 6 months (17/24 who achieved this at 6 months vs. 3/41 who had not).

Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus unexpectedly identified at hemorrhoidectomy pathologic evaluation is not uncommon. We hypothesized this is occurring more frequently and sought to evaluate its impact on outcomes. METHODS The Kentucky Cancer Registry, a premier population database, was queried for all squamous cell carcinoma of the anus cases between 2007 and 2016. Hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus patients were compared with nonhemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinomas of the anus. Patient demographics, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Of the 722 squamous cell carcinoma of the anus cases identified, 3.05% (n = 22) were within hemorrhoidectomy specimens. Demographics were similar between hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus versus nonhemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. Chemoradiation was the most common treatment strategy among all patients, and there were similar rates of disease, persistence, recurrence, and survival between hemorrhoidal and nonhemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma. Stage I disease was more common in the hemorrhoid group compared with the nonhemorrhoid group (63% vs 27%, P < .01). CONCLUSION Hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus comprised 3.05% of our population-based cohort. Hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinomas of the anus were more likely to receive chemoradiation compared with local excision, but there were similar oncologic outcomes. We postulate that some individuals may receive overtreatment with chemoradiation owing to imprecise labeling of hemorrhoid specimens. For this reason, we advocate for separate submission of each hemorrhoid specimen.","O'Brien, Stephen J; Ellis, C Tyler; McDowell, Jaclyn; Galandiuk, Susan; Polk, Hiram C",Surgery,433,24

Such cases may provide unique insight into brain regions responsible for mania symptoms and identify therapeutic targets.METHODSLesion locations associated with mania were identified using a systematic literature search (n = 41) and mapped onto a common brain atlas. The network of brain regions functionally connected to each lesion location was computed using normative human connectome data (resting-state functional MRI, n = 1000) and contrasted with those obtained from lesion locations not associated with mania (n = 79). Reproducibility was assessed using independent cohorts of mania lesions derived from clinical chart review (n = 15) and of control lesions (n = 490). Results were compared with brain stimulation sites previously reported to induce or relieve mania symptoms.RESULTSLesion locations associated with mania were heterogeneous and no single brain region was lesioned in all, or even most, cases. However, these lesion locations showed a unique pattern of functional connectivity to the right orbitofrontal cortex, right inferior temporal gyrus, and right frontal pole. This connectivity profile was reproducible across independent lesion cohorts and aligned with the effects of therapeutic brain stimulation on mania symptoms.CONCLUSIONSBrain lesions associated with mania are characterized by a specific pattern of brain connectivity that lends insight into localization of mania symptoms and potential therapeutic targets.FUNDINGFundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT), Harvard Medical School DuPont-Warren Fellowship, Portuguese national funds from FCT and Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional, Child Neurology Foundation Shields Research, Sidney R.

Four edges of the mesh were fixed with pre-tied 2/0 polypropylene suture for 9 patients initially (Group 1). Unexpected complication of chronic pain in 3 patients led us to revise our method and we avoided to position the mesh with transabdominal sutures for the rest of the patients (Group 2). Results Nineteen (82.6%) female and 4 (17.4%) male patients, with a mean age of 50.9 years underwent laparoscopic repair. Following the revision and avoiding transabdominal sutures to position the mesh, no complaint of chronic pain was observed, and the difference was statistically significant between the groups (p<0.05). Conclusion Previous laparoscopic surgery indicates the lack of obstacle in laparoscopic repair of TSH, and LRTSH can be considered as first option in treatment. Shorter mean operative time in obese patients and lack of recurrence in our series support this view. Using transabdominal sutures should be avoided to prevent chronic pain in LRTSH.","Sıkar, Hasan Ediz; Çetin, Kenan",Turkish journal of surgery,433,19

We examined how hybrid rounds with virtual communication added to in-person rounds could facilitate social distancing while maintaining patient-centered care. DESIGN Continuous quality improvement. SETTING Quaternary care referral pediatric hospital. PATIENTS Daytime rounds conducted on PICU patients. INTERVENTIONS Following a needs assessment survey and pilot trials, multiple technological solutions were implemented in a series of plan-do-study-act cycles. Hybrid rounds model was deployed where a videoconference platform was used to establish communication between the bedside personnel (nurse, patient/family, and partial ICU team) with remotely located remaining ICU team, ancillary, and consultant providers. Floor labels marking 6-feet distance were placed for rounders. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Outcome metrics included compliance with social distancing, mixed methods analysis of surveys, direct interviews of providers and families, and reports of safety concerns. The clinicians adopted hybrid rounds readily. Compliance with social distancing and use of floor labels needed reminders. One-hundred fourteen providers completed the feedback survey. Twenty-five providers and 11 families were interviewed. Feedback about hybrid rounds included inability to teach effectively, suboptimal audio-video quality, loss of situational awareness of patient/unit acuity, alarm interference, and inability to socially distance during other ICU interactions. Benefits noted were improved ancillary input, fewer interruptions, improved efficiency, opportunity to integrate with data platforms, and engage remote consultants and families. Nurses and families appreciated the efforts to ensure safety but wanted the ICU attending/fellow supervising the team to participate at bedside, during rounds. Clinicians appreciated the multidisciplinary input but felt that teaching was difficult. CONCLUSIONS Hybrid rounds employed during pandemic facilitated social distancing while retaining patient-centered multidisciplinary ICU rounds but compromised teaching during rounds. A change to ingrained rounding habits needs team commitment and ongoing optimization. The hybrid rounds model has potential for generalizability to other settings.","Bavare, Aarti C; Goldman, Jordana R; Musick, Matthew A; Sembera, Kerry A; Sardual, Alex A; Lam, Anne K; Tume, Sebastian C; Thammasitboon, Satid X; Williams, Eric A",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,433,1

The work presented here used healthy animal tissues, in lieu of diseased tissue, which is extremely difficult to obtain and quantify. METHODS Briefly, fresh explanted porcine and canine trachea-lung blocs were used for all testing. Tissue thicknesses were measured with a custom-design spring-loaded caliper before stapling with control and test articles to ensure that the tissue was of ""appropriate"" thickness for the stapler size (staple height) selected (per manufacturer's instructions for use). All tissue measurements were comparable across each area of lung tested, and both test and control devices were fired into the same tissue thicknesses. After stapling, the lungs were submerged in water, insufflated, checked for air leaks at four discrete (increasing) pressures, and scored using a predetermined scale. Statistical analysis was performed for n = 26 (3.5-mm staples), n = 29 (4.8-mm staples), and n = 26 or 29 (paired to the standard group) for the variable-height stapler (3.0-, 3.5-, and 4.0-mm staples). RESULTS The results demonstrated that the test article comprising three rows of variable-height staples provided comparable pneumostasis with the standard three-row single-height staplers (with staple heights of either 3.5 or 4.8 mm) under the test conditions described. CONCLUSIONS A novel test article containing three rows of staples with heights of 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mm (variable-height stapler) showed promising results when compared with standard commercially available single-height staplers, performing as well as or better than the standard single-height staplers. This work demonstrates important first steps to proving equivalent device performance, which might facilitate the use of a variable-height stapler in place of multiple single-height staplers.","Contini, Elizabeth; Godek, Marisha L; Whiffen, Jennifer M; Bronson, Dwight G",Innovations,433,1

Using a high-density transposon screen in the enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, we find that the bacterium requires amino acid biosynthesis pathways to colonize conventionally raised mice, but not germ-free or antibiotic-treated animals. These metabolic pathways are induced during infection by the presence of the gut microbiota. Reduced amounts of amino acids are found in the guts of conventionally raised mice compared with germ-free animals. Dietary administration of high protein increases amino acid levels in the gut and promotes pathogen colonization. Thus, the depletion of amino acids by the microbiota limits pathogen colonization, and in turn, the pathogen activates amino acid biosynthesis to expand in the presence of the microbiota.","Caballero-Flores, Gustavo; Pickard, Joseph M; Fukuda, Shinji; Inohara, Naohiro; Núñez, Gabriel",Cell host & microbe,433,16

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of addition of TOC to standard of care (SOC) versus SOC in patients with COVID-19. METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, WHO COVID, LitCOVID and Cochrane databases. Pooled outcomes (overall mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and secondary infections) were compared using DerSimonian-Laird/Random-effects approach. Risk difference (RD), confidence interval (CI), and p-values were generated. RESULTS A total of 23 studies with 6279 patients (1897 in TOC and 4382 in SOC group, respectively) were included. The overall mortality was lower in TOC group compared to SOC group (RD: -0.06, CI: -0.12 - -0.01, p = 0.03). Subgroup analysis including studies with only severe cases revealed lower mortality (RD: -0.12, CI: -0.18 - -0.06, p <0.01) and need for mechanical ventilation (RD: -0.11, CI: -0.19 - -0.02, p = 0.01) in TOC group compared to SOC group.

With the recent increase in popularity of single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), several techniques for SILS appendectomy have already been described. We herein describe our own simplified technique for single incision transumbilical laparoscopic appendectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS From December 2008 to August 2009, a total of 26 patients consented for single incision laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data were collected. RESULTS Our technique was successful in 19 out of 26 (73.1%) patients, while seven patients required the placement of additional trocars. None of the patients needed conversion to an open approach. Mean OR time was 45.9 min. The mean length of stay was 1.1 day. Only one patient had developed postoperative umbilical wound infection. CONCLUSION Our technique for single incision laparoscopic transumbilical appendectomy is safe feasible, and reproducible. Prospective randomized studies comparing the single incision laparoscopic approach with its conventional multiport counterpart are necessary to confirm the conclusions of our early experience.","Saber, Alan A; Elgamal, Mohamed H; El-Ghazaly, Tarek H; Dewoolkar, Aditya V; Akl, Abir",International journal of surgery,433,20

Male sex, advanced age, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity have been identified as risk factors for the COVID-19 severity. Presumably, as these three cardiovascular risk factors are associated with a high prevalence of multiorgan damage. In the present focused clinical review, we will discuss the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 including acute cardiovascular syndrome (acute cardiac injury/COVID cardiomyopathy, thromboembolic complications and arrhythmias) and post-COVID-19 sequelae. Preliminary data shows that the cause of acute cardiovascular syndrome may be multifactorial and involve direct viral invasion of the heart and vascular system, as well as through the immune and inflammation-mediated systemic cytokine storm. COVID-19 survivors may also show persistently elevated blood pressure and sinus tachycardia at rest. Furthermore, poor diabetic control, persistent renal damage and cerebral sequelae, such as persistent cognitive and neuropsychiatric alterations are also frequently reported. A particular attention should be paid towards cardiovascular protection in COVID-19 patients who develop acute cardiovascular syndromes during hospitalization, and/or permanent/semipermanent sequelae after recovery from COVID-19. These conditions may require careful clinical assessment, treatment and close follow-up to avoid short-term and long-term complications.","Saeed, Sahrai; Tadic, Marijana; Larsen, Terje H; Grassi, Guido; Mancia, Giuseppe",Journal of hypertension,433,6

Modulating the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) may be an enforceable strategy for atherosclerosis prevention. Therefore, we investigated the potential mechanisms of N. nucifera leaf polyphenol extract (NLPE) and its active ingredient gallic acid (GA) in VSMC proliferation and migration. A7r5 rat aortic VSMCs were provoked using 50 ng mL-1 tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α; the NLPE or GA reduced the TNF-α-induced migration by inhibiting the transforming protein RhoA/cell division cycle protein 42 pathway. The NLPE or GA suppressed the TNF-α-induced VSMC proliferation by inhibiting the Ras pathway and increasing the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), kinase suppressor of Ras 2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. The NLPE or GA increased PTEN expression by downregulating microRNA (miR)-21 expression and reduced Ras and RhoA expression by upregulating miR-143 and miR-145 expression. The NLPE and GA use potentially prevents atherosclerosis by inhibiting the VSMC migration and proliferation. The mechanisms involve the regulation of the miRNA in PTEN, the Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathway, and Rho family proteins.","Chung, Dai-Jung; Wu, Yi-Liang; Yang, Mon-Yuan; Chan, Kuei-Chuan; Lee, Huei-Jane; Wang, Chau-Jong",Food & function,433,31

METHODS Participants within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation were eligible if they provided encounter data in the 3 months immediately before and after the national emergency proclamation date (NEPD). RESULTS The mean age of the 528 study participants was 53.9 years and 74.1% were women. Utilization of exercise therapy, massage therapy, and spinal manipulation decreased during the pandemic. Increasing age was associated with decreased utilization of all nonpharmacological treatments except exercise therapy, and with increased opioid use during the pandemic. African American participants reported decreased utilization of yoga and spinal manipulation during the pandemic. Overall, mean change scores for pain intensity and disability before and after the NEPD were not significant. However, African American participants consistently reported worse pain intensity and disability outcomes during the pandemic. Marginally worse outcomes were observed less consistently for pain intensity with increasing age and for disability among women. DISCUSSION Social distancing during the pandemic impacted the uptake of recommended nonpharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain that require visiting community-based facilities or interacting closely with providers. CONCLUSIONS The pandemic threatens to exacerbate the impact of chronic low back pain, particularly among African American patients and the older population, by impeding access to guideline-informed noninvasive treatments.","Licciardone, John C",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,433,1

Consequently, numerous anti-inflammatory molecules that are effective in animal models of COPD have been or are being evaluated in humans. AREAS COVERED : In this article we describe several classes of drugs that target the cellular components of inflammation under clinical development for COPD. EXPERT OPINION Although the results of many clinical trials with new molecules have often been disappointing, several studies are underway to investigate whether some of these molecules may be effective in treating specific subgroups of COPD patients. Indeed, the current perspective is to apply a more personalized treatment to the patient. This means being able to better define the patient's inflammatory state and treat it in a targeted manner. Unfortunately, the difficulty in translating encouraging experimental data into human clinical trials, the redundancy in the effects induced by signal-transmitting substances and the non-specific effects of many classes that are undergoing clinical trials, do not yet allow specific inflammatory cell types to be targeted.","Matera, Maria Gabriella; Calzetta, Luigino; Annibale, Rosa; Russo, Francesco; Cazzola, Mario",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,433,1

Continued surgical innovation has seen the recent resurgence of single-port laparoscopic surgery. We present a series of 10 cases of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for right hemicolectomy, with the aim of reaffirming the feasibility and favourable short-term results of this technique. METHODS Ten patients underwent SILS for right hemicolectomy using the SILS port, between June 2009 and August 2009. A longitudinal periumbilical incision was used as the access point for all cases. Data analysed included age, gender, American Society of Anaesthesiology score, body mass index (BMI), location of disease, duration of surgery, length of incision and duration of hospital stay. Inclusion criteria were no prior abdominal surgery, no intra-abdominal sepsis, no distant metastases and a BMI of <30. RESULTS All 10 cases of right hemicolectomy were successfully performed using the SILS port through a single periumbilical incision. The median age of patients was 64 years (range 48-83 years), with a median body mass index of 21.5 kg/m(2) (range 18.9-25.6 kg/m(2)). The median duration of surgery and hospital stay was 83 min (range 60-125 min) and 6 days (range 5-11 days), respectively. No morbidity or mortality was associated with this technique, and all patients recovered uneventfully. CONCLUSION This case series illustrates that SILS for right hemicolectomy is feasible and safe. However, the routine use of this innovative technique in malignant disease cannot be recommended without further large-scale prospective trials.","Wong, M T C; Ng, K H; Ho, K S; Eu, K W",Techniques in coloproctology,433,12

Investigations are warranted to predict the influences of implant macro-textures on bone on-growth pattern. Mechanoregulatory tissue differentiation algorithms can predict such patterns effectively. There is, however, a dearth of volumetric in silico study to assess the influence of macro-textures on bone growth.

Three distinct macro-textures, loosely based on commercially viable hip stem models, were comparatively assessed for varying levels of interfacial micromotion. The study predicted elevated fibrogenesis and chondrogenesis, followed by a suppressed osteogenesis for higher levels of micromotion (60 μm and 100 μm), resulting in weak bone-implant interface strength. However, small judicious modifications in implant surface texture may enhance bone growth to a considerable extent.

We evaluated tracheal injury associated with ETTs with novel high-volume low-pressure (HVLP) cuffs and subglottic secretions aspiration (SSA) and the effects on mucociliary clearance (MCC). METHODS Twenty-nine pigs were intubated with ETTs comprising cylindrical or tapered cuffs and made of polyvinylchloride (PVC) or polyurethane. In specific ETTs, SSA was performed every 2 h. Following 76 h of mechanical ventilation, pigs were weaned and extubated. Images of the tracheal wall were recorded before intubation, at extubation, and 24 and 96 h thereafter through a fluorescence bronchoscope. We calculated the red-to-green intensity ratio (R/G), an index of tracheal injury, and the green-plus-blue (G+B) intensity, an index of normalcy, of the most injured tracheal regions. MCC was assessed through fluoroscopic tracking of radiopaque markers. After 96 h from extubation, pigs were killed, and a pathologist scored injury. RESULTS Cylindrical cuffs presented a smaller increase in R/G vs tapered cuffs (P = .011). Additionally, cuffs made of polyurethane produced a minor increase in R/G (P = .012) and less G+B intensity decline (P = .022) vs PVC cuffs. Particularly, a cuff made of polyurethane and with a smaller outer diameter outperformed all cuffs. SSA-related histologic injury ranged from cilia loss to subepithelial inflammation. MCC was 0.9 ± 1.8 and 0.4 ± 0.9 mm/min for polyurethane and PVC cuffs, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS HVLP cuffs and SSA produce tracheal injury, and the recovery is incomplete up to 96 h following extubation. Small, cylindrical-shaped cuffs made of polyurethane cause less injury. MCC decline is reduced with polyurethane cuffs.","Li Bassi, Gianluigi; Luque, Nestor; Martí, Joan Daniel; Aguilera Xiol, Eli; Di Pasquale, Marta; Giunta, Valeria; Comaru, Talitha; Rigol, Montserrat; Terraneo, Silvia; De Rosa, Francesca; Rinaudo, Mariano; Crisafulli, Ernesto; Peralta Lepe, Rogelio Cesar; Agusti, Carles; Lucena, Carmen; Ferrer, Miguel; Fernández, Laia; Torres, Antoni",Chest,433,12

The jejunojejunostomy was a stapled anastomosis. Estimated blood loss was less than 100 mL. The patient was ambulating and tolerating oral intake on post-operative day 1, and was discharged home on post-operative day 2. CONCLUSIONS Robotic resection of choledochal cyst with intracorporeal Roux-en-Y anastomosis is feasible, with advantages over open surgery such as superior visualization, precision, and post-operative patient recovery.","Carpenter, S G; Grimsby, G; DeMasters, T; Katariya, N; Hewitt, W R; Moss, A A; Reddy, K S; Castle, E P; Mulligan, D C",Journal of robotic surgery,433,17

Accurate and timely information can help the public understand the outbreak and manage their lives. Presented here is a study of how residents of Hubei Province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, use media for information seeking, scanning, and sharing while under lockdown through in-depth interviews. We find that (1) individuals primarily acquire information through information scanning from official governmental sources, (2) information sharing is more frequent with family members through private channels than with one's extended social networks and the general public through pubic channels mostly due to concerns with censorship, and (3) individuals' information need and information use change substantially during different stages of the outbreak. These findings provide insights into how individuals in China use different media for information during an unprecedented public health crisis and make sense of the limited and often confusing and contradictory information that is available to them. Such findings can inform future health communication efforts during EID outbreaks.","Tang, Lu; Zou, Wenxue",Health communication,433,17

This study aims to explore approaches to increase HBV testing in Australia's Chinese community and inform evaluation planning, specifically to i) assess the feasibility and acceptability of HBV educational programs, and ii) compare HBV testing uptake in people receiving a tailored education resource focussing on liver cancer prevention compared with a standard HBV education package. METHODS This is a pre-post mixed-methods pilot and feasibility study. People of Chinese ethnicity and unsure of their HBV infection or immunity status were recruited from ten community sites in Melbourne, Australia in 2019-2020. Participants were randomised to receive an education package (comprised of a leaflet and in-person one-on-one educational session) with a focus on either 1) standard HBV-related information, or 2) liver cancer prevention. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire prior to receiving the intervention and were followed up at 6 months' time for a questionnaire and an opt-in semi-structured interview. Primary study outcomes included feasibility of study procedures, measured by recruitment, participation, and retention rates; acceptability of the education program assessed by acceptability scores; and HBV testing uptake rate in each arm. Secondary outcomes include HBV-related knowledge change, assessed by pre-post comparison; and factors affecting participants' testing behaviour analysed using qualitative data. RESULTS Fifty-four participants received an education package; baseline and follow-up data from 33 (61%) were available. The study procedures of recruitment and retention were feasible; the acceptability of the education program was moderate with improved HBV-related knowledge observed. Four participants self-reported being tested: one (1/15, 7%) in the standard HBV information group and three (3/18, 17%) in the liver cancer prevention information group. Factors identified as affecting testing included perceived relevance and seriousness of HBV, healthcare access and costs of testing, and perceptions of the role of primary care providers in HBV-related care. CONCLUSION A tailored education program targeting ethnic Chinese in Australia was feasible with moderate acceptability. A larger study is required to determine if a liver cancer prevention message would improve HBV testing uptake in Chinese community than standard HBV education message. Supports from healthcare providers, community-based testing programs, and public health education programs are likely needed to motivate diagnostic testing among Chinese people at risk of HBV infection.","Xiao, Yinzong; Wallace, Jack; Ahad, Marvad; van Gemert, Caroline; Thompson, Alexander J; Doyle, Joseph; Lam, Ho Yin; Chan, Kico; Bennett, Gabrielle; Adamson, Emily; Yussf, Nafisa; Tang, Aurora; Pedrana, Alisa; Stoove, Mark; Hellard, Margaret; Howell, Jessica",BMC public health,433,19

These stresses may impact parenting behaviors, potentially leading to negative consequences for children. Controlling parenting behaviors increase in the face of perceived environmental threat and are associated with adverse mental health outcomes for children; however, determinants of parenting behaviors have not been investigated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study prospectively evaluated parenting behaviors during the pandemic (N=87). Results indicated that all negative affect emotions investigated were positively associated with controlling parenting behaviors. However, only COVID-related fear predicted changes in controlling parenting behaviors across timepoints. Specifically, although controlling parenting behaviors decreased in the overall sample from time 1 to time 2, higher COVID-related fear scores at time 1 predicted maintenance of high levels of controlling parenting behaviors at time 2. Additionally, this effect was specific to controlling, as opposed to more adaptive, parenting behaviors.

Our study examined the association of plasma TMAO level with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS Patients who were at least 18 years-old and received HD for at least 6 months were enrolled within 6 months. Patients with coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, or stroke within 3 months before study onset were excluded. The primary endpoints were cardiovascular and all-cause death, and the secondary endpoint was cerebrovascular death. RESULTS We recruited 252 patients and divided them into a high-TMAO group (>4.73 μg/mL) and a low-TMAO group (≤4.73 μg/mL). The median follow-up time was 73.4 months (interquartile range: 42.9, 108). A total of 123 patients died, 39 from cardiovascular disease, 19 from cerebrovascular disease, and 65 from other causes. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the high-TMAO group had a greater incidence of cardiovascular death (Log-Rank: p = 0.006) and all-cause death (Log-Rank: p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed that high TMAO level was significantly associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. After adjustment for confounding, this association remained significant for cardiovascular mortality (TMAO as a continuous variable: HR: 1.18, 95%CI: 1.07, 1.294, p < 0.001; TMAO as a dichotomous variable: HR: 3.44, 95%CI: 1.68, 7.08, p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (TMAO as a continuous variable: HR: 1.14, 95%CI: 1.08, 1.21, p < 0.001; TMAO as a dichotomous variable: HR: 2.54, 95%CI: 1.71, 3.76, p < 0.001).

Chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations revealed that the FN-vlPAG pathway controls bi-directionally the strength of the fear memories, indicating an important role in the association of the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, a function consistent with vlPAG encoding of fear prediction error. Moreover, FN-vlPAG projections also modulate extinction learning. We also found a FN-parafascicular thalamus pathway, which may relay cerebellar influence to the amygdala and modulates anxiety behaviors.

These 2 entities have precise definitions from a clinical standpoint. Histologically, cases from patients with clinical acute lung injury typically exhibit diffuse alveolar damage, but other histologic patterns may occasionally be encountered such as acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and diffuse hemorrhage with capillaritis. OBJECTIVE To review the diagnostic criteria for various histologic patterns associated with a clinical presentation of acute lung injury and to provide diagnostic aids and discuss the differential diagnosis. DATA SOURCES The review is drawn from pertinent peer-reviewed literature and the author's personal experience. CONCLUSIONS Acute lung injury remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The pathologist should be aware of histologic patterns of lung disease other than diffuse alveolar damage, which are associated with a clinical presentation of acute lung injury. Identification of these alternative histologic findings, as well as identification of potential etiologic agents, especially infection, may impact patient treatment and disease outcome.","Beasley, Mary Beth",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,433,16

The present manuscript shows the presence of morphological and chromatic variations among populations of T. mexicana from the states of Hidalgo (Valle del Mezquital and Meztitlan), Guanajuato and Queretaro. The study employed 136 specimens collected in four locations. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study the morphological characteristics of the head, pronotum, and scutellum; also, we measured the width of the abdomen and the total length in the specimens of each population. The morphometric analysis considered 19 variables in the previous structures. Significant differences were found in the dimensions of the head and pronotum, but not in the scutellum; there is clear discrimination among the four proposed populations. The chromatic patterns observed in the connexivum go from yellow to brown and show some significant differences related to geographical origin. The set of evaluated characters showed a higher degree of difference in the population of Guanajuato, clearly separating from the rest of the populations, indicating the possibility of a divergence process.

The annual mean concentration of PM2.5 was 142.3 μg/m3, and 75% of the daily PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the 75 μg/m3. The secondary inorganic ions, organic matter and mineral dust were the most abundant species, accounting for 39.6%, 19.2% and 9.3% of the total mass concentration, respectively. But the major chemical components showed clear seasonal dependence. SO42- was most abundant specie in spring and summer, which related to intensive photochemical reaction under high O3 concentration. In contrast, the secondary organic carbon and ammonium while primary organic carbon and ammonium significantly contributed to haze formation in autumn and winter, respectively. This indicated that the collaboration effect of secondary inorganic aerosols and carbonaceous matters result in heavy haze in autumn and winter. Six main sources were identified by positive matrix factorization model: industrial emission, combustion sources, traffic emission, mineral dust, oil combustion and secondary sulfate, with the annual contribution of 24%, 20%, 24%, 4%, 5% and 23%, respectively. The potential source contribution function analysis pointed that the contribution of the local and short-range regional transportation had significant impact.

Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is a standard surgical management of patients with ulcerative colitis who have cancer or dysplasia, but the oncologic risk of stapled anastomosis vs mucosectomy with handsewn anastomosis is debated. We compare the risk of new cancer or recurrence in the pouch or rectal cuff in patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing stapled anastomosis vs mucosectomy with handsewn anastomosis. METHODS This study was performed as a retrospective analysis of the clinical database at a single center, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada. The patients with ulcerative colitis associated with colorectal dysplasia or cancer who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis between 1981 and 2009 were evaluated. The development of dysplasia or cancer at ileoanal anastomosis or in the pelvic pouch was assessed. RESULTS Eighty-one patients underwent stapled (n = 59) or handsewn (n = 22) ileal pouch-anal anastomosis; 52 had evidence of dysplasia and 29 had colorectal cancer (24 colon; 5 rectum) at the time of surgery. Median follow-up was 76.1 months. Two of 10 (20%) patients with handsewn anastomosis and 0% patients with stapled anastomosis developed metastatic cancer. One patient with a 33-year history of colitis, a previously resected right-sided colon cancer, and subsequent high-grade dysplasia in the rectum underwent a handsewn pelvic pouch and developed an unresectable adenocarcinoma at the cuff 4 years later. A second patient with a 10-year history of colitis underwent handsewn pelvic pouch and developed dysplasia in the pouch 8 years after surgery. Nine patients were dead at last follow-up (11%). Of those patients, both colorectal cancer-related deaths were in patients with handsewn anastomoses. Differences in overall 5-year survival between the groups did not reach statistical significance. This study was limited by the sample size in subgroups and the few outcome events. CONCLUSIONS Performing a stapled ileal pelvic anal anastomosis does not appear to be inferior to mucosectomy and handsewn anastomosis in oncologic outcome, and it seems appropriate in patients with ulcerative colitis associated with coexisting dysplasia or cancer.","Al-Sukhni, Wigdan; McLeod, Robin S; MacRae, Helen; O'Connor, Brenda; Huang, Harden; Cohen, Zane",Diseases of the colon and rectum,433,1

RESULTS The proportion of participants with high levels of anxiety symptoms increased significantly from 8.1% (95% CI[7.7, 8.5]) in 2019 to 21.4% (95% CI[19.9, 22.9]) at the beginning of April, 2020. The prevalence then declined to 11.4% (95% CI[10.3, 12.5]) in May and remained 3% above 2019 levels until December 2020. This pattern of increasing anxiety between 2019 and April 2020 followed by a rapid decrease in anxiety was identified across all demographic characteristics examined. LIMITATIONS The NHIS and UAS samples differ in their sampling and mode of administration which may bias comparisons between samples. CONCLUSIONS Anxiety symptoms increased markedly during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced quickly as stay-at-home orders were lifted. These findings highlight the importance of providing mental health supports during future lockdowns and suggest that resilience in mental health may have been a key population-level response to the demands of the pandemic.","Daly, Michael; Robinson, Eric",Journal of affective disorders,433,8

Intravitreal (IVT) injection of small molecule p75NTR antagonist THX-B was therapeutic and resolved the inflammatory, vascular, and neurodegenerative phases of the retinal pathology. To simplify clinical translation, we sought a superior drug delivery method that circumvents risks associated with IVT injections. Methods We compared the pharmacokinetics of a single 40 μg subconjunctival (SCJ) depot to the reported effective 5 μg IVT injections of THX-B. We quantified therapeutic efficacy, with endpoints of inflammation, edema, and neuronal death. Results The subconjunctival depot affords retinal exposure equal to IVT injection, without resulting in detectable drug in circulation. At week 2 of diabetic retinopathy, the SCJ depot provided therapeutic efficacy similar to IVT injections, with reduced inflammation, reduced edema, reduced neuronal death, and a long-lasting protection of the retinal structure. Conclusions Subconjunctival injections are a safe and effective route for retinal delivery of p75NTR antagonists. The subconjunctival route offers an advantageous, less-invasive, more compliant, and nonsystemic method to deliver p75NTR antagonists for the treatment of retinal diseases.","Galan, Alba; Barcelona, Pablo F; Nedev, Hinyu; Sarunic, Marinko V; Jian, Yifan; Saragovi, H Uri",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,433,16

Proper management of equipment and human resources is critical to provide adequate medical care to all patients admitted to the hospital and the ICU for both pandemic-related and unrelated reasons. RECENT FINDINGS Appropriate separate paths for infected and noninfected patients and prompt isolation of infected critical patients in dedicated ICUs play a pivotal role in limiting the contagions and optimizing resources during pandemics. The key to handle these challenging events is to learn from past experiences and to be prepared for future occurrences. Hospital space should be redesigned to quickly increase medical and critical care capacity, and healthcare workers (critical and noncritical) should be trained in advance. SUMMARY A targeted improvement of hospital and ICU protocols will increase medical care quality for patients admitted to the hospital for any clinical reasons during a pandemic.","Florio, Gaetano; Zanella, Alberto; Pesenti, Antonio",Current opinion in critical care,433,16

A variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), characterized by base deletion and insertion in the S gene, compared to classical PEDV CV777, was shown to be responsible for this outbreak. In this study, a multiplex TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR was developed for detecting PEDV and differentiating the variant from classical PEDV, by using two sets of primers and probes based on the S gene of PEDV. The limits of detection of both variant and classical PEDV were 5×10(2) DNA copies. Specificity was determined using eight other viral pathogens of swine. Reproducibility was evaluated using standard dilutions, with coefficients of variation <1.4%. Standard dilutions included in each test allowed quantification of the amount of PEDV. Among 42 intestinal samples from pigs with severe watery diarrhea, 36 variant PEDV and three classical PEDV samples were detected, with viral loads of 10(2)-10(8) copies/μl and 10(3)-10(5) copies/μl, respectively, which suggested that the variant PEDV was prevalent in China. The multiplex TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR should be a useful tool for quantifying viral load, detecting PEDV, and differentiating variant from classical PEDV.","Zhao, Pan-deng; Bai, Juan; Jiang, Ping; Tang, Tai-shan; Li, Yufeng; Tan, Chen; Shi, Xiaoli",Journal of virological methods,433,28

During the quarantine period (from January 24 to February 7, 2020), the concentrations of atmospheric pollutants decreased significantly relative to the period before controls were imposed (from January 15 to 23, 2020). Specifically, except for an increase in the concentration of O3, concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO decreased for 72.6 μg·m-3 (45.86%), 47.4 μg·m-3(41.24%), 25.6 μg·m-3 (58.00%), 3.0 μg·m-3 (17.71%), and 0.5 mg·m-3 (31.40%), respectively. RAMS-CMAQ simulation showed that meteorological diffusion had an essential role in improving air quality. Influenced by meteorological factors, emissions of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO were reduced 26.04%, 33.03%, 28.35%, 43.27%, and 23.29%, respectively. Furthermore, the concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO were reduced by 19.82%, 8.21%, 29.65%, -25.56%, and 8.12%, respectively, due to pollution emissions reductions during the quarantine period. O3 concentrations increased by 20.51% during quarantine, caused by both meteorological factors (10.47%) and human activities (10.04%). These results indicate that primary pollutants were more sensitive to emissions reductions; however, secondary pollutants demonstrated a lagged response the emissions reduction and were significantly affected by meteorological factors. The linear relationship between ozone and the emissions reduction was not significant, and was inverse overall. Further investigation are now required on the impact of emissions reduction on ozone pollution control.","Liu, Hou-Feng; Xu, Wei; Wei, Min; Sui, Xiao; Xu, Peng-Ju; Li, Ming-Yan; Zhang, Mei-Gen",Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue,433,26

Very recently, TEM via an anally inserted single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS(®))-port has been proposed to overcome remaining obstacles of the classical TEM equipment. METHODS Nine patients with a total of 12 benign or early stage malignant rectal polyps were operated using the SILS(®)-port for TEM. Patients' and polyps' characteristics, perioperative and postoperative complications, as well as operating and hospitalization time were recorded. RESULTS All 12 polyps (ten low-grade adenoma, one high-grade adenoma, one pT2 carcinoma [preoperatively staged as T1]) were resected. Local full-thickness bowel wall resection was performed for three lesions and submucosal resection for nine lesions. Median operating time was 64 (range 30-180) min. No conversion to laparoscopic or open techniques was necessary. The median maximum diameter of the specimen was 25 (range 3-60) mm, fragmentation of polyps was avoidable in 11 of 12 (92 %) lesions, and resection margins were histologically clear in 11 of 12 (92 %) polyps. Only one patient, in whom three lesions were resected, experienced a complication as postoperative hemorrhage. No mortality occurred. Median hospitalization time was four (range 1-14) days. CONCLUSIONS SILS(®)-TEM is a feasible and safe method, providing numerous advantages in application, handling, and economy compared with the classical TEM technique. SILS(®)-TEM might become a promising alternative to classical TEM. Randomized, controlled trials comparing safety and efficacy of both instrumental settings will be needed in the future.","Walensi, Mikolaj; Käser, Samuel A; Theodorou, Panagiotis; Bassotti, Gabrio; Cathomas, Gieri; Maurer, Christoph A",World journal of surgery,433,1

An RNA interference (RNAi) approach to inhibit TBE virus replication was therefore developed. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeted at the TBE virus genome reduce the quantity of infectious TBE virus particles, TBE virus genome, and TBE virus protein in vitro by up to 85%. The 50% inhibitory dose (DI(50)) of the shRNA plasmid was only 0.05μg/ml. As RNAi-based therapeutics for other diseases are already being evaluated in phases II and III clinical trials, it is possible that RNAi could become valuable tool for controlling TBE virus infection.","Achazi, Katharina; Patel, Pranav; Paliwal, Ravish; Radonić, Aleksandar; Niedrig, Matthias; Donoso-Mantke, Oliver",Antiviral research,433,8

In addition, propofol concentration in exhaled breath is tightly correlated with propofol concentration in plasma. Therefore, real-time monitoring of expiratory propofol could be useful for titrating intravenous anesthesia, but only if concentration changes in plasma can be determined in exhaled breath without significant delay. To evaluate the utility of IMR-MS during non-steady-state conditions, we measured the time course of both expiratory propofol concentration and the processed electroencephalography (EEG) as a surrogate outcome for propofol effect after an IV bolus induction of propofol. Twenty-one patients scheduled for routine surgery were observed after a bolus of 2.5 mg kg(-1) propofol for induction of anesthesia. Expiratory propofol was measured using IMR-MS and the cerebral propofol effect was estimated using the bispectral index (BIS). Primary endpoints were time to detection of expiratory propofol and time to onset of propofol's effect on BIS, and the secondary endpoint was time to peak effect (highest expiratory propofol or lowest BIS). Expiratory propofol and changes in BIS were first detected at 43 ± 21 and 49 ± 11 s after bolus injection, respectively (P = 0.29). Peak propofol concentrations (9.2 ± 2.4 parts-per-billion) and lowest BIS values (23 ± 4) were reached after 208 ± 57 and 219 ± 62 s, respectively (P = 0.57). Expiratory propofol concentrations measured by IMR-MS have similar times to detection and peak concentrations compared with propofol effect as measured by the processed EEG (BIS). This suggests that expiratory propofol concentrations may be useful for titrating intravenous anesthesia.","Hornuss, Cyrill; Wiepcke, Dirk; Praun, Siegfried; Dolch, Michael E; Apfel, Christian C; Schelling, Gustav",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,433,1

Beginning on February 29, 2020, residents became ill with COVID-19-like illness (CLI), which required absence from work. There was initially a shortage of personal protective equipment and delays in SARS-CoV-2 testing, which gradually improved during March and April 2020. Objective We evaluated the relationship between CLI-related work absence rates of internal medicine residents and MMC's COVID-19 hospital census over time. Methods Data on resident work absence between February 29 and May 22 were reviewed along with MMC's COVID-19 hospital census data. To determine the effect of patient exposure on resident CLI incidence, we compared the mean incidence of CLI per patient exposure days (PED = daily hospital census × days pre- or post-peak) before and after peak COVID-19 hospital census. Results Forty-two percent (103 of 245) of internal medicine residents were absent from work, resulting in 875 missed workdays. At the peak of resident work absence, 16% (38 of 245) were out sick. Residents were absent for a median of 7 days (IQR 6-9.5 days). Mean resident CLI incidence per PED (CLI/PED) was 13.9-fold lower post-peak compared to pre-peak (P = .003). Conclusions At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, a large portion of internal medicine residents at this single center became ill. However, the incidence of CLI decreased over time, despite ongoing exposure to patients with COVID-19.","Merkin, Ross; Kruger, Ariel; Bhardwaj, Gaurav; Kajita, Grace R; Shapiro, Lauren; Galen, Benjamin T",Journal of graduate medical education,433,1

METHODS We built a model for GammaMed Plus high dose rate brachytherapy source in TOPAS. The TG-43 dosimetry parameters including air-kerma strength SK , dose-rate constant Λ, radial dose function gL (r), and 2D anisotropy function F(r,θ) were calculated using Monte Carlo simulation with Geant4 physics models and NNDC 192 Ir spectrum. Calculations using an old 192 Ir spectrum were also carried out to evaluate the impact of incident spectrum and cross sections. The results were compared with published data. RESULTS For calculations using the NNDC spectrum, the air-kerma strength per unit source activity SK /A and Λ were 1.0139 × 10-7 U/Bq and 1.1101 cGy.h-1 .U-1 , which were 3.56% higher and 0.62% lower than the reference values, respectively. The gL (r) agreed with reference values within 1% for radial distances from 2 mm to 20 cm. For radial distances of 1, 3, 5, and 10 cm, the agreements between F(r,θ) from this work and the reference data were within 1.5% for 15° < θ < 165°, and within 4% for all θ values. The discrepancies were attributed to the updated source spectrum and cross sections. They caused deviations of the SK /A of 2.90% and 0.64%, respectively. As for gL (r), they caused average deviations of -0.22% and 0.48%, respectively. Their impact on F(r,θ) was not quantified for the relatively high statistical uncertainties, but basically they did not result in significant discrepancies. CONCLUSION A model for GammaMed Plus high dose rate 192 Ir brachytherapy source was developed in TOPAS and validated following TG-43 protocols, which can be used for future studies.

This study aimed to explore possible reasons affecting changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviour in Indonesian adolescents during the pandemic based on mothers' perspectives. METHODS We recruited parents (n = 20) from the Yogyakarta region of Indonesia (July-August 2020) using purposive and snowball sampling. Individual interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and anonymised. Data were imported into NVivo software for a reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS The interviews lasted between 38 and 113 min (M = 65 min). Participants' age ranged between 36 and 54 years (M = 42.6 years). Participants' children ranged in age from 12 to 15 years (M = 13.7 years, female: 9, male: 11). Themes related to changes in physical activity during the pandemic were 1) self-determination and enjoyment, 2) supports from others, and 3) physical activity facilities and equipment. Themes related to changes in sedentary behaviour during the pandemic included 1) educational demands, 2) psychological effects due to the pandemic, 3) devices and internet availability, 4) parental control, and 5) social facilitators. CONCLUSIONS During the pandemic, mothers perceived their children to be less active and using more screen-based devices, either for educational or recreational purposes, compared to before. The present themes might be useful when developing interventions and policies promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour in adolescents. Interventions could, for example, consider increasing parents' and adolescents' awareness on current activity guidelines, providing education on healthier recreational screen time, and involving parents, peers, and teachers. Increasing the accessibility of physical activity facilities and equipment, making use of adolescents' favourite program and social media for interventions, and providing activities that are fun and enjoyable may also important.","Andriyani, Fitria Dwi; Biddle, Stuart J H; De Cocker, Katrien",BMC public health,433,20

Overall, CS significantly but inconsistently reduced pain (SMD: - 0.63; 95% CI: - 0.91, - 0.35; I2 = 94%) and improved function (SMD: - 0.82; 95% CI: - 1.31, - 0.33; I2 = 95%). When limiting the analysis to studies with a low risk of bias, the pharmaceutical grade CS of IBSA origin showed a greater reduction in pain (SMD: - 0.25; 95% CI: - 0.34, - 0.16; I2 = 75%) and function (SMD: - 0.33; 95% CI: - 0.47, - 0.20; I2 = 53%, p = 0.07) compared with the other preparations (SMDPain: - 0.08; 95% CI: - 0.19, + 0.02; I2 = 20%; SMDFunction: - 0.18; 95% CI: - 0.36, +0.01; I2 = 0%). Assessing funnel plot asymmetry in the studies with a low risk of bias, we found strong correlations between the treatment effects and study size (pain: rS = 0.93; LI: rS = 0.86; p < 0.05). Ultimately, there was no residual heterogeneity in the CS effects when the smallest studies were removed from the analyses. CONCLUSION This new meta-analysis suggests that CS provides a moderate benefit for pain and has a large effect on function in knee OA, however with large inconsistency. The risks of bias, brand and study size were the factors explaining heterogeneity among the clinical trial results.","Honvo, Germain; Bruyère, Olivier; Geerinck, Anton; Veronese, Nicola; Reginster, Jean-Yves",Advances in therapy,433,10

We propose that it is now time for a third theme to receive attention: conservation genomics. As a result of anthropogenic effects, the majority of primate species have become threatened with extinction. A more robust primate conservation genomics will allow for genetically informed population management. Thanks to a steady decline in the cost of sequencing, it has now become feasible to sequence whole primate genomes at the population level. Furthermore, technological advances in noninvasive genomic methods have made it possible to acquire genome-scale data from noninvasive biomaterials.

The objective of this study was to examine whether regulating gut microbiota by vitamin D supplementation could reduce the plasma TMAO level in mice. For 16 weeks, C57BL/6J mice were fed a chow (C) or high-choline diet (HC) without or with supplementation of vitamin D3 (CD3 and HCD3) or a high-choline diet with vitamin D3 supplementation and antibiotics (HCD3A). The results indicate that the HC group exhibited higher plasma trimethylamine (TMA) and TMAO levels, lower richness of gut microbiota, and significantly increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes as compared with group C. Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced plasma TMA and TMAO levels in mice fed a high-choline diet. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition was regulated, and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was reduced by vitamin D. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that Bacteroides and Akkermansia were negatively correlated with plasma TMAO in the HC and HCD3 groups.

Methods Patients undergoing thyroidectomy in our Unit between January 2012 and June 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the type of energy-device used, patients were divided into three groups: Group A (HF), Group B (LSJ) and Group C (TB). Results A total of 1,165 patients were included in this study: 1,012 in Group A, 96 in Group B and 57 in Group C. Demographic data and histopathological findings were comparable between the three groups. About the postoperative stay and complications, no statistically significant difference was found. The mean operative time was 89.41±20.60 minutes in Group A, 85.57±15.91 minutes in Group B and 78.07±17.67 minutes in Group C (P<0.01). However, the post-hoc test for all pairwise comparisons showed a statistically significant difference only between Group A and Group C. Conclusions HF, LSJ and TB have proved to be safe and effective. The postoperative stay and complications were comparable between the three groups.

All U.S. states have advised their cystic fibrosis (CF) populations to socially isolate. Major health care payors such as Medicare and most private insurance companies have agreed to reimburse health care providers for telemedicine and telephone visits. Methods: The CF adult team at the University of Virginia (UVA) transitioned from face-to-face clinics to multidisciplinary telemedicine clinics by using WebEx® (Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA), a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) compliant platform. Interventions: Patients were contacted before scheduled visits and triaged into: (1) patients eligible for the multidisciplinary telemedicine clinic, (2) patients to be seen in clinic urgently due to acute needs, and (3) stable patients who can be rescheduled at a later time. Ineligible patients for the telemedicine clinic due to lack of access to technology were followed up via telephone. Results: A total of 63 patients were scheduled to be seen in the UVA clinic over 4 weeks, 10 clinic days. Of these patients, 20 (32%) rescheduled their appointment. In addition, 2 patients (3%) were seen in clinic for acute needs and 38 (60%) were seen by the multidisciplinary team through telemedicine. Conclusions: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing a telemedicine clinic process that serves the needs of a multidisciplinary care team is paramount to preserving the CF care model. Through a systematic design and test process, a feasible and sustainable program was created that can be utilized by other multidisciplinary programs to adapt to their context.","Compton, Martina; Soper, Morgan; Reilly, Bonnie; Gettle, Lucy; List, Rhonda; Bailey, Molly; Bruschwein, Heather; Somerville, Lindsay; Albon, Dana",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,433,1

Causes alleged are relative hyperoxia, increased gravity in the head-to-foot direction (+Gz), and compression of legs and stomach by anti-G trousers (AGT). We aimed to assess, in real time, the effects of hyperoxia, +Gz accelerations and AGT inflation on changes in regional lung volumes and breathing pattern evaluated in an axial plane by electrical impedance tomography (EIT). METHODS The protocol mimicked a routine peacetime flight in combat aircraft. Eight subjects wearing AGT were studied in a human centrifuge during 1 h 15 min exposure of +1 to +3.5Gz. They performed this sequence three times, breathing AIR, 44.5 % O2 or 100 % O2. Continuous recording of functional EIT enabled uninterrupted assessment of regional lung volumes at the 5th intercostal level. Breathing pattern was also monitored. RESULTS EIT data showed that +3.5Gz, compared with any moment without hypergravity, caused an abrupt decrease in regional tidal volume (VT) and regional end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) measured in the EIT slice, independently of inspired oxygen concentration. Breathing AIR or 44.5 % O2, sub-regional EELV measured in the EIT slice decreased similarly in dorsal and ventral regions, but sub-regional VT measured in the EIT slice decreased significantly more dorsally than ventrally. Breathing 100 % O2, EELV and VT decreased similarly in both regions. Inspired tidal volume increased in hyperoxia, whereas breathing frequency increased in hypergravity and hyperoxia. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that hypergravity and AGT inflation cause airway closure and air trapping in gravity-dependent lung regions, facilitating absorption atelectasis formation, in particular during hyperoxia.","Borges, João Batista; Hedenstierna, Göran; Bergman, Jakob S; Amato, Marcelo B P; Avenel, Jacques; Montmerle-Borgdorff, Stéphanie",European journal of applied physiology,433,1

METHOD We performed probability calculations to estimate COVID-19 infection status and likelihood of disease transmission among neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients and health care workers during anti-VEGF procedures, at various community prevalence levels of COVID-19. We then applied the expected burden of COVID-19 illness and death expressed through health-adjusted life-years (HALYs) lost. We compared these results to the expected disease burden of severe visual impairment if sight protecting anti-VEGF injections were not performed. RESULTS Our calculations suggest a wide range of contexts where the benefits of treatment to prevent progression to severe visual impairment or blindness are greater than the expected harms to the patient and immediate health care team due to COVID-19. For example, with appropriate protective equipment the benefits of treatment outweigh harms when the chance of progression to severe visual impairment is >0.044% for all scenarios where COVID-19 prevalence was one per thousand, even when the attack rate in the clinical setting is very high (5-43%). CONCLUSION Unless COVID-19 prevalence is very high, the reduced disease burden from avoiding visual impairment outweighs the expected HALYs lost from COVID-19 transmission. This finding is driven by the fact that HALYs lost when someone suffers severe visual impairment for 5 years are equivalent to nearly 400 moderate cases of infectious disease lasting 2 weeks each.","Boyd, Matt J; Scott, Daniel A R; Squirrell, David M; Wilson, Graham A",Clinical & experimental ophthalmology,433,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the 335 MR arthrograms of the shoulder joint (mean age 37.8 years) performed from March 2000 to February 2008. Images were evaluated with attention to anomalous insertion of the pectoralis minor tendon and the coracohumeral ligament. RESULTS Anomalous insertion of the pectoralis minor tendon was demonstrated in 5 out of 335 shoulders (1.5%). The pectoralis minor tendons crossed over the coracoid process and attached directly to a glenohumeral joint capsule, and the coracohumeral ligament was absent in these 5 patients. In these patients, injected contrast material was noted to extend over the coracoid process along the course of the pectoralis minor tendon. Among 5 patients, 3 patients (60%) were diagnosed with SLAP (superior labrum anterior to posterior) lesions. CONCLUSION Anomalous insertion of the pectoralis minor tendon to the glenohumeral joint capsule and associated absence of the coracohumeral ligament is well demonstrated on MR arthrography. It is an unusual variant of the pectoralis minor muscle insertion, and may be a possible contributing factor in the development of a SLAP lesion.","Lee, Shin Jae; Ha, Doo Hoe; Lee, Sang Min",Skeletal radiology,433,10

Methods We searched databases from inception up to August 28, 2019, for studies examining the effect of replacing sitting with standing on fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, and lipid levels; blood pressure; body fat mass; weight; and waist circumference in healthy adults. Differences in mean ± SD values were used for pooling the data and calculating the mean differences and CIs. Results The search found 3507 abstracts. Nine clinical trials (8 randomized and 1 nonrandomized) with 877 (64.4% [n=565] women) participants met all inclusion criteria. The mean ± SD age was 45.34±5.41 years; mean follow-up was 3.81 months, and mean difference in standing time between the intervention and control groups was 1.33 hours per day. The follow-up fasting blood glucose and body fat mass values were slightly but significantly lower than baseline records in the intervention groups compared with control groups (-2.53; 95% CI, -4.27 to -0.79 mg/dL; and -0.75; 95% CI, -0.91 to -0.59 kg). The analysis for fasting insulin levels, lipid levels, blood pressure, weight, and waist circumference revealed no significant differences. Conclusion Replacing sitting with standing can result in very small but statistically significant decreases in fasting blood glucose levels and body fat mass with no significant effect on lipid levels, blood pressure, weight, and waist circumference. Replacing sitting with standing can be used as an adjunctive intervention to decrease the burden of cardiovascular risk factors but cannot be used as an alternative to physical activity to decrease sedentary time.","Saeidifard, Farzane; Medina-Inojosa, Jose R; Supervia, Marta; Olson, Thomas P; Somers, Virend K; Prokop, Larry J; Stokin, Gorazd B; Lopez-Jimenez, Francisco","Mayo Clinic proceedings.

METHODS HER2-positive breast cancer was divided into three groups of the high hormone receptor expression (LH-high) group, low expression (LH-low) group, or negative (NLH) group to (1) compare differences in the percentage of the HER2 IHC test score of 2 + based on the 2013 ASCO/CAP guideline and in the intratumor heterogeneity of HER2 expression for breast cancer with an IHC score of 3 + among these groups, (2) compare the HER2/CEP17 ratio and the average HER2 copy number, and classified ISH groupings according to the 2018 ASCO/CAP guideline algorithm. RESULTS (1) Of 244 HER2-positive breast cancers, the cases with a HER2 IHC score of 2 + (n = 54, 22.1%) were significantly more common in the LH-high group (n = 45, P < 0.001). The frequency of heterogeneity was low (n = 25, 10.2%) for the HER2 score of 3 + (n = 190, 77.9%), and significantly higher in the LH-high group (n = 19, 76%, P = 0.002). (2) In a HER2 IHC score of 2 + , Group 2 which is deemed HER2 negative according to the revised 2018 ASCO/CAP guideline was observed in 17 (39.5%) out of 43 cases, of which 16 cases (94.1%) were in the LH-high group. CONCLUSIONS The LH-high group is a heterogeneous group largely consisting of heterogeneous cases with HER2 IHC scores of 2 + or 3 + . NLH, in contrast, is a homogenous group.","Akashi, Momoko; Yamaguchi, Rin; Kusano, Hironori; Yamaguchi, Miki; Akiba, Jun; Kakuma, Tatsuyuki; Tanaka, Maki; Akagi, Yoshito; Yano, Hirohisa",Breast cancer,433,30

The aim of this study was to examine the associations between self-reported age at first drink and age at first alcohol intoxication with the risk of death by age 30. METHODS The sample (n = 6564; 49.1% males) included all participants of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort Study 1986 (NFBC1986) for whom the two measures of adolescent drinking were available. Self-reported age at onset of first drink and first alcohol intoxication were analyzed along with background variables and data regarding subsequent psychiatric diagnoses. Adolescents were dichotomized into those reporting age at first drink and age at first intoxication before or after age 14. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for death by age 30. RESULTS By the age of 30, 0.7% (n = 47) of all 6564 participants were deceased. In the multivariable models, male gender and a history of illicit substance use in adolescence were associated with both all-cause mortality and mortality due to accidents or suicide. After controlling for confounding variables, age at first alcohol intoxication was associated with all-cause mortality (HR 2.33; 95% CI 1.04-5.20) as well as death due to accidents or suicide (HR 2.99; 95% CI 1.11-8.05). CONCLUSIONS Earlier age at first intoxication carries long-term repercussions with respect to premature loss of life. Efforts should be made targeting the prolongation of initiating binge drinking in adolescence to diminish this mortality risk.","Levola, Jonna; Rose, Richard J; Mustonen, Antti; Sarala, Marian; Miettunen, Jouko; Koskela, Jari; Niemelä, Anni-Emilia; Niemelä, Solja",European journal of public health,433,24

The relative lengths of the index (2D) and ring (4D) fingers (digit ratio; 2D:4D) is a sexually dimorphic (males < females) proxy of fetal sex steroids (low 2D:4D indicates high prenatal testosterone/low prenatal estrogen). AIM To examine sex-specific relationships of 2D:4D per nation with national values of COVID-19 CFRs. STUDY DESIGN COVID-19 CFRs and the percent of male deaths were related to mean national (self-reported) 2D:4D by sex and hand from a large online survey (the BBC Internet Study). SUBJECTS 103,482 men and 83,366 women. OUTCOME MEASURES Relationships of mean national 2D:4D with CFRs from 41 countries and with national male death rates from 16 countries. RESULTS Male right and left hand 2D:4D showed positive relationships with CFR. These relationships remained significant after removing the influence of female 2D:4D. A positive association of male right and left 2D:4D was detected with the percentage of male deaths. CONCLUSIONS At the national level, high mean 2D:4D (indicating low prenatal testosterone/high prenatal estrogen) is associated with high CFRs and percent male mortality. At the individual level, high 2D:4D may be a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 in males. We speculate that male 2D:4D is a negative correlate for expression of the SARS-CoV2 receptor (ACE2).","Manning, John T; Fink, Bernhard",Early human development,433,1

Three months after stroke, a significant decrease in CT of -2.6% (median, upper/lower boundary of 95% confidence interval -4.1%/-1.1%) was detected in areas connected to ischemic lesions, whereas CT in unconnected cortical areas remained largely unchanged. A cluster of significant cortical thinning was detected in the superior frontal gyrus of the stroke hemisphere using a surface-based general linear model correcting for multiple comparisons. There was no significant correlation of changes in CT with clinical outcome parameters.

In this paper, we focus on COVID-19 as an 'emerging epidemic' from the perspective of citizens in Bobo-Dioulasso, the second-largest city in Burkina Faso. We explore how these citizens experience ruptures of their everyday life due to COVID-19 and how their understandings and responses to the pandemic were shaped in a context of instability and political turbulence. We are inspired by Giddens's notion of 'time-space distanciation', which refers to 'the condition under which time and space are organized so as to connect presence and absence'. We focus on the temporality of the pandemic by looking at a specific period during the pandemic, during which the government of Burkina Faso introduced a number of restrictions as preventive measures at a time when COVID-19 as a disease was still an absent phenomenon for most people. The pandemic had not (yet) infected large numbers of people in the country and most people did not yet have any experiences of the disease. We argue that the local responses to the pandemic and the various control measures during this period must be understood in the wider context of Burkina Faso's specific socio-economic, political, and security situations, which are distinctly fragile.","Samuelsen, H.; Toe, L.

Yet, how formalin fixation, commonly used for tissue preservation, affects the phase measurement is not fully known. We, therefore, study the impacts of formalin fixation on magnetic susceptibility, microstructural compartmentalisation and chemical exchange measurement on human brain tissue. Methods A formalin-fixed, post-mortem human brain specimen was scanned with multiple orientations with respect to the main magnetic field direction for robust bulk magnetic susceptibility measurement with conventional quantitative susceptibility imaging models. Homogeneous white matter tissues were subsequently excised from the whole-brain specimen and scanned in multiple rotations on an MRI scanner to measure the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility and microstructure-related contributions in the signal phase. Electron microscopy was used to validate the MRI findings. Results The bulk isotropic magnetic susceptibility of ex vivo whole-brain imaging is comparable to in vivo imaging, with noticeable enhanced non-susceptibility contributions. The excised specimen experiment reveals that anisotropic magnetic susceptibility and compartmentalisation phase effect were considerably reduced in formalin-fixed white matter tissue. Conclusions Despite formalin-fixed white matter tissue has comparable bulk isotropic magnetic susceptibility to those measured via in vivo imaging, its orientation-dependent components in the signal phase related to the tissue microstructure is substantially weaker, making it less favourable in white matter microstructure studies using phase imaging.","Chan, Kwok-Shing; Hédouin, Renaud; Mollink, Jeroen; Schulz, Jenni; Walsum, Anne-Marie van Cappellen van; Marques, José P.",bioRxiv,433,29

These models assume wave-like propagation dynamics on an uniform medium. However, it appears that COVID-19 follows unexpected propagation dynamics. In this paper we consider the state-wise data on COVID-19 mortality in Brazil provided by government sources. Conventional propagation models tell us that the pandemic should propagate over the neighboring states from the initial cases in Sao Paulo. We compute several measures of correlation and prediction by random forests finding that the patterns of propagation do not correlate well with the graph distances defined by the spatial neighborhood of the states. We think that this phenomenon deserves further attention in order to understand COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Graña, M.; Badiola-Zabala, G.; Lopez-Guede, J.

Design: Online open national survey of adults bereaved in the UK from 16 March 2020-5 January 2021, recruited via media, social media, national associations and organisations. Setting: General population, UK. Participants: 711 participants, mean age 49.5 (SD 12.9, range 18-90). 395 (55.6%) had experienced the death of a parent, 152 (21.4%) a partner. 628 (88.6%) were female and 33 (4.7%) from a minority ethnic background. The mean age of the person who died was 72.2 (SD 16.1, range miscarriage to 102 years). 311 (43.8%) deaths were from confirmed/suspected COVID-19, and 410 (57.8%) deaths occurred in hospital. Main outcome measures: End-of-life care experiences (six items, e.g. involvement in care decisions) and pandemic-related challenges before and after death (six items, e.g. unable to visit prior to death). Results: Deaths in hospital/care home increased the likelihood of: unable to visit prior to death, unable to say goodbye as wanted, limited contact in last days of life (all P<0.001). Deaths in hospice/at home increased the likelihood of: involved in care decisions (P<0.001), well supported by healthcare professionals (HCPs) after the death (P=0.003). Hospice deaths increased the likelihood of being given bereavement support information, which was least likely for care home deaths (P<0.001). Hospital deaths decreased the likelihood of knowing the contact details for the responsible care professional (P=0.001). Bereavement due to COVID-19 decreased the likelihood of: involvement in care decisions (P<0.001), feeling well supported by HCPs after the death (P<0.001), and increased the likelihood of: being unable to say goodbye (OR=0.348; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.605), social isolation and loneliness (OR=0.439; 95% CI: 0.261 to 0.739), limited contact with relatives/friends (OR=0.465; 95% CI: 0.254 to 0.852). Expected deaths were associated with higher likelihood of feeling involved, informed, and well supported by HCPs (all P<0.001). The deceased being a partner or child increased the likelihood of knowing the contact details for the responsible care professional (P=0.001), being able to visit (P<0.001) and given bereavement support information (P<0.001). Being a bereaved partner strongly increased odds of social isolation and loneliness, e.g. OR = 0.092 (95% CI: 0.028 to 0.297) partner versus distant family member. Conclusions: Four clear risk factors were found for poorer end-of-life care and pandemic-related challenges in bereavement: place, cause and expectedness of death, and relationship to the deceased.","Selman, L.

Methods Between June and August 2020, an agent-based model was used to project rates of COVID-19 infection incidence and cases diagnosed as positive from 15 September to 31 October 2020 for 72 geographic settings. Five scenarios were modelled: a baseline scenario where no future changes were made to existing restrictions, and four scenarios representing small or moderate changes in restrictions at two intervals. Post hoc, upper and lower bounds for number of diagnosed Covid-19 cases were compared with actual data collected during the prediction window. A regression analysis with 17 covariates was performed to determine correlates of accurate projections. Results The actual data fell within the lower and upper bounds in 27 settings and out of bounds in 45 settings. The only statistically significant predictor of actual data within the predicted bounds was correct assumptions about future policy changes (OR = 15.04; 95%CI 2.20-208.70; p=0.016). Conclusions For this study, the accuracy of COVID-19 model projections was dependent on whether assumptions about future policies are correct. Frequent changes in restrictions implemented by governments, which the modelling team was not always able to predict, in part explains why the majority of model projections were inaccurate compared with actual outcomes and supports revision of projections when policies are changed as well as the importance of policy experts collaborating on modelling projects.","Houdroge, F.; Palmer, A.; Delport, D.; Walsh, T.; Kelly, S.

This study provides insight into patient concerns & information seeking (IS) behaviors. Methods: In January 2021, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted in the US with CC patients (diagnosed within 2 years) recruited through panels, social media & advocacy groups. The interview focused on rational & emotional drivers and barriers for IS. Transcripts were coded using NVivo qualitative analysis software to identify key themes. Results: 14 women of varied education status were interviewed (mean age 51 years (range: 37-70);8 White, 4 Black, & 2 Latina). Patients emphasized trust in their oncologist to provide sufficient information. IS was driven by the desires to confirm their oncologist's recommendation & find reassurance through the experience of other patients, and encouragement from family. Barriers to IS included: 1) hesitancy to undermine their oncologist's recommendations, 2) pessimism about ability to find individualized answers about prognosis or QoL, 3) feeling overwhelmed & fearing misinformation, 4) personal urgency to decide on a treatment plan, 5) already having sufficient information, 6) potential exposure to 'negative energy' from online patient communities, & 7) COVID-19 hindering opportunity for personal connections. Conclusions: While patients' oncologist, family, & common patient experience provide comfort, reluctance towards IS exists. As trusted gatekeepers, oncologists should recognize patients' desire for accessible, reliable, & personalized information. Better understanding this perspective and gaps in the availability of validated & relevant resources can enable clinicians/policy makers to develop strategies & tools for better communication. In turn, this will help CC patients feel more empowered & informed throughout their cancer care journey.","Szamreta, E. A.; Wayser, G. R.; Prabhu, V.

Although cells share numerous autoAgs, each cell type gives rise to unique COVID-altered autoAg candidates, which may explain the wide range of symptoms experienced by patients with autoimmune sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the unifying property of affinity between autoantigens (autoAgs) and the glycosaminoglycan dermatan sulfate (DS), this paper reports 140 candidate autoAgs identified from proteome extracts of human Jurkat T-cells, of which at least 105 (75%) are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with currently available multi-omic COVID-19 data shows that 125 (89%) of DS-affinity proteins are altered at protein and/or RNA levels in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells or patients, with at least 94 being known autoAgs in a wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Protein alterations by ubiquitination and phosphorylation in the viral infection are major contributors of autoAgs. The autoAg protein network is significantly associated with cellular response to stress, apoptosis, RNA metabolism, mRNA processing and translation, protein folding and processing, chromosome organization, cell cycle, and muscle contraction. The autoAgs include clusters of histones, CCT/TriC chaperonin, DNA replication licensing factors, proteasome and ribosome proteins, heat shock proteins, serine/arginine-rich splicing factors, 14-3-3 proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins. AutoAgs such as LCP1 and NACA that are altered in the T cells of COVID patients may provide insight into T-cell responses in the viral infection and merit further study. The autoantigen-ome from this study contributes to a comprehensive molecular map for investigating acute, subacute, and chronic autoimmune disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Wang, Julia Y.; Zhang, Wei; Roehrl, Michael W.; Roehrl, Victor B.; Roehrl, Michael H.",bioRxiv,433,1

In this paper, I treat the national response to the pandemic as the outcome variable, which I seek to explain through an analysis of the intersection of dualism in the model of Swedish public administration and the devolved governance system that bestows operational autonomy on public agencies and local public authorities. The duality that characterizes the relationship between politics, policy, and administration in Sweden resulted in a response that was necessarily decentralized.

There is new evidence for the loss of smell and taste as a symptom of COVID-19 infection. Objectives: This study aims to examine the influence of coffee on the smell and taste of patients with Covid-19. Methods: In order to investigate the effect of coffee consumption on the taste and smell of COVID-19 patients, we attempted to sample in 20 provinces of the country, COVID-19 patients were separated by gender and underlying and non-underlying disease, doses of 15–20 mg for non-underlying patients and 25–30 mg for underlying patients. The reason for determining this amount of coffee is that every coffee we want to prepare needs a scoop of 14 g of coffee, which we determine. For some people, it was determined 14 g and for some people 28 g of coffee was determined due to consumed in two cups of coffee. Results: Patients with COVID-19 had reversibility on the first and second day. It was clear that there is a small gap between the proportion of recovered patients in the underlying and non-underlying patients, but due to the high volume of observations, this small difference is evident. Discussion: The effectiveness time of coffee is debatable by prescribing its amount. The time efficiency of improving the sense of smell and taste with coffee consumption was lower in non-background patients than in patients. Conclusions: Anosmia and Ageusia are more prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Caffeine in coffee reduced the reversibility of the sense of smell and taste of people with COVID-19. It was concluded that the chances of recovery are higher for those who do not have the underlying disease than for the other groups and for those who suffer from all three types of the underlying disease than for the other groups.","Hosseini, Asiyeh Mirmahdi Esmaeil Mina Akbari Moghaddam",Integrative Respiratory Medicine,433,16

In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed in order to analyze the behavior and provide different possible predictions of the virus infection, based in the case of Panama. Public data from the Ministry of Health has been used with a set of differential equations to characterize the outbreak propagation behavior. Key epidemiological parameters were estimated with some degree of confidence to make predictions of the inflection point and possible time of completion of the outbreak in the country. These parameters were obtained using optimization algorithms (non-linear Generalized Reduced Gradient and evolutionary) in order to obtain the minimum possible measures of standard deviation error and mean square error. These parameters were used in the mathematical model described in this paper and in a global comparison simulator, to expand the comprehensive behavior to other possible cases.","Casaboza, J.

The inference in the resulting processes is presented jointly, as well as the strategies developed to obtain the initial solutions necessary for the numerical resolution of the system of equations resulting from the application of the maximum likelihood method.

The clinical symptoms of this disease are nonspecific and cannot be easily distinguished from other acquired pneumonias. Therefore, radiological findings and laboratory tests play an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of the disease. Preliminary studies have shown that people with underlying diseases are at higher risk for complications and mortality from COVID-19.

At the early onset of the pandemic, it is imperative to measure the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among healthy individuals to better understand the causes, transmission, and preventive measures. Purpose: This study aimed to identify the knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 in a healthy Filipino population during the early onset of the pandemic outbreak. Methods: This cross-sectional rapid online and web-based survey was conducted among healthy Filipino population. A total of 1634 subjects participated via the Google survey link. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the respondents' profile characteristics and KAP scores. The One-Way ANOVA or independent sample t-test was used to measure KAP scores' differences when grouped according to respondents' profile characteristics. Pearson correlation was used to measure the relationship among the KAP scores. The data were all analyzed using the SPSS version 26.0. Results: The overall knowledge scores revealed 67.7%. Filipinos believed COVID-19 would finally be successfully controlled and confident that the Philippines can win the battle against the virus through preventive practices. KAP scores showed significant differences with age, sex (p&lt;0.000), and place of residence (p&lt;0.000), occupation (p&lt;0.000), and marital status (p&lt;0.000). A significant positive low correlation between knowledge and practice (r=0.076, p&lt;0.01), attitude and practice (r=0.100, p&lt;0.01).Conclusion: Albeit a low knowledge of COVID-19, healthy Filipino populations had a positive attitude and compliant with the preventive measures. This study hopes to contribute to the growing corpus of literature on COVID-19 to provide evidence-based information towards health promotion, illness prevention, and control of possible virus' spread.","Tuppal, Cyruz P.; Ninobla, Marina Magnolia G.; Ruiz, Mara Gerbabe D.; Loresco, Richard D.; Tuppal, Shanine Mae P.; Panes, Iril I.; Oducado, Ryan Michael F.; Prudencio, Denise Angelo M.; Vega, Paolo D.; Eribal, Mark John E.; Real, Don Vicente P.; Roa, Mary Nellie T.; en,",Nurse Media Journal Of Nursing,433,24

Moreover, economically disadvantaged groups are more susceptible. This paper analyses the effects of health expenditure on carbon emissions in BRICS (that is, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries from 2000 to 2017. The Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FM-OLS), the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) Granger causality and the Dumitrescu–Hurlin causality tests are employed. In terms of aggregate health expenditure, the level of current health expenditure is significantly and negatively connected with carbon emissions. With regard to disaggregated variables, private health expenditure is also negatively and significantly linked to emissions. However, domestic general government health expenditure and external health expenditure are positively and significantly associated with carbon emissions. Country-specific results are also provided. The causality tests confirm bi-directional causality between the level of current health expenditure, private health expenditure, and domestic general government health expenditure, and carbon emissions. External health expenditure in BRICS does not cause emissions, and vice-versa. VECM causal links are also discussed. The results point to the need to review health expenditure sub-policy programs to achieve zero-carbon targets. © 2021 The Author(s).

We implemented operational changes to safely remain open and treat tumors with potential to threaten life or function. We studied the impact of these changes on safety, access, and treatment. Methods: A single-center retrospective study was conducted in an academic office-based dermatologic surgery practice. All patients consented to research. 'Pre-pandemic' (Nov. 2019 - March 21, 2020) consultations served as controls. Consultations during the 'pause' (March 22 - June 8, 2020) and 'reopening' (June 9 - Sept. 30, 2020) were evaluated for time to treatment, tumor area, and upstaging. One-way ANOVA or Fisher Exact analyses were performed with P &lt; 0.05 significant. Operational changes included (1) modified scheduling, staffing, and rooming;(2) COVID-19 symptom screening;(3) N95 masks and shields for patient contact;(4) triage by tumor acuity;(5) same day or video consultation;and (6) increased utilization of same day biopsy and surgery for suspicious lesions. Results: Data from 698 patients (23-103 yrs of age, avg 71 yrs) yielded 876 tumors treated by Mohs surgery (n = 776), standard excision (n = 73), staged excision (n = 14) or electrodessication and curettage (n = 13). The average time from biopsy or consultation to treatment was faster during the pause and reopening relative to prepandemic (Table). More frozen section diagnostic biopsies were performed in the pause (n = 6) and reopening (n = 4) compared to pre-pandemic (n = 0). Post-operative defects were similar to prepandemic sizes (3.2 cm2 ) during the pause (3.9 cm2 ) and reopening (3.2 cm2 ) (p = 0.72). A reduction in treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC, X2 = 0.04) and shift toward treatment of higher risk tumors such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, 49% of tumors during pause vs 37% pre-pandemic) and melanoma (11% pause vs 4.7% pre-pandemic) was noted. The percentage of SCC upstaged after treatment increased during the pause (42%, X2 = 0.02) vs pre-pandemic (18.5%) or reopening (17.4%). Conclusions: Time to treatment, tumor size, and SCC upstaging prepandemic and during the reopening fail to identify any significant access interruptions. This likely reflects practice modifications of increased same day surgery, frozen section diagnostic biopsy, and tumor triage. Lack of COVID-19 transmission attributable to maintained operations suggests that essential surgical care can be delivered safely to patients with high-risk skin cancers during a pandemic.","Cullison, S.

To address this question, we determined the transcriptomic profiles of DENV-specific CD8+T cells in a cohort of 40 hospitalized DENV donors with either a milder form of the disease (dengue fever, DF) or a more severe disease form (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF). We found multiple transcriptomic signatures, one associated with DENV-specific Interferon-gamma responding cells, and two other gene signatures, one specifically associated with the acute phase, and the other with the early convalescent phase. Additionally, we found no differences in quantity and quality of DENV-specific CD8+T cells based on disease severity. Taken together with previous findings that did not detect altered DENV-specific CD4 T cell responses, the current analysis argues against alteration in DENV-specific T cell responses as being a correlate of immunopathology.","Grifoni, A.; Voic, H.; Mateus, J.; Fung, K.

An outbreak of a previously unknown disease, prolonged self-isolation, contradictory information in the media, and an economic crisis — all these are today's realities that have arisen due to the coronavirus pandemic. In such conditions, society is particularly in need of developing measures to overcome post-traumatic stress, which is preceded by the identification of its patterns, connections with certain psychological and other factors. Hypothesis: negative coping strategies and low indicators of subjective well-being are correlated with high indicators of post-traumatic stress in a sample of Chinese students. As a sample a total of 306 Chinese students were interviewed, including 161 students studying in China and 145 students studying outside their country (Russia, England, USA). Methods: “Subjective well-being” (IOW);post-traumatic stress self-assessment questionnaire (PTSD);assessment of stress management style (SCSD). A sample of students from China showed a positive correlation between passive coping strategies and stress (0.221**), the overall mood and stress index (0.356**), and subjective well-being and stress (0.191*);negative correlation between active coping strategies and the overall mood index (-0.321**). In the sample of Chinese students studying abroad, there is a positive correlation between passive coping strategies and stress (0.394**), active coping strategies and subjective well-being (0.283*), and the mood and stress index (0.178*);a negative correlation was found between active coping strategies and the overall mood of Chinese students (-0.325**).

168858,168858,168858,Biclustering Analysis of Countries Using COVID-19 Epidemiological Data,15.593359,4.0071177,2021,"Purpose: The purpose of this research is to conduct a comparative analysis of the views of architects and urban designers in the West and the Middle East on whether the COVID-19 pandemic could affect architecture and urban design shortly and what is the future of our home design? A further purpose was to explore and explain how the pandemic will change the future of architecture and urban design by reviewing, analyzing and synthesizing different and related viewpoints to create a grounded theory, hoping to provide some insight for the entire world. Design/methodology/approach: Different research methods were used to achieve the research purposes including grounded theory, desk reviews, reviewing the limited existing literature and semi-structured interviews. Findings: This research found that most surveyed architects believed that the COVID-19 pandemic would affect the future of architecture and urban design and help to create new design features. Future concentration will be in living, working, learning, leisure and teaching spaces. All future designs should be independent, self-sufficient in terms of power and water usage and using nonrenewable energy sources. The home design should focus on the interior design, transparency, open to the inside (introverted spaces), quality of life, natural daylighting and ventilation, healthy indoor air quality, use of plants and natural materials, green roof, the relationships between indoor and outdoor spaces and quality of building materials. Additionally, transitional space is an important primary entry point to the home. Moreover, folding furniture may be a solution to enlarge the room when needed and turn it into multifunctional spaces. The home office will no longer be a small desk, chair and lamp located at the small corner anywhere. The future home office should be equipped with all the necessary technology. The open-plan design trend and the concept of flow space will not exist anymore. The pandemic will encourage the use of touchless and smart technologies in design and construction. There is a need to separate heating and ventilation systems in detached houses and multistory buildings to avoid infectious diseases. Social norms have changed over a few weeks of social distancing. Therefore, we can change the system of negative habits, old traditions and society’s bad behaviors. Practical implications: This research raises many proactive ideas, and the results are relevant to all actors in the construction sector, as it contains findings of understanding how the interaction of people with the built external or internal environment evolved during the pandemic process. In this sense, it will provide socio and economic benefits for the society in terms of seeking an answer to the question of “how should we design” for possible new bad scenarios to evolve the spaces in the “lockdown” situation. This research discusses how to make our homes comfortable and ready for an extraordinary time, suggested a practical design solution based on construction technologies. Social implications: This research links theory to practice, and it facilitates the adaptation to the current situation. It has a high impact on society, as it guides designers to rethink spaces that can help occupants face the COVID-19 pandemic challenges. Therefore, it should create and implement architectural design guidelines for health and safety. The architects should think about how to create and organize multifunctional, flexible, aesthetical, healthy and clean spaces under the new roles of interaction and social distancing. Architects should incorporate technological and innovations from different fields to organize spaces, promote public health and enhance the quality of life. Originality/value: Architecture and urban design suddenly become medical, and we can use the built environment as a way to control epidemic spread. Additionally, and by reviewing the literature, there is no published qualitative research that has been explored on how the COVID-19 pandemic will change the future of architectur and urban design, but there are some personal viewpoints and short interviews. This topic is a new growing concern and becoming a top social topic and priority for policymaking in the world. The topic is important in terms of design input for designers to create new living spaces, as it includes the views and observations of architects from the east and west to the pandemic process. We have all been encouraged to reimagine the space in which we live, how the place fits our needs, how we use it and enjoy it during the pandemic. Therefore, this paper appeals to an international readership by linking the COVID-19 situation to architectural design. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Alhusban, A. A.; Alhusban, S.

High rates of VTE in patients admitted to intensive care unit have been reported [2]. However effect of COVID-19 on ambulatory patients attending out-patient clinics has not been described. Objectives: This retrospective, observational cohort study analyses the impact of COVID-19 on incidence of Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) in patients referred to Ambulatory Deep Venous Thrombosis Out-patient Clinic (ADOC). A comparative analysis of patients attending ADOC during a similar period in 2019 is undertaken. Methods: Patients who attended the ADOC with suspected DVT during the 'first wave' of the COVID-19 pandemic between 01 February and 30 June 2020 at Southport and Ormskirk NHS Trust were studied and compared to a similar period in 2019. Patients characteristics, comorbidities, risk factors, incidence of DVT and relationship with COVID-19 with the evaluation of haematological parameters including D-dimer and two-tier Wells score. Additionally we examined patients outcomes including morbidity, mortality and hospital admissions. Results: Overall, there was a decrease in the number of patients attending the ADOC from 290 in 2019 to 233 in 2020. However, a total of 38 patients tested positive for DVT, a rate of 16.3%, which is compared to an incidence of 7.9% in 2019. Due to evolving protocols, the COVID-19 status of all patients attending the ADOC could not be ascertained. However, 5/233 of the 2020 cohort patients either had a positive test result (n=4) or were symptomatic of COVID-19 (n=1). Conclusion: There has been a 129% increase in the incidence of DVT in patients presenting to ADOC at our trust during the 'first wave' of the COVID-19pandemic. Furthermore, despite fewer patients presenting with DVT symptoms to the ADOC, there appears to be a higher incidence of confirmed DVTs in ambulatory patients during COVID-19. Although there is a strong association inferred between COVID-19 and VTE [3], lack of access to SARS-CoV-2 nasal swab testing of patients attending ADOC for VTE assessment was a limiting factor to establish an association in this study. Because of this, we cannot extrapolate a definite association in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness in the community and DVT. What we postulate is perhaps the higher incidence in the 2020? cohort could be a marker for a mild case of asymptomatic COVID-19 in these patients. Currently there is no guidance as to whether point of care testing should be available in ADOC. We wonder whether a point of care COVID-19 testing of these patients would have positive impact on the rate at which COVID-19 is identified in the community. Furthermore patients have been avoiding hospitals during the pandemic, greater testing should help to reassure and encourage them to seek help earlier during their illness, minimising potential complications such as PE, hospital admission and death.","Hill, T.; Iyengar, K.

We administered the COVID-19 vaccine to the medical staff at Yamagata University Hospital from March to August 2021. Subsequently, we conducted an online questionnaire-based survey to investigate the presence of allergy and adverse reactions after vaccination and examined the association between allergy and adverse reactions after immunization. Responses were collected from 1586 subjects after the first vaccination and 1306 subjects after the second administration of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Adverse reactions included injection site pain, injection site swelling, fever, fatigue or malaise, headache, chills, nausea, muscle pain outside the injection site, and arthralgia. The frequency and severity of most adverse reactions were higher after the second vaccination compared to the first. The frequency of some adverse reactions and their severity were higher, and the duration of symptoms was longer in subjects with allergies than in subjects without allergies. Although several participants visited the emergency room for treatment after the first and second vaccinations, nobody was diagnosed with anaphylaxis. Given the serious consequence of COVID-19 and the reported high efficacy of this vaccine against this disease, we conclude that vaccination of allergic individuals is generally recommended.","Inoue, S.; Igarashi, A.; Morikane, K.; Hachiya, O.; Watanabe, M.; Kakehata, S.; Sato, S.; Ueno, Y.",,433,1

High-flow O-2 therapy and non-invasive ventilation by mask or ventilation helmet have become key treatment options. In endeavours to provide respiratory care to all segments of the population whenever necessary, other therapeutic devices may be employed. The fact that milder cases of these diseases can also be treated with less expensive out-of-hospital ventilators and HFOT devices and that a full-fledged intensive care ventilator may not be imperative must be considered in the final decision. Nevertheless, answers to the triage and allocation of ventilators must be found in a discussion involving society as a whole and the health sciences in particular.

Meanwhile, its high dimensionality brought challenges in data modeling, analysis, visualization and interpretation. Available analysis tools require extensive knowledge and training of data properties, statistical modeling and computational skills. It is challenging for biologists to efficiently view, browse and interpret the data. Results Here we developed SCANNER, as a public webserver resource to equip the biologists and bioinformatician to share and analyze scRNA-seq data in a comprehensive and collaborative manner. It is effort-less and host-free without requirement on software setup or coding skills, and enables a user-friendly way to compare the activation status of gene sets on single cell basis. Also, it is equipped with multiple data interfaces for easy data sharing and currently provide a database for studying the smoking effect on single cell gene expression in lung. Using SCANNER, we have identified larger proportions of cancer-associated fibroblasts cells and activeness of fibroblast growth related genes in melanoma tissues in females compared to males. Moreover, we found ACE2 is mainly expressed in pneumocytes, secretory cells and ciliated cells with disparity in gene expression by smoking behavior.

The future is likely to pose a range of new challenges and opportunities to sustainable tourism. This paper employs the Markov-switching vector autoregressions (MSVAR) model to investigate the sustainability of tourism’s economic effects in Hong Kong, both during periods of crisis and in the absence of crises. The empirical results show that: (1) The MSVAR model is effective in capturing the nonlinear relationship between the economy and tourism and allows for the categorizing of this relationship into four regimes, for example, the “major event crises” regime and the “economic crises” regime;(2) The economic effects of tourism differ noticeably across the four different regimes, and sustainability varies depending on the presence and type of crisis;(3) The Hong Kong economy, and the tourism industry in particular, exhibits high levels of stability and sustainability. In short, economic growth in Hong Kong’s tourism industry is capable of rapid recovery following major crisis events, and it has the capacity to rebound quickly into new periods of rapid growth.

Despite this, geographical enquiry often references the two as interchangeable indicators of mental health and assumes the relationship between the two is consistent across different geographical scales. Furthermore, the importance of geography in such research is commonly assumed to be static for all age groups, despite the large body of evidence demonstrating contextual effects in age-specific populations. We leverage simultaneous measurement of a mental illness and mental wellbeing metric from Understanding Society, a UK population-based survey, and employ bivariate, cross-classified multilevel modelling to characterise the relationship between geographical context and mental health. Results provide strong evidence for contextual effects for both responses before and after covariate adjustment, with weaker evidence for area-classification and PSU-level contextual effects for the GHQ-12 after covariate adjustment. Results support a two-continua model of mental health at the individual level, but indicates that consensual benefit may be achieved across both dimensions by intervening at household and regional levels. There is also some evidence of a greater contextual effects for mental wellbeing than for mental illness. Results highlight the potential of the household as a target for intervention design for consensual benefit across both constructs. Results highlight the increased importance of geographical context for older respondents across both responses. This research supports an area-based approach to improving both mental illness and mental wellbeing in older populations.","Griffith, G. J.; Jones, K.",,433,1

The empirical results obtained from the analysis of 11 economic sectors suggest that there is a statistically significant impact relationship between COVID-19 and the healthcare and utility industries. Additional findings show a statistically significant negative impact of COVID-19 on the utility share price at lag 1. Analysis of impulse response function (FRF) and forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) show an inverse reaction of utility stock prices to the impact of COVID-19 and a gradual disappearing shock after two steps. Major findings show that there is a clear negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on share prices, and the daily increase in the number of confirmed cases, indicate that, in future disease outbreaks, early containment measures and positive responses are necessary conditions for governments and nations to protect stock markets from excessive depreciation.

However, due to their small size, low complexity, degenerate nature, and frequent mutations, identifying novel functional motifs is a challenging task. Viral proteins rely extensively on the molecular mimicry of cellular linear motifs for modifying cell signalling and other processes in ways that favour viral infection. This study aims to discover human linear motifs convergently evolved also in disordered regions of viral proteins, under the hypothesis that these will result in enrichment in functional motif instances. We systematically apply computational motif prediction, combined with implementation of several functional and structural filters to the most recent publicly available human-viral and human-human protein interaction network. By limiting the search space to the sequences of viral proteins, we observed an increase in the sensitivity of motif prediction, as well as improved enrichment in known instances compared to the same analysis using only human protein interactions. We identified > 8,400 motif instances at various confidence levels, 105 of which were supported by all functional and structural filters applied. Overall, we provide a pipeline to improve the identification of functional linear motifs from interactomics datasets and a comprehensive catalogue of putative human motifs that can contribute to our understanding of the human domain-linear motif code and the mechanisms of viral interference with this.","Wadie, Bishoy; Kleshchevnikov, Vitalii; Sandaltzopoulou, Elissavet; Benz, Caroline; Petsalaki, Evangelia",bioRxiv,433,1

However, multilevel thresholding becomes increasingly more computationally complex as the number of thresholds grows. In order to address this defect, this paper proposes a new multilevel thresholding approach based on the Evolutionary Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA). The arithmetic operators in science were the inspiration for AOA. DAOA is the proposed approach, which employs the Differential Evolution technique to enhance the AOA local research. The proposed algorithm is applied to the multilevel thresholding problem, using Kapur’s measure between class variance functions. The suggested DAOA is used to evaluate images, using eight standard test images from two different groups: nature and CT COVID-19 images. Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index test (SSIM) are standard evaluation measures used to determine the accuracy of segmented images. The proposed DAOA method’s efficiency is evaluated and compared to other multilevel thresholding methods. The findings are presented with a number of different threshold values (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). According to the experimental results, the proposed DAOA process is better and produces higher-quality solutions than other comparative approaches. Moreover, it achieved better-segmented images, PSNR, and SSIM values. In addition, the proposed DAOA is ranked the first method in all test cases.","Abualigah, Laith Diabat Ali Sumari Putra Gandomi Amir H.",Processes,433,16

A3 proteins act in the innate immune response to viral infection by mutating the viral ssDNA. One of the most well-studied human A3 family members is A3G, which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1. Each A3 protein prefers a specific substrate sequence for catalysis - for example, A3G deaminates the third cytidine in the CCCA sequence motif. However, the interaction between A3G and ssDNA is difficult to characterize due to poor solution behavior of the full-length protein and loss of DNA affinity of the truncated protein. Here, we present a novel DNA-anchoring fusion strategy, which we have used to capture an A3G-ssDNA interaction. We characterized an A3G-DNA binding pocket that is important for the enzyme to scan the DNA for its hotspot. The results provide insights into the mechanism by which A3G selects and deaminates its preferred substrates and help define how A3 proteins are tailored to recognize specific DNA sequences. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of DNA substrate selection by A3G, as well as A3G antiviral activity against HIV-1.","Ziegler, Samantha J.; Liu, Chang; Landau, Mark; Buzovetsky, Olga; Desimmie, Belete A.; Zhao, Qi; Sasaki, Tomoaki; Burdick, Ryan C.; Pathak, Vinay K.; Anderson, Karen S.; Xiong, Yong",bioRxiv,433,1

The novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 was later given the name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to its close similarity with SARS-CoV. The entry of the virus is mediated through the interaction of spike glycoprotein with the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The Spike protein plays a pivotal role in SARS-CoV-2 infection as it is required for both receptor binding and viral fusion, hence the key target for neutralizing antibodies. Owing to its important role, Spike protein stands as the prime target for developing vaccines and therapeutics. The S glycoprotein carries the receptor-binding domain and the major B cell and T cell epitopes, which indicate that it is a potential target for vaccines and therapeutics. Several candidate vaccines have already entered into the clinical trials. The commonly employed vaccine platforms for COVID-19 include subunit, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA, RNA, and viral vector-based platforms. The majority of these vaccine candidates target the Spike glycoprotein to elicit an efficient immune response. The safety profile and clinical efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines that are currently under trials are quite reassuring, but it is still way ahead from attaining commercial utility.

It considers the various contributions of the special issue and shows how the Treaty emerged in an era of shifting cleavages, disputed steps towards a more political Union and rising populism. This legacy has led to more polarisation and politicisation - a phenomenon that the Treaty of Lisbon struggles to encapsulate and conciliate with the culture of consensus and compromise inherent to its institutional structures. As a result, we observe a bias towards policy stability - and even failure - that affects the legitimacy and democratic standards of the European Union. In a context of polycrisis, the difficulty to find compromises - especially in highly normative issues - leads to the de-politicisation of the EU and reinforces the gap between EU institutions and its citizens.

Data were obtained with questionnaires distributed through social media platforms from July 14, 2020, to July 21, 2020. This study using the Fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19) Scale and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 to assess FCV-19, anxiety, stress, and depression. statistical analysis used IBM SPSS Statistics 24 was used to analyze the two-tailed Chi-square test, the Mann-Whitney test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test, which were used with statistical significance as P &lt; 0.05 for all tests. RESULTS: Out of 1027 samples, 44.6% had stressed, 47.8% had anxiety, and 18.6% had depression. The gender (P = 0.000), educational stage (P = 0.000), and the comorbidity factor (P = 0.001 for stress and anxiety, P = 0.036 for depression, and P = 0.000 for FCV-19) had a significant association with stress, anxiety, depression, and FCV-19 in medical students. The hometown that showed zone risk of infection only showed significant differences in FCV-19 (P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Protection and psychological support for a medical student is extremely high importance given that COVID-19 is now a well-established pandemic and there will be other pandemics in the future.","Natalia, D.; Syakurah, R.

Specifically, rich data and machine learning based models are explored for public health policies, exploring the timing and restrictive levels of intervention measures, such as school/workplace closure and lifting, gathering ban, or travel restrictions, needed for a community, at the region and community level as time goes. This study articulates that rich data and machine learning work well in reducing policy discrepancies. Real world data of COVID-19 cases at the state level in the U.S. are used first in this study to show the consequence of different policy responses in 2020. To demonstrate what different policy responses could result, an agent-based simulation model using a small-scale school setting will be then presented. The simulation model could be further developed, scaled up, and customarily adopted across any geographical hierarchy, facilitating policymaking in public health. (c) 2021 The Authors.

The psychological distress can linger after the initial recovery from the infection. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of provisional post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with cured COVID-2019. Methods: The baseline survey was conducted from 10 to 25 February 2020 in patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital. Demographic and clinical characteristics were acquired, and depression and anxiety levels were assessed, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, respectively. A follow-up survey was conducted 1 month post-discharge. PTSD symptoms were measured by the Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6) and patients' perception of supportive care during hospitalization was investigated using a self-developed questionnaire. Results: In total, 114 patients completed both the baseline and follow-up surveys. Of these, 41 (36.0%) met the cut-off score for provisional PTSD diagnosis according to the IES-6. Female gender [odds ratio (OR) = 4.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-14.37], educational level of high school or below (OR = 15.49, 95% CI 1.13-212.71), higher anxiety levels (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.12-1.61) and lower perceptions of emotional support during hospitalization (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.17-0.96) predicted a higher risk for provisional PTSD. Conclusions: PTSD is commonly seen in patients with COVID-19 1 month post-discharge. Female patients, and patients with lower educational levels, higher anxiety levels and lower perceptions of emotional support during hospitalization may be more likely to develop PTSD in the near future. Enhancing emotional support during hospitalization could help to prevent PTSD in patients with COVID-19.","Ju, Y. M.; Liu, J.; Ng, R. M. K.; Liu, B. S.; Wang, M.; Chen, W. T.; Huang, M.; Yang, A.

The paper aims to highlight the importance of reporting in the financial statements the subsequent events caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but also of the aspects that can significantly influence the going concern of companies' activities, respectively how these effects can cause changes in the quality of audit services. The study was conducted on a sample of 60 companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, analyzing the components of the annual reports for the financial year 2019, namely the financial statements, the administrator's report and the independent auditor's report. The results showed that the effects generated by the CO VID-19 pandemic had a significant impact in most of the industries studied, affecting both companies to carry out activities by closing borders, reducing or even closing certain activities, stopping travel and hindering communication with suppliers, customers or investors, reduced sales, deferred payments or the need to optimally manage costs and available resources, as well as at the level of employees by performing work at home, technical unemployment or salary reductions, but also at the level of the client-auditor relationship, by limiting travel in business interest. Most of the estimated effects of the pandemic were presented in the administrator's report, some of the effects being mentioned in the explanatory notes to the financial statements. From a statistical point of view, the companies' declaration of the effects of the pandemic was correlated with the size of the auditor, the opinion issued by him and the average number of employees. The study showed that certain auditors assessed the risks posed by subsequent events reported by companies, presenting insignificant uncertainties in some cases, but also significant uncertainties regarding the going concern of the activity of some companies.","Crucean, Andreea Claudia PhD Student Hategan Habil Camelia-Daniela PhD",Audit Financiar,433,1

This study sought to determine Nigerians' knowledge of social distancing and why most people do not adhere to the guidelines amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A non-probability sampling method was used for this study;data were generated from respondents who filled an online form distributed on all social media platforms. All respondents living in Nigeria were included in the study while those living outside at the time of the survey were excluded. Results from the survey revealed that most Nigerians are knowledgeable about social distancing guidelines but observed low or non-adherence to the rules. This non-compliance was partly attributed to poor knowledge of the guidelines due to inadequate information from the government, and majorly due to lack of basic amenities, poverty and hunger. Further research and policies on the best avenue of reaching this group of Nigerians with a substantial economic package, an improvement on information dissemination on social distancing guidelines will make a great difference.

The existing literature is limited. Objective(s) To develop a robust, reliable and valid methodology to evaluate distribution and persistence of dental aerosol and splatter, including the evaluation of clinical procedures. Methods Fluorescein was introduced into the irrigation reservoirs of a high-speed air-turbine, ultrasonic scaler and 3-in-1 spray and procedures performed on a mannequin in triplicate. Filter papers were placed in the immediate environment. The impact of dental suction and assistant presence were also evaluated. Samples were analysed using photographic image analysis, and spectrofluorometric analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Pearson’s correlation for comparison of analytic methods. Results All procedures were aerosol and splatter generating. Contamination was highest closest to the source, remaining high to 1-1.5 m. Contamination was detectable at the maximum distance measured (4 m) for high-speed air-turbine with maximum relative fluorescence units (RFU) being: 46,091 at 0.5 m, 3,541 at 1.0 m, and 1,695 at 4 m. There was uneven spatial distribution with highest levels of contamination opposite the operator. Very low levels of contamination (≤0.1% of original) were detected at 30 and 60 minutes post procedure. Suction reduced contamination by 67-75% at 0.5-1.5 m. Mannequin and operator were heavily contaminated. The two analytic methods showed good correlation (r=0.930, n=244, p<0.001). Conclusion Dental procedures have potential to deposit aerosol and splatter at some distance from the source, being effectively cleared by 30 minutes in our setting.","Allison, James R; Currie, Charlotte C; Edwards, David C; Bowes, Charlotte; Coulter, Jamie; Pickering, Kimberley; Kozhevnikova, Ekaterina; Durham, Justin; Nile, Christopher J; Jakubovics, Nicholas; Rostami, Nadia; Holliday, Richard",bioRxiv,433,11

However, one of the barriers to the uptake of Bayesian adaptive designs for confirmatory trials is limited experience with how they may perform compared to a frequentist design. Objective: Compare the performance of a Bayesian and a frequentist adaptive clinical trial design. Design: Prospective observational study comparing two trial designs using individual patient level data from a completed stroke trial, including the timing and order of enrollments and outcome ascertainment. The implemented frequentist design had group sequential boundaries for efficacy and futility interim analyses when 90-days post-randomization was met for 500, 700, 900, and 1,100 patients. The Bayesian alternative utilized predictive probability of trial success to govern early termination for efficacy and futility with a first interim analysis at 500 randomized patients, and subsequent interims after every 100 randomizations. Setting: Multi-center, acute stroke study conducted within a National Institutes of Health neurological emergencies clinical trials network. Participants: Patient level data from 1,151 patients randomized in a clinical trial comparing intensive insulin therapy to standard in acute stroke patients with hyperglycemia. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Sample size at end of study. This was defined as the sample size at which each of the studies stopped accrual of patients. Results: As conducted, the frequentist design passed the futility boundary after 936 participants were randomized. Using the same sequence and timing of randomization and outcome data, the Bayesian alternative crossed the futility boundary about 3 months earlier after 800 participants were randomized. Conclusions and Relevance: Both trial designs stopped for futility prior to reaching the planned maximum sample size. In both cases, the clinical community and patients would benefit from learning the answer to the trial's primary question earlier. The common feature across the two designs was frequent interim analyses to stop early for efficacy or for futility. Differences between how this was implemented between the two trials resulted in the differences in early stopping.","Broglio, K.; Meurer, W.; Durkalski, V.; Pauls, Q.; Connor, J.; Berry, D.; Lewis, R.; Johnston, K.

Specifically, the authors studied the impact of the 2014 oil price drop and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on risk spillovers and portfolio allocation among stock markets (United States (SP500), China (SSEC), Japan (Nikkei 225), France (CAC40) and Germany (DAX)) and commodities (oil and gold). Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors used the Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (BEKK-GARCH) model to estimate shock transmission among the five financial markets and the two commodities. The authors rely on Diebold and Yilmaz (2014, 2015) methodology to construct network-associated measures. Findings Relying on the BEKK-GARCH, the authors found that the recent health crisis of COVID-19 intensified the volatility spillovers among stock markets and commodities. Using the dynamic network connectedness, the authors showed that at the 2014 oil price drop and the COVID-19 pandemic shock, the Nikkei225 moderated the transmission of volatility to the majority of markets. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the commodity markets are a net receiver of volatility shocks from stock markets. In addition, the SP500 stock market dominates the network connectedness dynamic during the COVID-19 pandemic, while DAX index is the weakest risk transmitter. Regarding the portfolio allocation and hedging strategies, the study showed that the oil market is the most vulnerable and risky as it was heavily affected by the two crises. The results show that gold is a hedging tool during turmoil periods. Originality/value This study contributes to knowledge in this area by improving our understanding of the influence of fluctuations in oil prices on the dynamics of the volatility connection between stock markets and commodities during the COVID-19 pandemic shock. The study's findings provide more implications regarding portfolio management and hedging strategies that could help investors optimize their portfolios.","Mezghani, T.; Ben Hamadou, F.; Abbes, M.

Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) during pregnancy can cause devastating fetal outcomes, and efforts to understand natural immunity to this infection are essential for optimizing vaccine design. In this study, we leveraged the high-dimensional single-cell profiling capacity of mass cytometry (CyTOF) to deeply characterize the cellular immune response to acute and convalescent ZIKV infection in a cohort of blood donors in Puerto Rico incidentally found to be viremic during the 2015-2016 epidemic in the Americas. During acute ZIKV infection, we identified widely coordinated responses across innate and adaptive immune cell lineages. High frequencies of multiple activated innate immune subsets, as well as activated follicular helper CD4+ T cells and proliferating CD27-IgD-B cells, during acute infection were associated with high titers of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies at 6 months post-infection. On the other hand, low titers of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies were associated with immune features that suggested a cytotoxic-skewed immune “set-point.” Our study offers insight into the cellular coordination of immune responses and identifies candidate cellular biomarkers that may offer predictive value in vaccine efficacy trials for ZIKV and other acute viral infections aimed at inducing high titers of neutralizing antibodies.

Some DF patients suddenly develop severe symptoms after the defervescent period. Although the pathogenic mechanism of the severe symptoms has not been fully elucidated, the viremia level in the early phase has been shown to correlate with the disease severity. One of the hypotheses is that a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection leads to a high level of viremia. To examine the plausibility of this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between in vitro ADE activity and in vivo viral load quantity in six patients with dengue diseases. An autologous DENV strain was isolated from each of the six patients. Blood samples were then collected at multiple time points between the acute and defervescent phases, and the balance between neutralizing and enhancing activities against the autologous and prototype viruses was examined. As the antibody levels against DENV were rapidly increased, ADE activity was decreased over time or partially maintained against some viruses at low serum dilution. In addition, positive correlations were observed between ADE activity representing in vitro progeny virus production and viremia levels in patient plasma samples. Therefore, the measurement of ADE activity in dengue-seropositive samples may help to predict the impact of viral load in the subsequent DENV infection. IMPORTANCE It has not been fully elucidated how the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) affects the pathogenesis of severe dengue diseases, although high viremia levels have been epidemiologically demonstrated to be associated with the disease severity. Here, we show that ADE in the acute-phase patient sera exhibited significantly different activities against autologous and lab strains than ADE in the defervescent-phase sera. Further, the enhancement of progeny virus production activity, which is one of the factors to evaluate ADE in vitro, was significantly correlated with the levels of viral load in the patient blood circulation. This suggests that measurement of the in vitro enhancing progeny virus titers might be used to predict the impact of in vivo DENV viremia level. Our present findings could contribute to a method to forecast disease severity for seropositive populations who would be at risk of developing severe disease in the event of heterotypic DENV infection.","Yamanaka, Atsushi; Imad, Hisham Ahmed; Phumratanaprapin, Weerapong; Phadungsombat, Juthamas; Konishi, Eiji; Shioda, Tatsuo",bioRxiv,433,1

Established in 2016, the IFC is an informal collaborative network of Indigenous-led and Indigenous-serving organizations that aims to support and develop the capacity of Indigenous Peoples to collaboratively address challenges and opportunities facing food systems and to ensure that food-related programming and policy meets the needs of the all communities. Its primary goals are to reduce Indigenous food insecurity, increase food self-determination, and establish meaningful relationships with the settler population through food. This community case study introduces the IFC and shares the strategies and initiatives that were used during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 to address immediate needs and maintain a broader focus on Indigenous food sovereignty. The food related impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Indigenous People and determining solutions cannot be understood in isolation from settler colonialism and the capitalist food system. Reflecting on the scholarly literature and the experiential learnings that emerged from these efforts, we argue that meaningful and impacting initiatives that aim to address Indigenous food insecurity during an emergency situation must be rooted in a decolonizing framework that centers meaningful relationships and Indigenous leadership.","Levkoe, C.

Galbraith comment on comparing covid-19 control in the asia-pacific and north atlantic regions,15.8436165,3.8510952,2021,"Background Assessment of surveillance and response system functions focusing on notifiable diseases has widely been documented in literature. However, there is limited focus on diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, particularly preventive chemotherapy neglected tropical diseases (PC-NTDs). There are limited strategies to guide strengthening of surveillance and response system functions concerning PC-NTDs. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a framework to improve surveillance and response to PC-NTDs at the sub-national level in Kenya. Methods Framework development adopted a multi-phased approach. The first phase involved a systematic literature review of surveillance assessment studies conducted in Africa to derive generalised recommendations. The second phase utilised primary data surveys to identify disease-specific recommendations to improve PC-NTDs surveillance in Kenya. The third phase utilised a Delphi survey to assess stakeholders consensus on feasible recommendations. The fourth phase drew critical lessons from existing conceptual frameworks. The final validated framework was based on resolutions and inputs from concerned stakeholders. Results Framework components constituted inputs with the first domain combining surveillance tools, equipment and infrastructure while the second domain combined financial, technical and logistical support. Processes were categorised into four sub-domains with activities for strengthening existing surveillance tools, surveillance core, support and attribute functions. The intended results phase comprised of ten distinct outputs with the anticipated outcomes categorised into three sub domains. Lastly, the overall impact alluded to reduced disease burden, halted disease transmission and reduced costs for implementing treatment interventions to achieve PC-NTDs control and elimination. Conclusion In view of the mixed methodological approach used to develop the framework coupled with further inputs and consensus among concerned stakeholders, the validated framework appears to be relevant in guiding decisions by policy makers to strengthen the existing surveillance and response system functions towards achieving PC-NTDs elimination.","Ng'etich, A.

Sustainable logistics and distribution management can help reduce greenhouse gases emission and lighten its influence against our living environment. Quantum computing has become more and more popular in recent years for advancing artificial intelligence into the next generation. Hence, we apply quantum random number generator to provide true random numbers for the genetic algorithm to solve the pollution-routing problems (PRPs) in sustainable logistics management in this paper. The objective of the PRPs is to minimize carbon dioxide emissions, following one of the seventeen sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. We developed a two-phase hybrid model combining a modified k-means algorithm as a clustering method and a genetic algorithm with quantum random number generator as an optimization engine to solve the PRPs aiming to minimize the pollution produced by trucks traveling along delivery routes. We also compared the computation performance with another hybrid model by using a different optimization engine, i.e., the tabu search algorithm. From the experimental results, we found that both hybrid models can provide good solution quality for CO2 emission minimization for 29 PRPs out of a total of 30 instances (30 runs each for all problems).","Yi-Cheng, Shih",Sustainability,433,33

Mil Familias is a longitudinal observational cohort study enrolling Hispanic/Latino families with T2D, building a unique real-world dataset of genetic, biological, behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental determinants of health. This analysis showed that this cohort has biological and social risk factors for poor health outcomes from diabetes and emerging health threats. Interim analyses were conducted on the first 158 enrollees (64% female, age 57.6 years, 129 with T2D). In T2D subjects, sub-optimal glycemic control, obesity and uncontrolled blood pressure were common, increasing risk from T2D and COVID-19. Further, validated assessments of social determinants of health reveal inadequate health insurance coverage and low levels of: income, educational attainment, acculturation, trust in physicians, and confidence in their literacy-numeracy skills. Hispanic/Latino adults, especially women, with T2D in the Mil Familias cohort have a cluster of social as well as biological risk factors that make them vulnerable from T2D and new threats like COVID-19.

The recovery can be performed by multiple different decoders, however most of them rely on some tuning. Given an estimate for the noise level a common convex approach to recover the signal is basis pursuit denoising. If the measurement matrix has the robust null space property with respect to the (Formula presented.) -norm, basis pursuit denoising obeys stable and robust recovery guarantees. In the case of unknown noise levels, nonnegative least squares recovers non-negative signals if the measurement matrix fulfills an additional property (sometimes called the (Formula presented.) -criterion). However, if the measurement matrix is the biadjacency matrix of a random left regular bipartite graph it obeys with a high probability the null space property with respect to the (Formula presented.) -norm with optimal parameters. Therefore, we discuss non-negative least absolute deviation (NNLAD), which is free of tuning parameters. For these measurement matrices, we prove a uniform, stable and robust recovery guarantee. Such guarantees are important, since binary expander matrices are sparse and thus allow for fast sketching and recovery. We will further present a method to solve the NNLAD numerically and show that this is comparable to state of the art methods. Lastly, we explain how the NNLAD can be used for viral detection in the recent COVID-19 crisis. © Copyright © 2021 Petersen, Bah and Jung.","Petersen, H.

Fusion is accomplished when SNARE proteins hosted by apposing membranes form SNARE complexes called SNAREpins, but the mechanism of fusion remains unclear. Computational simulations of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion are challenging due to the millisecond timescales of physiological membrane fusion. Here we used ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) simulations to investigate the minimal requirements for a molecular intracellular fusogen, and to elucidate the mechanisms of SNARE-mediated fusion. We find fusion by simple body forces that push vesicles together is highly inefficient. Inter-vesicle fusogens with different aspect ratios can fuse vesicles only if they are rodlike, of sufficient length to clear the fusogens from the fusion site by entropic forces. Simulations with rod-shaped SNAREpin-like fusogens fused 50-nm vesicles on ms timescales, driven by entropic forces along a reproducible fusion pathway. SNARE-SNARE and SNARE-membrane entropic forces cleared the fusion site and pressed the vesicles into an extended contact zone (ECZ), drove stalk nucleation at the high curvature ECZ boundary, and expanded the stalk into a long-lived hemifusion diaphragm in which a simple pore completed fusion. Our results provide strong support for the entropic hypothesis of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion, and implicate the rodlike structure of the SNAREpin complex as a necessity for entropic force production and fusion.","Zeng, Jin; McDargh, Zachary; An, Dong; O’Shaughnessy, Ben",bioRxiv,433,1

The major function of N protein is to assemble the RNA of coronavirus. In the present study, the gene encoding the N protein was cloned and the protein was expressed, purified, and refolded as shown by (1)H NMR measurement. The maximal Trp emission wavelength occurs near 331 nm, suggesting substantial burial of Trp residues. Circular dichroism measurements indicate that N protein contains little alpha-helical structure. Acid titration shows that N protein begins to unfold near pH 5 and is fully denatured near pH 2.7, and the acid unfolding process is reversible. The physical and chemical properties of N protein indicate that its stability is low. N protein is denatured reversibly at pH 7.4 either by urea (with C(m) of 2.77 M and m value of 2.74 kcal mol(-1) M(-1)) or GdmCl (with C(m) of 1.46 M and m value of 4.50 kcal mol(-1) M(-1)). In the heat-induced denaturation in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, N-protein starts to unfold at 35 degrees C and is completely denatured at 55 degrees C, where SARS virus was also reported to be inactivated.

Endothelial TLR2 promoted tumor growth, angiogenesis, and protumorigenic immune cell recruitment in a mouse model of prostate cancer. Furthermore, the cell surface localization of P-selectin and the subsequent production of other critical cell adhesion molecules (such as E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) that recruit immune cells required endothelial TLR2. Our findings demonstrate that endothelial cells actively contribute to innate immune pathways and propose that endothelial TLR2 has a pathological role in proinflammatory conditions.","McCoy, Michael G; Nascimento, Daniel W; Veleeparambil, Manoj; Murtazina, Rakhylia; Gao, Detao; Tkachenko, Svyatoslav; Podrez, Eugene; Byzova, Tatiana V",Science signaling,433,28

Mol.Biol. 245, 608-622). To determine if parameters other than nucleotide sequence in the crossover region affect junction site selection, recombinants were assayed at various times postinoculation of plants and protoplasts. Populations of recombinants became progressively shorter in plants and larger in protoplasts. Levels of inoculated transcript and age of the plant were not substantial factors in the shifts in crossover site locations. The two most commonly cloned recombinant species were not amplified to detectable levels in protoplasts, suggesting that these molecules are not viable templates for replication. These results suggest that recombination between sat-RNA D and TCV is a very frequent event, and populations of recombinants are likely generated de novo in each infected cell and represent the original recombinant molecules rather than progeny of such molecules. Therefore, factors other than simple selection for recombinants that are more fit to replicate are probably responsible for the differences in junction sites in populations of sat-RNA D/TCV recombinants.","Carpenter, C D; Simon, A E",Virology,433,1

The cattle tested were Holstein dairy cows aged 2 to 10 years. A vaccination group consisted of 157 animals (including 132 pregnant cows) and a non-vaccinated control group consisted of 50 animals. The cows received 2 intramuscular injections of vaccine (2 mL) at 3-week intervals. Vaccinated cows did not develop abnormalities, such as a decrease in milk production volume, and all pregnant animals calved normally. The geometric mean of the hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer was 34.2 before vaccination in test cows. The titer had increased to 105.6, 3 weeks after the 1st injection and peaked at 755.6, 1 month after the 2nd injection. A high antibody titer persisted at 396.0; 241.0; and 201.5, at 3, 6, and 9 months after the 2nd injection, respectively. This confirms the safety and high antibody-response induced by this prototype vaccine.

METHODS A prospective study was conducted on the clinical characteristics of infants <2 years of age admitted to hospital for respiratory infection and the characteristics of hMPV infections were compared with those of infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Influenza A, B and C viruses, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses were simultaneously detected in clinical samples by multiple reverse transcription nested-PCR assay. The presence of hMPV was tested in all samples using two separate RT-PCR tests. RESULTS A respiratory virus was detected in 65.9% of the 749 children included in the study. hMPV, found in 69 of the positive nasopharyngeal aspirates (14%), was the most common virus after RSV. Peak incidence was in March and over 80% of children were <12 months of age. The most common diagnoses were recurrent wheezing (49.3%) and bronchiolitis (46.4%). Oxygen therapy was required by 58% of patients, and assisted ventilation by one. Clinical characteristics in the 18 co-infections were indistinguishable from those of single infections. Fifty one hMPV single infections were compared with 88 hRSV single infections. Recurrent wheezing was diagnosed more frequently in hMPV patients. All other variables tested were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS hMPV was the second most frequent virus after RSV in infants <2 years of age hospitalised for respiratory infection and was associated with lower respiratory tract infections. hMPV occurred predominantly in springtime. Co-infections were frequent and clinically similar to single infections and RSV infections.","García-García, M L; Calvo, C; Martín, F; Pérez-Breña, P; Acosta, B; Casas, I",Archives of disease in childhood,433,16

HYPOTHESES The following hypotheses were tested: (1) nurses' sense of preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks and naturally occurring disasters will be higher than for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN)-type disasters associated with terrorist attacks; (2) perceptions of preparedness will vary according to previous outbreak experience; and (3) perceptions of personal preparedness will be related to perceived institutional preparedness. METHODS Nurses from emergency departments and intensive care units across Canada were recruited via flyer mailouts and e-mail notices to complete a 30-minute online survey. RESULTS A total of 1,543 nurses completed the survey (90% female; 10% male). The results indicate that nurses feel unprepared to respond to large-scale disasters/attacks. The sense of preparedness varied according to the outbreak/disaster scenario with nurses feeling least prepared to respond to a CBRN event. A variety of socio-demographic factors, notably gender, previous outbreak experience (particularly with SARS), full-time vs. part-time job status, and region of employment also were related to perceptions of risk. Approximately 40% of respondents were unaware if their hospital had an emergency plan for a large-scale outbreak. Nurses reported inadequate access to resources to support disaster response capacity and expressed a low degree of confidence in the preparedness of Canadian healthcare institutions for future outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS Canadian nurses have indicated that considerably more training and information are needed to enhance preparedness for frontline healthcare workers as important members of the response community.","O'Sullivan, Tracey L; Dow, Darcie; Turner, Michelle C; Lemyre, Louise; Corneil, Wayne; Krewski, Daniel; Phillips, Karen P; Amaratunga, Carol A",Prehospital and disaster medicine,433,3

METHODS We abstracted data on the clinical presentation and course of disease in 10 epidemiologically linked Chinese patients (5 men and 5 women 38 to 72 years old) in whom SARS was diagnosed between February 22, 2003, and March 22, 2003, at our hospitals in Hong Kong, China. RESULTS Exposure between the source patient and subsequent patients ranged from minimal to that between patient and health care provider. The incubation period ranged from 2 to 11 days. All patients presented with fever (temperature, >38 degrees C for over 24 hours), and most presented with rigor, dry cough, dyspnea, malaise, headache, and hypoxemia. Physical examination of the chest revealed crackles and percussion dullness. Lymphopenia was observed in nine patients, and most patients had mildly elevated aminotransferase levels but normal serum creatinine levels. Serial chest radiographs showed progressive air-space disease. Two patients died of progressive respiratory failure; histologic analysis of their lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage. There was no evidence of infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Legionella pneumophila. All patients received corticosteroid and ribavirin therapy a mean (+/-SD) of 9.6+/-5.42 days after the onset of symptoms, and eight were treated earlier with a combination of beta-lactams and macrolide for 4+/-1.9 days, with no clinical or radiologic efficacy. CONCLUSIONS SARS appears to be infectious in origin. Fever followed by rapidly progressive respiratory compromise is the key complex of signs and symptoms from which the syndrome derives its name.

The HCV genome is an RNA molecule that is approximately 9.6 kb in length and encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved proteolytically to generate at least 10 mature viral proteins. Recently, a new HCV protein named F has been described, which is synthesized as a result of a ribosomal frameshift. Little is known about the biological properties of this protein, but the possibility that the F protein may participate in HCV morphology or replication has been raised. In this work, the presence of functional constraints in the F protein was investigated. It was found that the rate of amino acid substitutions along the F protein was significantly higher than the rate of synonymous substitutions, and comparisons involving genes that represented independent phylogenetic lineages yielded very different divergence/conservation patterns. The distribution of stop codons in the F protein across all HCV genotypes was also investigated; genotypes 2 and 3 were found to have more stop codons than genotype 1. The results of this work suggest strongly that the pattern of divergence in the F protein is not affected by functional constraints.","Cristina, Juan; Lopez, Fernando; Moratorio, Gonzalo; López, Lilia; Vasquez, Silvia; García-Aguirre, Laura; Chunga, Ausberto",The Journal of general virology,433,1

These were linked to processes and outcomes of care. RESULTS Eighteen of 26 EDs responded. These were representative of the range of EDs nationally. There was wide variability between the EDs across all the surveyed elements. Although no single element was strongly related to performance measures, combinations of elements were. When there was a lack of doctors and available ED or hospital beds relative to the workload, then performance was worse. The correlations were: for time to assessment r=0.728, p=0.001, for ED length of stay r=0.759, p<0.001, for patients who did not wait r=0.619, p=0.006 and for deaths in the ED r=0.649, p=0.004.

METHODS We included 43 patients with a past history of CKD and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients were evaluated for demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory data and findings of initial chest computed tomography (CT) and were followed until either death or discharge occurred. Then, study variables were compared based on final outcome and stage of CKD. RESULTS Mean age ± SD of patients was 60.65 ± 14.36 years; 65.1% were male. Five of 43 patients (11.6%) died on follow-up and the rest were discharged. Disease outcome did not differ across CKD stages (P > .05). More than half of the patients (58.1%) presented with severe disease on admission. Clinical symptoms were similar to those of non-CKD individuals. Mean duration of hospitalization was higher in those who died, although not significant (16.6 ± 8.38 vs. 11 ± 6.26, P > .05). The only hematologic parameter that significantly differed between survivors and non-survivors was lactase dehydrogenase level (P < .05). Ground-glass opacification and reticular pattern were the most frequent patterns on CT and pleural effusion existed in about one-fifth of all patients. A greater lower zone score was noted in deceased patients (P < .05).

METHODS Our SILC procedure utilized the SILS-Port with additional 5-mm forceps through an umbilical incision. A laparoscopic fluorescent imaging system developed by Karl Storz Endoskope was utilized for fluorescent cholangiography. RESULTS We performed fluorescent cholangiography during SILC in 21 patients. All procedures were completed successfully without biliary injury. The detectability of the running course of the cystic duct, the confluence between the cystic duct and the common hepatic duct, and the common hepatic duct before the dissection in Calot's triangle was 47.6, 71.4, and 81.0 %, respectively. The detectability of biliary structures was worse in 9 obese patients (body mass index ≥ 25.0 kg/m2) than in 12 non-obese patients. The mean operative time for the patients in whom fluorescent cholangiography could identify the running course of the cystic duct before dissection in Calot's triangle (68 ± 16 min) was shorter than that for the other patients (91 ± 35 min; p = 0.037).

The aim of this study was to survey Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students' perceptions of learning during the instructional shift as well as assess the impact of this shift on learning outcomes. SUBJECTS One hundred twenty-five students enrolled in the DPT program were recruited to participate in this study. METHODS A survey was completed by students 12 days after the switch to remote instruction. Students rated multiple aspects of remote instruction. In addition, exam scores of students before and after the shift to remote instruction were compared, and final semester grades were compared to previous years. RESULTS Most respondents reported that they did not learn as well during remote instruction (83%); however, students' exam scores during remote instruction indicated otherwise. Open-ended questions revealed varied student responses regarding remote learning, workload, and burnout. CONCLUSION A disconnect seems to exist between student perceptions of learning with actual learning outcomes. While these results may positively support remote instruction, qualitative data indicate that student experience of remote instruction must be considered to avoid burnout and stress among students.","Lorio, Anne K; Galen, Sujay; Morelli, Kimberly; Gore, Jane",Journal of allied health,433,21

METHODS: Latent Class Analysis with covariates was applied to the Mugello Study data to identify health profiles among the 504 nonagenarians residing in the Mugello district (Tuscany, Italy) and to evaluate the association between socioeconomic characteristics and the health profiles resulting from the analysis. RESULTS: This study highlights four groups labeled according to the posterior probability of determining a certain health characteristic: ""healthy"", ""physically healthy with cognitive impairment"", ""unhealthy"", and ""severely unhealthy"". Some demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were found to be associated with the final groups: older nonagenarians are more likely to be in worse health conditions; men are in general healthier than women; more educated individuals are less likely to be in extremely poor health conditions, while the lowest-educated are more likely to be cognitively impaired; and office or intellectual workers are less likely to be in poor health conditions than are farmers.

Such measures run counter to the prevailing approach of the previous two centuries that developed an international public health space. This article examines the measures adopted by European states in order to contain 19th-century cholera pandemics, which took shape through the development of an international maritime quarantine system, based primarily on the implementation of national regulations and local decision-making. This regime was quickly viewed as ineffective and out of step with liberal ideas that urged a “laissez-faire” approach to public health matters. In its stead, a long-term trend developed towards easing quarantine measures. Nation states supported the internationalisation of the fight against pandemics, which chiefly consisted of externalising quarantine measures to the East in order to eliminate them in Europe. This process was based on a subtle dialectical relationship between the construction of an international public health space and the affirmation of state sovereignty, and continued into the 20th century with the progressive creation of international institutions responsible for advancing global health.","Pouget, Benoît",Centaurus,433,1

In this study, we explored the patterns of COVID-19 cases in the US from 1 March to 12 December 2020. The county-level cases and rates of the disease were mapped using a geographic information system (GIS). The overall trend of the disease in the US, as well as in each of its 50 individual states, were analyzed by the seasonal-trend decomposition.

This will enable governments and policy-makers to make evidence-based decisions. This international study reports the association between workplace factors and the mental health of HCWs during the pandemic. METHODS: An international, cross-sectional study was conducted in 41 countries. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms, derived from the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with mental health outcomes. Inter-country differences were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 2527 responses were received, from 41 countries, including China (n = 1213; 48.0%), UK (n = 891; 35.3%), and USA (n = 252; 10.0%). Of all participants, 1343 (57.1%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 2021 (80.0%) were female; 874 (34.6%) were doctors, and 1367 (54.1%) were nurses. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of depressive symptoms were: working in the UK (OR = 3.63; CI = [2.90-4.54]; p < 0.001) and USA (OR = 4.10; CI = [3.03-5.54]), p < 0.001); being female (OR = 1.74; CI = [1.42-2.13]; p < 0.001); being a nurse (OR = 1.64; CI = [1.34-2.01]; p < 0.001); and caring for a COVID-19 positive patient who subsequently died (OR = 1.20; CI = [1.01-1.43]; p = 0.040). Workplace factors associated with depressive symptoms were: redeployment to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (OR = 1.67; CI = [1.14-2.46]; p = 0.009); redeployment with perceived unsatisfactory training (OR = 1.67; CI = [1.32-2.11]; p < 0.001); not being issued with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (OR = 2.49; CI = [2.03-3.04]; p < 0.001); perceived poor workplace support within area/specialty (OR = 2.49; CI = [2.03-3.04]; p < 0.001); and perceived poor mental health support (OR = 1.63; CI = [1.38-1.92]; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This is the first international study, demonstrating that workplace factors, including PPE availability, staff training pre-redeployment, and provision of mental health support, are significantly associated with mental health during COVID-19. Governments, policy-makers and other stakeholders need to ensure provision of these to safeguard HCWs' mental health, for future waves and other pandemics.","Khajuria, Ankur; Tomaszewski, Wojtek; Liu, Zhongchun; Chen, Jian-Hua; Mehdian, Roshana; Fleming, Simon; Vig, Stella; Crawford, Mike J",BMC Health Serv Res,433,5

Anxiety has been associated with poor diet quality and weight gain, which may lead to obesity, a risk factor for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The present study was designed to examine associations between diet quality and anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This cross-sectional, international online study was conducted between March 30 and April 25, 2020 and available in seven languages: Arabic (7.6%), English (43.7%), French (0.8%), Hebrew (42.1%), Italian (3%), Russian (1.1%), and Spanish (1.6%). Diet quality was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score (possible range: 0-17 points) and anxiety scored using the General Anxiety Disorder 7-point scale (GAD-7). The Google Survey platform was used to conduct the survey. RESULTS: A total of 3797 persons were included in the present analysis. More than 75% of respondents were female; most completed the survey in English or Hebrew. Median age was 31 (IQ = 18) years. Almost 60% indicated that their pre-pandemic diet was healthier than their current diet. The median Mediterranean diet score was 9 (IQ = 3). The majority (54%) of participants reported at least mild anxiety, while 25% reported moderate anxiety or more severe. In a logistic regression model of at least moderate anxiety, Mediterranean diet score (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.95, p < 0.0001) reduced odds of elevated anxiety, even after controlling for age, sex and other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Though causality cannot be inferred, associations between diet quality and anxiety might suggest public health interventions including diet and stress control during future mass lockdowns.","Kaufman-Shriqui, Vered; Navarro, Daniela Abigail; Raz, Olga; Boaz, Mona",Eur. j. clin. nutr,433,22

However, limited data are available comparing these cough simulations to physiological breathing and coughing. In this study, three different cough simulators (Teleflex Mucosal Atomization Device Nasal (MAD Nasal), a spray gun, and GloGerm™ MIST) that have been used in the literature were studied to assess their physiologic relevance. Droplet size, velocity, dispersion, and force generated by the simulators were measured. Droplet size was measured with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Slow-motion videography was used to 3D reconstruct and measure the velocity of each simulated cough. A force-sensitive resistor was used to measure the force of each simulated cough. The average size of droplets from each cough simulator was 176 to 220 µm. MAD Nasal, the spray gun, and GloGerm™ MIST traveled 0.38 m, 0.89 m, and 1.62 m respectively. The average velocities for the MAD Nasal, spray gun, and GloGerm™ MIST were 1.57 m/s, 2.60 m/s, and 9.27 m/s respectively, and all yielded a force of &lt;0.5 Newtons. GloGerm™ MIST and the spray gun most closely resemble physiological coughs and breathing respectively. In conclusion, none of the simulators tested accurately modeled all physiologic characteristics (droplet size, 3-D dispersion velocity, and force) of a cough, while there were various strengths and weaknesses of each method. One should take this into account when performing simulations with these devices.","Patel, Shiv H.; Yim, Wonjun; Garg, Anupam K.; Shah, Sahil H.; Jokerst, Jesse; Chao, Daniel L.",J. Clin. Med.,433,30

Vascular surgery departments are no exception and Vascular societies across the world issued some guidance through these turbulent times, resulting all together in surgery reduction and surgeons' reallocations. Objectives As expected, this impacts vascular trainees and their training and so, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact o COVID-19 pandemic on vascular education. Materials and Methods A remote digital survey was spread across European networks aiming vascular residents and their activities during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. Questions were related to possible trainee relocations, COVID-19 infections, daily activities reduction, scientific activity, exams and internships. Results reported here are from 7th July to 20th September. Duplicate responses were removed. Results A total of 104 answers across 27 countries were included. The mean age of the trainee's responders were 31.2 ± 3.58 years old, 63% were male and the residency year mode was the 5th. Forty-four (42.3%) of the trainees stood in the COVID- 19 frontline, of which were mainly for COVID-19 wards (50%) and emergency departments (22.1%), with only two (1.9%) being relocated to a different hospital. Concerning time in the frontline, the most frequent answers were up to two weeks in 34.8% and above 12 weeks in 28.8%. More than half (76.9%) said to had suffer a decrease in number of surgical procedures performed and/or assisted with over 60% reporting a decrease superior to 50%. Annual or final exams were re-schedule or cancelled for 16.3% and 10.6% of the participants, respectively. Of the responders, 56.7% as stated to have operated COVID- 19 positive patients at the time of the survey. Six responders (5.8%) had said to have themselves being infected by COVID-19 while 63.5% answer to have had medical staff infected in their vascular departments. Accordingly, to the survey, 73.5% claims that the first COVID-19 pandemic wave had a negative impact on vascular education and 73.4% agrees for the need of ""some compensation"" on their vascular residency curriculum. Conclusions The first COVID-19 pandemic wave brough a significant negative impact on vascular education with more than 50% of the responders suggesting a need for compensation after this period. However, as a second wave is emerging, this negative impact is expected to increase even more significantly.","Pereira-Neves, António; Domingues, Liliana Fidalgo; Ancetti, Stefano",Rev Port Cir Cardiotorac Vasc,433,20

As current surveys suggest, people are displaying an irrational desire to live in a world without chemistry, but at the same time are unable to answer trivial chemistry questions. Constant questioning of the importance of chemistry induced by chemophobia leads to a weakening of the identity of chemists and can have negative consequences on the reproduction of chemistry. The need for the support of a positive perception of the chemical profession and an offer of positive examples for self-identification is the result. Everyday communication thus becomes the background on which the determination of the identity of the chemist takes place. The new communication strategy, which we call ""heroes of chemistry"", aims not only to add a much-needed human touch to chemistry communications, but also to create the conditions for strengthening the identity of the chemist.","Chalupa, Radek; Nesmerák, Karel",Monatsh Chem,433,2

To overcome this problem, countries have adopted different policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions for controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) agent-based model that aims to simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business and government. Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation. The COVID-ABS model was implemented in Python programming language, with source code publicly available. The model can be easily extended to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the creation of a multitude of other scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to assist politicians and health authorities to plan their actions against the COVID-19 epidemic.","Silva, Petrônio C.L.; Batista, Paulo V.C.; Lima, Hélder S.; Alves, Marcos A.; Guimarães, Frederico G.; Silva, Rodrigo C.P.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,433,1

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed hypoxic COVID-19 patients who were consecutively admitted between March 13, 2020 and April 19, 2020. Patients with lung infiltrates and elevated inflammatory markers received a single dose of tocilizumab if no contraindication was present. Systemic steroid, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin were concomitantly used for majority of the patients. Findings: Of the 51 patients included for analysis, 28 (55%) received tocilizumab and 23 (45%) did not receive tocilizumab. Tocilizumab cohort required more invasive ventilation (68% vs. 22%) at baseline and during entire hospitalization (75% vs. 48%). The median time to clinical improvement in tocilizumab vs. no tocilizumab cohorts was 8 days (Interquartile range [IQR]: 6·25 - 9·75 days) vs. 13 days (IQR: 9·75 - 15·25 days) among patients who required mechanical ventilation at any time (Hazard ratio for clinical improvement: 1·83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0·57 - 5·84) and 6·5 days vs. 7 days among all patients (Hazard ratio for clinical improvement: 1·14, 95% CI: 0·55 - 2·38), respectively. The median duration of vasopressor support and invasive mechanical ventilation were 2 days (IQR: 1·75 - 4·25 days) vs. 5 days (IQR: 4 - 8 days), p = 0.039, and 7 days (IQR: 4 - 14 days) vs. 10 days (IQR: 5 - 15 days) in tocilizumab vs. no tocilizumab cohorts, p = 0.11, respectively. Similar rates of hospital-acquired infections occurred in both cohorts (18% in tocilizumab and 22% in no tocilizumab cohort). Interpretation: In patients with severe COVID-19, tocilizumab was associated with significantly shorter duration of vasopressor support. Although not statistically significant, tocilizumab also resulted in shorter median time to clinical improvement and shorter duration of invasive ventilation. These findings require validation from ongoing clinical trials of Tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients.","Kewan, Tariq; Covut, Fahrettin; Al-Jaghbeer, Mohammed J; Rose, Lori; Gopalakrishna, K V; Akbik, Bassel",EClinicalMedicine,433,16

Specifically we use a collisional approach to an infection-age structured model described by a renewal equation for the time homogeneous evolution of epidemics. As a result, we show how various contributions of the lockdown policies, namely physical proximity and human mobility, reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate the risk of disease resurgence.

The cohort was split randomly into the development cohort and the validation cohorts with 2:1 ratio. In the development cohort (n=3,729), we tried to identify factors associated with overall survival (OS) and create a scoring system to predict OS using identified parameters by Cox proportional hazard regression model with bootstrapping methods. The prediction accuracy was evaluated in the validation cohort (n=1,865) using the area under the curve (AUC) by receiver operating characteristics curves. Each variable's score in the COPS system was rounded off following the log-scaled conversion of the adjusted hazard ratio. RESULTS: Among the 5,594 patients included in this analysis, 234 died after COVID-19 diagnosis. In the development cohort, six parameters were significantly related to poor overall survival: advanced age; dementia; chronic renal failure; dyspnea; mental disturbance; and absolute lymphocyte count <1,000 /mm3. Afterward, the COPS system was developed, and risk groups were created: low-risk (score, 0-2), intermediate-risk (score, 3), high-risk (score, 4), and very high-risk (score, 5-7). The COPS system yielded an AUC of .918 for predicting 14-days survival rate and .896 for predicting 28-days survival rate in the validation cohort. Using the COPS system, 28-days overall survival rates were discriminatively estimated as 99.8%, 95.4%, 82.3%, and 55.1% in low-risk, intermediate-risk, high risk, and very high-risk groups in the total cohort, respectively (P <.001). Length of hospital stay and disease severity were directly associated with the survivors (P <.001), and survivors stayed in a hospital significantly longer than non-survivors (26.1±10.7 vs. 15.6±13.3 days). CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed predictive COPS system may assist in risk-adapted decisions for medical resources allocation, including intensive care, during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cho, Sung-Yeon; Park, Sung-Soo; Song, Min-Kyu; Bae, Young Yi; Lee, Dong-Gun; Kim, Dong-Wook",J. med. internet res,433,1

To assess burnout level during an outbreak of COVID-19 and to identify influencing factors between frontline nurses and nurses from other wards. Methods. This cross-sectional study makes comparison between two groups of nurses including frontline (exposure group) and other nurses working in usual wards (non-exposure group) in Torbat Heydariyeh city, Iran. Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Job stress questionnaire (JSQ), and questionnaires of hospital resources, family support, and measuring the fear of COVID-19 were used as research instruments. Results. The scores of job stress and burnout in the exposure group with COVID-19 infection were significantly higher than in the non-exposure group (p=0.006 and p=0.002, respectively). Although, in univariate linear regression, employment status (p=0.047), experience in taking care of patient confirmed or suspected with COVID-19 infection (p=0.006), hospital resources (p=0.047), and job stress (p<0.001) were considered as significant risk factors for COVID-19-related burnout. In multivariate regression analysis, job stress (p=0.031, ß=0.308) was considered as an only factor that has a significant relationship with COVID-19-related burnout. Conclusion. The burnout level in frontline nurses was higher than other nurses, the most important influencing factor was the job stress. Regarding to negative effects of burnout on both physical and mental health nurses, it is suggested that a strong strategy be considered to reduce nurses' burnout to be able to control ongoing and future outbreaks successfully.","Sarboozi Hoseinabadi, Tahere; Kakhki, Samaneh; Teimori, Gholamheidar; Nayyeri, Somayyeh",Invest. educ. enferm,433,16

To answer this question, researchers traditionally need to run an experiment applying the drug of interest to that cell type. This approach is not scalable: given a large number of different actions (drugs) and a large number of different contexts (cell types), it is infeasible to run an experiment for every action-context pair. In such cases, one would ideally like to predict the result for every pair while only having to perform experiments on a small subset of pairs. This task, which we label""causal imputation"", is a generalization of the causal transportability problem. In this paper, we provide two main contributions. First, we demonstrate the efficacy of the recently introduced synthetic interventions estimator on the task of causal imputation when applied to the prominent CMAP dataset. Second, we explain the demonstrated success of this estimator by introducing a generic linear structural causal model which accounts for the interaction between cell type and drug.","Squires, Chandler; Shen, Dennis; Agarwal, Anish; Shah, Devavrat; Uhler, Caroline",,433,32

Methods: Psychiatric hospitalizations and emergency psychiatric attendances carried out between January 7th and May 28th, 2020, were evaluated, covering the periods before and after lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Fortaleza, capital of the state of Ceará, Brazil. The data in the two periods were described and presented in time series graphs. Attendances were also described according to the severity categories. Comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U test and test for proportions. Results: The daily average of hospitalizations and of attendances decreased in the evaluated periods from 16.0 to 10.8 (p &lt; 0.001) and 67.9 to 35.0 (p &lt; 0.001), respectively. This absolute reduction was observed in all categories of severity. No difference was observed in the proportion of severe attendances (2.3% vs. 2.8%; p = 0.207).

To assess whether emergency general surgeons (EGS) could provide a 'Hot Gall Bladder Service' (HGS) with an acceptable outcome. Patients and Methods: This was a prospective HGS observational study that was protocol driven with strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and secure online data collection in a district general hospital between July 2018 and June 2019. A weekly dedicated theatre slot was allocated for this list. Results: Of the 143 referred for HGS, 86 (60%) underwent ELC which included 60 (70%) women. Age, ASA and body mass index was 54* (18-85) years, II* (I-III) and 27* (20-54), respectively. 86 included 46 (53%), 19 (22%), 19 (22%) and 2 (3%) patients presenting with acute calculus cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, biliary colic, and acalculus cholecystitis, respectively. 85 (99%) underwent LC with a single conversion. Grade of surgical difficulty, duration of surgery and post-operative stay was 2* (1-4) 68* (30-240) min and 0* (0-13) day, respectively. Eight (9%) required senior surgical input with no intra-operative complications and 2 (2%) 30-day readmissions. One was post-operative subhepatic collection that recovered uneventfully and the second was pancreatitis, imaging was clear requiring no further intervention.

We aimed to investigate the association between the SARS-CoV-2 antibody status at baseline and subsequent infection in this population. Methods We did a prospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in staff (aged &lt;65 years) and residents (aged &gt;65 years) at 100 LTCFs in England between Oct 1, 2020, and Feb 1, 2021. Blood samples were collected between June and November, 2020, at baseline, and 2 and 4 months thereafter and tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was done weekly in staff and monthly in residents. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of a PCR-positive test by baseline antibody status, adjusted for age and sex, and stratified by LTCF. Findings 682 residents from 86 LCTFs and 1429 staff members from 97 LTCFs met study inclusion criteria. At baseline, IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid were detected in 226 (33%) of 682 residents and 408 (29%) of 1429 staff members. 93 (20%) of 456 residents who were antibody-negative at baseline had a PCR-positive test (infection rate 0.054 per month at risk) compared with four (2%) of 226 residents who were antibody-positive at baseline (0.007 per month at risk). 111 (11%) of 1021 staff members who were antibody-negative at baseline had PCR-positive tests (0.042 per month at risk) compared with ten (2%) of 408 staff members who were antibody-positive staff at baseline (0.009 per month at risk). The risk of PCR-positive infection was higher for residents who were antibody-negative at baseline than residents who were antibody-positive at baseline (adjusted HR [aHR] 0.15, 95% CI 0.05-0.44, p=0.0006), and the risk of a PCR-positive infection was also higher for staff who were antibody-negative at baseline compared with staff who were antibody-positive at baseline (aHR 0.39, 0.19-0.82;p=0.012). 12 of 14 reinfected participants had available data on symptoms, and 11 of these participants were symptomatic. Antibody titres to spike and nucleocapsid proteins were comparable in PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. Interpretation The presence of IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid protein was associated with substantially reduced risk of reinfection in staff and residents for up to 10 months after primary infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including ordinary cases (group A, n = 12), severe cases (group B, n = 15), and critical cases (group C, n = 24) were retrospectively enrolled. The qualitative and quantitative indicators from chest CT were recorded and compared using Fisher exact test, one-way analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis H test, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: Depending on the severity of the disease, the number of involved lung segments and lobes, the frequencies of consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and air bronchogram increased in more severe cases. Qualitative indicators including total severity score for the whole lung and total score for crazy-paving and consolidation could distinguish groups B and C from A (69% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and 73% accuracy) but were similar between group B and group C. Combined qualitative and quantitative indicators could distinguish these 3 groups with high sensitivity (B + C vs A, 90%; C vs B, 92%), specificity (100%, 87%), and accuracy (92%, 90%). Critical cases had higher total severity score (>10) and higher total score for crazy-paving and consolidation (>4) than ordinary cases, and had higher mean lung density (>-779 HU) and full width at half maximum (>128 HU) but lower relative volume of normal lung density (â¦50%) than ordinary/severe cases. In our critical cases, 8 patients with relative volume of normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, and 2 of them had died. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid, accurate severity assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest CT would be feasible and could provide help for making management decisions, especially for the critical cases.","Lyu, Peijie; Liu, Xing; Zhang, Rui; Shi, Lei; Gao, Jianbo",Invest Radiol,433,16

Disposable gowns were labeled for single person use and hung in common procedure spaces within the vivarium between usages. A simulated rack change of 140 cages was completed using XR7-treated cages. One individual changed all cages with a break occurring after the first 70 cages, requiring the gown to be removed and reused once. To simulate research activities, 5 individuals accessed 3 XR7-treated cages daily for 5 d. Each mouse in the XR7-treated cages was manipulated at least once before returning cages to the housing room. Disposable gowns were reused 5 times per individual.

Fluorescence was localized to gloves and gown sleeves in closest contact with animals and caging. No fluorescence was detected on underlying clothing, or bare arms and hands after removing PPE. Fluorescence was not detected in procedure spaces where gowns were hung. The lack of fluorescence on personnel or surfaces indicate that gowns can be reused 1 time for routine husbandry tasks and up to 5 times for research personnel.

METHODS: A dynamic transmission model that extended the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered framework by incorporating asymptomatic, presymptomatic and waiting-to-be-diagnosed patients was constructed to conduct the cost-effectiveness analysis from the healthcare system perspective. To estimate epidemic parameters, the model was first calibrated to the observed epidemic curve in Wuhan from 23 January to 19 March 2020. Following the calibration, the infected compartment was replaced by 3 severity-defined health states to reflect differential costs and quality of life associated with disease gravity. Costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) outcomes of 9 million simulated people were accrued across time to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of remdesivir. As robustness checks, an alternative modelling technique using decision tree, additional epidemic scenarios representing different epidemic intensities, and 1-way parameter variations were also analysed. RESULTS: Remdesivir treatment cost CN¥97.93 million more than standard of care. Also, the net QALY gain from 5-day remdesivir treatment was 6947 QALYs. As such, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CN¥14 098/QALY, substantially lower than the gross domestic product per capita threshold. The peak daily number of severe cases was 19% lower in the remdesivir treatment strategy. Overall, results were robust in alternative scenarios and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Given the cost-effectiveness profile, access to remdesivir for severe COVID-19 patients in China should be considered.","Jiang, Yawen; Cai, Dan; Chen, Daqin; Jiang, Shan; Si, Lei; Wu, Jing",,433,16

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with STEMI in the outbreak era (between January 23, 2020 and March 27, 2020), and the post era (between March 28, 2020, and July 31, 2020) in Suzhou Province, drawn from the China Chest Pain Center Database. RESULTS: 1965 STEMI admissions were enrolled. During the corresponding period of 2019 to the post COVID-19 era, there were a 53% and 38% fall in admissions in outbreak and the post era. There remained a gap in actual number of admissions at 306 and the predicted number that might be at 497. An estimated 26 deaths due to STEMI would have been caused by not seeking health care while no one died from COVID-19. The percentage of STEMI cases transferred by ambulance decreased from 9.3% to 4.2% (P=0.013). Door-to-balloon and the FMC-to-device median (q1, q3) time increased from 17.5 (10.0, 46.0) and 52.0 (12.0, 86.0) minutes to 34.0 (15.0, 48.0) and 63.0 (15.0, 94.0) minutes, respectively (p=0.001, p=0.005), and rate of PCI practice declined from 71.3% to 60.1% (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of public health restrictions in the post COVID-19 era is significant, and may lead to unexpected out-of-hospital deaths and compromised quality of STEMI care. Delay or absence in presentation in STEMI patients should be continuously considered to avoid the secondary disaster of the pandemic. System delay should be modifiable for reversing the worse clinical outcomes from the COVID-19 outbreak, by coordination measures with focus on the balance between timely PCI procedure and minimizing contamination of cardiac catheterization rooms.","Ma, J.; Zhou, S.; Li, N.; Dong, X.; Maimaitiming, M.; Jin, Y.; Zheng, Z.

However, a few recent studies have demonstrated that repetitive feedback at final recall can reverse the long-term advantage of testing over restudy. The result that feedback at long-term tests can dramatically decrease the relative effectiveness of retrieval-based learning could be important for both theoretical and practical reasons. Considering that these earlier studies administered low retrieval success at retrieval practice, we investigated whether the effect of feedback on the testing effect is modulated by the level of retrieval success during practice. In three experiments the level of success at retrieval practice was manipulated by multiple pre-practice learning trials, and multiple tests with feedback were applied after a 1-week retention interval at final recall. Our results have demonstrated that a feedback-induced reversed testing effect was present only at low retrieval success during practice (Experiment 1), whereas with moderate (Experiment 2) and high retrieval success (Experiment 3) during practice a significant testing effect emerged and no reversed testing effect was found even after repeated cycles of feedback. These results point to the conclusion that the level of retrieval success was the key factor in reversing the testing effect in earlier studies. Application of high retrieval success during practice can produce long-lasting accessible memories even in learning settings applying multiple tests with feedback.","Racsmány, Mihály; Szollosi, Ágnes; Marián, Miklós",Mem. cogn,433,1

Evidence is emerging that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 2.5 µm or less) associates with higher COVID-19 mortality rates, but whether it also associates with the speed at which the disease is capable of spreading in a population is unknown. Here, we establish the association between long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 in the United States (US) and COVID-19 basic reproduction ratio R0- a dimensionless epidemic measure of the rapidity of disease spread through a population. We inferred state-level R0 values using a state-of-the-art susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) model initialized with COVID-19 epidemiological data corresponding to the period March 2-April 30. This period was characterized by a rapid surge in COVID-19 cases across the US states, implementation of strict social distancing measures, and a significant drop in outdoor air pollution. We find that an increase of 1 µg/m3 in PM2.5 levels below current national ambient air quality standards associates with an increase of 0.25 in R0 (95% CI: 0.048-0.447). A 10% increase in secondary inorganic composition, sulfate-nitrate-ammonium, in PM2.5 associates with &#8776;10% increase in R0 by 0.22 (95% CI: 0.083-0.352), and presence of black carbon (soot) in the ambient environment moderates this relationship. We considered several potential confounding factors in our analysis, including gaseous air pollutants and socio-economical and meteorological conditions. Our results underscore two policy implications - first, regulatory standards need to be better guided by exploring the concentration-response relationships near the lower end of the PM2.5 air quality distribution; and second, pollution regulations need to be continually enforced for combustion emissions that largely determine secondary inorganic aerosol formation.","Chakrabarty, Rajan K; Beeler, Payton; Liu, Pai; Goswami, Spondita; Harvey, Richard D; Pervez, Shamsh; van Donkelaar, Aaron; Martin, Randall V",Sci Total Environ,433,1

This study aimed to develop and evaluate the construct validity and reliability of a new parent-proxy Preschool Hearing Environments and Reflection on Quality of Life (HEAR-QL) questionnaire. METHODS: Parents of children 2 to 6 years old with any hearing loss (HL) were recruited from multiple sites. To evaluate the new measure's construct validity, participants completed a 70-item preschool HEAR-QL and validated questionnaires measuring hearing and communication functioning (Parents' Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children), generic pediatric QL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Parent Report, PedsQL), family functioning (PedsQL Family Impact Module), and parent well-being (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Adult Global Report). Participants completed the preschool HEAR-QL 2 weeks later to measure test-retest reliability. Exploratory principal components analysis was used to reduce the number of items and determine the underlying HEAR-QL factor structure. Analysis of variance examined HEAR-QL differences by HL. RESULTS: Among 205 parents, 144 had children with bilateral HL, 50 had children with unilateral HL, 10 had children with normal hearing (NH), and one child's hearing status was unspecified. The 70-item questionnaire was reduced to 23 items with five underlying factors: Behavior and Attention, Hearing Environments, New Social Situations, Social Interactions, and Communication. Cronbach's alpha for each factor ranged from 0.80 to 0.91. Test-retest reliability was 0.93. Moderate-to-strong correlations (r > .300) were observed between each Preschool HEAR-QL factor and previously validated measures. Hearing Environments scores differed significantly between children with NH and any HL. CONCLUSION: Preschool HEAR-QL correlations with other measures supported its construct validity.

Because caregivers serve an important role in postoperative recovery, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of visitor restrictions on the postoperative experience of coronavirus disease 2019-negative patients undergoing surgery. METHODS: Patients who underwent surgery immediately before or after the implementation of a visitor restriction policy were enrolled. Patients were surveyed on their inpatient experience and preparedness for discharge using items adapted from validated questionnaires. RESULTS: Among 128 eligible patients, 117 agreed to participate (91.4% response rate): 58 (49.6%) in the Visitor Cohort and 59 (50.4%) in the No-Visitor Cohort. Mean age was 57.5 years (standard deviation 13.9) and 66 (56.4%) were female. Among all patients, 47.8% underwent oncologic surgery, 31.6% transplant, and 20.5% general or other. Patients in the No-Visitor Cohort were less likely to report complete satisfaction with the hospital experience (80.7% vs 66.0%, P = .044), timely receipt of medications (84.5% vs 69.0%, P = .048), and assistance getting out of bed (70.7% vs 51.7%, P = .036). No-Visitor Cohort patients were less likely to feel that their discharge preferences were adequately considered (79.3% vs 54.2%, P = .004). Qualitative analysis of patient responses highlighted the consistent psychosocial support provided by visitors after surgery (84.5%), and patients in the No-Visitor Cohort reported social isolation due to lack of psychosocial support (50.8%). CONCLUSION: The implementation of hospital visitor restriction policies may adversely impact the postoperative experience of coronavirus disease 2019-negative patients undergoing surgery. These findings highlight the urgent need for novel patient-centered strategies to improve the postoperative experience of patients during ongoing or future disruptions to routine hospital practice.","Zeh, Ryan D; Santry, Heena P; Monsour, Christina; Sumski, Alan A; Bridges, John F P; Tsung, Allan; Pawlik, Timothy M; Cloyd, Jordan M",Surgery,433,12

While there is evidence indicating that suicide rates de-crease during times of crises, they are expected to increase once the immediate crisis has passed. The COVID-19 pandemic affects risk and pro-tective factors for suicide at each level of the socio-ecological model. Economic downturn, augmented barriers to accessing health care, increased access to suicidal means, inappropriate media reporting at the societal level; deprioritization of mental health and preventive activities at the community level; interpersonal conflicts, neglect and violence at the relationship level; unemployment, poverty, loneliness and hopelessness at the individual level: all these variables contribute to an increase of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, harmful use of alcohol, substance abuse, and ultimately suicide risk. Suicide should be prevented by strengthening universal strategies directed to the entire population, including mitigation of unemployment, poverty and inequalities; prioritization of access to mental health care; responsible media reporting, with information about available support; prevention of increased alcohol intake; and restriction of access to lethal means of suicide. Selective interventions should continue to target known vulnerable groups who are socio-economically disadvantaged, but also new ones such as first responders and health care staff, and the bereaved by COVID-19 who have been deprived of the final contact with loved ones and funerals. Indicated preventive strategies targeting individuals who display suicidal behaviour should focus on available pharmacological and psychological treatments of mental disorders, ensuring proper follow-up and chain of care by increased use of telemedicine and other digital means.

Real estate market data in general and market transaction data, in particular, are inherently spatiotemporal as each transaction has a location and time. Therefore, exploratory spatiotemporal methods can extract unique locational and temporal insight from property transaction data, but this type of data are usually unavailable or not sufficiently geocoded to implement spatiotemporal methods. In this article, exploratory spatiotemporal methods, including a space-time cube, were used to analyze the residential real estate market at small area scale in the Dublin Metropolitan Area over the last decade. The spatial patterns show that some neighborhoods are experiencing change, including gentrification and recent development. The extracted spatiotemporal patterns from the data show different urban areas have had varying responses during national and global crises such as the economic crisis in 2008–2011, the Brexit decision in 2016, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also suggests that Dublin is experiencing intraurban displacement of residential property transactions to the west of Dublin city, and we are predicting increasing spatial inequality and segregation in the future. The findings of this innovative and exploratory data-driven approach are supported by other work in the field regarding Dublin and other international cities. The article shows that the space-time cube can be used as complementary evidence for different fields of urban studies, urban planning, urban economics, real estate valuations, intraurban analytics, and monitoring sociospatial changes at small areas, and to understand residential property transactions in cities. Moreover, the exploratory spatiotemporal analyses of data have a high potential to highlight spatial structures of the city and relevant underlying processes.

While prior evidence provides support for the general implementation of virtual individual therapy, there is limited guidance and evidence for the adoption of group teletherapy. Here we describe our efforts to implement group teletherapy for two small cohorts of individuals with FEP receiving care in a coordinated specialty care clinic using methods adopted from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. We observed high adherence with group visits as well as client satisfaction across groups. Based on our results, we have taken efforts to implement virtual group therapy more permanently in our clinic. Our experience provides guidance and a model for integration of virtual group therapy within CSC.

The keys, queries, values and attention vectors of the network are considered as the unobserved stochastic states of its hidden structure. This generative model is such that at each time step the received observation is a random function of these past states in a given attention window. In this general state-space setting, we use Sequential Monte Carlo methods to approximate the posterior distributions of the states given the observations, and then to estimate the gradient of the log-likelihood. We thus propose a generative model providing a predictive distribution, instead of a single-point estimate.","Martin, Alice; Ollion, Charles; Strub, Florian; Corff, Sylvain Le; Pietquin, Olivier",,433,16

The extent to which this change in health news consumption practice impacts health knowledge is not known. This study investigates the relationship between most trusted information source and COVID-19 knowledge. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was sent to a convenience sample from a list of adults on a central Pennsylvania health system's marketing database 25-31 March 2020. Respondents were grouped by their trusted news sources and comparison of respondent COVID-19 knowledge was made between these groups for 5948 respondents. RESULTS: Those who selected government health websites as their most trusted source were more likely to answer COVID-19 questions correctly than those who selected other internet news sources or television news (OR 1.21, p < .05; 1.08, p > .05; and 0.87, p < .05, respectively). Those who used Facebook as an additional source of news in any way were less likely to answer COVID-19 questions correctly than those who did not (OR 0.93, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 knowledge correlates with trusted news source. To increase public knowledge of COVID-19 in order to maximize information dissemination and compliance with COVID-19-related public health recommendations, those who provide health information should consider use of the public's most trusted sources of information, as well as monitoring and correcting misinformation presented by other sources. Independent content review for accuracy in media may be warranted in public health emergencies to improve knowledge.","Sakya, Surav Man; Scoy, Lauren Jodi Van; Garman, John C; Miller, Erin L; Snyder, Bethany; Wasserman, Emily; Chinchilli, Vernon M; Lennon, Robert P",Curr Med Res Opin,433,1

With the cases of ranavirus infection increasing, many ranavirus genomic sequences were published, but little is known about ranavirus taxonomy on a whole genome level. In this study, 44 ranaviruses core genes were identified in 32 ranaviruses genome sequences by using PanX. The Neighbor joining phylogenetic trees (NJ-tree) based on 44 ranaviruses core genes and 24 iridoviridae core genes and composition vector phylogenetic tree (CV-Tree) based on whole genome were constructed. The three of phylogenetic trees showed that 32 ranavirus isolates can be divided into 4 different subgroups including SGIV-like, EHNV-like, FV3-like and CMTV-like, and subgroups taxonomic position of three phylogenetic trees were consistent. However, the phylogenetic position of ToRV could not be determined if it belongs to FV3-like or CMTV-like group. Subsequently, we carried out dot plot analysis and confirmed that ToRV should belong to CMTV-like group. Based on dot plot analysis and phylogenetic trees, the taxonomic classification of ranaviruses was confirmed. Finally, 4 genes which are suitable for the construction of phylogenetic tree were selected from ranavirus core genes by recombination analysis, substitution saturation analysis and single-gene phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of the 4 selected genes showed that the classification of subgroups was identical with 3 of the phylogenetic trees. Conclusion our results confirmed taxonomic identification of ranaviruses, the 4 selected genes used in phylogenic analysis will make taxonomic identification more convenient and accurate.","Yu, Zehui; Zhang, Wenjie; Gu, Congwei; Chen, Jindong; Zhao, Mingde; Fu, Lu; Han, Jianhong; He, Manli; Xiao, Qihai; Xiao, Wudian; He, Lvqin; Zhang, Zhimin",Transbound. emerg. dis.

However, the low-mass end of AGN has never been explored in detail. In this work, we extend the existing scaling relations to lower-mass AGN, which serve as anchors between the normal-mass AGN and BHXRBs. For this purpose, we construct a sample of low-mass AGN ($M_{\rm BH}<3\times 10^{6} M_{\rm \odot}$) from the XMM-Newton archive and measure frequency-resolved time delays between the soft (0.3-1 keV) and hard (1-4 keV) X-ray emission. We report that the soft band lags behind the hard band emission at high frequencies $\sim[1.3-2.6]\times 10^{-3}$ Hz, which is interpreted as a sign of reverberation from the inner accretion disc in response to the direct coronal emission. At low frequencies ($\sim[3-8]\times 10^{-4}$ Hz), the hard band lags behind the soft band variations, which we explain in the context of the inward propagation of luminosity fluctuations through the corona. We find that the X-ray source for the sample extends at an average radius of around $8r_{\rm g}$ and a median height of around $15r_{\rm g}$ above the disc plane, assuming a lamppost geometry for the corona. Our results confirm that the scaling relations between the BH mass and soft lag amplitude/frequency derived for higher-mass AGN can safely extrapolate to lower-mass AGN, and the accretion process is indeed independent of the BH mass.","Mallick, Labani; Wilkins, Daniel R.; Alston, William N.; Markowitz, Alex; Marco, Barbara De; Parker, Michael L.; Lohfink, Anne M.; Stalin, C.

The purpose of these discharge instructions is to assist and provide guidance for physicians, nurses, and other health care personnel involved in discharging COVID-19 patients to home after encounters at hospitals, emergency departments, urgent care settings, and medical offices. METHODS: A systematic literature-search of studies evaluating both symptoms and signs of COVID-19 was performed in order to establish specific optimal performance criteria in monitoring a patient's status with regard to disease safety. These optimal performance criteria parameters were considered with regard to the severity of morbidity and mortality. Strategies used to develop the discharge instructions included review of a broad spectrum of literature to develop the discharge criteria. RESULTS: These guidelines are presented for patient education and should achieve the essential goals including: enabling patients to understand their medical situation, preventing complications, supporting patients by providing instructions, helping patients make more effective use of available health services, and managing patient stress by giving patients comfort through the knowledge of specific recommendations including how to respond to situations. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic requires clinicians to efficiently teach their patients self-management strategies and to provide a safe educated response to the patient and the surrounding community environment. The primary goal of the patient education discharge-instructions (PEDI) is to provide self-management strategies for preventing complications and disease transmission.","Baker, Terrance L; Greiner, Jack V",J Prim Care Community Health,433,16

We examined predictors of interest and avoidance of COVID-19 news in Lithuania. STUDY DESIGN: This is an online survey. METHODS: An online survey was conducted between October and December 2020 targeting the general population in Lithuania. Participants rated their interest and avoidance of news about the COVID-19 pandemic, with possible answers ranging from 'completely agree' to 'completely disagree'. The participants were also evaluated for symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), post-traumatic stress (Impact of Event Scale-Revised) and COVID-19 fear (COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire). RESULTS: In total, 1036 participants (83% women) completed the survey. The results indicated that 37% of participants were losing interest in COVID-19 news, 32% had started avoiding COVID-19 news and 26% had stopped following news about COVID-19. In the multivariate regression analyses, younger age, greater post-traumatic stress symptoms, less fear of COVID-19 and less frequent use of healthcare professionals for COVID-19 information were independent predictors of decreasing/diminished interest and avoidance of COVID-19 news (all P-values <0.005). More frequent use of friends/relatives for COVID-19 information was associated with increasing avoidance and diminished interest in news about COVID-19, while more frequent use of internet news portals for COVID-19 information predicted decreasing/diminished interest in news about COVID-19, independently from other factors considered in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing/diminished interest and avoidance of news about COVID-19 are common and are associated with younger age, greater post-traumatic stress symptoms, less fear of COVID-19 and less frequent use of healthcare professionals for COVID-19 information.","Buneviciene, I; Bunevicius, R; Bagdonas, S; Bunevicius, A",Public Health,433,16

The virus that causes Coronavirus diseases-19 ( COVID-19) is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical manifestations of COVID -19 and complications are evolving. Cardiac, renal, neurologic complication and coagulopathy has been reported in the literature. Here we present a case of spontaneous pneumomediastinum who tested positive for COVID -19 . A 45 years old female who was admitted after a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test-confirmed COVID-19. She was experiencing worsening dyspnea. Initial laboratory investigation showed white blood cells of 7.49 [differential: 80.5% neutrophils and 13.6% lymphocytes]. Procalcitonin was 0.12, lactate dehydrogenase was 701, ferritin was 586, fibrinogen was more than 600, D-dimer was 0.56, CRP was 9.9. Arterial blood gas showed pH 7.44, PCO2 54 mmHg, and PO2 85.7 mmHg on 85% FiO2 heated high flow nasal cannula oxygen. A chest x-ray showed bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities. A diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was made. Despite maximum high flow oxygen patient continues to desaturate and the patient was started on BiPAP with 100% FiO2 with the improvement of hypoxia. The patient continued on Covid specific therapy including dexamethasone. The patient remained BiPAP dependent with intermittent heated high flow nasal cannula with positive pressure support. On the 15-day of hospitalization, the patient noted to have worsening hypoxia, emergent computed tomography angiogram(CTA) of the chest was done which revealed extensive pneumomediastinum. Esophagogram was obtained and esophageal rupture was ruled out. The patient was treated conservatively and monitored for any further complications. On day 43 patient was discharged on 2liter nasal cannula oxygen. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is a rare clinical entity. SPM occurs when the air leak through the small alveolar ruptures into the surrounding bronchovascular sheath. SPM also could result from air leaks from the esophageal or endobronchial rupture. The exact mechanism is unknown but the proposed mechanism is likely via the differential pressure gradient that develops between the Alveoli and lung interstitium. Barotrauma from mechanical ventilation accounts for one-third of the cases of pneumomediastinum. In our case patient was not on mechanical ventilation and esophageal rupture was ruled out by esophagogram, so we believe it is a spontaneous pneumomediastinum. We believe prolonged positive pressure ventilation could lead to rupture of the alveoli in COVID-19 pneumonia, leading to spontaneous pneumomediastinum.","Alam, M.; Hussain, K.; Clagett, C.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,433,16

During the current COVID-19 outbreak, in-person teaching in our institution was not permitted, thus creating a unique challenge for clinical skills teaching. A case-based electronic learning (e-learning) activity was designed to replace the traditional in-person teaching of renal semiology. e-Learning activities have been shown to be effective for knowledge retention and increasing novice learners' performance. However, major knowledge gaps exist concerning the satisfaction of learners with e-learning activities as the sole form of teaching, specifically for undergraduate clinical skills education. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to prospectively assess undergraduate medical students' perceptions of and satisfaction with an e-learning activity teaching renal semiology. METHODS: All second-year medical students (novice learners) from the medical faculty of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, undertook the e-learning activity and were invited to participate in a nonmandatory, validated web-based survey, comprising questions answered using a 10-point Likert scale and one qualitative open-ended question. For comparison and to provide further insights, 17 fourth- to sixth-year students (advanced learners) were prospectively recruited to participate in both the e-learning activity and the evaluation. A mixed methods analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 88 (63%) out of 141 novice learners and all advanced learners responded to the evaluation survey. Advanced learners reported significantly higher satisfaction with the e-learning activity (mean 8.7, SD 1.0 vs mean 7.3, SD 1.8; P<.001), clarity of objectives (mean 9.6, SD 0.8 vs mean 7.7, SD 1.7; P<.001), and attainability of objectives (mean 9.8, SD 0.5 vs mean 7.3, SD 1.3; P<.001). Both groups showed high interest in the inclusion of the activity as part of a blended learning approach; however, there was low interest in the activity being the sole means of teaching. CONCLUSIONS: Case-based e-learning activities might be better suited for advanced learners and could increase learners' satisfaction within a blended teaching instructional design. More research on students' satisfaction with e-learning activities in the field of clinical skills education should be done. In addition, more effort should be put into finding alternative teaching tools for clinical skills education in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future health crises.","Zamberg, Ido; Schiffer, Eduardo; Stoermann-Chopard, Catherine",JMIR Med Educ,433,16

No presente estudo, 21 amostras fecais de vacas leiteiras colhidas durante um surto de disenteria em uma propriedade de Paranapanema no Estado de São Paulo positivas para BCoV foram submetidas a reações de PCR para amplificação parcial dos genes codificadores das proteínas S (448pb) e HE (441pb) do BCoV. Destas amostras, 14 foram positivas para cada PCR (não simultaneamente), sendo os fragmentos amplificados submetidos a seqüenciamento de DNA para reconstrução genealógica por máxima parcimônia através de algoritmo heurístico em conjunto com seqüências homólogas recuperadas do GenBank. Considerando-se o gene S, a identidade de nucleotídeos entre as 14 amostras aqui estudadas foi de 100%, tendo as mesmas segregado em um grupo exclusivo; além disso, demais amostras brasileiras incluídas no estudo segregam em outros dois grupos. Em relação ao gene HE, as 14 amostras estudadas apresentaram identidade de nucleotídeos de 100%, mas a árvore genealógica apresentou topologia pouco resolvida, tendo estas amostras, segregado em grupo politômico com as seqüências homólogas incluídas. Comparações entre os diversos grupos nas árvores do gene S em termos de aminoácidos revelaram marcadores grupo-específicos, com substituições exclusivas para as amostras de BCoV aqui estudadas. Com base nestes resultados, conclui-se que, durante o transcorrer do surto de disenteria de inverno, uma única linhagem de BCoV estava presente, baseado no seqüenciamento parcial dos genes S e HE e que há pelo menos três genótipos de BCoV presentes no Brasil em relação ao gene S e ao menos um em relação ao gene HE, considerando-se as regiões gênicas e as seqüências incluídas no presente estudo","Souza, Sibele Pinheiro de",,433,6

Sources of indoor pollution with particulate matter (PM) are outdoor particles and indoor causes, such as construction materials, the use of cleaning products, air fresheners, heating, cooking, and smoking activities In 2017, according to the Global Burden of Disease study, 1 6 million people died prematurely because of indoor air pollution The health effects of outdoor exposure to PM have been the subject of both research and regulatory action, and indoor exposure to fine particles is gaining more and more attention as a potential source of adverse health effects Moreover, in critical situations such as the current pandemic crisis, to protect the health of the population, patients, and staff in all areas of society (particularly in indoor environments, where there are vulnerable groups, such as people who have pre-existing lung conditions, patients, elderly people, and healthcare professionals such as dental practitioners), there is an urgent need to improve long- and short-term health Exposure to aerosols and splatter contaminated with bacteria, viruses, and blood produced during dental procedures performed on patients rarely leads to the transmission of infectious agents between patients and dental health care staff if infection prevention procedures are strictly followed On the other hand, in the current circumstances of the pandemic crisis, dental practitioners could have an occupational risk of acquiring coronavirus disease as they may treat asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic patients Consequently, an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection could occur in dental offices, both for staff that provide dental healthcare and for other patients, considering that many dental procedures produce droplets and dental aerosols, which carry an infectious virus such as SARS-CoV-2 (2) Types of studies reviewed and applied methodology: The current work provides a critical review and evaluation, as well as perspectives concerning previous studies on health risks of indoor exposure to PM in dental offices The authors reviewed representative dental medicine literature focused on sources of indoor PM10 and PM2 5 (particles for which the aerodynamic diameter size is respectively less than 10 and 2 5 &mu;m) in indoor spaces (paying specific attention to dental offices) and their characteristics and toxicological effects in indoor microenvironments The authors also reviewed representative studies on relations between the indoor air quality and harmful effects, as well as studies on possible indoor viral infections acquired through airborne and droplet transmission The method employed for the research illustrated in the current paper involved a desk study of documents and records relating to occupational health problems among dental health care providers In this way, it obtained background information on both the main potential hazards in dentistry and infection risks from aerosol transmission within dental offices Reviewing this kind of information, especially that relating to bioaerosols, is critical for minimizing the risk to dental staff and patients, particularly when new recommendations for COVID-19 risk reduction for the dental health professional community and patients attending dental clinics are strongly needed (3) Results: The investigated studies and reports obtained from the medical literature showed that, even if there are a wide number of studies on indoor human exposure to fine particles and health effects, more deep research and specific studies on indoor air pollution with fine particles and implications for workers&rsquo;health in dental offices are needed As dental practices are at a higher risk for hazardous indoor air because of exposure to chemicals and microbes, the occupational exposures and diseases must be addressed, with special attention being paid to the dental staff The literature also documents that exposure to fine particles in dental offices can be minimized by putting prevention into practice (perso al protection barriers such as masks, gloves, and safety eyeglasses) and also keeping indoor air clean (e g , high-volume evacuation, the use of an air-room-cleaning system with high-efficiency particulate filters, and regularly maintaining the air-conditioning and ventilation systems) These kinds of considerations are extremely important as the impact of indoor pollution on human health is no longer an individual issue, with its connections representing a future part of sustainability which is currently being redefined These kinds of considerations are extremely important, and the authors believe that a better situation in dentistry needs to be developed, with researchers in materials and dental health trying to understand and explain the impact of indoor pollution on human health","Cocârţă, Diana Mariana Prodana Mariana Demetrescu Ioana Lungu Patricia Elena Maria Didilescu Andreea Cristiana",Sustainability,433,18

This study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on all lifestyle medicine pillars, namely diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, social support and use of risky substances. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on a convenient sample of adults who resided in Cyprus during the Spring 2020 lockdown. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire comprised of six validated tools regarding the following lifestyle behaviours before and during lockdown: adherence to the Mediterranean diet, physical activity, stress and social support levels, sleep pattern and use of risky substances such as smoking and alcohol. Paired before and during lockdown comparisons for each lifestyle pillar were undertaken using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Bowker symmetry Test where response was numerical (non-parametric data) and categorical respectively. Furthermore, stratified analyses for sociodemographic characteristics were performed. RESULTS: Out of 745 participants, 74% were female and median age was 39 years. Overall participants reported significantly higher perceived stress score (22 v 25, p < 0.01), lower social support score (71 v 68, p < 0.001), and worse sleep quality score (4 v 5, p < 0.01) during lockdown. Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence was moderate and increased significantly only in those practicing religious fasting (score of 6 v 7, p < 0.01). Total minutes spent sitting increased (120 v 180, p < 0.01) although overall physical activity score did not significantly change. Smoking intensity increased during lockdown whilst frequency of alcohol consumption decreased (ptrend = 0.03 and < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Various lifestyle factors were adversely affected by the COVID-19 lockdown in Cyprus. Evidence from this study supports development of holistic lifestyle interventions during and following the pandemic to reduce short and long-term NCD risks by building on lifestyle behaviour strengths and addressing longstanding and emerging gaps and needs.","Kolokotroni, Ourania; Mosquera, Maria C; Quattrocchi, Annalisa; Heraclides, Alexandros; Demetriou, Christiana; Philippou, Elena",BMC Public Health,433,16

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) can downregulate RAAS activation by unloading the left ventricle and increasing the cardiac output translating into a better end-organ perfusion improving survival. However, the absence of pulsatility brought about by continuous-flow devices may variably trigger RAAS activation depending on left ventricular (LV) intrinsic contractility, the design and speed of the pump device. Moreover, the concept of myocardial recovery is being tested in clinical trials and in this setting LVAD support combined with intense RAAS inhibition can promote recovery and ensure maintenance of LV function after explantation. Blood pressure control on LVAD recipients is key to avoiding complications as gastrointestinal bleeding, pump thrombosis and stroke. Furthermore, emerging data highlight the role of RAAS antagonists as prevention of arteriovenous malformations that lead to gastrointestinal bleeds. Future studies should focus on the role of angiotensin receptor inhibitors in preventing myocardial fibrosis in patients with LVADs and examine in greater details the target blood pressure for these patients.","Briasoulis, Alexandros; Ruiz Duque, Ernesto; Mouselimis, Dimitrios; Tsarouchas, Anastasios; Bakogiannis, Constantinos; Alvarez, Paulino",J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst,433,20

This period did not involve a change to online teaching. Instead, it involved emergency remote teaching, wherein the content of face-to-face teaching was taught through non-classroom training using media, devices and tools available at that time. The main objective of the paper is related to the perceptions of students and teachers on emergency remote teaching regarding the face-to-face model. We applied statistical techniques of descriptive and inferential analysis over a sample of 2778 students and 221 teaching staff from the University of Cádiz. We also analysed the methodologies used, as well as the acquisition of skills, competencies and knowledge by the students in this situation, in order to detect whether this type of action can achieve sustainable education. This term refers to education that is capable of maintaining the continuous quality of the training of each student, who should acquire the required knowledge and competences regardless of unforeseen events. However, according to the results of this research, the sudden transition to e-learning, based on available technological and computer-based methods, did not guarantee sustainable education or its quality. This study establishes different possibilities for improving non-face-to-face teaching in this kind of situation. The results show greatly concerning levels of training and evaluation, as well as worse acquisition of skills. Both teachers and students declared a preference for face-to-face teaching. This perception should prompt the educational authorities to solve the existing problems in e-learning education, improving the transition and guaranteeing the sustainability of non-face-to-face education. This research highlights the areas for improvement in e-learning education in the ongoing situation, the general uncertainty in the transition, the lack of communication and the completion of a fair evaluation system. The results show that the methods used in this period must be improved to achieve sustainable teaching and learning during a pandemic. The results also emphasize the uncertainty in the educational community about the entire process.

In recent decades, we have witnessed the development of different kinds of mRNAs by sequence optimization to overcome the disadvantage of excessive mRNA immunogenicity, instability and inefficiency. Based on the immunological study, mRNA vaccines are coupled with immunologic adjuvant and various delivery strategies. Except for sequence optimization, the assistance of mRNA-delivering strategies is another method to stabilize mRNAs and improve their efficacy. The understanding of increasing the antigen reactiveness gains insight into mRNA-induced innate immunity and adaptive immunity without antibody-dependent enhancement activity. Therefore, to address the problem, scientists further exploited carrier-based mRNA vaccines (lipid-based delivery, polymer-based delivery, peptide-based delivery, virus-like replicon particle and cationic nanoemulsion), naked mRNA vaccines and dendritic cells-based mRNA vaccines. The article will discuss the molecular biology of mRNA vaccines and underlying anti-virus and anti-tumor mechanisms, with an introduction of their immunological phenomena, delivery strategies, their importance on Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related clinical trials against cancer and viral diseases. Finally, we will discuss the challenge of mRNA vaccines against bacterial and parasitic diseases.","Wang, Yang; Zhang, Ziqi; Luo, Jingwen; Han, Xuejiao; Wei, Yuquan; Wei, Xiawei",Mol Cancer,433,16

(Special Issue: Sport and the coronavirus crisis.),15.354288,3.647912,2020,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is the second leading cause of death for college-aged individuals worldwide and in the United States. Recent studies have identified preliminary evidence of widening disparities in suicidal behaviors across sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status among college students. Few systematic reviews and meta-analyses offer a comprehensive understanding of on-campus and off-campus suicide interventions, nor is collated information available for different types of screening, assessment, treatment, and postvention plans. Further challenges have been identified since the COVID-19 pandemic, calling for cost-effective and innovative interventions to address increased rates of suicidal behaviors among college students facing unprecedented stressors. OBJECTIVE: This research protocol describes the first systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the most effective and cost-effective intervention components for universal and targeted (indicated and selected) suicide prevention among college students in a global context. Special attention will be placed on disparities in suicide prevention across sociodemographic subgroups, inclusive interventions beyond campus, global context, and intervention responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A sensitive search strategy will be executed across MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, PsycINFO (EBSCO), ERIC (EBSCO), Cochrane Library, Dissertations and Theses Global (ProQuest), Scopus, Global Index Medicus, SciELO, African Journals Online, Global Health (CABI), and Google Scholar. Data extraction and evaluation will be conducted by three independent researchers. Risk of bias will be assessed. A multilevel meta-regression model and subgroup analysis will be used to analyze the data and estimate effect sizes. RESULTS: The initial search was completed in December 2020 and updated with additional other-language studies in March 2020. We expect the results to be submitted for publication in mid-2021. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing rates of suicidal behaviors among college students, few preventative efforts have targeted this population, and fewer focus on factors that might place specific demographic groups at heightened risk. The impact of COVID-19 on suicidal behaviors among college students highlights and exacerbates the urgent need for rapid and effective interventions that might differ from traditional approaches. This equity-focused study will address these gaps and provide a valuable analysis of the effectiveness of suicide prevention programs and interventions. Findings will inform clinicians, researchers, policy makers, families, and organizations about evidence-based interventions for reducing the gaps in the suicide crisis among college students from different sociodemographic groups.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 472 HCWs participated from two distinct acute hospital settings, A and B, in the South-East of Ireland. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures of psychological distress-depression, anxiety, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-as dictated by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). An independent sample t-test and a Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine significance of difference in continuous variables between groups. Categorical variables were assessed for significance with a &#967;2 test for independence. RESULTS: The DASS-21 provided independent measures of depression (mean 4.57, IQR 2-7), anxiety (mean 3.87, IQR 1-6) and stress (mean 7.41, IQR 4-10). Positive scores were reflected in 201 workers (42.6%) for depression and 213 (45.1%) for both anxiety and stress. The IES-R measured subjective distress on three subscales: intrusion (mean 1.085, IQR 0.375-1.72), avoidance (mean 1.008, IQR 0.375-1.5) and hyperarousal (mean 1.084, IQR 0.5-1.667). Overall, 195 cases (41.3%) were concerning for PTSD. Site B scored significantly higher across all parameters of depression (5.24 vs 4.08, p<0.01), anxiety (4.66 vs 3.3, p<0.01), stress (8.91 vs 6.33, p<0.01) and PTSD (0.058 vs 0.043, p<0.01). Worse outcomes were also noted in HCWs with underlying medical ailments. CONCLUSION: Psychological distress is prevalent among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic; screening for adverse mental and emotional outcomes and developing timely tailored preventative measures with effective feedback are vital to protect their psychological well-being, both in the immediate and long-term.","Ali, Saied; Maguire, Sinead; Marks, Eleanor; Doyle, Maeve; Sheehy, Claire",BMJ Open,433,29

A 3-year-old boy was admitted with clinical and laboratory findings indicative of NS. Induction therapy with prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) induced complete remission. While tapering the dose, he was infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). He developed a high fever and periorbital edema. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria (protein-creatinine ratio: 6.3 g/gCr). He was transferred to our hospital for the concurrent management of COVID-19 and NS relapse. As proteinuria worsened, the prednisolone dose was increased to 2 mg/kg/day. Proteinuria gradually improved, and remission was noted a week after initiating full-dose steroid treatment. The fever subsided after 2 days without treatment for COVID-19. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody including IgG levels decreased in the early convalescent phase.

RCCs to date were generated in mice, but rats are thought to be optimal for addiction genetic studies. Based on past literature, one inbred Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat substrain, SHR/NCrl, is predicted to exhibit a distinct behavioral profile as it relates to cocaine self-administration traits relative to another substrain, SHR/NHsd. Direct substrain comparisons are a necessary first step before implementing an RCC. We evaluated model traits for cocaine addiction risk and cocaine self-administration behaviors using a longitudinal within-subjects design. Impulsive-like and compulsive-like traits were greater in SHR/NCrl than SHR/NHsd, as were reactivity to sucrose reward, sensitivity to acute psychostimulant effects of cocaine, and cocaine use studied under fixed-ratio and tandem schedules of cocaine self-administration. Compulsive-like behavior correlated with the acute psychostimulant effects of cocaine, which in turn correlated with cocaine taking under the tandem schedule. Compulsive-like behavior also was the best predictor of cocaine seeking responses. Heritability estimates indicated that 22 %-40 % of the variances for the above phenotypes can be explained by additive genetic factors, providing sufficient genetic variance to conduct genetic mapping in F2 crosses of SHR/NCrl and SHR/NHsd. These results provide compelling support for using an RCC approach in SHR substrains to uncover candidate genes and variants that are of relevance to cocaine use disorders.","Kantak, Kathleen M; Stots, Carissa; Mathieson, Elon; Bryant, Camron D",Behav Brain Res,433,26

Thus, when optimal investment and reinsurance strategies have to be determined it is important to consider models which reflect this dependence. In this paper we make a proposal how to generate dependence between the financial market and claim sizes in times of crisis and determine via a stochastic control approach an optimal investment and reinsurance strategy which maximizes the expected exponential utility of terminal wealth. Moreover, we also allow that the claim size distribution may be learned in the model. We give comparisons and bounds on the optimal strategy using simple models. What turns out to be very surprising is that numerical results indicate that even a minimal dependence which is created in this model has a huge impact on the control in the sense that the insurer is much more prudent then.","Bauerle, Nicole; Leimcke, Gregor",,433,1

The envelope (E) protein, one of four structural proteins encoded in the viral genome, is a 75-residue integral membrane protein whose transmembrane domain exhibits ion channel activity and whose cytoplasmic domain participates in protein-protein interactions. These activities contribute to several aspects of the viral replication-cycle, including virion assembly, budding, release, and pathogenesis. Here, we describe the structure and dynamics of full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein in hexadecylphosphocholine micelles by NMR spectroscopy. We also characterized its interactions with four putative ion channel inhibitors. The chemical shift index and dipolar wave plots establish that E protein consists of a long transmembrane helix (residues 8-43) and a short cytoplasmic helix (residues 53-60) connected by a complex linker that exhibits some internal mobility. The conformations of the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain are unaffected by truncation from the intact protein. The chemical shift perturbations of E protein spectra induced by the addition of the inhibitors demonstrate that the N-terminal region (residues 6-18) is the principal binding site. The binding affinity of the inhibitors to E protein in micelles correlates with their antiviral potency in Vero E6 cells: HMA &#8776; EIPA > DMA >> Amiloride, suggesting that bulky hydrophobic groups in the 5' position of the amiloride pyrazine ring play essential roles in binding to E protein and in antiviral activity. An N15A mutation increased the production of virus-like particles, induced significant chemical shift changes from residues in the inhibitor binding site, and abolished HMA binding, suggesting that Asn15 plays a key role in maintaining the protein conformation near the binding site. These studies provide the foundation for complete structure determination of E protein and for structure-based drug discovery targeting this protein.","Park, Sang Ho; Siddiqi, Haley; Castro, Daniela V; De Angelis, Anna A; Oom, Aaron L; Stoneham, Charlotte A; Lewinski, Mary K; Clark, Alex E; Croker, Ben A; Carlin, Aaron F; Guatelli, John; Opella, Stanley J",PLoS Pathog,433,16

So far, CT has emerged as main stay of imaging whereas the local data on radiographic features of COVID-19 is sparse. METHODS: Prospective study includes 402 chest X rays (CXRs) of 105 patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19. The nature of abnormality, distribution and lung zone involvement was documented. Following British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) guidelines, CXRs were grouped into classic/ probable COVID-19, indeterminate, non-COVID-19 and normal categories. The lung involvement was scored according to modified Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) scoring. The follow up radiographs were assessed for disease progression and improvement. RESULTS: Seventy-six males and 29 females with mean age of 50 years were included in our study. 47 out of 105 baseline radiographs were categorized as classic/ probable COVID-19, 26 as indeterminate, 7 as Non-COVID-19 and 25 as normal. 75 patients were positive and 30 were negative on RT-PCR testing. The sensitivity of CXR in diagnosing COVID-19 is 84%. The worsening radiographic features and higher RALE score correlates with longer hospital stay, ICU admissions and mortality. The ground glass opacities and consolidations in peripheral distribution involving bilateral mid and lower zones are the predominant findings of COVID-19 in Pakistani population. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of bilateral peripheral ground glass opacities and consolidations are the cardinal feature of COVID-19 on CXRs. The diagnostic categories described by BSTI correlates with PCR results in Pakistani population. The worsening radiographic findings correspond to poor prognosis;hence serial radiographs can be used for assessing disease course.","Majeed, A. I.; Raza, F.; Riaz, S.

METHOD: Medical charts of 3,032 patients dying with COVID-19 in Italy (368 aged < 65 years and 2,664 aged &#8805;65 years) were revised to extract information on demographics, preexisting comorbidities, and in-hospital complications leading to death. RESULTS: Older adults (&#8805;65 years) presented with a higher number of comorbidities compared to those aged <65 years (3.3 ± 1.9 vs 2.5 ± 1.8, p < .001). Prevalence of ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke, hypertension, dementia, COPD, and chronic renal failure was higher in older patients (&#8805;65 years), while obesity, chronic liver disease, and HIV infection were more common in younger adults (<65 years); 10.9% of younger patients (<65 years) had no comorbidities, compared to 3.2% of older patients (&#8805;65 years).

Rehabilitation interventions can help address the consequences of COVID-19, including medical, physical, cognitive, and psychological problems. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effects of rehabilitation following discharge from hospital for patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The specific aims of this project are to investigate the effects of a 12-week exercise program on pulmonary fibrosis in patients recovering from COVID-19. A further aim will be to examine how Chinese herbal medicines as well as the gut microbiome and its metabolites regulate immune function and possibly autoimmune deficiency in the rehabilitation process. METHODS: In this triple-blinded, randomized, parallel-group, controlled clinical trial, we will recruit adult patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from hospital in Hong Kong and are experiencing impaired lung function and pulmonary function. A total of 172 eligible patients will be randomized into four equal groups: (1) cardiorespiratory exercise plus Chinese herbal medicines group, (2) cardiorespiratory exercise only group, (3) Chinese herbal medicines only group, and (4) waiting list group (in which participants will receive Chinese herbal medicines after 24 weeks). These treatments will be administered for 12 weeks, with a 12-week follow-up period. Primary outcomes include dyspnea, fatigue, lung function, pulmonary function, blood oxygen levels, immune function, blood coagulation, and related blood biochemistry. Measurements will be recorded prior to initiating the above treatments and repeated at the 13th and 25th weeks of the study. The primary analysis is aimed at comparing the outcomes between groups throughout the study period with an &#945; level of .05 (two-tailed). RESULTS: The trial has been approved by the university ethics committee following the Declaration of Helsinki (approval number: REC/19-20/0504) in 2020. The trial has been recruiting patients. The data collection will be completed in 24 months, from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022.

While periodically, alternatives such as government prizes, direct purchases or development, and limits on certain incentives have been proposed, the basic approach has remained intact since the 1980s, with incremental provisions addressing specific gaps and priorities, and adding provisions for biosimilar entry. This paper reviews the main elements of the current US system to financing drug innovation and its approach to balancing multiple objectives. In addition, the system for financing drug innovation must be effective over a wide range of potential scientific approaches and economic conditions. It should be predictable for investors and payers making long-term development and coverage decisions, while also encompassing unanticipated new treatment modalities and scientific progress. An important emerging challenge is posed by clinically transformative, high-investment, single-administration therapies, such as gene therapy.

Another task is inferring the origin of a disease, which is relatively difficult with current mathematical models. Such frameworks -- across varying levels of complexity -- are typically sensitive to input data on epidemic parameters, case-counts and mortality rates, which are generally noisy and incomplete. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a maximum entropy framework that fits epidemiological models, provides a calibrated infection origin probabilities, and is robust to noise due to a prior belief model. Maximum entropy is agnostic to the parameters or model structure used and allows for flexible use when faced with sparse data conditions and incomplete knowledge in the dynamical phase of disease-spread, providing for more reliable modeling at early stages of outbreaks. We evaluate the performance of our model by predicting future disease trajectories in synthetic graph networks and the real mobility network of New York state. In addition, unlike existing approaches, we demonstrate that the method can be used to infer the origin of the outbreak with accurate confidence. Indeed, despite the prevalent belief on the feasibility of contact-tracing being limited to the initial stages of an outbreak, we report the possibility of reconstructing early disease dynamics, including the epidemic seed, at advanced stages.","Ansari, Mehrad; Soriano-Panos, David; Ghoshal, Gourab; White, Andrew D.",,433,16

The sudden halt of business- and public life in Delhi has resulted in a notable reduction in air pollution levels and have caused clearer skies. Images released end of March in newspapers and on the internet show just how big the difference is: blue skies are visible where there is typically thick grey smog. The change in visibility also affects the amount of sunlight reaching the ground. Using methods developed in house, we explore how much insolation has changed as a consequence. In late March 2020, we found that more than 8% more sunlight reached the ground in Delhi than in previous years. In terms of PV energy yield this change is comparable to moving a PV installation from Toronto to Houston.","Peters, I. M.; Brabec, C.; Buonassisi, T.; Hauch, J.; Nobre, A.

The objective of this study is to characterize the clinical dermatological manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection in cases with few or without general symptoms in patients from Latin America. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using a questionnaire that was made for health professionals (physicians with a specialty in dermatology) to investigate dermatological lesions associated with COVID-19 infection in patients from 25 countries of Latin America. The survey was active from June 9 to July 30, 2020. RESULTS: In this study, information was collected from a total of 347 patients. We found a female gender predominance: 179/347 (51.6%). The mean age at presentation was 40.87 years. The most frequent dermatological manifestations were maculopapular rash and urticarial lesions, followed by papulovesicular lesions, vesicular lesions, chilblain-like lesions, papular lesions, ecchymosis, petechial purpura, pityriasis rosea-like lesions, pruritus, palmoplantar dysesthesias, transient livedo, acral necrosis, palpable purpura, livedo racemosa, and retiform purpura. As far as we know, there are no previous reports of pruritus and palmoplantar dysesthesias. CONCLUSIONS: This registry emphasizes skin manifestations as an important criterion for establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in Latin American countries. This information will be useful for the early identification of suspected cases by health professionals (dermatologists and nondermatologists) and will allow contact tracing to mitigate the impact on health systems at different levels.","Ocampo-Candiani, Jorge; Ramos-Cavazos, Cesar Jair; Arellano-Mendoza, Maria Ivonne; Arenas-Guzmán, Roberto; Beirana-Palencia, Angélica; Salmon-Demongin, Alfredo; Welsh-Hernández, Esperanza; Cabo, Horacio A; Gómez-Flores, Minerva; Dominguez-Cherit, Judith; Criado, Paulo Ricardo; Castro-López, Helena; Alfaro-Sánchez, Abraham Benjamin; García-Vargas, Alejandro; Cohen-Sabban, Emilia N; Del Solar, Manuel; Fich, Félix; Galimberti, Gastón; Gatti, Carlos Fernando; López-Estebaranz, José Luis; Lupi, Omar; Olmos-Pérez, Miguel; Pérez-Alfonzo, Ricardo",Int J Dermatol,433,9

METHODS: Twenty-nine healthy infants (14 girls and 15 boys) living at home with their parents in Handan City were followed by survey from birth to 1 year of age, specifically from October 2014 through December 2015. C. difficile isolates were typed by PCR ribotyping and analyzed for the presence of toxin genes. RESULTS: During the follow-up study period in the first year of life, 20 of the 29 total enrolled infants acquired C. difficile. A total of 437 fecal samples were obtained, and 111 (25.4%) samples contained C. difficile, including 79 (71.2%) toxigenic strains. The toxigenic isolates comprised six PCR ribotypes, and two PCR ribotypes were identified as nontoxigenic strains. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that C. difficile colonization increase with age during the 12-month period, and the dominant toxigenic types of C. difficile isolates in infants were those involved in long-term colonization.

Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA plays an important role in immune cell development and regulation of immune activity through yielding diverse transcriptional isoforms to supplement the function of limited genes associated with the immune reaction. In addition, multiple factors have been identified as being involved in the control of alternative splicing at the cis, trans, or co-transcriptional level, and the aberrant splicing of RNA leads to the abnormal modulation of immune activity in infections, immune diseases, and tumors. In this review, we summarize the recent discoveries on the generation of immune-associated alternative splice variants, clinical disorders, and possible regulatory mechanisms.

An inactivated, whole virus vaccine candidate of SARS-CoV-2 has been developed by Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Wuhan Institute of Virology. The low toxicity, immunogenicity, and immune persistence were investigated in preclinical studies using seven different species of animals. The results showed that the vaccine candidate was well tolerated and stimulated high levels of specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Low or no toxicity in three species of animals was also demonstrated in preclinical study of the vaccine candidate. Biochemical analysis of structural proteins and purity analysis were performed. The inactivated, whole virion vaccine was characterized with safe double-inactivation, no use of DNases and high purity. Dosages, boosting times, adjuvants, and immunization schedules were shown to be important for stimulating a strong humoral immune response in animals tested. Preliminary observation in ongoing phase I and II clinical trials of the vaccine candidate in Wuzhi County, Henan Province, showed that the vaccine is well tolerant.

To our knowledge, little is known about how these programs serve this vulnerable population outside the hospital setting. Objective: To assess the safety of a hotel-based isolation and quarantine (I/Q) care system and its association with inpatient hospital capacity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study of a hotel-based I/Q care system for homeless and unstably housed individuals in San Francisco, California, was conducted from March 19 to May 31, 2020. Individuals unable to safely isolate or quarantine at home with mild to moderate COVID-19, persons under investigation, or close contacts were referred from hospitals, outpatient settings, and public health surveillance to 5 I/Q hotels. Of 1009 I/Q hotel guests, 346 were transferred from a large county public hospital serving patients experiencing homelessness. Exposure: A physician-supervised team of nurses and health workers provided around-the-clock support, including symptom monitoring, wellness checks, meals, harm-reduction services, and medications for opioid use disorder. Main Outcomes and Measures: Characteristics of I/Q hotel guests, program retention, county hospital readmissions, and mean length of stay. Results: Overall, the 1009 I/Q hotel guests had a median age of 44 years (interquartile range, 33-55 years), 756 (75%) were men, 454 (45%) were Latinx, and 501 (50%) were persons experiencing sheltered (n = 295) or unsheltered (n = 206) homelessness. Overall, 463 (46%) received a diagnosis of COVID-19; 303 of 907 (33%) had comorbid medical disorders, 225 of 907 (25%) had comorbid mental health disorders, and 236 of 907 (26%) had comorbid substance use disorders. A total of 776 of 955 guests (81%) completed their I/Q hotel stay; factors most strongly associated with premature discontinuation were unsheltered homelessness (adjusted odds ratio, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.6; P < .001) and quarantine status (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6; P = .001). In total, 346 of 549 patients (63%) were transferred from the county hospital; of 113 ineligible referrals, 48 patients (42%) had behavioral health needs exceeding I/Q hotel capabilities. Thirteen of the 346 patients transferred from the county hospital (4%) were readmitted for worsening COVID-19. Overall, direct transfers to I/Q hotels from emergency and outpatient departments were associated with averting many hospital admissions. There was a nonsignificant decrease in the mean hospital length of stay for inpatients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 from 5.5 to 2.7 days from March to May 2020 (P = .11). Conclusions and Relevance: To support persons experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic, San Francisco rapidly and safely scaled a hotel-based model of I/Q that was associated with reduced strain on inpatient capacity.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the epidemiology and clonal relatedness of vanB VREfm from the period 2015-19 and describe the application of a clone-specific vanB VREfm PCR assay for rapid and accurate detection of vanB VREfm in rectal screening samples. METHODS: vanB VREfm were investigated using epidemiological data and WGS data. The SeqSphere+ software was used to analyse MLST and cgMLST, and de novo assemblies were annotated to determine insertion sites for the vanB transposon (Tn1549). A clone-specific vanB VREfm PCR assay was designed to detect the sequence bridging Tn1549 and the E. faecium chromosome (araA2) in the dominant cluster. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-five vanB VREfm isolates were identified, of which 76% were identified in 2019. A dominant cluster (Cluster 1, nâ=â204, 74%), six minor clusters and 15 singletons were identified. All Cluster 1 isolates and six non-Cluster 1 isolates had Tn1549 integrated into araA2. In 2019, the PCR assay would have detected 92% of all rectal screening samples containing vanB VREfm. CONCLUSIONS: vanB VREfm increased due to the introduction and nosocomial transmission of the successful Cluster 1.

Additionally, controversial public health policies implemented by the nation's political leaders have highlighted the socioeconomic inequalities of minorities. Therefore, through multivariate correlational analysis using machine learning techniques and structural equations, we measure whether social determinants are associated with increased infection and death from COVID-19 disease. The PLS least squares regression analysis allowed identifying a significant impact between social determinants and COVID-19 disease through a predictive value of R2 = .916, \b{eta} = .836, p =. 000 (t-value = 66,137) shows that for each unit of increase in social determinants, COVID-19 disease increases by 91.6%. The clustering index used for correlational analysis generated a new data set comprising three groups: C1 Republicans, C2 and C3 Democrats from California, New York, Texas, and Florida. This analysis made it possible to identify the poverty variable as the main risk factor related to the high rates of infection in Republican states and a high positive correlation between the population not insured with a medical plan and high levels of virus contagion in the states of group C3. These findings explain the argument that poverty and lack of economic security put the public or private health system at risk and calamity.","Salas-Guerra, Cesar R.",,433,16

However, long-term neurological consequences have received little interest compared to respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal manifestations. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the potential SARS-CoV-2 neurological injury that could lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A mutualistic relationship between AD and COVID-19 seems to exist. On the one hand, COVID-19 patients seem to be more prone to developing AD. On the other hand, AD patients could be more susceptible to severe COVID-19. In this review, we sought to provide an overview on the relationship between AD and COVID-19, focusing on the potential role of biomarkers, which could represent precious tool for early identification of COVID-19 patients at high risk of developing AD.","Ciaccio, Marcello; Lo Sasso, Bruna; Scazzone, Concetta; Gambino, Caterina Maria; Ciaccio, Anna Maria; Bivona, Giulia; Piccoli, Tommaso; Giglio, Rosaria Vincenza; Agnello, Luisa",,433,2

Transplantation is one of the most affected sectors, as it relies on a variety of services that have been drastically occupied to treat patients affected by COVID-19. With this report from two transplant centers in Italy, we aim to reflect on resource organization, organ allocation, virus testing and transplant service provision during the course of the pandemic and to provide actionable information highlighting advantages and drawbacks.To what extent can we preserve the noble purpose of transplantation in times of increased danger? Strategies to minimize risk exposure to the transplant population and health- workers include systematic virus screening, protection devices, social distancing and reduction of patients visits to the transplant center. While resources for the transplant activity are inevitably reduced, new dilemmas arise to the transplant community: further optimization of time constraints during organ retrievals and implantation, less organs and blood products donated, limited space in the intensive care unit and the duty to maintain safety and outcomes.","Spoletini, Gabriele; Bianco, Giuseppe; Graceffa, Dario; Lai, Quirino",BMC Gastroenterol,433,16

In this document the Italian Sports Medicine Federation (FMSI) makes recommendations for the development and the performance of physical exercise sessions for the general population obliged to stay at home, due to the lockdown caused by the Coronavirus pandemics. Such recommendations are made in terms of intensity, frequency, volume and exercise modality, applying what has already been suggested by the Federation itself in the recent Italian Prescription Guidelines for Physical Activity for Healthy Adults. The proposed reconditioning program suggests the respect of a gradual return to physical activity, starting from at least 30-45 minutes every day up to a total of 150-300 minutes per week, combined with muscle strengthening and flexibility exercises. The intensity of the work must vary according to the individual’s physical conditions and age, recommending activities of moderate intensity for most of the week, with a part of the individual sessions carried out at a higher intensity. If the period of isolation led to an increase in body weight, a return to normal weight is absolutely recommended, combining the returning to an active lifestyle with a controlled diet, moderately low in calories and rich in vitamins and with attention to appropriate hydration. Furthermore, an evaluation by a sports medicine specialist may be useful for a correct classification of health conditions and actual physical possibilities, especially for those with chronic diseases’ risk factors or people over 50 years of age. For people who have been suffering from Covid-19, after the approval of the infectious disease specialist, but before returning to any kind of physical activity, an evaluation by the specialist is certainly advisable.","Casasco, Maurizio; Pigozzi, Fabio; Porcelli, Simone; Beltrami, Gianfranco; Agnello, Luca; Parisi, Attilio; Pecci, Claudio; Pecorelli, Gaia; Scorcu, Marco; Pecorelli, Sergio",Med.

This study sought to determine the association between blunt and penetrating neck injuries on mortality and length of stay, and to identify additional patient and hospital-level characteristics that impact these outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study utilizing the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program database. METHODS: Adult patients (&#8805;18) who sustained traumatic injuries involving the soft tissues of the neck between 2012 and 2016 were eligible. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. Logistic regression and negative binomial models were used to analyze 1) in-hospital mortality and 2) length of stay respectively while adjusting for potential confounders and accounting for clustering at the hospital level. RESULTS: In a cohort of 20,285 patients, the crude mortality rate was lower in those sustaining blunt neck injuries compared to penetrating injuries (4.9% vs. 6.0%, P < .01), while length of hospital stay was similar (median 9.9 vs. 10.2, P = 0.06). In adjusted analysis, blunt neck injuries were associated with a reduced odds of mortality during hospital admission (odds ratio: 0.66, 95% confidence intervals [0.564, 0.788]), as well as significant reductions in length of stay (rate ratio: 0.92, 95% confidence intervals [0.880, 0.954]). CONCLUSIONS: Blunt neck injuries are associated with lower mortality and length of stay compared to penetrating injuries. Areas of future study have been identified, including elucidation of processes of care in specific organs of injury.

Much research has been published on this virus, and discoveries indicate that oxidative stress contributes to the possibility of getting sick from the new SARS-CoV-2. It follows that free radical scavengers may be useful for the treatment of coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19). This report investigates the antioxidant properties of nine antivirals, two anticancer molecules, one antibiotic, one antioxidant found in orange juice (Hesperidin), one anthelmintic and one antiparasitic (Ivermectin). A molecule that is apt for scavenging free radicals can be either an electron donor or electron acceptor. The results I present here show Valrubicin as the best electron acceptor (an anticancer drug with three F atoms in its structure) and elbasvir as the best electron donor (antiviral for chronic hepatitis C). Most antiviral drugs are good electron donors, meaning that they are molecules capable of reduzing other molecules. Ivermectin and Molnupiravir are two powerful COVID-19 drugs that are not good electron acceptors, and the fact that they are not as effective oxidants as other molecules may be an advantage. Electron acceptor molecules oxidize other molecules and affect the conditions necessary for viral infection, such as the replication and spread of the virus, but they may also oxidize molecules that are essential for life. This means that the weapons used to defend us from COVID-19 may also harm us. This study posits the idea that oxide reduction balance may help explain the toxicity or efficacy of these drugs. These results represent a further advance on the road towards understanding the action mechanisms of drugs used as possible treatments for COVID-19. Looking ahead, clinical studies are needed to define the importance of antioxidants in treating COVID-19.","Martínez, Ana",Antioxidants,433,21

For suppression of the spread of the virus infection among people, a procedure to inactivate virus in saliva may be useful, because saliva of infected persons is the major origin of droplets and aerosols that mediate viral transmission to nearby persons. We previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly and remarkably inactivated by treatment in vitro with tea including green tea, roasted green tea, oolong tea and black tea. Tea catechin-derived compounds including theaflavins (TFs) with (a) galloyl moiety(ies) showed this activity. Although black tea is popularly consumed worldwide, a lot of people consume it with sugar, milk, lemon juice, and so on. But it has not been determined whether these ingredients may influence the inactivation effect of black tea against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has not been revealed whether black tea is capable of inactivating variant viruses such as delta variant. Here we examined the effect of black tea on some variants in the presence or absence of sugar, milk, and lemon juice in vitro. Black tea and galloylated TFs remarkably inactivated alpha, gamma, delta and kappa variants. Intriguingly, an addition of milk but not sugar and lemon juice totally prevented black tea from inactivating alpha and delta variant viruses. The suppressive effect was also exerted by milk casein. These results suggest the possibility that intake of black tea without milk by infected persons may result in inactivation of the virus in saliva and attenuation of spread of SARS-CoV-2 to nearby persons through droplets. Clinical studies are required to investigate this possibility.","Ohgitani, Eriko; Shin-Ya, Masaharu; Ichitani, Masaki; Kobayashi, Makoto; Takihara, Takanobu; Saito, Motoki; Kinugasa, Hitoshi; Mazda, Osam",,433,5

Consequently, the need to interpret longitudinal positive SARS-CoV-2 (SCV-2) tests is crucial in guiding clinical decisions regarding infection control precautions and treatment. Although quantitative tests are not routinely used diagnostically, standard diagnostic RT-PCR tests yield Ct values that are inversely correlated with RNA quantity. In this study, we performed a retrospective review of 72,217 SCV-2 PCR positive tests and identified 264 patients with longitudinal positivity prior to vaccination and VOC circulation. Patients with longitudinal positivity fell into two categories: short-term (207, 78%) or prolonged (57, 22%) positivity, defined as <= 28 (range 1-28, median 16) days and >28 (range 29-152, median 41) days, respectively. In general, Ct values declined over time in both groups; however, 11 short-term positive patients had greater amounts of RNA detected at their terminal test compared to the first positive, and 5 patients had RNA detected at Ct < 35 at least 40 days after initial infection. Oscillating positive and negative results occurred in both groups, although oscillation was seen three times more frequently in prolonged-positive patients. Patients with prolonged positivity had diverse clinical characteristics but were often critically ill and were discharged to high-level care or deceased (22%). Overall, this study demonstrates that caution must be emphasized when interpreting Ct values as a proxy for infectivity, predictor of severity, or a guide for patient care decisions in the absence of additional clinical context.","Hawken, Shawn E.; Sellers, Subhashini A.; Smedberg, Jason R.; Ward, Jeremy D.; Whinna, Herbert C.; Fischer, William A.; Miller, Melissa B.",,433,29

However, the small sample size of infected patients enrolled in most studies did not allow to draw robust conclusions on the COVID-19 impact in PD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess whether the prevalence and outcome of COVID-19 in PD patients are different from those observed in the general population. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting data on PD patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (PD-COVID+). We extracted prevalence, clinical-demographic data, outcome, and mortality. We also analyzed risk or protective factors based on comparisons between PD-COVID+ and control populations with PD without COVID-19 or without PD with COVID-19. RESULTS: We included 16 studies reporting on a total of 11,325 PD patients, 1,061 with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median infection prevalence ranged from 0.6% to 8.5%. PD-COVID+ patients had a median age of 74 and a disease duration of 9.4 years. Pooling all PD-COVID+ patients from included studies, 28.6% required hospitalization, 37.1% required levodopa dose increasing, and 18.9% died. The case fatality was higher in PD-COVID+ patients than the general population, with longer PD duration as a possible risk factor for worse outcome. Amantadine and vitamin D were proposed as potential protective factors. CONCLUSION: Available studies indicate a higher case fatality in PD patients affected by COVID-19 than the general population. Conversely, current literature does not definitively clarify whether PD patients are more susceptible to get infected. The potential protective role of vitamin D and amantadine is intriguing but deserves further investigation.","Artusi, Carlo Alberto; Romagnolo, Alberto; Ledda, Claudia; Zibetti, Maurizio; Rizzone, Mario Giorgio; Montanaro, Elisa; Bozzali, Marco; Lopiano, Leonardo",J Parkinsons Dis,433,20

Despite the concerning epidemiological burden, many people, including some policymakers, are underestimating this pandemic and are remaining enigmatically inactive against a human pathology which, for a combination of reasons, can be reasonably defined as a perfect storm (i.e., the ""wrong virus"" at the ""wrong time""). These many paradigmatic aspects include SARS-CoV-2 structure and peculiar biology of infection, high risk of inter-human transmission, long incubation time combined with early and sustained viral load, existence of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic carriers, viral shedding for days after symptom relief, unfavorable progression towards respiratory distress and death in up to 5-10% of patients thus causing dramatic healthcare challenges, as well as environmental contamination. Last but not least, the combination of the current case fatality rate with the extraordinary number of people that could be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 would permit to estimate that the worldwide deaths for COVID-19 may even approximate those recorded during World War II if appropriate restrictive measures for preventing human-to-human transmission are not readily undertaken.

AIMS: We sought to review the current knowledge of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly those deemed VOC/Is: B.1.351, B.1.1.7, and P.1. SOURCES: MEDLINE and BioRxiv databases, as well as the grey literature, were searched for reports of SARS-CoV-2 variants since November 2020. Relevant articles and their references were screened. CONTENT: Mutations on the spike protein in particular may affect both affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor ACEII and antibody binding. These VOC/Is often share similar mutation sets. The N501Y mutation is shared by the three main VOCs: B.1.1.7, first identified in the United Kingdom, P.1, originating from Brazil, and B.1.351, first described in South Africa. This mutation likely increases transmissibility by increasing affinity for ACEII. The B.1.351 and P.1 variants also display the E484K mutation which decreases binding of neutralizing antibodies, leading to partial immune escape; this favours reinfections, and decreases the in vitro efficacy of some antibody therapies or vaccines. Those mutations may also have phenotypical repercussions of greater severity. Furthermore, the accumulation of mutations poses a diagnostic risk (lowered when using multiplex assays), as seen for some assays targeting the S gene. With ongoing surveillance, many new VOC/Is have been identified. The emergence of the E484K mutation independently in different parts of the globe may reflect the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans against a background of increasing immunity. IMPLICATIONS: These VOC/Is are increasing in frequency globally and pose challenges to any herd immunity approach to managing the pandemic. While vaccination is ongoing, vaccine updates may be prudent. The virus continues to adapt to transmission in humans, and further divergence from the initial Wuhan sequences is expected.","Boehm, Erik; Kronig, Ilona; Neher, Richard A; Eckerle, Isabella; Vetter, Pauline; Kaiser, Laurent",Clin. microbiol. infect,433,16

While a detailed longer-term diffusion path of the new virus cannot be anticipated for individual countries, one may anticipate international supply shocks and declining GDP growth in many OECD countries and China in 2020; and one should expect falling asset prices in Asia, the United States and the European Union plus the United Kingdom – except for the price of risk-free government bonds. In the course of 2020/21 the US, the EU and the UK, as well as other countries, will face both an increasing number of infected patients as well as a higher case fatality ratio. Health care expenditures in the US could increase more than in the Eurozone and the EU in the medium term, a development that undermines the international competitiveness of the United States. The analysis suggests that per capita income is a positive function of the effective trade openness and of the new Global Health Security Index indicator from the NTI/Johns Hopkins University. A rising health care-GDP ratio in the US is equivalent to a rising US export tariff. As regards the coronavirus challenge, the ratio of acute care beds to the elderly in OECD countries shows considerable variation. Due to international tourism contraction alone, output growth in the Eurozone, the US and China can be expected to fall by about 1.6% in 2020. The COVID-19 challenge for the US Trump Administration is a serious one, since the lack of experts in the Administration will become more apparent in such a systemic stress situation – and this might well affect the November 2020 US presidential election which, in turn, would itself have considerable impacts on the UK and the EU27 as well as EU-UK trade negotiations. Integrating the health care sector into macroeconomics, which should include growth analysis, is an important task.

Evidence regarding cross-neutralizing response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. However, other previous coronaviruses may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection, since they are phylogenetically related and share the same target receptor. Further, the seroconversion of IgM and IgG occurs at around 12 days post onset of symptoms and most patients have neutralizing titers on days 14-20, with great titer variability. Neutralizing antibodies correlate positively with age, male sex, and severity of the disease. Moreover, the use of convalescent plasma has shown controversial results in terms of safety and efficacy, and due to the variable immune response among individuals, measuring antibody titers before transfusion is mostly required. Similarly, cellular immunity seems to be crucial in the resolution of the infection, as SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells circulate to some extent in recovered patients. Of note, the duration of the antibody response has not been well established yet.","Chvatal-Medina, Mateo; Mendez-Cortina, Yorjagis; Patiño, Pablo J; Velilla, Paula A; Rugeles, Maria T",Front Immunol,433,24

We estimated tactile feet sole sensibility through graduated monofilament light touch applied at several hotspots of both feet soles, covering the toes, metatarsal heads, midfoot internal and lateral arches, and heel. Intergroup comparisons per foot sole region indicated significantly lower sensibility for the group with morbid obesity under the fifth and third metatarsal heads, midfoot lateral and internal arches and heel. We found a large variation across the sole regions, with the lowest difference between the obese and lean groups observed under the hallux (18%) and the largest difference observed under the lateral arch of the midfoot (76%). Correlation analyses between body weight and sensibility scores revealed a significant positive correlation among participants who were leaner (rs = 0.56, p = 0.05) but not among participants who were obese (rs = -0.06, p = 0.83). Mainly, our results showed that morbid obesity was associated with significantly higher cutaneous sensibility thresholds, with large variability of the sensibility deficit across different regions of both feet soles. Due to its functional relevance for body balance control, reduced sensibility thresholds among women who are morbidly obese may have implications for stance stability.","Bueno, Jair Wesley Ferreira; Coelho, Daniel Boari; Souza, Caroline Ribeiro de; Teixeira, Luis Augusto",Percept Mot Skills,433,13

However, in terms of the mathematical formulation of the corresponding problems, one of the major challenges is coming from the fact that corresponding stochastic processes should, in most cases, be considered in bounded domains, possibly with obstacles. This has been known for a long time and yet, very little has been done for the quantification of uncertainties in modelling complex behavioral systems described by such stochastic processes. In this paper, we address this challenge by considering a coupled system of Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equations (SDEs) describing interactions between active and passive participants of a mixed-population group. In developing a multi-fidelity modelling methodology for such behavioral systems, we combine low- and high-fidelity results obtained from (a) the solution of the underlying coupled system of SDEs and (b) simulations with a statistical-mechanics-based lattice gas model, where we employ a kinetic Monte Carlo procedure. Furthermore, we provide representative numerical examples of healthcare systems, subject to an epidemic, where the main focus in our considerations is given to an interacting particle system of asymptomatic and susceptible populations.","Thieu, Thi Kim Thoa; Melnik, Roderick",,433,22

En l’absence de traitement efficace pour endiguer cette dernière, l’accent doit être mis sur les moyens de prévention : gestes barrières, dépistage, signalement et enfin vaccination. Le Service de Maladies Infectieuses comprenant l’activité Centre de Vaccination (CDV), peut se mobiliser pour mettre en place des actions de prévention. Matériels et méthodes Le CDV agit sur un territoire avec de fortes inégalités d’accès à la santé, tant sur le plan géographique que social. Nous avons adapté l’offre de soins en « allant vers » les populations avec mise en place des interventions de prévention. Une équipe mobile, le plus souvent infirmier et médecin, se déplace vers un site à la demande d’un partenaire (institution, association) permettant de délocaliser l’activité de prévention vers ce lieu (dépistage, vaccination). Dotée d’un camping-car médicalisé, l’équipe est autonome. La priorité est d’identifier des lieux dans lesquels la précarité, l’éloignement géographique ou les réticences représentent une entrave au dépistage et/ou à la vaccination. Fort d’une expérience de 12 ans, le service a adapté ces actions à la prévention du virus COVID 19, afin de répondre à l’afflux massif de touristes débordant les structures de dépistage existantes ou de palier à la limite du nombre de centres de vaccination autorisé. L’organisation de ces actions s’est déroulée sur 2 périodes, d’août à octobre 2020 et de février à aujourd’hui en proposant le dépistage par PCR et la vaccination. Résultats Les actions de dépistage par PCR ont permis de dépister 439 personnes dans 6 lieux stratégiques en mobilisant une équipe composée de 3 personnels soignants. Ces équipes ont parcouru le département à la rencontre de publics divers: touristes sur des plages ou des lieux de forte affluence touristique (village, port), lieux libertins, parkings. Les actions de vaccination Covid 19 HLM ont été mises en place par l’intermédiaire de partenariats avec les mairies de communes reculées, en collaboration avec l’agence régionale de santé (ARS) et la préfecture. À ce jour, 4 communes ont bénéficié de ce type d’actions et 340 personnes ont pu avoir accès à la vaccination complète anti-Covid 19. Elles ont concerné surtout des personnes âgées. Le succès de ces campagnes de vaccination réside dans l’implication des partenaires, l’organisation anticipée de la séance et l’adaptabilité des équipes. Un document tutoriel de référence a été rédigé afin d’accompagner les partenaires pour la mise en place de ces actions. Ces actions sont étendues aux structures médico-sociales accueillant des publics précaires éligibles à la vaccination. Conclusion La pandémie amplifie les inégalités d’accès à la santé et les situations critiques où les interventions HLM sont pertinentes. Notre expérience montre la transférabilité de ces actions (dépistage et vaccination) lors d’une situation épidémique sur un territoire très exposé. Par ailleurs ce type d’action de proximité renforce une communication positive autour des moyens de prévention du virus COVID-19 et notamment par rapport à la vaccination.","Ruffin, M.; Roy, M.; Eden, A.; Cornaglia, J.; Aumaître, H.",Infectious Diseases Now,433,6

The author shows that the experience of the European social paradigm has been carefully studied in the Latin American region in the past, and is taken into account nowadays, when all the coun-Tries over the planet are faced with the dramatic consequences of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. In addition to a deep economic shock, other problems are attributed to the characteristics of the current cycle (sometimes referred to as ""neo-normal"") such as welfare loss and deepening social inequalities. Complicated social environment objectively forces the governments on both sides of the Atlantic to search for medium term strategies for social protection of the most vulnerable strata of society. There is an acute issue of the State's ability to cope with the consequences of the pandemic crisis, to find ways for economic recovery and overcoming social difficulties that have arisen. The hypothesis is put forward that Transatlantic interaction in the field of social policy will help to find more effective measures for solving some social problems in Latin American region. © 2021 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

Based on a participant survey and our own experience, we found that e-conferences are relatively easy to organize with readily-available and free tools, that they are more accessible and thus inclusive than physical meetings, and that they are virtually carbon-free which can contribute to large emission savings. Three important success factors are attracting a good set of speakers, building an interested audience, and reaching your objectives and desired impact. A successful e-conference can enable joint learning among speakers and participants, and allows novel ways of disseminating scientific knowledge while also enabling networking for the many participants who might not be able to attend an in-person event.","Veldhuizen, Linda JL; Slingerland, Maja; Barredo, Lauren; Giller, Ken E",Outlook Agric.,433,1

Moreover, students' socioeconomic status and demographic variables were examined. Partial least square modeling and cluster analysis were performed on the survey data collected from 695 students. The findings show that mental load and mental effort were positively related to academic burnout, which was significantly negatively associated with student engagement in online learning. Digital competence did not directly affect academic burnout, but indirectly via its counteracting effect on cognitive load. However, help-seeking and agency were not found to be significantly negatively related to cognitive load. Among the three SDT constructs, digital competence demonstrated the greatest positive influence on student engagement. In addition, female students from humanities and social sciences disciplines and lower-income families seemed to demonstrate the weakest digital competence, lowest learning agency, and least help-seeking behaviors. Consequently, they were more vulnerable to high cognitive load and academic burnout, leading to the lowest learning engagement. This study contributes to the ongoing arguments related to the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and informs the development of efficient interventions that preserve university students' psychological well-being in online learning.","Wang, X.; Zhang, R.; Wang, Z.; Li, T.",Frontiers in Psychology,433,16

Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of endolysin, colistin and a combination of endolysin and colistin were determined, and the antimicrobial activity of each treatment was confirmed by time kill curves. Endolysin ElyA1 displayed activity against all 25 strains of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa tested and against 13 out of 17 strains of K. pneumoniae. Endolysin ElyA2 did not display any such activity. The combined antimicrobial activity of colistin and ElyA1 yielded a reduction in the colistin MIC for all strains studied, except K. pneumoniae. These results were confirmed in vivo in G. mellonella survival assays and in murine skin and lung infection models. In conclusion, combining colistin (1/4 MIC) with the new endolysin ElyA1 (350 µg) enhanced the bactericidal activity of colistin in both in vitro and in vivo studies.

The Milnor-Wood inequality is for circle bundles over surfaces, whereas the Mather-Thurston Theorem is about cobording general manifold bundles to ones admitting a flat connection. The surprise comes from the close encounter with obstructions from Chern-Weyl theory and other smooth obstructions such as the Bott classes and the Godbillion-Vey invariant. Contradiction is avoided because the structure groups for the positive results are larger than required for the obstructions, e.g.\ $\operatorname{PSL}(2,\R)$ versus $\operatorname{U}(1)$ in the former case and $C^1$ versus $C^2$ in the latter. This paper adds two types of control strengthening the positive results: In many cases we are able to (1) refine the Mather-Thurston cobordism to a semi-$s$-cobordism (ssc) and (2) provide detail about how, and to what extent, transition functions must wander from an initial, small, structure group into a larger one. The motivation is to lay mathematical foundations for a physical program. The philosophy is that living in the IR we cannot expect to know, for a given bundle, if it has curvature or is flat, because we can't resolve the fine scale topology which may be present in the base, introduced by a ssc, nor minute symmetry violating distortions of the fiber. Small scale, UV,""distortions""of the base topology and structure group allow flat connections to simulate curvature at larger scales. The goal is to find a duality under which curvature terms, such as Maxwell's $F \wedge F^\ast$ and Hilbert's $\int R\ dvol$ are replaced by an action which measures such""distortions.""In this view, curvature results from renormalizing a discrete, group theoretic, structure.","Freedman, Michael",,433,2

This study identifies organizational factors that promoted successful implementation of telehealth and adoption of ""no test"" medication abortion protocols. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted 21 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with health care providers and clinic administrators implementing clinician-supported telehealth abortion during the COVID pandemic. We selected 15 clinical sites to represent 4 different practice settings: independent primary care practices, online medical services, specialty family planning clinics, and primary care clinics within multispecialty health systems. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research guided our thematic analysis. RESULTS: Successful implementation of telehealth abortion included access to formal and informal inter-organizational networks, including professional organizations and informal mentorship relationships with innovators in the field; organizational readiness for implementation, such as having clinic resources available for telehealth services like functional electronic health records and options for easy-to-use virtual patient-provider interactions; and motivated and effective clinic champions. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the need to offer remote clinical services, 4 different practice settings types leveraged key operational factors to facilitate successful implementation of telehealth abortion. Information from this study can inform implementation strategies to support the dissemination and adoption of this model. IMPLICATIONS: Examples of successfully implemented telehealth medication abortion services provide a framework that can be used to inform and implement similar patient-centered telehealth models in diverse practice settings.","Godfrey, Emily M; Fiastro, Anna E; Jacob-Files, Elizabeth A; Coeytaux, Francine M; Wells, Elisa S; Ruben, Molly R; Sanan, Sajal S; Bennett, Ian M",Contraception,433,20

Results: The correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of mortality for COVID-19 per 100,000 on Sep. 17, 2020 in different regions of the Russian Federation is 0.68 (0.55,0.78). The region with both the highest COVID-19 mortality rate per 100,000 and the highest CFR (lowest detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection) is the city of St. Petersburg. Conclusions: Detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the factors that affects levels of mortality from COVID-19. Regions of the Russian Federation with relatively low detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g. those regions for which case-fatality ratio is below the median value of 1.2% for the case-fatality ratio in different regions of the Russian Federation on Sep. 17, 2020 [3]) ought to increase testing for SARS-CoV-2 in order to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and diminish the related mortality.","Goldstein, Edward",,433,3

This has been particularly important since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, because reducing patient contact can also help to minimise transmission of COVID-19 to outpatients who are at a high risk of COVID-19-triggered complications. In this retrospective study, the clinical effectiveness of intravenous (IV) infusion of flucloxacillin using an elastomeric device was explored in a convenience sample of patients. Patients with three primary infective diagnoses-bloodstream infection, non-vertebral osteomyelitis and vertebral osteomyelitis-were included in the analyses. In non-vertebral osteomyelitis patients, Accufuser antibiotic infusion shortened the course of OPAT care relative to standard antibiotic administration (p<.05). In contrast, in vertebral osteomyelitis patients, it prolonged the course of OPAT care relative to standard administration (p<.05). In patients with bloodstream infections, no significant difference was found between the treatment modes (p=.93). Thus, the clinical effectiveness of Accufuser antibiotic infusion varies among patients with different infective diagnoses, and there seems to be a complex relationship between the method of antibiotic delivery and the patient's condition.","Zhang, Yuhan; Ody, Yun Chun; Davis, Linsey",Br J Community Nurs,433,16

The risk factors for death were attributed to advanced age and comorbidities but have not been accurately defined.Objectives: To report the clinical features of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 in two hospitals in Wuhan.Methods: Medical records were collected of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 between January 9, 2020, and February 15, 2020. Information recorded included medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computed tomographic scans, and clinical management.Measurements and Main Results: The median age of the patients was 65.8 years, and 72.9% were male. Common symptoms were fever (78 [91.8%]), shortness of breath (50 [58.8%]), fatigue (50 [58.8%]), and dyspnea (60 [70.6%]). Hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease were the most common comorbidities. Notably, 81.2% of patients had very low eosinophil counts on admission. Complications included respiratory failure (80 [94.1%]), shock (69 [81.2%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (63 [74.1%]), and arrhythmia (51 [60%]), among others. Most patients received antibiotic (77 [90.6%]), antiviral (78 [91.8%]), and glucocorticoid (65 [76.5%]) treatments. A total of 38 (44.7%) and 33 (38.8%) patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and IFN-&#945;2b, respectively.Conclusions: In this depictive study of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19, most cases were males aged over 50 years with noncommunicable chronic diseases. The majority of the patients died of multiple organ failure. Early onset of shortness of breath may be used as an observational symptom for COVID-19 exacerbations. Eosinophilopenia may indicate a poor prognosis. A combination of antimicrobial drugs did not offer considerable benefit to the outcome of this group of patients.","Du, Yingzhen; Tu, Lei; Zhu, Pingjun; Mu, Mi; Wang, Runsheng; Yang, Pengcheng; Wang, Xi; Hu, Chao; Ping, Rongyu; Hu, Peng; Li, Tianzhi; Cao, Feng; Chang, Christopher; Hu, Qinyong; Jin, Yang; Xu, Guogang",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,433,32

Sixty-three COVID-19 patients and 43 non-COVID-19 patients with similar clinical phenotypes and/or imaging findings were enrolled to test the levels of KL-6 using chemiluminescent immunoassay. In addition, the blood gas, imaging and lymphocyte factors tests were collected from all participants. The data was finally analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed KL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients were higher than those in non-COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). Moreover, the KL-6 levels in severe and critically severe patients were significantly upregulated compared with patients with mild and common type (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the imaging evaluation showed a significant correlation between KL-6 and pulmonary lesion area (P < 0.05). KL-6 was also found to be significantly correlated with oxygenation index and oxygen partial pressure difference of alveolar artery (PA-aDO2) (Both P < 0.01). In conclusion, KL-6 could be an indicator to evaluate the progression of COVID-19, which is parallel to the level of lung injury and inflammation in patients. Moreover, it can also reflect the pulmonary ventilation function.","Xue, Mingshan; Zheng, Peiyan; Bian, Xiqing; Huang, Zhifeng; Huang, Huimin; Zeng, Yifeng; Hu, Haisheng; Liu, Xiaoqing; Zhou, Luqian; Sun, Baoqing; Wu, Jian-Lin; Zhong, Nanshan",Biosci Trends,433,24

In this study, the aim was to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D levels and clinical severity and inflammation markers in children and adolescents with COVID-19. The clinical and laboratory records of 103 pediatric cases with COVID-19, whose vitamin D levels had been measured, were retrospectively reviewed. The cases were divided into groups according to their clinical severity (asymptomatic, mild, and moderate-to-severe) and vitamin D levels. The moderate-to-severe clinical group had significantly higher inflammation markers (CRP, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, D-dimer) and a lower lymphocyte count compared to both the mild and asymptomatic groups. The 25 OH vitamin D levels were also significantly lower (p < 0.001), and the ratio of vitamin D deficiency was 70.6% in the moderate-to-severe group. The vitamin D-deficient group had a significantly higher age and fibrinogen levels while also having a lower lymphocyte count compared to the insufficient and normal groups. The 25 OH vitamin D level was correlated positively with the lymphocyte count (r = 0.375, p = <0.001), and negatively with age (r = -0.496, p = <0.001), CRP (r = -0.309, p = 0.002) and fibrinogen levels (r = -0.381, p = <0.001). In a logistic regression analysis, vitamin D deficiency, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels on admission were independent predictors of severe clinical course.Conclusion: This study revealed an association between vitamin D deficiency and clinical severity, in addition to inflammation markers in pediatric COVID-19 cases. Prophylactic vitamin D supplementation may be considered, especially in the adolescent age group. What is Known: â¢ â¢ The pathology of COVID-19 involves a complex interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system. Hyperinflammation/cytokine storm is held responsible for the severity of the disease. â¢ Vitamin D has multiple roles in the immune system that can modulate the body reaction to an infection. What is New: â¢ â¢ Clinically more severe group had significantly lower vit D levels and significantly higher inflammation markers. â¢ Lower 25 OH vit D levels were associated with higher inflammation markers, suggesting an important role of vitamin D in the clinical course of COVID-19 in children and adolescents probably by regulating the systemic inflammatory response.","Bayramoglu, Elvan; Akkoç, Gülsen; Agbas, Ayse; Akgün, Özlem; Yurdakul, Kamer; Selçuk Duru, Hatice Nilgün; Elevli, Murat",Eur. j. pediatr,433,25

We need less contact with each other to decrease the chance of infection, but this means loss of economic activity, as well. This tradeoff is inevitable in our society, because we still need direct communication and commuting, so far. The focus of our paper is the structure of society, on which we have direct contacts. We study on spreading process with artificial sosiety model, where each agent has daily cycle and go office and back home, every day. At the same time, infection spreads along SIR model. We show both slow infection and short commuting can be realized with some structures and vice versa. The most effective factor for such features is modularity of society. In highly modular society, agents live around the destined office, but agents commute long way to their office and can be infected fast, in not modular society. The first infection point is one more factor for the features. If the first infection takes place around the office, infection spreads slower. On the contrary, if the first one takes place far away from the office, infection can be fast. We show a design principle, high modularity and sparsely distributed offices, for good society and discuss on possible solutions in real society, where we live in.","Nakazato, Kenichi; Takano, Masanori",,433,16

In 2020, a large fraction of the global population was impacted by restrictions to contain the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, a period characterised by marked health risks and behavioural changes. Here we explore whether people responded to this stressor by spending more time in nature and investigate the reasons for any changes. We surveyed 1,002 people in Brisbane, Australia in 2020, to measure the change in use of green space during the restrictions period and benefits people associated with visiting them. About 36% of participants increased their urban green space use, but 26% reduced it, indicating a great deal of flux. Furthermore, 45% of the previous non-users of urban green space began using it for the first time during the restrictions period. Older people were less likely to increase their green space use and those with a backyard were more likely to increase their use of green spaces. Participants' change in use occurred regardless of the amount of green space available in close proximity to their households. In addition, we did not find a relationship between nature-relatedness and change in use. People's reasons for green space use shifted during the pandemic-related restrictions period, with many emphasising improvement of personal well-being rather than consolidating community capital. Most participants indicated an increase in the importance of the psychological and physical benefits obtained from urban green spaces. We conclude that increased urban green space use during moments of stress such as the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to ameliorate some of the negative effects of the stressor, but that the capacity and desire to spend more time in green space varies markedly across society. Sufficient urban green space provision for all sections of society will maximise the opportunity to employ a nature-based coping mechanism during times of personal or community stress. © 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: This was a cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital between 25th February and 6th April 2020 (NCT04318366). We considered secondary bloodstream infections (BSIs) or possible lower respiratory tract infections (pLRTIs) occurring 48 hours after hospital admission until death or discharge. We calculated multivariable Fine-Gray models to assess factors associated with risk of secondary infections. RESULTS: Among 731 patients, a secondary infection was diagnosed in 68 patients (9.3%); 58/731 patients (7.9%) had at least one BSI and 22/731 patients (3.0%) at least one pLRTI. The overall 28-day cumulative incidence was 16.4% (95%CI 12.4-21.0%). Most of the BSIs were due to Gram-positive pathogens (76/106 isolates, 71.7%), specifically coagulase-negative staphylococci (53/76, 69.7%), while among Gram-negatives (23/106, 21.7%) Acinetobacter baumanii (7/23, 30.4%) and Escherichia coli (5/23, 21.7%) predominated. pLRTIs were caused mainly by Gram-negative pathogens (14/26, 53.8%). Eleven patients were diagnosed with putative invasive aspergillosis. At multivariable analysis, factors associated with secondary infections were low baseline lymphocyte count (&#8804;0.7 versus >0.7 per 109/L, subdistribution hazard ratios (sdHRs) 1.93, 95%CI 1.11-3.35), baseline PaO2/FiO2 (per 100 points lower: sdHRs 1.56, 95%CI 1.21-2.04), and intensive-care unit (ICU) admission in the first 48 hours (sdHR 2.51, 95%CI 1.04-6.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a high incidence of secondary infections.

However, the distribution and zoonotic potential of Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. in these animals remain unclear. METHODS: A total of 889 fecal specimens were collected in this study from farmed masked palm civets in Hainan, Guangdong, Jiangxi and Chongqing, southern China, and analyzed for these pathogens by nested PCR and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Altogether, 474 (53.3%), 34 (3.8%) and 1 (0.1%) specimens were positive for E. bieneusi, G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium sp., respectively. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of 11 novel E. bieneusi genotypes named as PL1-PL11 and two known genotypes Peru8 and J, with PL1 and PL2 accounting for 90% of E. bieneusi infections. Phylogenetically, PL4, PL5, PL9, PL10 and PL11 were clustered into Group 1, while PL1, PL2, PL3, PL6, PL7 and PL8 were clustered into Group 2. Assemblage B (n = 33) and concurrence of B and D (n = 1) were identified among G. duodenalis-positive animals. Further multilocus genotyping of assemblage B has revealed that all 13 multilocus genotypes in civets formed a cluster related to those from humans. The Cryptosporidium isolate from one civet was identified to be genetically related to the Cryptosporidium bamboo rat genotype II.

In order to protect public health, states have limited a number of fundamental human rights that individuals have in accordance with national constitutions and international conventions. The focus of this paper is the right of access to abortion in the Member States of the European Union. In Europe, the situation with regard to the recognition of women's right to abortion is quite clear. All member states of the European Union, with the exception of Poland and Malta, recognize the rather liberal right of a woman to have an abortion in a certain period of time after conception. However, Malta and Poland, as members of the European Union, since abortion is seen as a service, must not hinder the travel of women abroad to have an abortion, nor restrict information on the provision of abortion services in other countries. In 2020, a pandemic highlighted all the weaknesses of this regime by preventing women from traveling to more liberal countries to perform abortions, thus calling into question their right to choose and protect their sexual and reproductive rights. This is not only the case in Poland and Malta, but also in countries that recognize the right to abortion but make it conditional on certain non-medical conditions, such as compulsory counselling;and the mandatory time period between applying for and performing an abortion;in situations present in certain countries where the problem of a woman exercising the right to abortion is a large number of doctors who do not provide this service based on their right to conscience. The paper is divided into three parts. The aim of the first part of the paper is to consider all the legal difficulties that women face in accessing abortion during the COVID -19 pandemic, restrictions that affect the protection of their dignity, right to life, privacy and right to equality. In the second part of the paper particular attention will be paid to the illiberal tendencies present in this period in some countries of Central and Eastern Europe, especially Poland. In the third part of the paper, emphasis will be put on the situation in Malta where there is a complete ban on abortion even in the case when the life of a pregnant woman is in danger.","Tucak, Ivana PhD Associate Professor Blagojević Anita PhD Associate Professor",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,433,30

Design/methodology/approach The paper explores an illustrative example, the UK government's procurement of personal protective equipment during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings In circumstances of a supreme emergency where parliamentary scrutiny and competitive contract tendering are suspended, other forms of public accountability come to the fore, with civil society actors becoming more evident. Research limitations/implications The paper relies on illustrative examples based on the Westminster model of government. The study advanced the notion of deferred accountability and identifies areas for further study, potentially in different jurisdictions. Social implications The paper highlights the need for a variety of active and engaged civil society actors. Originality/value The paper contributes an empirical case to how an account of government behaviour is established. The paper also contributes to a deeper understanding of the nature and role of legal and government audit accountability mechanisms.","Sian, S.; Smyth, S.",Accounting Auditing &amp; Accountability Journal,433,21

This puts biobanks at the forefront of responding to the ongoing worldwide outbreak of the severe pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The leading public health institutions around the world have developed and established interim policies and guidelines for researchers and biobank staff to handle the infectious biospecimens safely and adequately from COVID-19 patients. A study of these important and complementary policies and guidelines is conducted in this study. It should be emphasized that the COVID-19 biospecimens must be collected, processed, and preserved by trained personnel equipped with right personal protective equipment to prevent the transmission of the coronavirus and ensure the specimen quality for testing and research. Six of the leading global public health organizations or institutions included in this study are the World Health Organization, the Pan American Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health England, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the Office of Research at the University of California, San Francisco. In conclusion, following the recommended guidance and policies with extreme precautions is essential to ensure the quality of the collected COVID-19 biospecimens and accuracy of the conducted research or treatment, and prevent any possible transmission. Efforts from cryobiologist and biobanking engineers to optimize the protocol of COVID-19 biospecimen cryopreservation and develop the user-friendly and cost-effective devices are urgently required to meet the urgent and increased needs in the specimen biobanking and transportation.","Gao, Frank; Tao, Liang; Ma, Xiao; Lewandowski, David; Shu, Zhiquan",Biopreserv Biobank,433,1

In India, a large country of about 1.3 billion people, the disease was first detected on January 30, 2020, in a student returning from Wuhan. The total number of confirmed infections in India as of May 3, 2020, is more than 37,000 and is currently growing fast. OBJECTIVE: Most of the prior research and media coverage focused on the number of infections in the entire country. However, given the size and diversity of India, it is important to look at the spread of the disease in each state separately, wherein the situations are quite different. In this paper, we aim to analyze data on the number of infected people in each Indian state (restricted to only those states with enough data for prediction) and predict the number of infections for that state in the next 30 days. We hope that such statewise predictions would help the state governments better channelize their limited health care resources. METHODS: Since predictions from any one model can potentially be misleading, we considered three growth models, namely, the logistic, the exponential, and the susceptible-infectious-susceptible models, and finally developed a data-driven ensemble of predictions from the logistic and the exponential models using functions of the model-free maximum daily infection rate (DIR) over the last 2 weeks (a measure of recent trend) as weights. The DIR is used to measure the success of the nationwide lockdown. We jointly interpreted the results from all models along with the recent DIR values for each state and categorized the states as severe, moderate, or controlled. RESULTS: We found that 7 states, namely, Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are in the severe category. Among the remaining states, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Bihar are in the moderate category, whereas Kerala, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, and Telangana are in the controlled category. We also tabulated actual predicted numbers from various models for each state. All the R2 values corresponding to the logistic and the exponential models are above 0.90, indicating a reasonable goodness of fit. We also provide a web application to see the forecast based on recent data that is updated regularly. CONCLUSIONS: States with nondecreasing DIR values need to immediately ramp up the preventive measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the states with decreasing DIR can maintain the same status to see the DIR slowly become zero or negative for a consecutive 14 days to be able to declare the end of the pandemic.","Ghosh, Palash; Ghosh, Rik; Chakraborty, Bibhas",JMIR Public Health Surveill,433,16

In this work we evaluated in vivo the effects of three relevant components of atmospheric dusts (brake dust, wood pellet ash and Saharan dust) employing the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans. Main endpoints of C. elegans such as life span, brood size and oxidative stress were addressed by exposing the nematodes to different dust concentrations. Brake dust and pellet ash affected the life span and increased significantly the oxidative stress of exposed nematodes, while Saharan dust showed no effects. Water soluble and insoluble fractions of these dusts were used to investigate the impact of the single fraction on C. elegans. The two fractions of brake dust and pellet ash exerted different effects on C. elegans endpoints in terms of life span and oxidative stress response. These fractions acted in different ways on the worm susceptibility to infection of two human pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) affecting the sek-1 gene expression. In conclusion, our study showed that C. elegans is a valuable tool to investigate in vivo possible effects of atmospheric dusts.","Ficociello, Graziella; Inverni, Agnese; Massimi, Lorenzo; Buccini, Giulio; Canepari, Silvia; Uccelletti, Daniela",Environ Res,433,22

In particular, contact tracing mobile apps provide a means for governments to manage both health and economic concerns. However, public reception of these apps is paramount to their success, and global uptake rates have been low. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to identify the characteristics of individuals or factors potentially associated with voluntary downloads of a contact tracing mobile app in Singapore. METHODS: A cohort of 505 adults from the general community completed an online survey. As the primary outcome measure, participants were asked to indicate whether they had downloaded the contact tracing app TraceTogether introduced at the national level. The following were assessed as predictor variables: (1) participant demographics, (2) behavioral modifications on account of the pandemic, and (3) pandemic severity (the number of cases and lockdown status). RESULTS: Within our data set, the strongest predictor of the uptake of TraceTogether was the extent to which individuals had already adjusted their lifestyles because of the pandemic (z=13.56; P<.001). Network analyses revealed that uptake was most related to the following: using hand sanitizers, avoiding public transport, and preferring outdoor over indoor venues during the pandemic. However, demographic and situational characteristics were not significantly associated with app downloads. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to introduce contact tracing apps could capitalize on pandemic-related behavioral adjustments among individuals. Given that a large number of individuals is required to download contact tracing apps for contact tracing to be effective, further studies are required to understand how citizens respond to contact tracing apps.

We speculate a few contributing factors like the timely implementation of nationwide lockdown by Indian Government, strict compliance of social dis tancing, a predominantly large youth population who are less susceptible and lastly, a possible ad vantageous immune modulatory role of BCG vaccine conferred to the community during birth as part of the National BCG vaccination programme;a combination effect that might have contributed to the risk mitigation. The USA, with one of the lowest TB incidences has no BCG vaccination programme, has 291 COVID-19 deaths per million. Spain, with a TB incidence of 12 per 100,000, BCG vaccination started in 1965 but stopped in 1981, has reported 558 COVID deaths per million. However WHO has cautioned the use of BCG vaccine in the COVID-19 pandemic due to the absence of rigorous scientific evidence.

However, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter continue to pose unique challenges for clinical health care providers and public health officials alike. In order to effectively communicate during public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it is increasingly critical for health care providers and public health officials to understand how patients gather health-related information on the internet and adjudicate the merits of such information. OBJECTIVE: With that goal in mind, we conducted a survey of 1003 US-based adults to better understand how health consumers have used social media to learn and stay informed about the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which they have relied on credible scientific information sources, and how they have gone about fact-checking pandemic-related information. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted with a sample that was purchased through an industry-leading market research provider. The results were reported with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of 3. Participants included 1003 US-based adults (aged &#8805;18 years). Participants were selected via a stratified quota sampling approach to ensure that the sample was representative of the US population. Balanced quotas were determined (by region of the country) for gender, age, race, and ethnicity. RESULTS: The results showed a heavy reliance on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic; more than three-quarters of respondents (762/1003, 76%) reported that they have relied on social media at least ""a little,"" and 59.2% (594/1003) of respondents indicated that they read information about COVID-19 on social media at least once per week. According to the findings, most social media users (638/1003, 63.6%) were unlikely to fact-check what they see on the internet with a health professional, despite the high levels of mistrust in the accuracy of COVID-19-related information on social media. We also found a greater likelihood of undergoing vaccination among those following more credible scientific sources on social media during the pandemic (&#967;216=50.790; &#966;=0.258; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that health professionals will need to be both strategic and proactive when engaging with health consumers on social media if they hope to counteract the deleterious effects of misinformation and disinformation.

However, some of them developed severe or critical conditions as the disease progressed. OBJECTIVE: To develop a telemedicine model to balance the challenge of treating progressive COVID-19 patients who are home-quarantined and shortages in the medical workforce. METHODS: A telemedicine system was developed to continuously monitor the progression of home quarantined COVID-19 patients. The system was built on a popular social media smartphone app called WeChat, which established two-way communication between a multi-disciplinary team consisting of seven medical workers and 188 home-quarantined individuals (including 74 confirmed COVID-19 patients). The system helped patients self-assess their conditions and update the multi-disciplinary team through a telemedicine form stored on a cloud service, based on which the team made treatment decisions accordingly. RESULTS: Out of 188 individuals using the telemedicine system, 114 individuals did not infect with COVID-19 and were dismissed. 26 confirmed COVID-19 patients recovered during the study period, and voluntarily quit the system. The remaining 48 confirmed COVID-19 patients used the system until the end of the study, including six patients who progressed to a severe or critical condition. These six patients were admitted to hospital and were saved (one received ECMO support for 17 days). All 74 COVID-19 patients eventually recovered. Through the comparison of monitored symptoms between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, this study found the prolonged persistence and deterioration of fever, dyspnea, lack of strength, and muscle soreness to be diagnostic for identifying patients for hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: By continuously monitoring the changes of several key symptoms, the telemedicine system reduces the risks of delayed hospitalization for COVID-19 patients quarantined at home due to disease progression. The system uses a set of scales of quarantine management assessment for patients to self-assess their conditions. The results are useful for medical staff to identify disease progression, and hence, make appropriate and timely treatment decisions. The system requires little manpower to handle a large cohort of patients. In addition, the system can solicit help from the recovered but self-quarantined medical workers to alleviate the shortage in the medical workforce, and free healthy medical workers to fight frontline. Thus, it optimized the usage of local medical resources and prevented cross-infections among medical workers and patients.","Xu, Hui; Huang, Sufang; Qiu, Chun; Liu, Shangkun; Deng, Juan; Jiao, Bo; Ai, Ling; Xiao, Yaru; Belliato, Mirko; Yan, Li",J. med. internet res,433,30

Awake proning is an attractive intervention in settings with limited resources, as it comes with no additional costs. However, awake proning remains poorly used probably because of unfamiliarity and uncertainties regarding potential benefits and practical application. To summarize evidence for benefit and to develop a set of pragmatic recommendations for awake proning in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, focusing on settings where resources are limited, international healthcare professionals from high and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with known expertise in awake proning were invited to contribute expert advice. A growing number of observational studies describe the effects of awake proning in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in whom hypoxemia is refractory to simple measures of supplementary oxygen. Awake proning improves oxygenation in most patients, usually within minutes, and reduces dyspnea and work of breathing. The effects are maintained for up to 1 hour after turning back to supine, and mostly disappear after 6-12 hours. In available studies, awake proning was not associated with a reduction in the rate of intubation for invasive ventilation. Awake proning comes with little complications if properly implemented and monitored. Pragmatic recommendations including indications and contraindications were formulated and adjusted for resource-limited settings. Awake proning, an adjunctive treatment for hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen, seems safe in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure. We provide pragmatic recommendations including indications and contraindications for the use of awake proning in LMICs.","Stilma, Willemke; Åkerman, Eva; Artigas, Antonio; Bentley, Andrew; Bos, Lieuwe D; Bosman, Thomas J C; de Bruin, Hendrik; Brummaier, Tobias; Buiteman-Kruizinga, Laura A; Carcò, Francesco; Chesney, Gregg; Chu, Cindy; Dark, Paul; Dondorp, Arjen M; Gijsbers, Harm J H; Gilder, Mary Ellen; Grieco, Domenico L; Inglis, Rebecca; Laffey, John G; Landoni, Giovanni; Lu, Weihua; Maduro, Lisa M N; McGready, Rose; McNicholas, Bairbre; de Mendoza, Diego; Morales-Quinteros, Luis; Nosten, Francois; Papali, Alfred; Paternoster, Gianluca; Paulus, Frederique; Pisani, Luigi; Prud039,; homme, Eloi; Ricard, Jean-Damien; Roca, Oriol; Sartini, Chiara; Scaravilli, Vittorio; Schultz, Marcus J; Sivakorn, Chaisith; Spronk, Peter E; Sztajnbok, Jaques; Trigui, Youssef; Vollman, Kathleen M; van der Woude, Margaretha C E",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,433,16

However, there are limited studies that have investigated the psychological aspects of vulnerable groups including pregnant women amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among Chinese pregnant women from February 2020 until March 2020. METHODS: Our study was conducted using a modified validated online questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic, the Impact of Event Scale (IES), attitude and mental health-related questions towards COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 560 women were included. The overall mean age and IES of women was 25.8 ± 2.7 years and 31.4 ± 13.7. Moreover, 67.1% of them had IES â©¾26. Psychological impact seemed to be more severe in women in second trimester of pregnancy (the highest IES) (p = .016). There was a significant association between trimesters of pregnancy and some indicators of negative health impacts (including increased stress from work, increased stress from home, feeling apprehensive and helpless during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic) (all p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results reported moderate-to-severe stressful impact among Chinese pregnant women.

Despite the severe health effects, unprecedented improvements in air quality in many countries due to emergency measures, and public behavior changes have been reported. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in air and sewage samples in several studies across the globe. The use of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) could be a valuable method to monitor the outbreak of COVID-19, which requires fast and reliable methods for virus detection in sewage. However, water treatment companies face many pressures due to potential for aerosolization, PPE shortages, and changed usage patterns. In addition, the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the worldwide economy especially the energy sector, and its impact on our ecosystem required instant responses. This article discusses the recent developments and challenges faced in water, air, and energy resources, including renewables and non-renewables as the significant and interrelated components of the ecosystem. Furthermore, some recommendations have been directed, which may serve as a guideline to the scientists, legislators, and other stakeholders.

Thereby, three hundred and fifty-two valid questionnaires were received and partial least squares was adopted in this study to test the proposed hypotheses. The empirical results show that perceived critical mass, image, and para-social interaction strengthen the social interaction tie between users and the food safety platform. In addition, this study found that social interaction tie and trust of OHC platform users increased users' willingness to continue using the OHC platform. This research provides OHC platform managers with an in-depth understanding of online social interactions on food safety pages.

RESULTS: The sample comprised 96 patients aged 26 to 84 years (median, 66.0 years). At the time of their COVID-19 diagnosis, 75 patients (78.1%) were treated for hematologic diseases. Twenty-seven patients (28.1%) in the sample had complete remission (CR) of their hematologic disease. They were nonsignificantly more likely to have asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19 infection than those who failed to achieve CR (74.1% vs. 56.5%; P = .06). A more severe course of the infection was significantly correlated with older age (P = .047). Lung involvement was also statistically significantly associated with older age (P = .045). Over the study period, a total of 15 patients died. Age greater than 60 years was significantly associated with deaths from COVID-19 (P = .036), with failure to achieve CR having a statistically nonsignificant impact on mortality (P = .22). CONCLUSION: These results confirm the prognostic significance of age for achieving treatment response of hematologic disease as well as the severity and mortality of COVID-19 in hematology patients.","Cernan, Martin; Szotkowski, Tomás; Obr, Ales; Látal, Vojtech; Hlusí, Antonín; Krhovská, Petra; Klementová, Olga; Kolár, Milan; Sauer, Pavel; Faber, Edgar; Fürst, Tomás; Papajík, Tomás",Clin. lymphoma myeloma leuk.

Analysis of the multimodal data of four leading Hong Kong brands, with a focus on the use of verbal evaluation, iconography, typography, color, and materiality, reveals three symbolic meanings that are used in face-mask branding: (1) professionalism, which refers to the representation of face-masks as a symbol of advanced technology, (2) Hong Kong identity, which includes evoking pride in the past economy and exploiting the cultural symbol of the Lion Rock, and (3) fashion lifestyle, in which face-masks are associated with the values of stylishness, individuality, and luxuriousness.

RECENT FINDINGS: There was a significant decrease in lung transplant volumes during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic due to a combination of reduced availability of donors and an imbalance between waitlist additions and inactivations. SARS-CoV-2 infection was subsequently associated with an exuberant immune response that can lead to the development of postinfectious fibrotic lung disease. Few lung transplants have been performed in previously infected recipients and long-term outcomes remain unknown. Although the lung transplant volume rebounded during the second wave, it is unclear what the long-term effects of healthcare resource limitation and public health measures will have on transplant volumes in the future. Outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in previous lung transplant recipients appear to be worse than the general public, and, although an immunosuppressed state likely contributes to these outcomes, whether immunosuppression should be altered in those exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unanswered in the absence of unequivocal data. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a number of challenges for lung transplant programs across the globe.

The spread of this virus has had critical effects on people's health and social interactions, security and national, the economy, and individual attitudes, activities, manners, and behaviour. This dire situation called for governments world-wide to adopt various strategies to contain the spread of the virus and minimise its negative impacts on individuals, communities, and nations. People were asked to self-isolate to avoid contagion and, within a matter of weeks, many began working from home. People started to use sophisticated social networking (SN) applications to communicate, collaborate, connect, and cooperate to exchange information, ideas, keep fit while confined at home, and obtain news about the spread of COVID-19 world-wide.

Popular approaches like CEM and CMA-ES greedily focus on promising regions of the search space and may get trapped in local maxima. DOO and VOOT balance exploration and exploitation, but use space partitioning strategies independent of the reward function to be optimized. Recently, LaMCTS empirically learns to partition the search space in a reward-sensitive manner for black-box optimization. In this paper, we develop a novel formal regret analysis for when and why such an adaptive region partitioning scheme works. We also propose a new path planning method PlaLaM which improves the function value estimation within each sub-region, and uses a latent representation of the search space. Empirically, PlaLaM outperforms existing path planning methods in 2D navigation tasks, especially in the presence of difficult-to-escape local optima, and shows benefits when plugged into model-based RL with planning components such as PETS. These gains transfer to highly multimodal real-world tasks, where we outperform strong baselines in compiler phase ordering by up to 245% and in molecular design by up to 0.4 on properties on a 0-1 scale.

Many of these measures caused a sudden rupture in people's daily routines, thereby eliciting considerable uncertainty and potentially also hampering the satisfaction of individuals' psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Drawing upon Maslow's Hierarchical Need Theory and Self-Determination Theory, this study examined the unique role of felt insecurity and the psychological needs, as well as their dynamic interplay, in the prediction of mental health. A large and heterogeneous sample of adults (N = 5118; Mage = 43.45 years) was collected during the first ten days of the lockdown period in Flanders, Belgium. A subsample (N = 835, Mage = 41.39) participated during a second wave one week later. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that felt insecurity, need satisfaction and need frustration all independently predicted various positive (life satisfaction, sleep quality) and negative indicators depressive symptoms, anxiety) of mental health, with little systematic evidence for interactions between the predictors. The pattern of findings obtained concurrently largely held in the longitudinal analyses. Finally, results showed that associations between felt insecurity and lower concurrent and prospective mental health were partially mediated by need satisfaction and frustration, with especially psychological need frustration predicting changes in mental health over time. Overall, the findings suggest that satisfaction of the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness is not just a 'luxury good'. Satisfaction of these needs is important also in times of insecurity, while need frustration represents a risk factor for maladjustment during such times.","Vermote, Branko; Waterschoot, Joachim; Morbée, Sofie; Van der Kaap-Deeder, Jolene; Schrooyen, Charlotte; Soenens, Bart; Ryan, Richard; Vansteenkiste, Maarten",J Happiness Stud,433,5

Fear of contamination with germs is one of the most common intrusive obsessive thoughts with subsequent ritualistic and compulsive handwashing in patients with OCD. The current guidelines and the only safety strategy employed for infection control is frequent hand hygiene. In this regard, there is every possibility that those with preexisting OCD can have worsening of symptomatology, or many individuals can develop new-onset obsessive-compulsive symptoms that need to be addressed and appropriately evaluated.

Whereas the EPA enshrines the existing interconnectedness between the Japanese and European economies, the SPA remains more aspirational. With an emphasis on shared norms and values and recognising an increasingly hostile external environment, the EU and Japan are seeking to deepen and broaden their security cooperation. For the period 1990-2017, EU-Japan security cooperation is mapped for a broad range of security domains. During this period, cooperation has increased notably in domains such as economic security, cyber-security and civil protection. In other areas, such as military, regional, energy and human security as well as terrorism, the scope of cooperation lags behind. Looking forward, the SPA not only reflects a renewed interest and level of ambition in the EU and Japan but also provides them with a platform to extend security cooperation to address their global and regional challenges.","Kirchner, Emil J; Dorussen, Han",Asia Eur J,433,29

METHODS: We performed a longitudinal, cross-sectional email survey of clinically active emergency physicians (attending, fellow, and resident) at seven academic emergency departments. Follow-up surveys were sent 4 to 6 weeks after the initial survey and assessed the following: COVID-19 patient exposure, availability of COVID-19 testing, levels of home and workplace anxiety/stress, changes in behaviors, and performance on a primary care posttraumatic stress disorder screen (PC-PTSD-5). Logistic regression explored factors associated with a high PC-PTSD-5 scale score (&#8805;3), indicating increased risk for PTSD. RESULTS: Of the 426 surveyed initial respondents, 262 (61.5%) completed the follow-up survey. While 97.3% (255/262) reported treating suspected COVID-19 patients, most physicians (162/262, 61.8%) had not received testing themselves. In follow-up, respondents were most concerned about the relaxing of social distancing leading to a second wave (median score = 6, IQR = 4-7). Physicians reported a consistently high ability to order COVID-19 tests for patients (median score = 6, IQR = 5-7) and access to personal protective equipment (median score = 6, IQR = 5-6). Women physicians were more likely to score &#8805; 3 than men on the PC-PTSD-5 screener on the initial survey (43.3% vs. 22.5%; &#916; 20.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.3% to 31.5%), and despite decreases in overall proportions, this discrepancy remained in follow-up (34.7% vs. 16.8%; &#916; 17.9%, 95% CI = 7.1% to 28.1%). In examining the relationship between demographics, living situations, and institution location on having a PC-PTSD-5 score &#8805; 3, only female sex was associated with a PC-PTSD-5 score &#8805; 3 (adjusted odds ratio = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.28 to 4.79). CONCLUSIONS: While exposure to suspected COVID-19 patients was nearly universal, stress levels in emergency physicians decreased with time. At both initial and follow-up assessments, women were more likely to test positive on the PC-PTSD-5 screener compared to men.","Baumann, Brigitte M; Cooper, Richelle J; Medak, Anthony J; Lim, Stephen; Chinnock, Brian; Frazier, Remi; Roberts, Brian W; Epel, Elissa S; Rodriguez, Robert M",Acad Emerg Med,433,1

Hence, a number of public health authorities have experimented with automated contact tracing apps. While the global deployment of contact tracing apps aims to protect the health of citizens, these apps have raised security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we assess the security and privacy of 34 exemplar contact tracing apps using three methodologies: (i) evaluate the design paradigms and the privacy protections provided; (ii) static analysis to discover potential vulnerabilities and data flows to identify potential leaks of private data; and (iii) evaluate the robustness of privacy protection approaches. Based on the results, we propose a venue-access-based contact tracing solution, VenueTrace, which preserves user privacy while enabling proximity contact tracing. We hope that our systematic assessment results and concrete recommendations can contribute to the development and deployment of applications against COVID-19 and help governments and application development industry build secure and privacy-preserving contract tracing applications.","Sun, Ruoxi; Wang, Wei; Xue, Minhui; Tyson, Gareth; Camtepe, Seyit; Ranasinghe, Damith",,433,1

Relief measures instituted by World Bank Group (WBG) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help in the prevention, detection and treatment of coronavirus amidst SSA non-monetary measures and business support interventions are highlighted. The underlying economic challenges likely to impede WBG and IMF relief measures in SSA such as health infrastructure and resource deficiency, unsustainable high debt levels and drought effects due to climate change are analysed. Ranking the inadequate doctor-to-population ratio from 2015 to 2017, SSA ratio stood at less than 1 per 1000 population recommended World Health Organisation standard. On the credit front, other creditors such as China have contributed to prevailing economic challenges as China Official Development Assistance (ODA) to SSA debt ratio is depicted at 55% in 2016 from a low ratio of 17% in 2009. The economic challenges are further buttressed by estimated monthly tourism sector loss of US$8.8 billion per month for SSA countries during the pandemic. SSA self-employed informal sector that accounts for 76% (International Labour Organisation 2018) is equally affected amid lockdowns, business losses, closures and job losses. Economic growth is forecasted to drop to 1.8%, from a previous estimate of 3.2% according to United Nations Economic Commission (2020) due to a trade fall with developed and emerging markets. Recovery is aligned to good resilience in inherent cyber risk, oil intensity and urbanisation rate and policies to enhance production and the agriculture sector.","Ndiili, Nchimunya",Environ Syst Decis,433,24

DESIGN: A nationally representative longitudinal survey study of Australian doctors analysed using regression analysis. SETTING: General practice in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: 448 GPs who completed both the 11th wave (2018-2019) of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) Survey and the MABEL COVID-19 Special Online Survey (May 2020). OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of all consultations delivered via telephone (audio) or video (audiovisual); proportion of telehealth consultations delivered via video. RESULTS: 46.1% of GP services were provided using telehealth in early May 2020, with 6.4% of all telehealth consultations delivered via video. Higher proportions of telehealth consultations were observed in GPs in larger practices compared with solo GPs: between +0.21 (95% CI +0.07 to +0.35) and +0.28 (95% CI +0.13 to +0.44). Greater proportions of telehealth consultations were delivered through video for GPs with appropriate infrastructure and for GPs with more complex patients: +0.10 (95% CI +0.04 to +0.16) and +0.04 (95% CI +0.00 to +0.08), respectively. Lower proportions of telehealth consultations were delivered via video for GPs over 55 years old compared with GPs under 35 years old: between -0.08 (95% CI -0.02 to -0.15) and -0.15 (95% CI -0.07 to -0.22), and for GPs in postcodes with a higher proportion of patients over 65 years old: -0.005 (95% CI -0.001 to -0.008) for each percentage point increase in the population over 65 years old. CONCLUSIONS: GP characteristics are strongly associated with patterns of telehealth use in clinical work.

We documented an SMA case who contracted COVID-19 but only developed mild-to-moderate clinical and radiological manifestations of pneumonia, which were relieved by a combined antiviral and supportive treatment. We then reviewed a cohort of patients with SMA who had been living in the Hubei province since November 2019, among which the only 1 out of 56 was diagnosed with COVID-19 (1.79%, 1/56). Bioinformatic analysis was carried out to delineate the potential genetic crosstalk between SMN1 (mutation of which leads to SMA) and COVID-19/lung injury-associated pathways. Protein-protein interaction analysis by STRING suggested that loss-of-function of SMN1 might modulate COVID-19 pathogenesis through CFTR, CXCL8, TNF and ACE. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis also revealed a link between SMN1 and ACE2, despite low-confidence protein-protein interactions as suggested by STRING. This bioinformatic analysis could give hint on why SMA might not necessarily lead to poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Li, Zheng; Li, Xingye; Shen, Jianxiong; Tan, Haining; Rong, Tianhua; Lin, Youxi; Feng, Erwei; Chen, Zhengguang; Jiao, Yang; Liu, Gang; Zhang, Lin; Vai Chan, Matthew Tai; Kei Wu, William Ka",Brief. bioinform,433,16

Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study from a total of 13,138 inpatients with COVID-19 in Hubei, China, and Milan, Italy. Among them, 9,810 patients with &#8805;2 CBC records from Hubei were assigned to the training cohort. CBC parameters were analyzed as potential predictors for all-cause mortality and were selected by the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Findings: Five risk factors were derived to construct a composite score (PAWNN score) using the Cox regression model, including platelet counts, age, white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. The PAWNN score showed good accuracy for predicting mortality in 10-fold cross-validation (AUROCs 0.92-0.93) and subsets with different quartile intervals of follow-up and preexisting diseases. The performance of the score was further validated in 2,949 patients with only 1 CBC record from the Hubei cohort (AUROC 0.97) and 227 patients from the Italian cohort (AUROC 0.80). The latent Markov model (LMM) demonstrated that the PAWNN score has good prediction power for transition probabilities between different latent conditions. Conclusions: The PAWNN score is a simple and accurate risk assessment tool that can predict the mortality for COVID-19 patients during their entire hospitalization. This tool can assist clinicians in prioritizing medical treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Iran was one of those first countries facing the second wave of coronavirus, due to the lack of appropriate public restrictions because of economic problems the country is facing. The clinical and demographic characteristics of severe cases and non-severe cases of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in 192 patients in Tehran, Iran, between June 16 and July 11, 2020, were investigated. The patients were divided into severe cases (n = 82) and non-severe cases (n = 110). Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the two study clusters.

To this end, natural products can provide therapeutic alternatives that could be employed as an effective safe treatment for COVID-19. Experimental procedure: Twelve compounds were isolated from the aerial parts of C. officinalis L. and investigated for their inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro compared to its co-crystallized N3 inhibitor using molecular docking studies. Furthermore, a 100 ns MD simulation was performed for the most active two promising compounds, Calendulaglycoside A (SAP5) and Osteosaponin-I (SAP8). Results and Conclusion: At first, molecular docking studies showed interesting binding scores as compared to the N3 inhibitor. Calendulaglycoside A (SAP5) achieved a superior binding than the co-crystallized inhibitor indicating promising affinity and intrinsic activity towards the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 as well. Moreover, findings illustrated preferential stability for SAP5 within the Mpro pocket over that of N3 beyond the 40 ns MD simulation course. Structural preferentiality for triterpene-Mpro binding highlights the significant role of 17ß-glucosyl and carboxylic 3&#945;-galactosyl I moieties through high electrostatic interactions across the MD simulation trajectories. Furthermore, this study clarified a promising SAR responsible for the antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the design of new drug candidates targeting it as well. The above findings could be promising for fast examining the previously isolated triterpenes both pre-clinically and clinically for the treatment of COVID-19.","Zaki, Ahmed A; Ashour, Ahmed; Elhady, Sameh S; Darwish, Khaled M; Al-Karmalawy, Ahmed A",Journal of traditional and complementary medicine,433,3

The start of the pandemic meant that, in England, schools were closed to all but vulnerable pupils and the children of ‘key workers’, and so the normal placements of students in teacher education (ITE students) could not continue. The ‘virtualisation’ of the ITE programmes by, in some cases, both schools and universities, raised significant issues of both equity and pedagogy. The loss of time on school placement had the effect of lost opportunities for practising teaching but increasing the time for reading and reflection. We consider the effects on a teacher education programme when the practicum experience is abruptly curtailed, yet the programme is able to continue in a different way.

We develop a layered networked spread model for a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) pathogen-borne disease spreading over a human contact network and an infrastructure network, and refer to it as a layered networked susceptible-infected-water-susceptible (SIWS) model. The SIWS network is in the healthy state (also referred to as the disease-free equilibrium) if none of the individuals in the population are infected nor is the infrastructure network contaminated; otherwise, we say that the network is in the endemic state (also referred to as the endemic equilibrium). First, we establish sufficient conditions for local exponential stability and global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the healthy state. Second, we provide sufficient conditions for existence, uniqueness, and GAS of the endemic state. Building off of these results, we provide a necessary, and sufficient, condition for the healthy state to be the unique equilibrium of our model. Third, we show that the endemic equilibrium of the SIWS model is worse than that of the networked SIS model without any infrastructure network, in the sense that at least one subpopulation has strictly larger infection proportion at the endemic equilibrium in the former model than that in the latter. Fourth, we study an observability problem, and, assuming that the measurements of the sickness-levels of the human contact network are available, provide a necessary and sufficient condition for estimation of the pathogen levels in the infrastructure network. Furthermore, we provide another sufficient, but not necessary, condition for estimation of pathogen levels in the infrastructure network.","Pare, Philip E.; Janson, Axel; Gracy, Sebin; Liu, Ji; Sandberg, Henrik; Johansson, Karl H.",,433,14

Impliqués dans la gestion des malades et l’organisation hospitalière et territoriale, les SMIT ont été variablement associés aux décisions. Matériels et méthodes Afin d’évaluer l’impact de la pandémie sur les SMIT, une enquête portée par le syndicat a été réalisée entre mai et septembre 2020. Un questionnaire était adressé à l’ensemble des responsables d’équipe ayant une activité d’infectiologie. Dans un 2e temps, l’enquête était en libre accès sur le site infectiologie.com. Résultats Les données de 66 équipes privées (12 %) et publiques (86 %) dont 49 % de CH et 38 % de CHU ont été recueillies. Les infectiologues rapportent une forte collaboration avec l’administration hospitalière, les médecins libéraux et les cliniques privées (respectivement sur une échelle de 1 à 5, une collaboration&gt;3 dans 100 % des cas, 62 % et 59 %). A contrario, les ARS sont jugées peu réactives, les structures locales ont été peu associées (mairie 29 %) et le CDOM souvent non impliqué. Au niveau hospitalier, les principales collaborations se sont faites avec les pneumologues, internistes et réanimateurs ;seulement 12 % des équipes notent une implication forte des urgences. L’organisation de la prise en charge des patients est faite à l’échelle de l’hôpital (41 %) ou du GHT (37 %) plutôt que départementale (20 %). Le partenariat avec le privé est jugé important pour 68 %. En cellule de crise, l’infectiologue est leader pour 48 % avec des disparités régionales fortes dans ce rôle. Si l’accueil des patients a été assez partagé (1/3 dans les SMIT via le 15, 1/3 par les urgences et 1/3 par des services de tri dédiés), les modes d’hospitalisation étaient très variés (services dédiés COVID : 45 %, COVID en secteur chirurgical…). Les infectiologues ont participé à la gestion de la crise dans les EHPAD (64 %) et à l’organisation de la gestion en médecine libérale (50 %). Deux équipes sur 3 ont mis en place une astreinte téléphonique/physique dédiée, financée à 95 % et 55 % une garde sur place. L’impact sur les autres activités a été l’arrêt de l’activité de prévention pour 64 % des SMIT, un arrêt partiel des consultations à 74 %. Un essor de la téléconsultation est noté : 74 % des SMIT ont créé un dispositif à cette occasion, souvent (32 %) étendu à d’autres pathologies (VIH, IOA…). La majorité des équipes (85 %) a participé à des protocoles de recherche, surtout nationaux (42 %). Toutes les équipes rapportent une communication régulière dans la presse, régionale (29 %) ou nationale (26 %). Conclusion La pandémie de COVID a été l’occasion pour de nombreux SMIT d’une visibilité de la spécialité en interne et au niveau du grand public. La gestion de crise à laquelle les infectiologues ont été associés a permis de nombreux partenariats et un exercice renouvelé (télé-expertise, ville/hôpital, actions hors les murs…). Si la gestion médicale est assez homogène malgré des voies discordantes, un effort sur une communication plus cohérente est nécessaire.","Casas, C.; Alfandari, S.; Abgueguen, P.; Salmon, D.; Wyplosz, B.; Aumaître, H.",Infectious Diseases Now,433,1

We illustrate how the operating characteristics of different trial design elements may be evaluated using a network epidemic and trial simulation model, based on COVID-19 and individually randomised two-arm trials with a binary outcome. We show that “ring” recruitment strategies, prioritising participants at imminent risk of infection, can result in substantial improvement in terms of power in the model we present. In addition, we introduce a novel method to make more efficient use of the data from the earliest cases of infection observed in the trial, whose infection may have been too early to be vaccine-preventable. Finally, we compare several methods of response-adaptive randomisation, discussing their advantages and disadvantages in the context of our model and identifying particular adaptation strategies that preserve power and estimation properties, while slightly reducing the number of infections, given an effective vaccine.

In early March 2020, Israel imposed travel restrictions and limited social contacts to household members only. The effects of these restrictions on the sexual behavior and mental health of MSM are unknown. AIM: To assess sexual behaviors and mental health of Israeli MSM during social distancing and to compare sexual behaviors before and during social distancing, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected through anonymous web-based questionnaires in a popular geospatial application used by MSM between March and April 2020 during the social-distancing period. OUTCOMES: The dependent variable was casual sex, in violation of social-distancing regulations. Independent variables were demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors before and during social-distancing restrictions, and mental health. RESULTS: Of the 2,562 participants, 1,012 (39.5%) continued to meet new casual sex partners during this period. Being of a younger age, single, and with higher levels of mental distress predicted engagement in casual sex during the social-distancing period. MSM reduced their sexual risk and limited sexual repertoire-in particular, kissing with their sexual partners. Participants also spent more time in dating applications than in the pre-social-distancing period and increased their use of sex phone, webcams, and porn consumption. They perceived the threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus to be greater than that of HIV: only 3.2% could imagine themselves having sex with a partner who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with 30.1% in case of HIV, P < .01. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: MSM reduced their risk behaviors during social distancing because of the threat of COVID-19. Casual sex during social distancing was associated with negative feelings of mental distress. Future public health response in the future waves of COVID-19 morbidity should strike a balance between containment measures and the need for social distancing with its possible mental and social burdens. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: This is the first study in Israel and one of the few in the world to examine sexual behaviors among MSM during the COVID-19 social distancing period. It involved a relatively large sample, through convenience sampling, which limits causality. Findings should be interpreted cautiously, specifically because COVID-19-related behaviors and circumstances may change rapidly. CONCLUSION: The negative feelings of distress due to social distancing should be considered as a potential barrier to adherence among vulnerable populations, such as MSM. Future public health response should strike a balance between containment measures and its possible mental, social, and financial burdens. Shilo G, Mor Z.

The online learning environment is increasingly a choice for more undergraduate students, and it continues to grow in popularity as an attractive option for adults. It is crucial to find ways to increase persistence and graduation especially given the increased use of virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Attrition rates in online learning can be high for a variety of reasons, including persistence and engagement. Faculty mentors in the online environment can strengthen connections and relationships with undergraduate students, and it is important to ask for and evaluate these student perceptions. This mixed methods study surveyed and interviewed undergraduate students in an online university to understand both their experiences with faculty mentoring in the online environment and the potential of a faculty mentor program in a large online university. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of four undergraduate student mentees with their faculty mentor at a large online university using mixed methods research design. In addition, survey data from one department are analyzed to guide future mentoring programs in online learning environments. Findings from the study indicate belief that mentoring and encouragement from faculty would enhance students? scholarly experience. Students indicated they would like to participate in a faculty mentoring program, and it was clear that students welcome and appreciate the opportunity to further cement a professional relationship between themselves and faculty. This article makes a unique contribution to higher education research, providing a potential model for others seeking guidance in mentoring in online higher education.

Following IV administration, RDV is rapidly distributed into cells and tissues and simultaneously metabolized into GS-441524 and GS-704277 in plasma. LC-MS/MS methods were validated for determination of the 3 analytes in human plasma that involved two key aspects to guarantee their precision, accuracy and robustness. First, instability issues of the analytes were overcome by diluted formic acid (FA) treatment of the plasma samples. Secondly, a separate injection for each analyte was performed with different ESI modes and organic gradients to achieve sensitivity and minimize carryover. Chromatographic separation was achieved on an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 µm) with a run time of 3.4 min. The calibration ranges were 4-4000, 2-2000, and 2-2000 ng/mL, respectively for RDV, GS-441524 and GS-704277. The intraday and interday precision (%CV) across validation runs at 3 QC levels for all 3 analytes was less than 6.6%, and the accuracy was within ±11.5%.

The daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia are shown to be affected by some explanatory variables that are recorded daily: recovered COVID-19 cases, critical cases, daily active cases, tests per million, curfew hours, maximal temperatures, maximal relative humidity, maximal wind speed, and maximal pressure. Restrictions applied by the Saudi Arabia government due to the COVID-19 outbreak, from the suspension of Umrah and flights, and the lockdown of some cities with a curfew are based on information about COVID-15. The aim of the paper is to propose some predictive regression models similar to generalized linear models (GLMs) for fitting COVID-19 data in Saudi Arabia to analyze, forecast, and extract meaningful information that helps decision makers. In this direction, we propose some regression models on the basis of inverted exponential distribution (IE-Reg), Bayesian (BReg) and empirical Bayesian regression (EBReg) models for use in conjunction with inverted exponential distribution (IE-BReg and IE-EBReg). In all approaches, we use the logarithm (log) link function, gamma prior and two loss functions in the Bayesian approach, namely, the zero-one and LINEX loss functions. To deal with the outliers in the proposed models, we apply Huber and Tukey's bisquare (biweight) functions. In addition, we use the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm to estimate Bayesian regression coefficients. Further, we compare IE-Reg, IE-BReg, and IE-EBReg using some criteria, such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), deviance (D), and mean squared error (MSE). Finally, we apply the collected data of the daily confirmed from March 23 - June 21, 2020 with the corresponding explanatory variables to the theoretical findings.

Previous studies have reported rapid antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in the first 2 to 3 weeks after symptom onset. Here, we retrospectively described the dynamic changes of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in later weeks (mainly 4-10 weeks) in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We observed that serum IgM and IgG, especially in patients with moderate-to-high levels, declined significantly between week 4 to 10 after illness onset. Notably, IgG levels in high percentage of patients (77.5%, 31 of 40) rapidly declined by half, from 212.5 (range, 163.7-420.3) to 96.3 (range, 75.0-133.4) AU/mL, within 1 to 2 weeks in the second month and then sustained at around 100 AU/mL until discharge from hospital. Significant reduction of IgM was also observed as SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid turned negative (P = .002). In the recovery stage, serum IgG declined significantly (early vs late recovery stage, n = 16, P = .003) with a median reduction of 50.0% (range, 3.7%-77.0%). Our results suggested that the decline of IgM may be an indicator of virus clearance and recovered patients may have a robust immunity against reinfection within at least 3 months after illness onset. Yet, the rapid reduction of IgG by half rises serious concerns on the robustness and sustainability of the humoral immune response in the period after discharge, which is crucial for immunity strategy and developing a vaccine.","Zhou, Wei; Xu, Xiaomao; Chang, Zhigang; Wang, He; Zhong, Xuefeng; Tong, Xunliang; Liu, Taotao; Li, Yanming",J. med. virol,433,20

Most of them did not include main confounding factors (i.e. demographic of the assessed countries, share of peo- ple residing in urban settings, etc.), and simply assessed the differences among incidence/mortality of COVID-19 with vaccination rates or by having vs. having not any vaccination policy for BCG. Even though all studies shared the very same information sources (i.e. international registries for BCG vaccination rates and open source data for COVID-19 epidemics), results were conflicting, with later studies apparently denying any true correlation between COVID-19 occurrence and BCG vaccination rates and/or policies.

Interpretation of these studies will depend on robust validation of the longitudinal sensitivities of these assays, especially in the context of mild disease which makes up the majority of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caseload. METHODS: Hospital staff (n=94) returning to work following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 were offered antibody testing to assist with laboratory verification. Initial specimens were collected at median 29 days post-symptom onset and run on the Roche, Abbott, Siemens and DiaSorin platforms. Re-sampling occurred at median 142 days from a subset of the initial cohort (n=62) that had volunteered to provide further sera to assist in longitudinal sensitivity analysis. Samples that were not run across all four platforms were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: Comparative sensitivity analysis was conducted on 89/94 of the initial specimens and 55/62 of the repeat specimens. Sensitivity at initial sampling ranged from 78-87% across platforms. At re-sampling, sensitivities were: 100% (Roche), 45% (Abbott), 100% (Siemens), and 80% (DiaSorin). Paired analysis using the longitudinal cohort (n=55) demonstrated stable or increasing median assay values on three platforms, with a clear reduction seen only on the Abbott platform (4.78 to 1.34) with corresponding sensitivity drop-off (81.8% to 45.4%). CONCLUSION: The Abbott assay demonstrated sensitivity drop-off and decrease in median assay signal below detection threshold at 4-5 months. This has implications on the interpretation and design of future studies.","Sim, Marcus Yee Lu; Cockcroft, Christopher; Darby, Denise; Ellis, Clare Roisin; Heaps, Adrian; Scargill, Jonathan; Garcez, Tomaz",Ann Clin Biochem,433,16

That is, early life adversity may inhibit the formation of supportive social ties, and weak social support is itself often linked to dysregulated stress responses. Here, we use prospective, longitudinal data from wild baboons in Kenya to test the links between early adversity, adult social bonds, and adult fecal glucocorticoid hormone concentrations (a measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis activation and the stress response). Using a causal inference framework, we found that experiencing one or more sources of early adversity led to a 9 to 14% increase in females' glucocorticoid concentrations across adulthood. However, these effects were not mediated by weak social bonds: The direct effects of early adversity on adult glucocorticoid concentrations were 11 times stronger than the effects mediated by social bonds. This pattern occurred, in part, because the effect of social bonds on glucocorticoids was weak compared to the powerful effects of early adversity on glucocorticoid levels in adulthood. Hence, in female baboons, weak social bonds in adulthood are not enough to explain the effects of early adversity on glucocorticoid concentrations. Together, our results support the well-established notions that early adversity and weak social bonds both predict poor adult health. However, the magnitudes of these two effects differ considerably, and they may act independently of one another.","Rosenbaum, Stacy; Zeng, Shuxi; Campos, Fernando A; Gesquiere, Laurence R; Altmann, Jeanne; Alberts, Susan C; Li, Fan; Archie, Elizabeth A",Proc.

The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic medicine physicians and their staffs with a practical guide to safety considerations to support clinic preparedness for patients seeking non-surgical aesthetic treatments and procedures following the return-to-work phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, once such activity is permitted by applicable law. Many federal, state and local governmental authorities, public health agencies and professional medical societies have promulgated COVID-19 orders and advisories applicable to health care practitioners. The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic physicians and their staffs with an additional set of practical considerations for delivering aesthetic care safely and generally conducting business responsibly in the new world of COVID-19. Aesthetic providers will face new and unique challenges as government stay-at-home orders and related commercial limitations are eased, and the U.S. economy reopens and healthcare systems transition from providing only urgent and other essential treatment to resuming routine care and elective procedures and services. The medical aesthetic specialties will therefore wish to resume practice in order to ensure high quality, expert care is available, and importantly to help promote patients' positive self-image and sense of well-being following a lengthy and stressful period of quarantine. In a number of areas, this Guidance Supplement exceeds traditional aesthetic office safety precautions, recognizing reduced tolerance in an elective treatment environment for any risk associated with COVID-19's highly variable presentation and unpredictable course. The disease has placed a disturbing number of young, otherwise healthy patients in extremis with severe respiratory and renal failure, stroke, pericarditis, neurologic deficits and other suddenly life-threatening complications, in addition to its pernicious effects on those with pre-existing morbidities and advanced age. Accordingly, the Guidance Supplement seeks to establish an elevated safety profile for providing patient care while reducing, to the greatest extent reasonably possible, the risk of infectious processes to both patients and providers. While the Guidance Supplement cannot foreclose the risk of infection, nor serve to establish or modify any standards of care, it does offer actionable risk-mitigation considerations for general office comportment and for certain non-surgical procedures typically performed in aesthetic medical settings. It is axiomatic that all such considerations are necessarily subject to the ultimate judgment of each individual healthcare professional based on patient situation, procedure details, office environment, staffing constraints, equipment and testing availability, and local legal status and public health conditions.","Dover, Jeffrey S; Moran, Mary Lynn; Figueroa, Jose F; Furnas, Heather; Vyas, Jatin M; Wiviott, Lory D; Karchmer, Adolf W",,433,1

This review describes the latest MERS-CoV clusters and the first cases of nosocomial transmission within health care facilities in Oman. We have highlighted lessons learned and proposed steps to prevent healthcare-associated infections. METHODS: A descriptive analysis of MERS-CoV cases was conducted between January 23 and February 16, 2019. The data from officials and other published sources used. RESULTS: Thirteen laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were reported from three simultaneous clusters from two governorates without an epidemiological link between the clusters. Two clusters were reported from North Al Batinah Governorate, with nine cases (69%) and 1 cluster from South Ash Sharqiyah Governorate with four cases (31%). In total, four deaths were reported (case fatality rate 31%). Four cases (31%) reported were household contacts from the first cluster, 3 (23%) were nosocomial transmission in health care facilities (two for first and one from the second cluster) and 7 (54%) were community-acquired cases. CONCLUSIONS: The first local clusters of MERS-CoV reported with evidence suggestive of healthcare and household-associated transmission.

To improve the understanding of transmission risks in six Scottish renal dialysis units, we utilised the rapid whole-genome sequencing data generated by the COG-UK consortium. METHODS: We combined geographical, temporal and genomic sequence data from the community and hospital to estimate the probability of infection originating from within the dialysis unit, the hospital or the community using Bayesian statistical modelling and compared these results to the details of epidemiological investigations. RESULTS: Of 671 patients, 60 (8.9%) became infected with SARS-CoV-2, of whom 16 (27%) died. Within-unit and community transmission were both evident and an instance of transmission from the wider hospital setting was also demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Near-real-time SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data can facilitate tailored infection prevention and control measures, which can be targeted at reducing risk in these settings.","Li, Kathy K; Woo, Y Mun; Stirrup, Oliver; Hughes, Joseph; Ho, Antonia; Filipe, Ana Da Silva; Johnson, Natasha; Smollett, Katherine; Mair, Daniel; Carmichael, Stephen; Tong, Lily; Nichols, Jenna; Aranday-Cortes, Elihu; Brunker, Kirstyn; Parr, Yasmin A; Nomikou, Kyriaki; McDonald, Sarah E; Niebel, Marc; Asamaphan, Patawee; Sreenu, Vattipally B; Robertson, David L; Taggart, Aislynn; Jesudason, Natasha; Shah, Rajiv; Shepherd, James; Singer, Josh; Taylor, Alison H M; Cousland, Zoe; Price, Jonathan; Lees, Jennifer S; Jones, Timothy P W; Lopez, Carlos Varon; MacLean, Alasdair; Starinskij, Igor; Gunson, Rory; Morris, Scott T W; Thomson, Peter C; Geddes, Colin C; Traynor, Jamie P; Breuer, Judith; Thomson, Emma C; Mark, Patrick B",J. infect,433,24

Recent technical advances enable the recording of increasingly larger neuronal populations to produce increasingly more sophisticated datasets. Despite bold and important open-science and data-sharing policies, these datasets tend to include unique data acquisition methods, behaviors, and file structures. Discrepancies between experimental protocols present key challenges in comparing data between laboratories and across different brain regions and species. Here, we discuss our recent efforts to create a standardized and high-throughput research platform to address these issues. The McGill-Mouse-Miniscope (M3) platform is an initiative to combine miniscope calcium imaging with standardized touchscreen-based animal behavioral testing. The goal is to curate an open-source and standardized framework for acquiring, analyzing, and accessing high-quality data of the neuronal dynamics that underly cognition throughout the brain in mice, marmosets, and models of disease.

Few days later, he monitored an increase in his resting heart rate. This was followed by a dry cough, fatigue, and myalgia. At the same time, symptoms occurred in all four family members. CLINICAL FINDINGS: The patient had a dry cough. The medical examination was normal. Heart rate was 60/min, sinus rhythm, body temperature 36.6â°C. Complete anosmia was present. The RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 from a deep pharyngeal swab was positive in all five family members. THERAPY AND COURSE: Symptoms were present for almost two weeks. All family members had anosmia, that started earlier and lasted longer than the other symptoms, and myalgia. Reduced taste sensation, fatigue, dry cough and sore throat were present in four of five persons. Shortness of breath at rest or gastrointestinal symptoms were absent. Four affected persons had sleep disturbances in the later course of the disease. None of the affected persons had raised temperature at any time during the disease.

DISCUSSION: We describe a family of 5 previously healthy persons with a mild course of COVID-19 disease. The symptoms and course are described in detail. Anosmia can precede other symptoms by several days and can indicate an early phase of infection. An increase in resting heart rate can occur in the absence of raised temperature or fever. The symptoms and course are discussed in the context of the ongoing pandemic, and efforts to control infection chains.","Isenmann, Anna; Isenmann, Stefan",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,433,20

Social VR platforms draw aspects from traditional 2D virtual worlds where users engage in various immersive experiences, interactive activities, and choices in avatar-based representation. However, social VR also demonstrates specific nuances that extend traditional 2D virtual worlds and other online social spaces, such as full/partial body tracked avatars, experiencing mundane everyday activities in a new way (e.g., sleeping), and an immersive means to explore new and complex identities. The growing popularity has signaled interest and investment from top technology companies who each have their own social VR platforms. Thus far, social VR has become an emerging research space, mainly focusing on design strategies, communication and interaction modalities, nuanced activities, self-presentation, harassment, privacy, and self-disclosure. These recent works suggest that many questions still remain in social VR scholarship regarding how to ethically conduct research on these sites and which research areas require additional attention. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an overview of modern Social VR, critically review current scholarship in the area, raise ethical considerations for conducting research on these sites, and highlight unexplored areas.","Maloney, Divine; Freeman, Guo; Robb, Andrew",,433,24

METHODS: Volume and outcome data before (1/2019 - 2/2020), during (3/2020 - 4/2020), and following (5/2020 - 6/2020) the initial pandemic surge were obtained from the Vascular Quality Initiative®. Volume changes were determined using interrupted Poisson time series regression. Adjusted mortality was estimated using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The final cohort comprised 57,181 patients from 147 US and Canadian sites. Overall procedure volumes fell 35.2% (95% CI 31.9%, 38.4%, p < 0.001) during and 19.8% (95% CI 16.8%, 22.9%, p < 0.001) following the surge, compared with presurge months. Procedure volumes fell 71.1% for claudication (95% CI 55.6%, 86.4%, p < 0.001) and 15.9% for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) (95% CI 11.9%, 19.8%, p < 0.001) but remained unchanged for acute limb ischemia (ALI) when comparing surge to presurge months. Adjusted mortality was significantly higher among those with claudication (0.5% vs 0.1%; OR 4.38 [95% CI 1.42, 13.5], p = 0.01) and ALI (6.4% vs 4.4%; OR 2.63 [95% CI 1.39, 4.98], p = 0.003) when comparing postsurge with presurge periods. CONCLUSION: The first North American COVID-19 pandemic surge was associated with a significant and sustained decline in both elective and nonelective lower-extremity vascular procedural volumes. When compared with presurge patients, in-hospital mortality increased for those with claudication and ALI following the surge.","Lou, Jun-Yang; Kennedy, Kevin F; Menard, Matthew T; Abbott, J Dawn; Secemsky, Eric A; Goodney, Philip P; Saad, Marwan; Soukas, Peter A; Hyder, Omar N; Aronow, Herbert D",Vasc Med,433,24

This survey examines the levels of knowledge and the perception of risk within the population and analyses implementation and adherence to the recommended and legally mandated safety measures in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In March 2020, participants registered on the HeReCa-Online-Panel from Saxony-Anhalt, Berlin and Schleswig Holstein were invited to complete a 65-question survey. RESULTS: 1048 respondents answered the questionnaire, which amounts to a response of 3.5%. 83% of respondents stated that they felt themselves to be well-informed or very well-informed concerning COVID-19 and the coronavirus. The majority of respondents reported fears for the well-being of family members (60%) or the health of the German population as a whole (45%); 79% reported concerns regarding adverse economic impacts. 79% of respondents have implemented individual protective measures, such as reducing social contacts and maintaining the recommended physical distance in public spaces. Most respondents regarded the government-mandated safety measures as predominantly reasonable and appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: In the early phase of the pandemic, most people kept themselves informed about of COVID-19 and started to take individual measures for risk reduction. Acceptance of governmental measures to stem the spread of the pandemic was high.","Führer, Amand; Frese, Thomas; Karch, Andre; Mau, Wilfried; Meyer, Gabriele; Richter, Matthias; Schildmann, Jan; Steckelberg, Anke; Wagner, Karoline; Mikolajczyk, Rafael",Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes,433,17

The ever-growing new cases have called for an urgent emergency for specific anti-COVID-19 drugs. Three structural proteins (Membrane, Envelope and Nucleocapsid protein) play an essential role in the assembly and formation of the infectious virion particles. Thus, the present study was designed to identify potential drug candidates from the unique collection of 548 anti-viral compounds (natural and synthetic anti-viral), which target SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. High-end molecular docking analysis was performed to characterize the binding affinity of the selected drugs-the ligand, with the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, while high-level Simulation studies analyzed the stability of drug-protein interactions. The present study identified rutin, a bioflavonoid and the antibiotic, doxycycline, as the most potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein. Caffeic acid and ferulic acid were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein while the anti-viral agent's simeprevir and grazoprevir showed a high binding affinity for nucleocapsid protein. All these compounds not only showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties, absorption, metabolism, minimal toxicity and bioavailability but were also remain stabilized at the active site of proteins during the MD simulation. Thus, the identified lead compounds may act as potential molecules for the development of effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting the envelope formation, virion assembly and viral pathogenesis.","Bhowmik, Deep; Nandi, Rajat; Jagadeesan, Rahul; Kumar, Niranjan; Prakash, Amresh; Kumar, Diwakar",Infect Genet Evol,433,17

Unfortunately, drilling protection systems are not available in all hospitals. Thanks to the development of 3D printing in recent years, sharing devices and materials to solve surgical problems has become easy and inexpensive. The objective of our work is to evaluate a universal, freely accessible, 3D-printable drilling protection device. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, randomized, and triple-blind evaluation of excess drilling was evaluated in expert surgeons and resident surgeons without the use of the protection device. Subsequently, excess drilling was assessed using the device in both groups. The differences in drilling lengths between both groups with and without the device were analyzed to establish the reduction of excess drilling in both groups. RESULTS: The drilling in the expert surgeon without device group was 3.03 mm (SD 1.69 95% CI 2.40-3.66 p value = 9.89e-11), while the resident surgeon with device group performed excess drilling of 1.76 mm (SD 0.89 CI 95% 1.43-2.10). Results showed better results in the resident surgeon with device group than in the expert surgeons with device group (p value Ë 0.01). The device improved drilling in both resident surgeons (5.77 mm) and expert surgeons (1.17 mm). CONCLUSIONS: The device improves drilling in both expert surgeons and resident surgeons, showing greater benefits in the latter. The device is printable with any 3D printer, making it universally accessible, inexpensive, and effective, allowing expert surgeons to improve precision in high-risk situations and resident surgeons to improve their technique without increasing risk to the patient.","Ferràs-Tarragó, Joan; Jordà-Gómez, Pablo; Català-de-Las-Marinas, Juan; Antequera-Cano, Juan Manuel; Barrés-Carsí, Mariano",,433,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective, observational study was performed in a university ICU from March to June 2020 (first wave) and from September 2020 to January 2021 (second wave). In first wave, patients received bundle 1 including early invasive ventilation, hydroxychloroquine, cefotaxime and azithromycin. In second wave, bundle 2 included non-invasive oxygenation support and dexamethasone. The main outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay, ICU supportive therapies, viral clearance and antimicrobial resistance emergence. RESULTS: 129 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were admitted to our ICU. Thirty-five were treated according to bundle 1 and 76 to bundle 2. In-hospital mortality was similar in the two groups (23%, p = 1). The hospital (p = 0.003) and ICU (p = 0.01) length of stay and ventilator-free days at 28 days (p = 0.03) were significantly reduced in bundle 2. Increasing age, vasopressor use and PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 125 were associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of our study, changes in therapeutic bundles for SARS-Cov-2 ICU patients might have no effect on in-hospital mortality but were associated with less exposure to mechanical ventilation and reduced hospital length of stay.","Lopez, Alexandre; Lakbar, Ines; Delamarre, Louis; Culver, Aurélien; Arbelot, Charlotte; Duclos, Gary; Hammad, Emmanuelle; Pastene, Bruno; Antonini, François; Zieleskiewicz, Laurent; Leone, Marc",J Crit Care,433,9

Severe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a major immune inflammatory response with cytokine upregulation including interleukin 6 (IL-6). We report a case presenting with acute encephalitis that was diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with hyperinflammatory systemic response and recovered after therapy with immunoglobulins and cytokine blockade. Case report: A 39-year-old-man was brought to the Emergency Department with drowsiness, mental disorientation, intermittent fever and headache. A brain magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive involvement of the brain including cortical and subcortical right frontal regions, right thalamus, bilateral temporal lobes and cerebral peduncles, with no leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a leukocyte count of 20/µL (90% lymphocytes), protein level of 198â¯mg/dL, and glucose of 48â¯mg/dL. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) but it was negative in the CSF. Remarkable laboratory findings in blood tests included low lymphocyte count and elevated ferritin, IL-6 and D-dimer. He had a complicated clinical course requiring mechanical ventilation. Intravenous immunoglobulins and cytokine blockade with tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, were added considering acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. The patient made a full recovery, suggesting that it could have been related to host inflammatory response. Conclusion: This case report indicates that COVID-19 may present as an encephalitis syndrome mimicking acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis that could be amenable to therapeutic modulation.","Freire-Álvarez, Eric; Guillén, Lucía; Lambert, Karine; Baidez, Ana; García-Quesada, Miguel; Andreo, María; Alom, Jordi; Masiá, Mar; Gutiérrez, Félix",Clin Infect Pract,433,16

We investigated their prevalence, severity, co-occurrence and overlap. METHODS: We interviewed 124 psychiatric outpatients with MDE using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I and II Disorders, the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI-IV), and about past (hypo)manic episodes, and stratified them according to the principal diagnosis into subcohorts of major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 50), bipolar disorder (BD, n = 43), and borderline personality disorder (BPD, n = 31). We quantified (hypo)manic symptoms using a novel semi-structured interview (MIXed symptoms during MDE, MIX-MDE) with good psychometric qualities. RESULTS: The subcohorts did not differ in MDE severity. They differed significantly in some (hypo)manic symptoms being present on most days in 24% of MDD, 30% of BD, and 42% of BPD subcohort, but only 5% of the BD subcohort fulfilled the DSM-5 mixed features. The mean MIX-MDE scores were 5.7 (SD 4.0), 12.0 (8.2) and 10.5 (7.5), and BPDSI-IV scores 15.6 (7.0), 17.2 (6.2) and 26.9 (8.7), respectively (both p < 0.001). (Hypo)manic days and unspecific symptoms of distractibility and irritability inflated the correlation of observed (hypo)manic symptoms and borderline features. LIMITATIONS: Moderate sample size, limited age variation (18-50 years); no previous validation of MIX-MDE. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of some mixed and borderline features is common in MDEs, with overlap and diagnosis-specific differences. Unspecific symptoms of irritability and distractibility and the aggravating impact of hypomania on perceived BPD features blur the differential diagnosis.","Socada, J Lumikukka; Söderholm, John J; Rosenström, Tom; Ekelund, Jesper; Isometsä, Erkki",J Affect Disord,433,15

The new coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 belongs to the subfamily of ß-coronaviruses and shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV, the causative agent of the epidemic that started in 2002 and ended in 2004. Considering the clinical impact of the new outbreak, it is highly important to study the potential responses of the human immune system during the SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the role of virus-specific T cells and by B-lymphocytes. Moreover, specific data on the production of IgG and IgM is crucial to allow the rapid identification of the infection. In this paper we also described the importance of sensitive and specific rapid test for SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, this test represents an important immunological tool aimed at identifying the precise phase of the infection in order to undertake a more appropriate pharmacological treatment. Lastly, we provided an overview of pharmacological treatments aimed to reduce inflammatory processes underlying the infection and the need for the discovery of a new vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","di Mauro, Gabriella; Scavone, Cristina; Rafaniello, Concetta; Rossi, Francesco; Capuano, Annalisa",Int Immunopharmacol,433,13

Therefore, early evaluation and monitoring of both liver and kidney functions, as well as hematologic parameters, are pivotal to forecast the progression of COVID-19. Objectives: In this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between several complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI), acute liver injury (ALI), and coagulopathy, with poor outcomes in COVID-19. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting: Observational studies reporting AKI, ALI, and coagulopathy along with the outcomes of clinically validated death, severe COVID-19, or intensive care unit (ICU) care were included in this study. The exclusion criteria were abstract-only publications, review articles, commentaries, letters, case reports, non-English language articles, and studies that did not report key exposures or outcomes of interest. Patients: Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Measurements: Data extracted included author, year, study design, age, sex, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, respiratory comorbidities, chronic kidney disease, mortality, severe COVID-19, and need for ICU care. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC, and the Cochrane Central Database. AKI and ALI follow the definition of the included studies. Coagulopathy refers to the coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation defined in the included studies. The outcome of interest was a composite of mortality, need for ICU care, and severe COVID-19. We used random-effects models regardless of heterogeneity to calculate risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous variables. Heterogeneity was assessed using I 2. Random effects meta-regression was conducted for comorbidities and the analysis was performed for one covariate at a time. Results: There were 3615 patients from 15 studies. The mean Newcastle-Ottawa scale of the included studies was 7.3 ± 1.2. The AKI was associated with an increased the composite outcome (RR: 10.55 [7.68, 14.50], P < .001; I 2: 0%). Subgroup analysis showed that AKI was associated with increased mortality (RR: 13.38 [8.15, 21.95], P < .001; I 2: 24%), severe COVID-19 (RR: 8.12 [4.43, 14.86], P < .001; I 2: 0%), and the need for ICU care (RR: 5.90 [1.32, 26.35], P = .02; I 2: 0%). The ALI was associated with increased mortality (RR: 4.02 [1.51, 10.68], P = .005; I 2: 88%) in COVID-19. Mortality was higher in COVID-19 with coagulopathy (RR: 7.55 [3.24, 17.59], P < .001; I 2: 69%). The AKI was associated with the composite outcome and was not influenced by age (P = .182), sex (P = .104), hypertension (P = .788), cardiovascular diseases (P = .068), diabetes (P = .097), respiratory comorbidity (P = .762), and chronic kidney disease (P = .77). Limitations: There are several limitations of this study. Many of these studies did not define the extent of AKI (grade), which may affect the outcome. Acute liver injury and coagulopathy were not defined in most of the studies. The definition of severe COVID-19 differed across studies. Several articles included in the study were published at preprint servers and are not yet peer-reviewed. Most of the studies were from China; thus, some patients might overlap across the reports. Most of the included studies were retrospective in design. Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed that the presence of AKI, ALI, and coagulopathy was associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Lim, Michael Anthonius; Pranata, Raymond; Huang, Ian; Yonas, Emir; Soeroto, Arto Yuwono; Supriyadi, Rudi",Can J Kidney Health Dis,433,11

Herein, we aimed to describe relevant identified genetic variants and those potentially related to the inter-individual variability of COVID-19 susceptibility and/or severity considering the physiopathological pathway of the disease The HLA-A*25:01, -B*15:27, -B*46:01, -C*01:02, and -C*07:29 alleles have been associated with COVID-19 susceptibility; while HLA-A*02:02, -B*15:03, and -C*12:03 have been identified as low-risk alleles. Variants in cytokine genes such as IL1B, IL1R1, IL1RN, IL6, IL17A, FCGR2A, and TNF could be related to disease susceptibility and cytokine storm, and/or COVID-19 complications (e.g., venous thrombosis). Several variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 affecting the expression of the receptors related to COVID-19 have been associated with the disease susceptibility and risk factors. Finally, two GWAS have identified the loci 3p21.31 (LZTFL1, SLC6A20, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, and XCR1) and 9q34.2 (ABO) with COVID-19 severity. Heterogeneous results in the association of genetic variants with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity were observed.

A case-control study was conducted by including medical facilities with (Cases) and without (Control) community-acquired infection of COVID-19. Responses from 711 hospitals and 707 private clinics were assessed (72% of all hospital and 59% all private clinics provided maternity service in Japan). Seventy-five COVID-19-positive pregnant women were treated in 52 facilities. Community-acquired infection was reported in 4.1% of the facilities. Of these, 95% occurred in the hospital. Nine patients developed a community-acquired infection in the maternity ward or obstetric department. Variables that associated with community-acquired infection of COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) were found to be state of emergency prefecture (4.93 [2.17-11.16]), PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on admission (2.88 [1.59-5.24]), and facility that cannot treat COVID-19 positive patients (0.34 [0.14-0.82]).

Given the rapid spread of the infection in the population, it was suggested that in Europe, and specifically in Italy, the virus had already been present in the last months of 2019. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the hypothesis on the early presence of the virus in Italy by analysing data on trends of access to emergency departments (EDs) of subjects with a diagnosis of pneumonia during the 2015-2020 period. DESIGN: Time series cohort study. SETTING: We collected data on visits due to pneumonia between 1 October 2015 and 31 May 2020 in all EDs of the Agency for Health Protection of Milan (ATS of Milan). Trend in the winter of 2019-2020 was compared with those in the previous 4 years in order to identify unexpected signals potentially associated with the occurrence of the pandemic. Aggregated data were analysed using a Poisson regression model adjusted for seasonality and influenza outbreaks. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURESâ¯: Daily pneumonia-related visits in EDs. RESULTSâ¯: In the studied period, we observed 105 651 pneumonia-related ED visits. Compared with the expected, a lower occurrence was observed in January 2020, while an excess of pneumonia visits started in the province of Lodi on 21 February 2020, and almost 10 days later was observed in the remaining territory of the ATS of Milan. Overall, the peak in excess was found on 17 March 2020 (369 excess visits compared with previous years, 95% CI 353 to 383) and ended in May 2020, the administrative end of the Italian lockdown. CONCLUSIONSâ¯: An early warning system based on routinely collected administrative data could be a feasible and low-cost strategy to monitor the actual situation of the virus spread both at local and national levels.","Murtas, Rossella; Decarli, Adriano; Russo, Antonio Giampiero",BMJ Open,433,24

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already caused more than two million deaths worldwide and affected people's physical and mental health. COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms are generally required to self-isolate and monitor for symptoms at least for 14 days in the case the disease turns towards severe complications. Here, we overviewed the impact of COVID-19 on the patients' general health with a focus on their cardiovascular, respiratory and mental health, and investigated several existing patient monitoring systems. We addressed the limitations of these systems and proposed a wearable telehealth solution for monitoring a set of physiological parameters that are critical for COVID-19 patients such as body temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and cough. This physiological information can be further combined to potentially estimate the lung function using artificial intelligence (AI) and sensor fusion techniques. The prototype, which includes the hardware and a smartphone app, showed promising results with performance comparable to or better than similar commercial devices, thus potentially making the proposed system an ideal wearable solution for long-term monitoring of COVID-19 patients and other chronic diseases.","Jiang, Wei; Majumder, Sumit; Subramaniam, Sophini; Li, Xiaohe; Khedri, Ridha; Monday, Tapas; Abolghasemian, Mansour; Satia, Imran; Deen, M Jamal",IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering (Online),433,20

METHODS: This analysis utilizes information on the availability of oxygen sources and delivery apparatuses to determine if a health facility is ready to deliver oxygen therapy to patients in need, and estimates how many patients can be treated with continuous oxygen flow for a 7-day period based on the available oxygen equipment at health facilities. Using GIS mapping software, the study team modeled varying travel times to oxygen-ready facilities to estimate the proportion of the population with access to care. RESULTS: 0.4% of all health facilities in Mozambique are prepared to deliver oxygen therapy to patients, for a cumulative total of 283.9 to 406.0 patients-weeks given the existing national capacity, under varying assumptions including ability to divert oxygen from a single source to multiple patients. 35% of the population in Mozambique has adequate access within one-hour driving time of an oxygen-ready health facility. This varies widely by region; 89.1% of the population of Maputo City was captured by the one-hour driving time network, as compared ot 4.4% of the population of Niassa province. CONCLUSIONS: The Mozambican health system faces the dual challenges of under-resourced health facilities and low geographic accessibility to healthcare as it prepares to confront the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis also illustrates the disparity between provinces in preparedness to deliver oxygen therapy to patient, with Cabo Delgado and Nampula being particularly under-resourced.","Denhard, Langan; Kaviany, Parisa; Chicumbe, Sérgio; Muianga, Cláudio; Laisse, Guitunga; Aune, Kyle; Sheffel, Ashley",Int J Equity Health,433,22

A wild-type virus (using African green monkey VeroE6 cells), a pseudovirus (using human Caco-2 cells), and a surrogate neutralization test platform were applied to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization potential of a cohort of 111 convalescent plasma donors over a period of seven months after diagnosis. This allowed an in-depth validation and assay performance analysis of these platforms. More importantly, we found that SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers were stable or even increased within the observation period, which contradicts earlier studies reporting a rapid waning of Ab titers after three to four months. Moreover, we observed a positive correlation of neutralization titers with increasing age, number of symptoms reported, and the presence of the Rhesus Ag RhD. Validation of the platforms revealed that highest assay performances were obtained with the wild-type virus and the surrogate neutralization platforms. However, our data also suggested that selection of cutoff titers had a strong impact on the evaluation of neutralization potency. When taking strong neutralization potency, as demonstrated by the wild-type virus platform as the gold standard, up to 55% of plasma products had low neutralization titers. However, a significant portion of these products were overrated in their potency when using the surrogate assay with the recommended cutoff titer. In summary, our study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers are stable for at least seven months after diagnosis and offers a testing strategy for rapid selection of high-titer convalescent plasma products in a biosafety level 1 environment.","Jahrsdörfer, Bernd; Groß, Rüdiger; Seidel, Alina; Wettstein, Lukas; Ludwig, Carolin; Schwarz, Tatjana; Körper, Sixten; Rojewski, Markus; Lotfi, Ramin; Weinstock, Christoph; Seifried, Erhard; Corman, Victor Max; Drosten, Christian; Münch, Jan; Schrezenmeier, Hubert",J Immunol,433,6

As the natural next step we employ (near) scale invariance to organise the time evolution of the competing variants within the effective description of the epidemic Renormalization Group framework.

Data sources: We followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P), and searched the PubMed and Embase platforms for the keywords [brain damage OR pregnancy OR developmental outcomes] and [coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR SARS-CoV OR MERS-CoV] between January 1, 2000 and June 1, 2020. Data synthesis: Twenty-three reports described the course of pregnant women exposed to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV during the gestational period, eight to SARS-CoV-2, eight to SARS-CoV, and seven to MERS-CoV. No data were found on abnormalities in brain development or on a direct link between the virus and neurological abnormalities in the human embryo, fetus, or children. Spontaneous miscarriage, stillbirth, and termination of pregnancy were some complications connected with SARS/MERS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV-2 is not currently associated with complications in the gestational period. Conclusions: The literature has no data associating exposure to coronavirus during pregnancy with brain malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, despite the lack of reports, monitoring the development of children exposed to SARS-CoV-2 is essential given the risk of complications in pregnant women and the potential neuroinvasive and neurotropic properties found in previous strains.","Leyser, Marcio; Marques, Fernanda Jordão Pinto; Nascimento, Osvaldo José Moreira do","Rev.

However, some of these policies prevent people from physical contact. Consequently, many individuals may rely on social media to obtain information concerning COVID-19. Unfortunately, social media use (especially problematic social media use) may give rise to psychological distress. Therefore, this study thus examined potential psychopathology to explain the association between problematic social media use, psychological distress, and insomnia. Methods: Utilizing an online survey, a sample of Iranian young adults (n=1078 with 628 males; mean age=26.24 years [SD±7.41]) completed questions and psychometric scales concerning psychological distress, insomnia, problematic social media use, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19 misunderstanding. Results: Problematic social media use was significantly associated with psychological distress both directly and indirectly. The indirect effects were through fear of COVID-19 (unstandardized coefficient [B]=0.177; Bootstrapping SE=0.026) and COVID-19 misunderstanding (B=0.060; Bootstrapping SE=0.014). Problematic social media use was significantly associated with insomnia both directly and indirectly. The indirect effect was through fear of COVID-19 (B=0.062; Bootstrapping SE=0.019) but not COVID-19 misunderstanding (B=0.012; Bootstrapping SE=0.014). Discussion/Conclusion: Due to the pressure of the COVID-19 outbreak, individuals are highly likely to develop psychological distress and insomnia. Apart from developing appropriate health policies to minimize the spread of COVID-19 infection, healthcare providers should design appropriate online campaigns to eliminate people's fear of COVID-19 and to diminish misunderstanding concerning COVID-19.","Lin, Chung-Ying; Broström, Anders; Griffiths, Mark D; Pakpour, Amir H",Internet Interv,433,16

However, household person-to-person transmission studies are limited. Households participating in an ongoing cohort study of influenza incidence and prevalence in rural Egypt were followed. Baseline enrollment was done from August 2015 to March 2017. The study protocol was amended in April 2020 to allow COVID-19 incidence and seroprevalence studies. A total of 290 households including 1598 participants were enrolled and followed from April to October 2020 in four study sites. When a participant showed respiratory illness symptoms, a serum sample and a nasal and an oropharyngeal swab were obtained. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. If positive, the subject was followed and swabs collected on days three, six, nine, and 14 after the first swab day and a serum sample obtained on day 14. All subjects residing with the index case were swabbed following the same sampling schedule. Sera were collected from cohort participants in October 2020 to assess seroprevalence. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR. Sera were tested by Microneutralization Assay to measure the neutralizing antibody titer. Incidence of COVID-19, household secondary attack rate, and seroprevalence in the cohort were determined. The incidence of COVID-19 was 6.9% and the household secondary attack rate was 89.8%. Transmission within households occurred within two-days of confirming the index case. Infections were asymptomatic or mild with symptoms resolving within 10 days. The majority developed a neutralizing antibody titer by day 14 post onset. The overall seroprevalence among cohort participants was 34.8%. These results suggest that within-household transmission is high in Egypt. Asymptomatic or mild illness is common. Most infections seroconvert and have a durable neutralizing antibody titer.","Gomaa, Mokhtar R; El Rifay, Amira S; Shehata, Mahmoud; Kandeil, Ahmed; Nabil Kamel, Mina; Marouf, Mohamed A; GabAllah, Mohamed; El Taweel, Ahmed; Kayed, Ahmed E; Kutkat, Omnia; Moatasim, Yassmin; Mahmoud, Sara H; Abo Shama, Noura M; El Sayes, Mohamed; Mostafa, Ahmed; El-Shesheny, Rabeh; McKenzie, Pamela P; Webby, Richard J; Kayali, Ghazi; Ali, Mohamed A",PLoS Pathog,433,1

We analysed the Covid-19 cumulative incidence (CI) using data from the 1st to the 31st of March. We estimated that in Lombardy, the worst hit region in Italy, the observed Covid-19 CI diverged towards values lower than the ones expected in the absence of government measures approximately 7-10 days after the measures implementation. The Covid-19 CI growth rate peaked in Lombardy the 22nd of March and in other regions between the 24th and the 27th of March. The CI growth rate peaked in 87 out of 107 Italian provinces on average 13.6 days after the measures implementation. We projected that the CI growth rate in Lombardy should substantially slow by mid-May 2020. Other regions should follow a similar pattern. Our projections assume that the government measures will remain in place during this period. The evolution of the epidemic in different Italian regions suggests that the earlier the measures were taken in relation to the stage of the epidemic, the lower the total cumulative incidence achieved during this epidemic wave. Our analyses suggest that the government measures slowed and eventually reduced the Covid-19 CI growth where the epidemic had already reached high levels by mid-March (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto) and prevented the rise of the epidemic in regions of central and southern Italy where the epidemic was at an earlier stage in mid-March to reach the high levels already present in northern regions. As several governments indicate that their aim is to ""push down"" the epidemic curve, the evolution of the epidemic in Italy supports the WHO recommendation that strict containment measures should be introduced as early as possible in the epidemic curve.","Sebastiani, Giovanni; Massa, Marco; Riboli, Elio",Eur J Epidemiol,433,6

METHODS: We assessed effectiveness and safety of IL-6 blockade with tocilizumab in a single-center cohort of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint was survival probability post-intubation; secondary analyses included an ordinal illness severity scale integrating superinfections. Outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab compared to tocilizumab-untreated controls were evaluated using multivariable Cox regression with propensity score inverse probability weighting (IPTW). RESULTS: 154 patients were included, of whom 78 received tocilizumab and 76 did not. Median follow-up was 47 days (range 28-67). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, although tocilizumab-treated patients were younger (mean 55 vs. 60 years), less likely to have chronic pulmonary disease (10% vs. 28%), and had lower D-dimer values at time of intubation (median 2.4 vs. 6.5 mg/dL). In IPTW-adjusted models, tocilizumab was associated with a 45% reduction in hazard of death [hazard ratio 0.55 (95% CI 0.33, 0.90)] and improved status on the ordinal outcome scale [odds ratio per 1-level increase: 0.58 (0.36, 0.94)]. Though tocilizumab was associated with an increased proportion of patients with superinfections (54% vs. 26%; p<0.001), there was no difference in 28-day case fatality rate among tocilizumab-treated patients with versus without superinfection [22% vs. 15%; p=0.42].

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection including the potential mechanisms and therapeutic options. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search from December 01, 2019 to May 14, 2020 using multiple combinations of keywords from PubMed and Ovid Medline databases according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We included articles with cases of COVID-19 where neurological involvement was evident. RESULTS: We were able to identify 82 cases of COVID-19 with neurological complications. The mean age was 62.3 years. 37.8% of the patients were women (n = 31). 48.8% of the patients (n = 40) had cerebrovascular insults, 28% (n = 23) had neuromuscular disorders, and 23% of the patients (n = 19) had encephalitis or encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are not rare, especially large vessel stroke, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and meningoencephalitis. Moving forward, further studies are needed to clarify the prevalence of the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, investigate their biological backgrounds, and test treatment options.

We investigated the immunogenicity of the full-length and shorter fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and the crossreactivity of antibodies with HCoV. We identified a C-terminus region in SARS-CoV2 N of minimal sequence homology with HCoV that was more specific for SARS-CoV-2 and highly immunogenic. IgGs to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 N also recognized N229E N, and IgGs to HKU1 N recognized SARS-CoV-2 N. Crossreactivity with SARS-CoV-2 was stronger for alpha- rather than beta-HCoV despite having less sequence identity, revealing the importance of conformational recognition. Higher preexisting IgG to OC43 N correlated with lower IgG to SARS-CoV-2 N in rRT-PCR negative individuals, reflecting less exposure and indicating a potential protective association. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N were higher in patients with more severe and longer duration of symptoms and in females. IgGs remained stable for at least 3 months, while IgAs and IgMs declined faster.

This view changed since the beginning of this century, with the 2002 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic and the 2012 MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak, two zoonotic infections that resulted in mortality rates of approximately 10% and 35%, respectively. Despite the importance of these pathogens, no approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of human coronavirus infections became available. However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus, was found to inhibit the replication of a wide range of human and animal coronaviruses in vitro and in preclinical studies. It is therefore not surprising that when the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged in late 2019 in China, causing global health concern due to the virus strong human-to-human transmission ability, remdesivir was one of the first clinical candidates that received attention. After in vitro studies had shown its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, and a first patient was successfully treated with the drug in the USA, a number of trials on remdesivir were initiated. Several had encouraging results, particularly the ACTT-1 double blind, randomized, and placebo controlled trial that has shown shortening of the time to recovery in hospitalized patients treated with remdesivir. The results of other trials were instead negative. Here, we provide an overview of remdesivir discovery, molecular mechanism of action, and initial and current clinical studies on its efficacy.","Santoro, M Gabriella; Carafoli, Ernesto",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,433,1

Experimental studies suggest both coronaviruses and influenza viruses engage with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and tetraspanin antibodies, and that ACE 2 tetraspanin antibodies in turn may inhibit both coronavirus and low-pathogenicity influenza A viruses (LP IAV) infections. This study aims to investigate the potential clinical association between receiving the 2019 influenza vaccine and the incidence of COVID-19 among HCW. METHODS: We designed a case-control study within a hospital setting in Iran when it became a center for treating COVID-19 patients. We collected data and calculated relevant incidence and associative measures among HCW who had received the 2019 influenza vaccine as compared to HCW who had not received the vaccine. RESULTS: Our total sample size was 261 HCW. Of 80 COVID-19 incident cases, three cases had received the influenza vaccine, while 87 of 181 controls had received the vaccine. The odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) of being vaccinated were 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.14) among COVID-19 cases as compared to controls.

Saliva may serve as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) as its collection is simple, non-invasive and amenable for mass- and home testing, but its rigorous validation, particularly in children, is missing. We conducted a large-scale head-to-head comparison of SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR in saliva and NPS of 1270 adults and children reporting to outpatient test centers and an emergency unit. In total, 273 individuals were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in either NPS or saliva. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results in the two specimens showed a high agreement (overall percent agreement = 97.8%). Despite lower viral loads in the saliva of both adults and children, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva fared well compared to NPS (positive percent agreement = 92.5%). Importantly, in children, SARS-CoV-2 infections were more often detected in saliva than NPS (positive predictive value = 84.8%), underlining that NPS sampling in children can be challenging. The comprehensive parallel analysis reported here establishes saliva as a generally reliable specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, with particular advantages for testing children, that is readily applicable to increase and facilitate repetitive and mass testing in adults and children.","Huber, Michael; Schreiber, Peter Werner; Scheier, Thomas; Audigé, Annette; Buonomano, Roberto; Rudiger, Alain; Braun, Dominique L; Eich, Gerhard; Keller, Dagmar I; Hasse, Barbara; Böni, Jürg; Berger, Christoph; Günthard, Huldrych F; Manrique, Amapola; Trkola, Alexandra",,433,3

In addition, it also affected the medical education of many residents and learners throughout the country. Historically, physicians undergoing their residency training were not involved in telemedicine. However, in response to the challenges faced due to COVID-19, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) released a provision in May 2020 to allow residents to participate in telemedicine. METHOD: Lincoln Medical Center, located in the South Bronx of New York City, currently has 115 Internal Medicine residents, and telemedicine clinic visits have been conducted by residents since June 2020. An anonymous 25-question survey was sent to all Internal Medicine residents between August 8, 2020 to August 14, 2020. RESULT: Of 115 residents, 95 (82.6% of the residents) replied to this questionnaire. Residents revealed feeling less confident in managing chronic diseases through telemedicine visits. The survey also shows that 83.1% of respondents prefer in-person visits during their training, 65.3% feel that the telemedicine experience will affect their future career choice, and 67.4% would prefer less than 50% of visits to be telemedicine in their future careers. OUTCOME: The purpose of the new ACGME rules allowing telemedicine was to prevent the undertraining of residents and maintain health care for the patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. This affects residency training and the experiences of residents, which in turn can influence their future career plans.","Chiu, Chia-Yu; Sarwal, Amara; Jawed, Muzamil; Chemarthi, Venkata Sireesha; Shabarek, Nehad",PLoS One,433,1

Most medical students had distance learning as their main content delivery mode, but in clerkship (fifth and sixth years), in-person activities were maintained under new protocols. These different modes may have affected student mental health. This study examines mental burden and empathy in medical students during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic according to the year of attendance. METHODS: All students attending first to the sixth year in the same medical school were invited to participate. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) were provided. RESULTS: HADS scores for Anxiety and Depression (n=347) were 9.8±4.3 and 7.1±3.6, respectively; the SRQ-20 (n=373) score was 8.1±4.5; all scores were negatively correlated with the year of attendance. IRI (n=373) scores were: 2.6±0.5 (Empathic Concern), 2.7±0.7 (Perspective Taking), 2.5±0.9 (Fantasy), and 1.7±0.7 (Personal Distress). Fantasy was negatively correlated with the year of attendance. MAAS scores were positively correlated with the year of attendance. Worse mental health scores were found for first-year students across all scales.

SARS-CoV-2 proteins physically associate with many different host proteins over the course of infection, and notably there are several interactions between viral proteins and epigenetic enzymes such as HDACs and bromodomain-containing proteins as shown by correlation-based studies. The many contributions of epigenetic mechanisms to the viral life cycle and the host immune response to infection have resulted in epigenetic factors being identified as emerging biomarkers for COVID-19, and project epigenetic modifiers as promising therapeutic targets to combat COVID-19.

Patients usually present with fever, cough, and other respiratory tract symptoms, but may also be asymptomatic. Some studies have also indicated the ocular involvement by the virus. This study aims to look deeply into all ophthalmic findings seen in COVID-19 patients and their clinical characteristics. Methods: This longitudinal study was conducted in the COVID-19 unit of a tertiary care hospital, Pakistan. Data of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection between July 2020 and March 2021 were included in the study. Ophthalmological examination was done at the time of admission and was repeated every alternate day to look for any ophthalmological manifestation. Results: Out of 441 (n= 441), 61 (13.8%) participants had ophthalmological findings on examination. Patients with ophthalmological findings were significantly younger compared to patients without ophthalmological findings (42 +/- 6 years vs. 44 +/- 7;p-value, 0.03). C-reactive protein (CRP) was also significantly higher in patients with ophthalmological findings (122.2 +/- 16.2 vs. 112.8 +/- 19.8;p-value, 0.005). The most common ophthalmological finding was conjunctival irritation (50.8%), followed by diplopia (27.8%) and cotton wool spots (27.8%). Conclusion: Ophthalmological findings are prevalent in patients with COVID-19. In this study, patients with higher CRP levels were associated with ophthalmological findings. It is important to conduct ophthalmological examinations in patients with COVID-19, as they may give a clue about other complications associated with COVID-19.","Khan, S.

In this work, in order to acquire further SAR insights for this class of compounds and identify more potent derivatives, we designed and synthesized additional series of analogues to investigate the role of the substituents around the TZP core. To this aim, we developed four facile and efficient one-step procedures for the synthesis of 5-phenyl-, 6-phenyl- and 7-phenyl-2-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, and 2-amino-5-phenyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-ol. Two analogues having the ethyl carboxylate moiety at the C-2 position of the TZP were also prepared in good yields. Then, the scaffolds herein synthesized and two previous scaffolds were functionalized and evaluated for their anti-IAV activity, leading to the identification of compound 22 that showed both anti-PA-PB1 (IC50 = 19.5 µM) and anti-IAV activity (EC50 = 16 µM) at non-toxic concentrations, thus resulting among the most active TZP derivatives reported to date by us. A selection of the synthesized compounds, along with a set of in-house available analogues, was also tested against SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound 49 from this series displayed an EC50 value of 34.47 µM, highlighting the potential of the TPZ scaffold in the search for anti-CoV agents.","Pismataro, Maria Chiara; Felicetti, Tommaso; Bertagnin, Chiara; Nizi, Maria Giulia; Bonomini, Anna; Barreca, Maria Letizia; Cecchetti, Violetta; Jochmans, Dirk; De Jonghe, Steven; Neyts, Johan; Loregian, Arianna; Tabarrini, Oriana; Massari, Serena",Eur J Med Chem,433,27

According to the national policy issued in March 2020 in response to the evolving Covid-19 pandemic, several hospitals were re-configured as Covid-19 centers and elective surgery procedures were rescheduled according to the most recent recommendations. In addition, Covid-19 protected cancer hubs were established, including the Regina Elena National Cancer Institute of Rome, Central Italy. At our Institute, the Breast Surgery Department continued working under the sign of a multidisciplinary approach. The number of professional figures involved in case evaluation was reduced to a minimum and interactions took place in the full respect of the required safety measures. Treatments for benign disease, pure prophylactic surgery and elective reconstructive procedures were all postponed and priority was assigned to the histologically-proven malignant breast tumors and highly suspicious lesions. From March 15th though April 30th 2020, we treated a total of 79 patients. This number is fully consistent with the average quantitative standards reached by our Department under ordinary circumstances. Patients were mostly discharged the day after surgery and none was readmitted due to surgery-related late complications. More generally, post-operative complications rates were unexpectedly low, particularly in light of the relatively high number of reconstructive procedures performed in this emergency situation. A strict follow up was performed based on the close contact with the surgical staff by telephone, messaging apps and telemedicine.Patients ascertainment for their Covid-19 status prior to hospital admission and hospital discharge allowed to maintain the ""no-Covid-19"" status at our Institution. In addition, during the aforementioned time window, none of the care providers developed SARS-CoV-2 infection or disease, as shown by the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G profiling. In conclusions, elective breast cancer surgery procedures were successfully performed in a lockdown situation due to a novel viral pandemic. The well-coordinated regional and hospital efforts in terms of medical resource re-allocation and definition of clinical priorities allowed to maintain high quality standards of breast cancer care while ensuring safety to the cancer patients and care providers involved.","Pelle, Fabio; Cappelli, Sonia; Graziano, Franco; Piarulli, Loredana; Cavicchi, Flavia; Magagnano, Domenico; De Luca, Assunta; De Vita, Roy; Pozzi, Marcello; Costantini, Maurizio; Varanese, Antonio; Panimolle, Massimo; Gullo, Pietro Paolo; Barba, Maddalena; Vici, Patrizia; Vizza, Enrico; Cognetti, Francesco; Sanguineti, Giuseppe; Saracca, Elena; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Botti, Claudio",J Exp Clin Cancer Res,433,13

Several scores for quantifying the degree of involvement have been described, although there is no evidence to show that they have any capacity for predicting unfavorable progress. METHODOLOGY: Prospective cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The sample was stratified according to clinical course, and patients requiring invasive or non-invasive respiratory support were classified as having unfavorable progress. Biomarkers were analyzed at admission and on the same day that thoracic ultrasound was performed. Prognostic scales were also determined at admission. The ultrasound score was obtained in 8 or 14 areas, depending on the patient's ability to sit. RESULTS: We included 44 patients, 13 (29,5%) of whom subsequently needed ventilatory support. Eight areas were explored in all patients and 14 areas in 35 (79.5%). The most affected areas were the posterior lower lobes. Significant differences were found between the 2groups on the SOFA and quick SOFA multidimensional scales, and PCR and LDH on the same day as thoracic ultrasound, and the ultrasound scores. The best area under the ROC curve (AUC) was obtained with the 14-area score, with a result of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.75-0.99). Its sensitivity and specificity for a cut-off score of 13.5 were 100% and 61.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of scores to quantify lung involvement measured by thoracic ultrasound provides useful information, facilitating risk stratification in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Ramos Hernández, Cristina; Botana Rial, Maribel; Pazos Area, Luis Alberto; Núñez Fernández, Marta; Pérez Fernández, Silvia; Rubianes González, Martín; Crespo Casal, Manuel; Fernández Villar, Alberto",Arch. bronconeumol.

Questioning focussed on social isolation and desire to interact with others before and since COVID-19; effects of safety measures including personal protective equipment and social distancing; and perceived influences of the pandemic on service users and social aspects of service delivery. All employees at an English NHS mental health service were invited to complete an anonymous online questionnaire (July-September 2020), resulting in 464 completed questionnaires. Response frequencies were summed across the total sample, and the influence of patient contact, age, and vulnerability to COVID-19 were explored using pairwise comparisons. Approximately two thirds of employees felt there had been a fundamental change in how they felt about interacting with others, and many had lost confidence in their ability to relate emotionally to others. Respondents were keen to adhere to safety guidance, but the majority believed that face masks and social distancing could have a detrimental effect on communication and rapport within the workplace. Other concerns included passing on the virus, social isolation of employees and service users, and a reduction in community services. COVID-19 safety measures may impact morale, communication, empathy, and the provision of client-centred care. More generally, the pandemic has changed the attitudes of mental health workers towards social interaction, with younger employees reporting more mental health difficulties that may be linked to concerns about longer term social change.","Eddy, Clare M",Int. j. ment. health nurs,433,31

To alleviate this problem, telemedicine is increasingly being viewed as an effective means through which patients can be diagnosed and medications prescribed by doctors via untact Thus, concomitant with developments in information and communication technology (ICT), medical institutions have actively analyzed and applied ICT to medical systems to provide optimal medical services. However, with the convergence of these diverse technologies, various risks and security threats have emerged. To protect patients and improve telemedicine quality for patient safety, it is necessary to analyze these risks and security threats comprehensively and institute appropriate countermeasures. METHODS: The security threats likely to be encountered in each of seven telemedicine service areas were analyzed, and related data were collected directly through on-site surveys by a medical institution. Subsequently, an attack tree, the most popular reliability and risk modeling approach for systematically characterizing the potential risks of telemedicine systems, was examined and utilized with the attack occurrence probability and attack success probability as variables to provide a comprehensive risk assessment method. RESULTS: In this study, the most popular modelling method, an attack tree, was applied to the telemedicine environment, and the security concerns for telemedicine systems were found to be very large. Risk management and evaluation methods suitable for the telemedicine environment were identified, and their benefits and potential limitations were assessed. CONCLUSION: This research should be beneficial to security experts who wish to investigate the impacts of cybersecurity threats on remote healthcare and researchers who wish to identify new modeling opportunities to apply security risk modeling techniques.","Kim, Dong-Won; Choi, Jin-Young; Han, Keun-Hee",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,433,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: ENMGs performed for evaluation of diffuse weakness in patients who could not be discharged from semi-intensive care COVID unit because of difficulties in ventilation weaning were reviewed. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection who had undergone endotracheal intubation and able to co-operate were considered. ENMG protocol was focused on neurophysiological items that excluded or confirmed critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), myopathy (CIM), or polyneuromyopathy (CIPM). Standardized clinical evaluation was performed using Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score. RESULTS: Eight patients were included in the study. All presented known risk factors for intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW), and none of them had history of underlying neuromuscular disorders. ENMG findings were normal in two patients, while only two patients had an altered MRC sum score (< 48). Neuromuscular involvement was diagnosed in 6/8 patients (75%): 2 had CIP, 1 had possible CIM, 1 had CIPM, while 1 patient, with clinically evident weakness but equivocal ENMG findings, was classified as ICU-AW. Finally, 1 patient was diagnosed with acute demyelinating neuropathy. Patients with neuromuscular involvement were those with longer intubation duration and higher levels of IL-6 at admission. CONCLUSION: Neuromuscular complications are frequent in severe COVID-19 and cannot be excluded by MRC sum scores above 48. Standardized ENMG is helpful in guiding diagnosis when clinical evaluation is not reliable or possible. Elevated IL-6 at admission may be a predictor biomarker of ICU-AW in COVID-19.","Bax, Francesco; Lettieri, Christian; Marini, Alessandro; Pellitteri, Gaia; Surcinelli, Andrea; Valente, Mariarosaria; Budai, Riccardo; Patruno, Vincenzo; Gigli, Gian Luigi",Neurol Sci,433,16

However, data on the biological significance of SOX-10 expression is limited. Therefore, we investigated immunhistological SOX-10 expression in TNBC and correlated the results with genetic alterations and clinical data. METHODS: A tissue microarray including 113 TNBC cases was stained by SOX-10. Immunohistological data of AR, BCL2, CD117, p53 and Vimentin was available from a previous study. Semiconductor-based panel sequencing data including commonly altered breast cancer genes was also available from a previous investigation. SOX-10 expression was correlated with clinicopathological, immunohistochemical and genetic data. RESULTS: SOX-10 was significantly associated with CD117 and Vimentin, but not with AR expression. An association of SOX-10 with BCL2, EGFR or p53 staining was not observed. SOX-10-positive tumors harbored more often TP53 mutations but less frequent mutations of PIK3CA or alterations of the PIK3K pathway. SOX-10 expression had no prognostic impact either on disease-free, distant disease-free, or overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: While there might be a value of SOX-10 as a differential diagnostic marker to identify metastases of TNBC, its biological role remains to be investigated.","Kriegsmann, Katharina; Flechtenmacher, Christa; Heil, Jörg; Kriegsmann, Jörg; Mechtersheimer, Gunhild; Aulmann, Sebastian; Weichert, Wilko; Sinn, Hans-Peter; Kriegsmann, Mark",,433,21

However, the welfare of a companion animal is strongly influenced by the behaviour of their owners, as well as their physical and social environment. We aimed to investigate the reported changes in companion animal welfare and behaviour and to examine the association between these changes and companion animal owners' mental health. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of UK residents over 18 years of age was conducted between April and June 2020 (n = 5926). The questionnaire included validated, bespoke items measuring outcomes related to mental health, human-animal bonds and reported changes in animal welfare and behaviour. The final item of the survey invited open-ended free-text responses, allowing participants to describe experiences associated with human-animal relationships during the first UK lockdown phase. RESULTS: Animal owners made up 89.8% of the sample (n = 5323), of whom 67.3% reported changes in their animal's welfare and behaviour during the first lockdown phase (n = 3583). These reported changes were reduced to a positive (0-7) and negative (0-5) welfare scale, following principal component analysis (PCA) of 17 items. Participants reported more positive changes for cats, whereas more negative changes were reported for dogs. Thematic analysis identified three main themes relating to the positive and negative impact on companion animals of the COVID-19 pandemic. Generalised linear models indicated that companion animal owners with poorer mental health scores pre-lockdown reported fewer negative changes in animal welfare and behaviour. However, companion animal owners with poorer mental health scores since lockdown reported more changes, both positive and negative, in animal welfare and behaviour. CONCLUSION: Our findings extend previous insights into perceived welfare and behaviour changes on a very limited range of species to a wider range of companion animals. Owner mental health status has a clear, albeit small, effect on companion animal welfare and behaviour.","Shoesmith, Emily; Santos de Assis, Luciana; Shahab, Lion; Ratschen, Elena; Toner, Paul; Kale, Dimitra; Reeve, Catherine; Mills, Daniel S",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),433,30

Integration has also been highlighted as a critical element for building resilient health systems that can withstand the shock of health emergencies. However, there is a dearth of research and systematic synthesis of evidence on the synergistic relationship between integrated health services and pandemic preparedness, response, and recovery in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Thus, the authors are organising a scoping review aiming to explore the application of integrated health service delivery approaches during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review adheres to the six steps for scoping reviews from Arksey and O'Malley. Peer-reviewed scientific literature will be systematically assembled using a standardised and replicable search strategy from seven electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, the WHO's Global Research Database on COVID-19 and LitCovid. Initially, the title and abstract of the collected literature, published in English from December 2019 to June 2020, will be screened for inclusion which will be followed by a full-text review by two independent reviewers. Data will be charted using a data extraction form and reported in narrative format with accompanying data matrix. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval is required for the review. The study will be conducted from June 2020 to May 2021. Results from this scoping review will provide a snapshot of the evidence currently being generated related to integrated health service delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. The findings will be developed into reports and a peer-reviewed article and will assist policy-makers in making pragmatic and evidence-based decisions for current and future pandemic responses.","Neill, Rachel; Hasan, Md Zabir; Das, Priyanka; Venugopal, Vasuki; Jain, Nishant; Arora, Dinesh; Gupta, Shivam",BMJ Open,433,25

All of these have been well documented by international comparisons. Our largely privatized market-based system and medical-industrial complex have been ill equipped to respond effectively to the pandemic. The accompanying economic downturn exacerbates these problems that further reveal the failures of our largely for-profit private health insurance industry, dependent as it is on continued government subsidies while it profiteers on the backs of vulnerable Americans. This article brings historical perspective to these problems, and provides markers of the extent of our unpreparedness and ineffective response to the pandemic.

Because of the wide spreading of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), acute stroke care is negatively impacted. How much acute care for stroke has been affected during the pandemic remains to be assessed. Methods: The first-level response to major public health was launched from January 24th to April 29th, 2020 in Beijing to contain the spread of COVID-19. Based on a database connecting all 77 stroke centers, the quantity and quality in emergency care for stroke during the 97 lockdown days were compared with the equivalent period in 2019. During the pandemic, 15 of the 77 stroke centers were designated to receive patients sick with COVID-19. Subgroup analyses were carried out by different types of hospitals (designated and undesignated). Results: There were 1,281 and 2,354 stroke emergency hospital admissions in the lockdown period and the parallel period in 2019, respectively. A reduction of 45.6% in admission was shown in the lockdown period, with more reductions for hemorrhagic stroke (69.0%) compared with ischemic stroke (42.9%). More reductions happened in COVID-19 designated hospitals (52.6%) compared with undesignated hospitals (41.8%). The mean NIHSS score at hospital arrival was significantly higher in the lockdown period (9.4 ± 7.7 in 2020 vs. 8.4 ± 7.8 in 2019, P < 0.001). For the metrics measuring the quality of acute stroke care, the onset to door (OTD), onset to needle (ONT), and onset to recanalization (OTR) times didn't change significantly, while significant delays are shown for the door to CT scan (DTC, 1 min delay), door to needle (DTN, 4 min delays), and door to puncture (DTP, 29 min delays) times, which mainly happened in COVID-19 undesignated hospitals. Conclusions: Profound reductions in stroke hospital admissions and significant delays in emergency care for acute ischemic stroke occurred during the pandemic of COVID-19. Engagement and effective communication with all stakeholders including patients, health care providers, governmental policymakers, and other implementation partners are required for future success in similar crises.","Wu, Yiqun; Chen, Fei; Wang, Zijing; Feng, Wuwei; Liu, Ying; Wang, Yuping; Song, Haiqing",Front Neurol,433,33

Although numerous studies have utilized wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2, the methods used were developed and/or standardized for other pathogens. This study evaluates multiple methods for concentration and recovery of SARS-CoV-2 and seeded human coronavirus OC43 from municipal primary wastewater and/or sludge from the Greater Seattle Area (March-July 2020). Methods evaluated include the bag-mediated filtration system (BMFS), with and without Vertrel&#8482; extraction, skimmed milk flocculation, with and without Vertrel&#8482; extraction, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, ultrafiltration, and sludge extraction. Total RNA was extracted from wastewater concentrates and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 with RT-qPCR. Skimmed milk flocculation without Vertrel&#8482; extraction performed consistently over time and between treatment plants in Seattle-area wastewater with the lowest average OC43 Cq value and smallest variability (24.3; 95% CI: 23.8-24.9), most frequent SARS-CoV-2 detection (48.8% of sampling events), and highest average OC43 percent recovery (9.1%; 95% CI: 6.2-11.9%). Skimmed milk flocculation is also beneficial because it is feasible in low-resource settings. While the BMFS had the highest average volume assayed of 11.9 mL (95% CI: 10.7-13.1 mL), the average OC43 percent recovery was low (0.7%; 95% CI: 0.4-1.0%). Ultrafiltration and PEG precipitation had low average OC43 percent recoveries of 1.0% (95% CI: 0.5-1.6%) and 3.2% (95% CI: 1.3-5.1%), respectively. The slopes and efficiency for the SARS-CoV-2 standard curves were not consistent over time, confirming the need to include a standard curve each run rather than using a single curve for multiple plates. Results suggest that the concentration and detection methods used must be validated for the specific water matrix using a recovery control to assess performance over time.","Philo, Sarah E; Keim, Erika K; Swanstrom, Rachael; Ong, Angelo Q W; Burnor, Elisabeth A; Kossik, Alexandra L; Harrison, Joanna C; Demeke, Bethel A; Zhou, Nicolette A; Beck, Nicola K; Shirai, Jeffry H; Meschke, J Scott",Sci Total Environ,433,16

The Huddinge site at the Karolinska university hospital (KH) responded through a rapid transformation of inpatient care capacity together with changing working methods in the ED. The aim is to describe the KH response to the COVID-19 crisis, and how ED crowding, and important input, throughput and output factors for ED crowding developed at KH during a 30-day baseline period followed by the first 60 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Stockholm Region. METHODS: Different phases in the development of the crisis were described and identified retrospectively based on major events that changed the conditions for the ED. Results were presented for each phase separately. The outcome ED length of stay (ED LOS) was calculated with mean and 95% confidence intervals. Input, throughput, output and demographic factors were described using distributions, proportions and means. Pearson correlation between ED LOS and emergency ward occupancy by phase was estimated with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: As new working methods were introduced between phase 2 and 3, ED LOS declined from mean (95% CI) 386 (373-399) minutes to 307 (297-317). Imaging proportion was reduced from 29 to 18% and admission rate increased from 34 to 43%. Correlation (95% CI) between emergency ward occupancy and ED LOS by phase was 0.94 (0.55-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to avoid ED crowding, even during extreme and quickly changing conditions by leveraging previously known input, throughput and output factors. One key factor was the change in working methods in the ED with higher competence, less diagnostics and increased focus on rapid clinical admission decisions. Another important factor was the reduction in bed occupancy in emergency wards that enabled a timely admission to inpatient care. A key limitation was the retrospective study design.","Af Ugglas, Björn; Skyttberg, Niclas; Wladis, Andreas; Djärv, Therese; Holzmann, Martin J",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,433,24

Therefore, serum antibody measurement has been rapidly developed as a supplementary method with the aim of improving diagnostic accuracy. Further, serum antibody levels might help to identify the infection stage, asymptomatic carriers, and patients with diverging severities and to monitor convalescent plasma therapy.

With BPRE, dsDNA fragments composed of more than 40 copies of the repeat sequence can be quickly produced, while the cost is reduced by at least 90%. As a typical application, reannealing of the dsDNA repeats generates elastic hydrogels, which shows a high capacity for doxycycline absorption and prolonged release.","Wang, Xin; Yang, Xuerui",Small,433,1

Google released Community Mobility Report (CMR) data about the movement of people collated from mobile devices. OBJECTIVE: To explore the use of CMR to assess the role of mobility in spreading COVID-19 infection in India. METHODS: An Ecological study analyzed CMR for human mobility between March - October 2020. The data compared before (Between 14th -25th March 2020), during (25th March - 7th June 2020), and after lockdown (8th June 2020 - 15th October 2020) phases with the reference periods, i.e. (3rd January 2020 - 6th February 2020). Another dataset depicting the burden of COVID-19 as per various disease severity indicators was derived from a crowd-sourced Application Programming software. The relationship between the two datasets was investigated using Kendall's tau correlation to depict the correlation between mobility and disease severity. RESULTS: At the national level, mobility decreased from -38% to -77% for all but residential areas (an increase of 24.6%) during the lockdown compared to the reference period. At the beginning of unlocking, the state of Sikkim (minimum cases- seven) with a -60% reduction in mobility depicted more mobility compared to -82% in Maharashtra (maximum cases-1.59 million). Residential mobility negatively correlated (-0.05 to -0.91) with all other measures of mobility. The magnitude of correlations for intra-mobility indicators was comparatively low for the lockdown phase (corr &#8805; 0.5 for 12 indicators) compared to other phases (corr &#8805; 0.5 for 45 and 18 indicators in pre-lockdown and unlock phase, respectively). A high correlation coefficient between epidemiological and mobility indicators is observed for the lockdown and unlock phases compared to the pre-lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: We can use mobile-based open-source mobility data to assess the effectiveness of social distancing in mitigating the disease spread. CMR data depicted an association between mobility and disease severity, and we suggest that this technique supplement future COVID-19 surveillance.","Kishore, Kamal; Jaswal, Vidushi; Verma, Madhur; Kaushal, Vipin",,433,26

The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is regarded as a key target for the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. In order to develop anti-viral therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to find amino acid pairs that strongly attract each other at the interface of the spike glycoprotein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) complex. In order to find hot spot residues, the strongly attracting amino acid pairs at the protein-protein interaction (PPI) interface, we introduce a reliable inter-residue interaction energy calculation method, FMO-DFTB3/D/PCM/3D-SPIEs. In addition to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein/hACE2 complex, the hot spot residues of SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein/hACE2 complex, SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein/antibody complex, and HCoV-NL63 spike glycoprotein/hACE2 complex were obtained using the same FMO method. Following this, a 3D-SPIEs-based interaction map was constructed with hot spot residues for the hACE2/SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein, hACE2/HCoV-NL63 spike glycoprotein, and hACE2/SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein complexes. Finally, the three 3D-SPIEs-based interaction maps were combined and analyzed to find the consensus hot spots among the three complexes. As a result of the analysis, two hot spots were identified between hACE2 and the three spike proteins. In particular, E37, K353, G354, and D355 of the hACE2 receptor strongly interact with the spike proteins of coronaviruses. The 3D-SPIEs-based map would provide valuable information to develop anti-viral therapeutics that inhibit PPIs between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and hACE2.","Lim, Hocheol; Baek, Ayoung; Kim, Jongwan; Kim, Min Sung; Liu, Jiaxin; Nam, Ky-Youb; Yoon, JeongHyeok; No, Kyoung Tai",Sci Rep,433,1

Such characteristics are also observed between different regions of the same country. Herewith, we introduce a general method that allows us to compare the pandemic evolution in different localities inside a large territorial country. To evaluate our method, we study the heterogeneous spreading of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil and its 27 states. Each one of the states may be considered a cluster of interacting people with similar habits and distributed to a highly heterogeneous demographic density over the entire country. Our first set of results regarding the time-series analysis shows that: (i) a power-law growth of the cumulative number of infected people is observed for states of the five regions of Brazil; and (ii) the Distance Correlation (DC) calculated between the time series of the most affected states and the curve that describes the evolution of the pandemic in Brazil remains about 1 over most of the time, while such quantity calculated for the states with a low incidence of newly infected people remains about 0.95. By applying the epidemiological SIRD model we estimated the Effective Reproduction Number (ERN) Reand found that: (i) the mean value of Refor the eight most affected states in Brazil is about 2, and (ii) the current value of Refor Brazil is greater than 1, which indicates that the epidemic peak is far off. Based on these findings, we projected the effects of increase/decrease of the ERN and concluded that if the value of Reincreases 20%, not only the peak might grow at least 40% but also its occurrence might be anticipated, which hastens the collapse of the public health-care system.","Da Silva, Rafael Marques; Mendes, Carlos Fabio; Manchein, Cesar",Phys. biol,433,24

With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. OBJECTIVE: Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of ""psychosis after chloroquine."" Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications; however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.","Hamm, Brandon S; Rosenthal, Lisa J",Psychosomatics,433,3

A new betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been recognized as the responsible pathogen in this infection. Although coronavirus disease is principally expressed as a pulmonary infection, critical SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequently complicated with coagulopathy, and thromboembolic events are recognizable in several patients. Dehydration, acute inflammatory condition, protracted immobilization during disease, existence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, obesity or hypertension, previous coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease are frequent comorbidities in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized subjects, which possibly augment thrombo-embolic risk. However, other causal factors can still be identified such as unrestricted angiotensin II action, the use of immunoglobulins, an increased production of adhesion molecules able to induce vascular inflammation and endothelial activation, complement stimulation, excessive production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and increased platelet count. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be chosen as early treatment because of its anti-inflammatory action and its ability to antagonize histones and so defend the endothelium. However, several therapeutic possibilities have also been proposed such as fibrinolytic treatment, drugs that target NETs, and complement inhibition. Nevertheless, although the violence of the pandemic may suggest the use of heroic treatments to reduce the frightening mortality that accompanies SARS-CoV-2 infection, we believe that experimental treatments should only be used within approved and controlled protocols, the only ones that can provide useful and specify information on the validity of the treatments.","Allegra, Alessandro; Innao, Vanessa; Allegra, Andrea Gaetano; Musolino, Caterina",Ann Hematol,433,16

A review was performed in relation to the psychosocial vulnerabilities of the older adults during the pandemic, with insights from the similar biological disasters in the past. Besides the physiological risk, morbidities, polypharmacy and increased case fatality rates, various social factors like lack of security, loneliness, isolation, ageism, sexism, dependency, stigma, abuse and restriction to health care access were identified as crucial in pandemic situation. Frailty, cognitive and sensory impairments added to the burden. Marginalization and human rights deprivation emerged as a common pathway of suffering for the elderly during COVID-19. The implications of the emergent themes are discussed in light of psychosocial wellbeing and impact on the quality of life. The authors suggest potential recommendations to mitigate this marginalization on lines of the World Health Organization (WHO)'s concept of Healthy Ageing and the United Nations (U.N.) Sustainable Development Goals.","D039,; cruz, Migita; Banerjee, Debanjan",Psychiatry Res,433,24

Commercial coworking/tenancy space is confronted with an unexpected shift. This paper aims to examine the peculiarity and investment characteristics of flexible office space and the post-COVID implications on coworking office space practice and investment. This is with a view toward providing investors with an understanding of the dynamics underpinning flexible office space investment in the Nigerian emerging property market. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a qualitative research approach. Open-ended interview questions were used to solicit information from nine coworking space operators in the urban property market of Ibadan, Nigeria. The structured interview data were analyzed using Atlas.ti – a computer-aided qualitative data analysis software. Findings: The findings show that the factors influencing demand for flexible office space in the study area include flexibility, affordability, cost-effectiveness, entrepreneurship motivations and opportunity for risk sharing. The results also revealed that coworkers are predominantly mobile individuals who require a workstation away from their homes or a traditional office setup. Management challenges include deficient infrastructure, low level of awareness, stealing and high cost of operations. The impact of COVID-19 includes a drop in patronage, rent refunds, changes in working pattern and job loss, restriction to online and remote operation, the extra cost of putting prevention measures in place, changes in tenancy contract and drops in return on investment. Practical implications: This study has implications for investors in commercial space occupation and leases in comparable developing economies. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper lies in its relevance with the emergent behavioral changes, orchestrated from the novel COVID-19, which compels reevaluation of workplace practices and investment for economic improvement, especially as it relates to commercial real estate investment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ayodele, T.

Here we show how the real-time nature of Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencers can accelerate consensus generation, lineage and variant status assignment. We exploit the fact that multiplexed viral sequencing libraries quickly generate sufficient data for the majority of samples, with diminishing returns on remaining samples as the sequencing run progresses. We demonstrate methods to determine when a sequencing run has passed this point in order to reduce the time required and cost of sequencing. ResultsWe extended MinoTour, our real-time analysis and monitoring platform for nanopore sequencers, to provide SARS-CoV2 analysis using ARTIC network pipelines. We additionally developed an algorithm to predict which samples will achieve sufficient coverage, automatically running the ARTIC medaka informatics pipeline once specific coverage thresholds have been reached on these samples. After testing on run data, we find significant run time savings are possible, enabling flow cells to be used more efficiently and enabling higher throughput data analysis. The resultant consensus genomes are assigned both PANGO lineage and variant status as defined by Public Health England. Samples from within individual runs are used to generate phylogenetic trees incorporating optional background samples as well as summaries of individual SNPs. As minoTour uses ARTIC pipelines, new primer schemes and pathogens can be added to allow minoTour to aid in real-time analysis of pathogens in the future.

We aimed to explore the impact of point-of-care chest ultrasound (CUS) use in older bedridden inpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic as a tool to distinguish between cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and isolated viral pneumonia-related dyspnoea. METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective series included 16 patients aged 75 or older, hospitalized for acute dyspnoea in an acute geriatric unit of a university hospital and testing positive for a SARS-Cov2 infection. We collected demographic characteristics, medical history, biological screening, clinical symptoms, CUS findings (n = 16) and chest CT-scan conclusions (n = 14). Mean age was 89 years (77-97). All patients presented asthenia and dyspnoea, 56% complained of coughing and diarrhoea, and 50% had fever. Acute heart failure was clinically suspected in seven patients. At CUS, evidence of heart failure was confirmed in three patients (including one without clinical suspicion); interstitial syndrome was confirmed in 12 patients on CUS vs. 9 patients with CT. CONCLUSIONS: In older patients with COVID-19 and acute dyspnoea, the use of point-of-care CUS allowed the clinician to quickly rule out heart failure in nearly half of suspected cases while easily identifying virus-related interstitial syndrome. The use of CUS appears to be suitable for the rapid bedside investigation of dyspnoea in older patients, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hacquin, Arthur; Putot, Sophie; Barben, Jérémy; Chagué, Frédéric; Zeller, Marianne; Cottin, Yves; Manckoundia, Patrick; Putot, Alain",ESC Heart Fail,433,16

Beside significant mortality, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes considerable and sustained morbidity, dubbed long COVID. This paper argues that some of this morbidity may be due to a persistent systemic infection. Persistent infection is indicated by continued virus RNA shedding. The virus' superantigen could overstimulate anti-virus immune responses, and thereby induce negative feedback loops, that paradoxically allow the virus to persist. The superantigen would induce strong immune response to any residual infection. This hypothesis suggests that clearing the virus infection completely would be an appropriate intervention against long COVID.","Jacobs, John J L",Med Hypotheses,433,11

Here, Er3+ single atom composite photocatalysts are successfully constructed based on both the special role of Er3+ and the special advantages of Zn2 GeO4 /g-C3 N4 heterojunction in the photocatalysis reduction of CO2 . Especially, Zn2 GeO4 :Er3+ /g-C3 N4 obtained by in situ synthesis is not only more conducive to the tight junction of Zn2 GeO4 and g-C3 N4 , but also more favorable for g-C3 N4 to anchor rare-earth atoms. Under visible-light irradiation, Zn2 GeO4 :Er3+ /g-C3 N4 shows more than five times enhancement in the catalytic efficiency compared to that of pure g-C3 N4 without any sacrificial agent in the photocatalytic reaction system. A series of theoretical and experimental results show that the charge density around Er, Ge, Zn, and O increases compared with Zn2 GeO4 :Er3+ , while the charge density around C decreases compared with g-C3 N4 . These results show that an efficient way of electron transfer is provided to promote charge separation, and the dual functions of CO2 molecular activation of Er3+ single atom and 4f levels as electron transport bridge are fully exploited. The pattern of combining single-atom catalysis and heterojunction opens up new methods for enhancing photocatalytic activity.","Han, Zhendong; Zhao, Yue; Gao, Guoyang; Zhang, Wanying; Qu, Yang; Zhu, Hongyang; Zhu, Peifen; Wang, Guofeng",Small,433,1

This paper proposes a real-time multi-view face mask detector with two main modules: face detection and face mask classification. The proposed architecture emphasizes light and robust feature extraction. The two-stage network makes it easy to focus on discriminating features on the facial area. The detector filters non-faces at the face detection stage and then classifies the facial regions into two categories. Both models were trained and tested on the benchmark datasets. As a result, the proposed detector obtains high performance with competitive accuracy from competitors.

In this study, an in-depth analysis of the factors influencing the spread of COVID-19 is offered mainly through big data in the European Union (EU) context. In doing so, the data of the first wave of the pandemic are assessed. Afterward, we evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 spread in specific countries and regions. Based on the existing literature, mobility is recognized as a significant direct factor affecting disease transmission. The same applies to the case of COVID-19. However, compared with the analysis of mobility itself, this paper explores more profound reasons that affect mobility, ranging from policy and economy to geographical and transportation factors. Specifically, this paper studies nine EU countries based on their population density and the degree of impact of the epidemic in the first six months (February to July 2020) of the pandemic. Our study aims to illustrate how policies, economies, and geographical locations (including transportation factors) directly or indirectly affect the spread of the novel coronavirus by applying the SEIR model to analyze all selected countries’ big data. The key findings of this research are: (1) the timeliness of relevant policies and the effectiveness of government implementation indirectly limit the spread of the epidemic by reducing population mobility;(2) a better medical level would contribute to detect, isolate, and treat patients, and help control the epidemic;and (3) the large land borders and developed transportation between countries exacerbate the spread of the COVID-19.

METHODS: Required testing volumes were developed using standard statistical methods based on test analytical performance, disease prevalence, desired precision, and population size. RESULTS: Widespread testing for individual health management cannot address surveillance needs. The number of people who must be sampled for public health surveillance and decision making, although not trivial, is potentially in the thousands for any given population or subpopulation, not millions. CONCLUSIONS: While the contributions of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 have received considerable attention, concerns abound regarding the availability of sufficient testing capacity to meet demand. Different testing goals require different numbers of tests and different testing strategies; testing strategies for national or local disease surveillance, including monitoring of prevalence, receive less attention. Our clinical laboratory and diagnostic infrastructure are capable of incorporating required volumes for many local, regional, and national public health surveillance studies into their current and projected testing capacity. However, testing for surveillance requires careful design and randomization to provide meaningful insights.","Hilborne, Lee H; Wagner, Zachary; Cabreros, Irineo; Brook, Robert H",Am J Clin Pathol,433,16

The aim of this study is to describe the management and results of the respective fracture types and different injury characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study performs a retrospective data analysis of 100 consecutive patients with a fracture of the proximal radius treated in a single high-volume pediatric trauma center. RESULTS: One hundred patients [mean age 7.5 years (1-15)] were documented with a fracture of the proximal radius between 3/2011 and 12/2019. The gender distribution was 62 girls and 38 boys. Twenty-seven patients had concomitant injuries. Conservative treatment was performed in 63 patients (Judet I = 27; II = 30; III = 6; Mason I = 2) using an above-the-elbow cast for 21 days (6-35). Surgical treatment was performed in 37 patients (Judet II = 3; III = 22; IV = 5; V = 7) using elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN). Open reduction was necessary in five cases, and additional immobilization was performed in 32 cases. Six complications occurred: loss of implant stability (n = 2), healing in malalignment, pseudarthrosis, radioulnar synostosis, and a persisting hypoesthesia at the thumb. As a result, two ESIN osteosynthesis were revised, and one radial head resection was performed. Loss of movement was seen in 11% of cases, overall Mayo elbow performance index (MEPI) was 99.8 (90-100), and none of the patients experienced negative impacts on activities of daily life. CONCLUSIONS: Proximal radial fractures occur predominately without dislocation. Good results are obtained with conservative treatment throughout. In cases with displacement exceeding growth-related correction, ESIN is the undisputed treatment of choice. Open surgery and long immobilization periods should be avoided whenever possible.","Dietzel, Markus; Scherer, Simon; Esser, Michael; Kirschner, Hans-Joachim; Fuchs, Jörg; Lieber, Justus",Arch. orthop. trauma surg,433,22

In this paper, we propose a fast, inexpensive and high-throughput approach using painless nasal-swab self-collection followed by direct RT-qPCR for the sensitive PCR detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This approach was validated in a large prospective cohort study of 1038 subjects, analysed simultaneously using (1) nasopharyngeal swabs obtained with the assistance of healthcare personnel and analysed by classic two-step RT-qPCR on RNA isolates and (2) nasal swabs obtained by self-collection and analysed with direct RT-qPCR. Of these subjects, 28.6% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swab sampling. Our direct RT-qPCR approach for self-collected nasal swabs performed well with results similar to those of the two-step RT-qPCR on RNA isolates, achieving 0.99 positive and 0.98 negative predictive values (cycle threshold [Ct] < 37). Our research also reports on grey-zone viraemia, including samples with near-cut-off Ct values (Ct &#8805; 37). In all investigated subjects (n = 20) with grey-zone viraemia, the ultra-small viral load disappeared within hours or days with no symptoms.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study carried out within the cohort of the Spanish HIV Research Network. Participants were consecutive PWH with plasma collected from 1st April to 30th September 2020. We determined SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Abs) in plasma. Illness severity (NIH criteria) was assessed by a review of medical records and, if needed, participant interviews. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of seropositivity among the following variables: sex, age, country of birth, education level, comorbidities (hypertension, chronic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, non-AIDS-related cancer, chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis), route of HIV acquisition, prior AIDS, CD4+ cell count, HIV viral load, nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (N [t]RTI) backbone, type of third antiretroviral drug, and month of sample collection. RESULTS: Of 1076 PWH (88.0% males, median age 43 years, 97.7% on antiretroviral therapy, median CD4+ 688 cells/mm3, 91.4% undetectable HIV viral load), SARS-CoV-2 Abs were detected in 91 PWH, a seroprevalence of 8.5% (95%CI 6.9-10.3%). Forty-five infections (45.0%) were asymptomatic. Variables independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were birth in Latin American countries versus Spain (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.30, 95%CI 1.41-3.76, p 0.001), and therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) versus tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/FTC as the N(t)RTI backbone (aOR 0.49, 95%CI 0.26-0.94, p 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Many SARS-CoV-2 infections among PWH were asymptomatic, and birth in Latin American countries increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin decreased COVID-19 mortality compared with the standard of care. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and MedRxiv were searched up to 25 July 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included published and unpublished studies comparing the mortality rate between patients treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin and patients managed with standard of care. PARTICIPANTS: Patients &#8805;18 years old with confirmed COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. METHODS: Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. Multiple subgroup analyses were conducted to assess drug safety. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 839 articles, of which 29 met our inclusion criteria. All studies except one were conducted on hospitalized patients and evaluated the effects of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. Among the 29 articles, three were randomized controlled trials, one was a non-randomized trial and 25 were observational studies, including 11 with a critical risk of bias and 14 with a serious or moderate risk of bias. After excluding studies with critical risk of bias, the meta-analysis included 11 932 participants for the hydroxychloroquine group, 8081 for the hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin group and 12 930 for the control group. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with mortality: pooled relative risk (RR) 0.83 (95% CI 0.65-1.06, n = 17 studies) for all studies and RR = 1.09 (95% CI 0.97-1.24, n = 3 studies) for randomized controlled trials. Hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin was associated with an increased mortality (RR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.04-1.54, n = 7 studies). We found similar results with a Bayesian meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine alone was not associated with reduced mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients but the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin significantly increased mortality.","Fiolet, Thibault; Guihur, Anthony; Rebeaud, Mathieu Edouard; Mulot, Matthieu; Peiffer-Smadja, Nathan; Mahamat-Saleh, Yahya",Clin. microbiol. infect,433,24

The goal was to evaluate the impact of different types of COVID-19 stressors (infection fears, lockdown, and economic stressors) on mental health and cognitive functioning. We used a sample of 262 Turkish adults. We administered an online questionnaire that included measures of COVID-19 traumatic stressors, PTSD, depression, anxiety, executive function deficits, and cumulative stressors and traumas (CST). The analyses included correlations, hierarchical regression, path analysis, and PROCESS mediation analysis. All COVID-19 traumatic stressors types and their cumulative load predicted PTSD, depression, anxiety, and executive function deficits after controlling for previous cumulative stressors and traumas and COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 lockdown's stressors were the strongest predictors, compared to COVID-19 fears and economic stressors. Path analysis and PROCESS mediation results indicated that COVID-19 traumatic stressors had direct effects on working memory deficits, direct and indirect effects on PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and indirect effects on inhibition deficits. Anxiety, depression, and inhibition deficits mediated its indirect effects on PTSD. The results have conceptual and clinical implications. COVID-19 continuous posttraumatic stress syndrome that includes comorbid PTSD, depression, anxiety, and executive function deficits is different and does not fit within the current trauma frameworks. There is a need for a paradigm shift in current stress and trauma frameworks to account for the COVID-19 continuous global stressors and for clinical innovations in intervention to help its victims.

Reported non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) allergies may predispose to use of stronger pain medications and potentially to OUD. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the clinical impact of reported NSAID allergy on OUD in patients with chronic back pain. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of adults receiving care at a tertiary healthcare system from 1/1/2013-12/31/2018. Back pain and OUD were identified using administrative data algorithms. We used propensity score matching and logistic regression to estimate the impact of self-reported NSAID adverse drug reactions (ADRs) on risk of OUD, adjusting for other relevant clinical information. RESULTS: Of 47,114 patients with chronic back pain, 3,620 (7.7%) had a reported NSAID ADR. In an adjusted propensity score matched analysis, patients with NSAID ADRs had higher odds (OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.07-1.67]) of developing OUD as compared to those without NSAID ADRs. Additional risk factors for OUD included younger age, male sex, Medicaid insurance, Medicare insurance, higher number of inpatient and outpatient visits in the prior year, and co-morbid anxiety and depression. Patients with listed NSAID ADRs also had higher odds of a documented opioid prescription during the study period (OR 1.22 [95% CI 1.11-1.34]). CONCLUSION: Adults with chronic back pain and reported NSAID ADRs are at higher risk of developing OUD and receiving opioid analgesics, even after accounting for co-morbidities and health care utilization. Allergy evaluation is critical for potential de-labeling of patients with reported NSAID allergies and chronic pain.","Li, Lily; Chang, Yuchiao; Song, Shuang; Losina, Elena; Costenbader, Karen H; Laidlaw, Tanya M",J. allergy clin. immunol,433,23

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 children with different severities and allergic status. METHODS: Data extracted from the electronic medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory and immunological results, and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID-19 children, were summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys (male-female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients. Most of the children were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were ground-glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections. Compared to children without pneumonia (manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper respiratory infection), children with pneumonia were associated with higher percentages of the comorbidity history, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum interleukins (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;. There were no differences in treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing, and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID-19 children had recovered except one death due to intussusception and sepsis. In 43 allergic children with COVID-19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%) was the major disease, followed by drug allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and asthma. Demographics and clinical features were not significantly different between allergic and nonallergic groups. Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared with all patients. Immunological profiles including circulating T, B, and NK lymphocyte subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels, and serum cytokines did not show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups. Neither eosinophil counts nor serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels showed a significant correlation with other immunological measures, such as other immunoglobulins, complements, lymphocyte subset numbers, and serum cytokine levels. CONCLUSION: Pediatric COVID-19 patients tended to have a mild clinical course. Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers than those without pneumonia. There was no difference between allergic and nonallergic COVID-19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, and laboratory and immunological findings. Allergy was not a risk factor for developing and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hardly influenced the disease course of COVID-19 in children.","Du, Hui; Dong, Xiang; Zhang, Jin-Jin; Cao, Yi-Yuan; Akdis, Mubeccel; Huang, Pei-Qi; Chen, Hong-Wei; Li, Ying; Liu, Guang-Hui; Akdis, Cezmi A; Lu, Xiao-Xia; Gao, Ya-Dong",Allergy,433,16

Using four subspecies of Drosophila mojavensis as a model, we identify two behaviorally active, male-specific pheromones. One functions as a conserved male antiaphrodisiac in all subspecies and acts via gustation. The second induces female receptivity via olfaction exclusively in the two subspecies that produce it. Genetic analysis of the cognate receptor for the olfactory pheromone indicates an important role for this sensory pathway in promoting sexual isolation of subspecies, in combination with auditory signals. Unexpectedly, the peripheral sensory pathway detecting this pheromone is conserved molecularly, physiologically, and anatomically across subspecies. These observations imply that subspecies-specific behaviors arise from differential interpretation of the same peripheral cue, reminiscent of sexually conserved detection but dimorphic interpretation of male pheromones in Drosophila melanogaster Our results reveal that, during incipient speciation, pheromone production, detection, and interpretation do not necessarily evolve in a coordinated manner.","Khallaf, Mohammed A; Auer, Thomas O; Grabe, Veit; Depetris-Chauvin, Ana; Ammagarahalli, Byrappa; Zhang, Dan-Dan; Lavista-Llanos, Sofía; Kaftan, Filip; Weißflog, Jerrit; Matzkin, Luciano M; Rollmann, Stephanie M; Löfstedt, Christer; Svatos, Ales; Dweck, Hany K M; Sachse, Silke; Benton, Richard; Hansson, Bill S; Knaden, Markus",Sci.

However, some others need special and emergency treatment to get rid of this widespread disease. Till now, there are numbers of proposed novel compounds as well as standards therapeutics agent existed for other conditions seems to have efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some which are being tested for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are validated that could be also efficient against this new coronavirus. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations introduced for 2019-nCoV specifically that be supported by high-level evidence. The main purpose of this paper is to review typical and ongoing treatments for coronavirus disease including home remedies, herbal medicine, chemical drugs, plasma therapy, and also vaccinies. In this regards, famous herbal medicines and common chemical drugs which are routinely to be prescribed for patients are introduced. Moreover, a section is assigned to the drug interactions and some outdated drugs which have been proved to be inefficient.

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and ozone (O3) have reported antimicrobial properties but few studies have examined associations with community infectivity of COVID-19. Research suggests UV light can be preventative while the effect of O3 is contested. We sought to determine the relationship between UV, O3, and COVID-19 incidence in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: In our time series analyses, we calculated daily incidence rates and reproductive number (Rt) from 34,975 cases between January and June 2020 across 34 Ontario Public Health Units. We used generalised linear models, adjusting for potential confounders, to calculate point estimates (PE) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for UV and O3. Analyses were further stratified by age groups and outbreaks at institutions versus community. RESULTS: We found that 1-week averaged UV was significantly associated with a 13% decrease (95% CI: 0.80-0.96) in overall COVID-19 Rt, per unit increase. A negative association with UV was also significant among community outbreaks (PE: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96) but not institutional outbreaks (PE: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.85-1.03). A positive association of O3 with COVID-19 incidence is strongly suggested among institutional outbreak cases (PE: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00-1.13). CONCLUSION: Our study found evidence to support the hypothesis that higher UV reduced transmission of COVID-19 and some evidence that ground-level O3 positively influenced COVID-19 transmission. Setting of infection should be strongly considered as a factor in future research. UV and O3 may explain some of COVID-19's seasonal behaviour.","To, Teresa; Zhang, Kimball; Maguire, Bryan; Terebessy, Emilie; Fong, Ivy; Parikh, Supriya; Zhu, Jingqin; Su, Yushan",Environ Res,433,16

The UK COVID-19 lockdown has had an impact on day-to-day behaviour, which may affect diabetes self-management and outcomes. We assessed whether sensor-based outcomes pre- and during lockdown periods were different in a cohort of glucose sensor users with T1D. METHODS: Data were collected from Freestyle Libre (FSL) or Dexcom G6 sensor users who remotely shared their data with the diabetes clinic web platform. Sensor metrics according to international consensus were analysed and compared between pre-lockdown period and 2 and 3 weeks into lockdown (periods 1 and 2). RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-nine T1D patients (baseline HbA1c 57 ± 14 mmol/mol) were identified as FSL (n = 190) or Dexcom G6 (n = 79) users. In patients with sensor use > 70% (N = 223), compared to pre-lockdown period percentage TIR 3.9-10 mM (TIR) significantly increased during period 1 (59.6 ± 18.2 vs. 57.5 ± 17.2%, p = 0.002) and period 2 (59.3 ± 18.3 vs. 57.5 ± 17.2%, p = 0.035). The proportion of patients achieving TIR &#8805; 70% increased from 23.3% pre-lockdown to 27.8% in period 1 and 30.5% in period 2. A higher proportion also achieved the recommended time below and above range, and coefficient of variation in periods 1 and 2. Dexcom G6 users had significantly lower % time below range (< 3.9 mM) compared to FSL users during both lockdown periods (period 1: Dexcom G6 vs. FSL: 1.8% vs. 4%; period 2: 1.4% vs. 4%, p < 0.005 for both periods). CONCLUSION: Sensor-based glycaemic outcomes in people with T1D in the current cohort improved during COVID-19 lockdown, which may be associated with positive changes in self-management strategies. Further work is required to evaluate long-term sustainability and support.","Prabhu Navis, Joshi; Leelarathna, Lalantha; Mubita, Womba; Urwin, Andrea; Rutter, Martin K; Schofield, Jonathan; Thabit, Hood",Acta diabetol,433,16

These findings could inform intervention efforts aimed at curbing increases in substance use during periods of societal stress. Methods: We analyzed Wave 3 (W3; September-December 2019) and Wave 4 (W4; March-May 2020) from the Vape shop Advertising, Place characteristics and Effects Surveillance (VAPES), a 2-year, five-wave longitudinal study of young adults across six metropolitan areas.

Results: In this sample (N = 1084, Mage=24.76, SD = 4.70; 51.8% female; 73.6% White; 12.5% Hispanic), W3/W4 past 30-day use prevalence was: 29.1% cigarettes (19.4% increased/26.4% decreased), 36.5% e-cigarettes (23.2% increased/28.6% decreased), 49.4% marijuana (27.2% increased/21.2% decreased), and 84.8% alcohol (32.9% increased/20.7% decreased). Multivariate regressions indicated that, greater increases were predicted by: for e-cigarettes, greater ACEs; and for alcohol, greater depression. Among those with low resilience, predictors included: for e-cigarettes, greater depression; and for marijuana, greater ACEs. Conclusions: Interventions to reduce substance use during societal stressors should target both risk and protective factors, particularly resilience.","Romm, Katelyn F; Patterson, Brooke; Crawford, Natalie D; Posner, Heather; West, Carly D; Wedding, DeEnna; Horn, Kimberly; Berg, Carla J",Subst Abus,433,16

Use of avoidance coping was associated with all three psychological responses (perceived stress, traumatic stress, and stigma) across the two timepoints. Compared to baseline, specific factors associated with perceived stress and traumatic stress at timepoint 2 were living alone, less problem solving, and seeking social support.

Satisfaction with online learning is a significant aspect of promoting successful educational processes. This study aimed to identify factors affecting student and faculty satisfaction with online learning during the new normal. Online questionnaires were emailed to students (n = 370) and faculty (n = 81) involved in online learning during the pandemic. The questionnaires included closed- and open-ended questions and were organised into two parts: socio-demographic information and satisfaction with online learning. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the responses to the satisfaction scales. Students' and faculty responses to the open-ended questions were analysed using the thematic analysis method. The response rate was 97.8% for students and 86.4% for faculty. Overall satisfaction among students was 41.3% compared to 74.3% for faculty. The highest areas of satisfaction for students were communication and flexibility, whereas 92.9% of faculty were satisfied with students' enthusiasm for online learning. Technical problems led to reduced student satisfaction, while faculty were hampered by the higher workload and the required time to prepare the teaching and assessment materials. Study-load and workload, enhancing engagement, and technical issues (SWEET) were the themes that emerged from the thematic analysis as affecting student and faculty satisfaction. Adopting a combination synchronous and asynchronous approach, incorporating different applications to engage students, and timely feedback are imperative to increasing student satisfaction, while institutional support and organisational policy could enhance faculty satisfaction.","Elshami, Wiam; Taha, Mohamed H; Abuzaid, Mohamed; Saravanan, Coumaravelou; Al Kawas, Sausan; Abdalla, Mohamed Elhassan",Med Educ Online,433,1

A better understanding of mechanisms underpinning virus-associated inflammation is required to develop effective therapeutics. Here, we discover that SARS-CoV-2 replicates rapidly in lung epithelial cells despite triggering a robust innate immune response through the activation of cytoplasmic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5. The inflammatory mediators produced during epithelial cell infection can stimulate primary human macrophages to enhance cytokine production and drive cellular activation. Critically, this can be limited by abrogating RNA sensing or by inhibiting downstream signalling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 further exacerbates the local inflammatory environment when macrophages or epithelial cells are primed with exogenous inflammatory stimuli. We propose that RNA sensing of SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelium is a key driver of inflammation, the extent of which is influenced by the inflammatory state of the local environment, and that specific inhibition of innate immune pathways may beneficially mitigate inflammation-associated COVID-19.","Thorne, Lucy G; Reuschl, Ann-Kathrin; Zuliani-Alvarez, Lorena; Whelan, Matthew V X; Turner, Jane; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Jolly, Clare; Towers, Greg J",EMBO J,433,20

We first discuss methods that exploit spatial structure to account for unmeasured confounding variables. We then discuss causal analysis in the presence of spatial interference including several common assumptions used to reduce the complexity of the interference patterns under consideration. These methods are extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential outcomes framework with Granger causality and to geostatistical analyses involving spatial random fields of treatments and responses. The methods are introduced in the context of observational environmental and epidemiological studies and are compared using both a simulation study and analysis of the effect of ambient air pollution on COVID-19 mortality rate.

Therefore, their prompt detection is mandatory for successful patient treatment. Solid phase red cell adherence (SPRCA) assay allows for platelet antibody detection widely. However, preparation of fresh platelets with HLA-I and human platelet antigens (HPA)1-5,15 genotyped as target cells is inconvenient and fresh platelets have a short shelf life. In this study, the lyophilised human platelets for antibody detection in SPRCA were prepared. Firstly, platelets were resuspended in lyophilisation buffer and freeze-dried. Then the characteristics of lyophilised platelet were analysed. Rehydrated platelets were recovered with a mean rate of 80.91% ± 2.87%, and still retained spherical morphology. Indirect flow cytometry showed that glycoproteins IIb/IIIa, Ia/IIa, Ib/IX, IV, CD109, and HLA class I were present on the surface of the lyophilised platelets at a comparable level to that of fresh platelets. The consistent results obtained with WHO reference reagents containing anti-HPA-1a, anti-HPA-3a, and anti-HPA-5b, as well as clinical samples from the same donors containing anti-HLA antibodies when reacting with lyophilised versus fresh platelets confirmed good antigenicity preservation of platelets after freeze-drying. Further investigation showed that the lyophilised platelets could be stored at 2-8 °C for up to 14 months and the reconstituted suspension was stable for 48 h. Therefore, lyophilised platelets can be a convenient alternative to fresh platelets to use for anti-platelet antibody detection in SPRCA tests.","Duan, Shengbao; Wang, Mingyuan; Ding, Shaohua; Chen, Yezhou; Wei, Shuangshi; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Chun; Li, Yong; Wang, Hongmei",J Immunol Methods,433,26

ARDS associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 infection has been shown to have 45% mortality, secondary to elevated inflammatory cytokines2. Prolonged duration of ECMO leads to poor short term neurological function 3. However there is lack of data regarding long term quality of life among patients who undergo ECMO for ARDS. We plan to conduct a retrospective study among patients undergoing ECMO to assess their quality of life. Methods: Retrospectives chart review and phone interviews conducted approximately 6 months after receiving ECMO at New York University-Long Island Hospital. 22 patients have received veno-venous or veno-arterial ECMO since March 2020. Phone interviews of 10 patients have been conducted. Welch two sample t test will be used to detect differences between activities of daily living (ADL) between prolonged ECMO (more than 20 days) and routine ECMO (less than 20 days) groups. Association between ECMO parameters, laboratory values and ADL will be evaluated by using a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Result will be considered statistically significant if p&lt;0.05 Results:11 out of 22 patients have been discharged from hospital, 1 patient continues to receive ECMO. Initial analysis of our data shows that patients undergoing prolonged ECMO have a low mean score of 14 for activities of daily living (bathing, independent use of toilet, cooking and eating meals, shopping, driving, and use of supplemental oxygen) when compared to a mean score of 30 among routine ECMO. Mean Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and D Dimer levels 24 hours prior to undergoing cannulation for ECMO among prolonged ECMO group was higher when compared to routine ECMO group.

387360,387360,387360,Covid-19,15.625347,3.76054,2020,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19, consists of an assembly of proteins that determine its infectious and immunological behavior, as well as its response to therapeutics. Major structural biology efforts on these proteins have already provided essential insights into the mode of action of the virus, as well as avenues for structure-based drug design. However, not all of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, or regions thereof, have a well-defined three-dimensional structure, and as such might exhibit ambiguous, dynamic behaviour that is not evident from static structure representations, nor from molecular dynamics simulations using these structures. MAIN: We present a website ( https://bio2byte.be/sars2/ ) that provides protein sequence-based predictions of the backbone and side-chain dynamics and conformational propensities of these proteins, as well as derived early folding, disorder, ß-sheet aggregation, protein-protein interaction and epitope propensities. These predictions attempt to capture the inherent biophysical propensities encoded in the sequence, rather than context-dependent behaviour such as the final folded state. In addition, we provide the biophysical variation that is observed in homologous proteins, which gives an indication of the limits of their functionally relevant biophysical behaviour. CONCLUSION: The https://bio2byte.be/sars2/ website provides a range of protein sequence-based predictions for 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, enabling researchers to form hypotheses about their possible functional modes of action.","Kagami, Luciano; Roca-Martínez, Joel; Gavaldá-García, Jose; Ramasamy, Pathmanaban; Feenstra, K Anton; Vranken, Wim F",BMC Mol Cell Biol,433,14

We hypothesized that intraoperative large-volume autologous whole blood (AWB) collection and reinfusion improves viscoelastic coagulation parameters. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective observational study of cardiac surgery patients at the University of Maryland Medical Center between December 2017 and August 2019. Rotational thromboelastometry parameters were compared between AWB and control groups (n = 25 in each group) at three time points: T1, baseline; T2, on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) after the cross-clamp removal; and T3, 30-60 minutes after protamine administration. The study's primary outcomes were whole blood viscoelastic coagulation parameters that included EXTEM clotting time (CT), FIBTEM amplitude at 10 minutes, and EXTEM amplitude at 10 minutes (EXTEM-A10 ). Chest tube drainage and allogeneic transfusion were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Reinfusion of AWB after CPB resulted in a significantly shorter EXTEM CT; mean difference, -11.4 seconds (-21.4 to -1.4; P = .03). It also resulted in a greater percentage increase in EXTEM A10 from T2 to T3; mean difference, 7.8% (95% CI, 1.1%-14.5%; P = .02). Statistical significance was not found in 24-hour chest tube drainage. CONCLUSION: Large-volume AWB collection and reinfusion are feasible in selected cardiac surgical patients, and may be associated with prohemostatic effects according to thromboelastometry, warranting further investigation with a prospective randomized study.","Henderson, Reney A; Judd, Miranda; Strauss, Erik R; Gammie, James S; Mazzeffi, Michael A; Taylor, Bradley S; Tanaka, Kenichi A",Transfusion,433,20

Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes in patients with diabetes in whom COVID-19 was confirmed or clinically diagnosed (with typical features on lung imaging and symptoms) and their association with glucose-lowering or blood pressure-lowering medications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective study involving 904 patients with COVID-19 (136 with diabetes, mostly type 2 diabetes), clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared between the group with diabetes and the group without diabetes, and between groups taking different medications. Logistic regression was used to explore risk factors associated with mortality or poor prognosis. RESULTS: The proportion of comorbid diabetes is similar between cases of confirmed and of clinically diagnosed COVID-19. Risk factors for higher mortality of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.04, 1.15] per year increase; P = 0.001) and elevated C-reactive protein (aOR 1.12 [95% CI 1.00, 1.24]; P = 0.043).

Clinical outcomes of those who use an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker (ARB) were comparable with those of patients who do not use ACEI/ARB among COVID-19 patients with diabetes and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: C-reactive protein may help to identify patients with diabetes who are at greater risk of dying during hospitalization. Older patients with diabetes were prone to death related to COVID-19. Attention needs to be paid to patients with diabetes and COVID-19 who use insulin.

Current literature on the abundance and distribution of ACE2 protein in the human respiratory tract is controversial. We examined the effect of age and lung injury on ACE2 protein expression in rodent and non-human primate (NHP) models. We also examined ACE2 expression in human tissues with and without coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). ACE2 expression was detected at very low levels in preterm, but was absent in full-term and adult NHP lung homogenates. This pattern of ACE2 expression contrasted with that of transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), which was significantly increased in full-term newborn and adult NHP lungs compared to preterm NHP lungs. ACE2 expression was not detected in NHP lungs with cigarette smoke-induced airway disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Murine lungs lacked basal ACE2 immunoreactivity, but responded to hyperoxia, bacterial infection, and allergen exposure with new ACE2 expression in bronchial epithelial cells. In human specimens, robust ACE2 immunoreactivity was detected in ciliated epithelial cells in paranasal sinus specimens, while ACE2 expression was detected only in rare type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in control lungs. In autopsy specimens from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, ACE2 was detected in rare ciliated epithelial and endothelial cells in the trachea, but not in the lung. There was robust expression of ACE2 expression in F344/N rat nasal mucosa and lung specimens, which authentically recapitulated the ACE2 expression pattern in human paranasal sinus specimens. Thus, ACE2 protein expression demonstrates a significant gradient between upper and lower respiratory tract in humans and is scarce in the lung. This pattern of ACE2 expression supports the notion of sinonasal epithelium being the main entry site for SARS-CoV-2 but raises further questions on the pathogenesis and cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Soni, S.; Jiang, YuJie Tesfaigzi Y.; Hornick, J.

NMR diffusometry with chemical resolution is used to identify unexpected loading- and composition-dependent anomalous diffusion in water/cyclohexane mixtures confined to solid nanoporous glass (NPG) hosts. Diffusion NMR results indicate that data obtained on pure-component liquids in confinement cannot be extrapolated to their nonideal liquid mixtures confined in the same solid host. Loading-dependent data must be obtained on each component in the confined mixture in order to determine which of the liquid components exhibits chemical affinity for the host and, conversely, which of the components exhibits anomalous diffusivity. Most notably, NMR diffusometry revealed that cyclohexane diffusivity varied by 2 orders of magnitude in a water-rich mixture depending on the total fluid loading in the NPG host, ranging from anomalously high diffusivities that significantly exceeded that for pure cyclohexane in NPG at low fluid loadings to kinetically trapped sequestration at high fluid loadings. NMR diffusometry indicates that nonideal solution behavior in fluids confined within nanoporous hosts may have practical implications for enhanced oil recovery methods. Specifically, kinetic trapping of hydrocarbons in water-flooding regimes can result from complex liquid-vapor equilibrium that is significantly perturbed from that which exists in bulk or microporous confinement.","Erfani, Amir; Szutkowski, Kosma; Aichele, Clint P; White, Jeffery L",Langmuir,433,16

This case series addresses cognition in post-COVID-19 patient by describing three patients in acute rehabilitation to inform a model of cognitive sequelae of COVID-19. Methods: Three English-speaking inpatients with severe symptoms and long-term intensive care unit (ICU) treatment are described. All patients had a premorbid history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and experienced delirium and hypoxemia when hospitalized. Patient 1 is a 62-year-old male with 15 years of education with additional history of obstructive sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes. Patient 2 is a 73-year-old female with 12 years of education with a premorbid medical history of alcohol use disorder and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Patient 3 is a 75-year-old male with 14 years of education. No patients had premorbid psychiatric histories. Results: The three patients demonstrated deficits on formal neuropsychological testing, particularly with encoding and verbal fluency. Memory measures improved with a more structured story memory task compared to a less-structured verbal list-learning task, suggesting executive dysfunction impacted learning. None of the patients demonstrated rapid forgetting of information. Two patients endorsed new depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: The results suggest evidence for neurocognitive deficits after severe COVID-19 infection, particularly in encoding and verbal fluency. These results were interpreted with caution given the limited number of patients and the telephone-based battery. The specific mechanism that caused these cognitive deficits in these individuals remains unclear. A proposed three-stage model of cognitive dysfunction is described to help guide future research.","Whiteside, Douglas M; Oleynick, Victoria; Holker, Erin; Waldron, Eric J; Porter, James; Kasprzak, Michael",Clin Neuropsychol,433,24

Reviewing the adequacy of medication safety practices during the COVID-19 pandemic is critical to informing responses to future pandemics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate medication safety practices at a height of both COVID-19 cases and hydroxychloroquine use. METHODS: This was a multicentre observational point prevalence study. Adult inpatients receiving hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 between March 22 and 28, 2020 were included. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients receiving appropriate QTc monitoring. Secondary outcomes included QTc prolongation, early discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine and ventricular arrhythmias. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 59% (167/284) of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine received appropriate QTc monitoring. QTc prolongation occurred in 25%. Hydroxychloroquine was prematurely discontinued in 1.4% of patients, all due to QTc prolongation. Ventricular arrhythmia occurred in 1.1%. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Medication safety practices were suboptimal with regard to hydroxychloroquine monitoring at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Preparation for future pandemics should devote considerable attention to medication safety.","Smoke, Steven M; Leach, Henry; Leonida, Nicole; Raja, Karan; Shah, Monica; Patel, Vishal; Patel, Gargi; Daniel, Nicole M; Gerges, Jessica; Patel, Akshar",J. clin. pharm. ther,433,16

However, the presence of bony structures such as ribs and clavicles can obscure subtle abnormalities, resulting in diagnostic errors. This study aims to build a deep learning-based bone suppression model that identifies and removes these occluding bony structures in frontal CXRs to assist in reducing errors in radiological interpretation, including DL workflows, related to detecting manifestations consistent with tuberculosis (TB). Several bone suppression models with various deep architectures are trained and optimized using the proposed combined loss function and their performances are evaluated in a cross-institutional test setting. The best-performing model is used to suppress bones in the publicly available Shenzhen and Montgomery TB CXR collections. A VGG-16 model is pretrained on a large collection of publicly available CXRs. The CXR-pretrained model is then fine-tuned individually on the non-bone-suppressed and bone-suppressed CXRs of Shenzhen and Montgomery TB CXR collections to classify them as showing normal lungs or TB manifestations. The performances of these models are compared using several performance metrics, analyzed for statistical significance, and their predictions are qualitatively interpreted through class-selective relevance maps. It is observed that the models trained on bone-suppressed CXRs significantly outperformed (p<0.05) the models trained on the non-bone-suppressed CXRs. Models trained on bone-suppressed CXRs improved detection of TB-consistent findings and resulted in compact clustering of the data points in the feature space signifying that bone suppression improved the model sensitivity toward TB classification.","Rajaraman, Sivaramakrishnan; Zamzmi, Ghada; Folio, Les; Alderson, Philip; Antani, Sameer",,433,21

A recent example of the impact of sudden extreme events on carbon emissions occurred in the 2008 global financial crisis, in which carbon emissions droped in 2009, but jumped in 2010. This study is aimed to discuss how to prevent the retaliatory growth of carbon emissions post COVID-19 through learning the lessons from analysis of short-term and long-term drivers of carbon emissions. This study explored the short-term (annual) effects (population scale. affluence level, carbon intensity, energy intensity) of changes in carbon emissions by decomposing carbon emissions in the world, different income groups and selected countries before and after the 2008 financial crisis using LMDI technique. In addition, this study explored the long-term effects (energy consumption per capita, energy structure, energy intensity, foreign direct investment, and trade openness) of changes in carbon emissions by decomposing carbon emission in the world and different income groups from 1990 to 2014 using VAR technique. The decomposition results of short-term drivers of carbon emission uncovered that the deterioration in energy efficiency (increase in energy intensity) was the main reason for the retaliatory rebound in carbon emissions post-2008 financial crisis, especially in high-income countries. The decomposition results of long-term drivers of carbon emission uncovered that trade openness contributed to reduce carbon emission in the world and the incomes groups in the long term, although trade openness led to increase in carbon emission in developing countries in the short term. To prevent retaliatory rebound of carbon emissions, what we should learn two lessons from the decomposition of carbon emission: improving energy efficiency, and expanding trade openness. Unfortunately, energy efficiency has been neglected in the economic recovery plans to respond to COVID-19 of various countries, especially developed countries, and worse, trade protectionism is on the rise, especially in developed countries. Therefore, we are pessimistic about preventing a retaliatory rebound in carbon emissions post-COVID-19 for now.","Wang, Qiang; Wang, Shasha",Sci Total Environ,433,1

We hypothesized that patients whose lung injury resolves quickly, as measured by time to liberation from mechanical ventilation, have a higher percentage of Tregs amongst CD4+ T cells in either airway, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or peripheral blood samples. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and collected serial samples, the first within 72 h of ARDS diagnosis (day 0) and the second 48-96 h later (day 3). We analyzed immune cell populations and cytokines in BAL, tracheal aspirates and peripheral blood, as well as cytokines in plasma, obtained at the time of bronchoscopy. The study cohort was divided into fast resolvers (FR; n = 8) and slow resolvers (SR; n = 5), based on the median number of days until first extubation for all participants (n = 13). The primary measure was the percentage of CD4+ T cells that were Tregs. RESULTS: The BAL of FR contained more Tregs than SR. This finding did not extend to Tregs in tracheal aspirates or blood. BAL Tregs expressed more of the full-length FOXP3 than a splice variant missing exon 2 compared to Tregs in simultaneously obtained peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: Tregs are present in the bronchoalveolar space during ARDS. A greater percentage of CD4+ cells were Tregs in the BAL of FR than SR. Tregs may play a role in the resolution of ARDS, and enhancing their numbers or functions may be a therapeutic target.","Norton, Dustin L; Ceppe, Agathe; Tune, Miriya K; McCravy, Matthew; Devlin, Thomas; Drummond, M Bradley; Carson, Shannon S; Vincent, Benjamin G; Hagan, Robert S; Dang, Hong; Doerschuk, Claire M; Mock, Jason R",J Transl Med,433,20

The virus surfaced towards the end of December 2019 in Wuhan, China where earlier SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) had also surfaced in 2003. Unlike SARS, SARS-CoV-2 (a close relative of the SARS virus) created a pandemic, and as of February 24 2021, caused 112,778,672 infections and 2,499,252 deaths world-wide. Despite the best efforts of scientists, no drugs against COVID-19 are yet in sight; five vaccines have received emergency approval in various countries, but it would be a difficult task to vaccinate twice the world population of 8 billion. The objective of the present study was to evaluate through in silico screening a number of phytochemicals in Allium cepa (onion) regarding their ability to bind to the main protease of COVID-19 known as the 3C-like protease or 3CLpro, (PDB ID: 6LU7), 3CLpro of SARS (PDB ID: 3M3V), and human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), [PDB ID: 1R42], which functions as a receptor for entry of the virus into humans. Molecular docking (blind docking, that is docking not only against any target pocket) were done with the help of AutoDockVina. It was observed that of the twenty-two phytochemicals screened, twelve showed good binding affinities to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, the compounds also demonstrated good binding affinities to ACE-2. It is therefore very likely that the binding affinities shown by these compounds against both 3CLpro and ACE-2 merit further study for their potential use as therapeutic agents.","Bondhon, T A; Fatima, A; Jannat, K; Hasan, A; Jahan, R; Nissapatorn, V; Wiart, C; Pereira, M L; Rahmatullah, M",Trop Biomed,433,16

While most studies have focused on prevailing negative consequences, potential positive shifts in everyday life have received less attention. Thus, we examined the actual and perceived overall impact of the COVID-19 crisis on work and private life, and the consequences for mental well-being (MWB), and self-rated health (SRH) in German and Swiss employees. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected via an online questionnaire from 2118 German and Swiss employees recruited through an online panel service (18-65 years, working at least 20 h/week, various occupations). The sample provides a good representation of the working population in both countries. Using logistic regression, we analyzed how sociodemographic factors and self-reported changes in work and private life routines were associated with participants' perceived overall impact of the COVID-19 crisis on work and private life. Moreover, we explored how the perceived impact and self-reported changes were associated with MWB and SRH. RESULTS: About 30% of employees reported that their work and private life had worsened, whereas about 10% reported improvements in work and 13% in private life. Mandatory short-time work was strongly associated with perceived negative impact on work life, while work from home, particularly if experienced for the first time, was strongly associated with a perceived positive impact on work life. Concerning private life, younger age, living alone, reduction in leisure time, and changes in quantity of caring duties were strongly associated with perceived negative impact. In contrast, living with a partner or family, short-time work, and increases in leisure time and caring duties were associated with perceived positive impact on private life. Perceived negative impact of the crisis on work and private life and mandatory short-time work were associated with lower MWB and SRH. Moreover, perceived positive impact on private life and an increase in leisure time were associated with higher MWB. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show the differential impact of the COVID-19 crisis on people's work and private life as well as the consequences for MWB and SRH. This may inform target groups and situation-specific interventions to ameliorate the crisis.","Tusl, Martin; Brauchli, Rebecca; Kerksieck, Philipp; Bauer, Georg Friedrich",BMC Public Health,433,20

We describe the positive opportunities that the COVID-19 crisis has opened to reduce the sources of waste for our health systems: failures of care delivery, failures of care coordination, overtreatment or low-value care, administrative complexity, pricing failures and fraud and abuse. We argue that current events can canalize some very needy reforms to make our systems more sustainable. As always, political policy windows are temporarily open, and so swift action is needed, otherwise the opportunity will pass and the vested interests will come back to pursue their own agendas.

Quercetin has strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral properties, and it is characterized by a very high safety profile, exerted in animals and in humans. Like most other polyphenols, quercetin shows a very low rate of oral absorption and its clinical use is considered by most of modest utility. Quercetin in a delivery-food grade system with sunflower phospholipids (Quercetin Phytosome(®), QP) increases its oral absorption up to 20-fold. METHODS: In the present prospective, randomized, controlled, and open-label study, a daily dose of 1000 mg of QP was investigated for 30 days in 152 COVID-19 outpatients to disclose its adjuvant effect in treating the early symptoms and in preventing the severe outcomes of the disease. RESULTS: The results revealed a reduction in frequency and length of hospitalization, in need of non-invasive oxygen therapy, in progression to intensive care units and in number of deaths. The results also confirmed the very high safety profile of quercetin and suggested possible anti-fatigue and pro-appetite properties. CONCLUSION: QP is a safe agent and in combination with standard care, when used in early stage of viral infection, could aid in improving the early symptoms and help in preventing the severity of COVID-19 disease. It is suggested that a double-blind, placebo-controlled study should be urgently carried out to confirm the results of our study.","Di Pierro, F.; Derosa, G.; Maffioli, P.; Bertuccioli, A.; Togni, S.; Riva, A.; Allegrini, P.; Khan, A.; Khan, S.; Khan, B.

Our article aims of comparing and interpreting between-country trends of mortality rate, case-fatality and all-cause excess mortality. METHODS: We used data from open databases (Our World in Data mostly) for comparing mortality of eleven western countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, UK, USA). Between-country trends in mortality rate and case-fatality (both including deaths for COVID-19 as numerator and therefore labelled as COVID-19 mortality metrics) and all-cause excess mortality (i.e. observed deaths during the epidemic compared with those expected based on mortality in the same periods of previous years) were compared. RESULTS: Although Belgium ranks first in mortality from COVID-19 (possibly due to the broadest criterion for attributing a death to COVID-19), it does not rank first for all-cause excess mortality. Conversely, compared with Belgium, the UK, Italy and Spain have reported lower COVID-19 mortality (possibly due to the narrower definitions for a COVID-19 death) but higher all-cause excess mortality. Germany and Austria are the unique countries for which COVID-19 mortality, case-fatality and all-cause excess mortality consistently exhibited the lowest rates. CONCLUSION: Between-country heterogeneity of COVID-19 mortality metrics could be largely explained by differences of criteria for attributing a death to COVID-19; in age/comorbidity structures; in policies for identifying asymptomatic people affected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. All-cause excess mortality is recommended as a more reliable metric for comparing countries.","Corrao, Giovanni; Rea, Federico; Blangiardo, Gian Carlo",J Hypertens,433,21

The phenotypical diversity of the CD8+ T-cell population has made it difficult to identify the impact of aging on CD8+ T-cell subsets associated with diminished CD8+ T-cell responses. Here we identify a novel human CD8+ T-cell subset characterized by expression of Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR+ ) and CD45RA (RA+ ). These KIR+ RA+ T cells accumulated with age in the blood of healthy individuals (20-82 years of age, n = 50), expressed high levels of aging-related markers of T-cell regulation, and were functionally capable of suppressing proliferation of other CD8+ T cells. Moreover, KIR+ RA+ T cells were a major T-cell subset becoming activated in older adults suffering from an acute respiratory viral infection (n = 36), including coronavirus and influenza virus infection. In addition, older adults with influenza A infection showed that higher activation status of their KIR+ RA+ T cells associated with longer duration of respiratory symptoms. Together, our data indicate that KIR+ RA+ T cells are a unique human T-cell subset with regulatory properties that may explain susceptibility to viral respiratory disease at old age.","Pieren, Daan K J; Smits, Noortje A M; Hoeboer, Jeroen; Kandiah, Vinitha; Postel, Rimke J; Mariman, Rob; van Beek, Josine; van Baarle, Debbie; de Wit, Jelle; Guichelaar, Teun",Aging Cell,433,29

We evaluated the stability of flocked swabs inoculated with SARS-CoV-2-containing specimen incubated dry (i.e. without transport medium) at room temperature. METHODS: A pool of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen was used to inoculate flocked swabs. Five swabs were placed immediately into UTM following inoculation, and tested immediately (day 0). Fifteen of the swabs were placed into sterile 15 mL conical tubes and incubated at room temperature for one, two, or seven days. Following incubation, swabs were hydrated in separate vials of UTM and tested. This protocol was repeated for viral transport media (VTM) and saline. As a comparison, a series of swabs was prepared and tested in parallel, but stored in the corresponding liquid transport media (UTM, VTM, or saline) and incubated at room temperature. Testing was performed at 1, 2, and 7 days post inoculation in duplicate. All molecular testing was performed using the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: All dry swabs tested at days 1, 2, and 7 provided results that were within two cycle thresholds (Cts) of the average Ct values for swabs hydrated in the same media and tested on day 0.

Methods: Sample collection was conducted based on the standard operating procedure. Tianlong automatic magnetic bead nucleic acid extraction reagent was used for RNA extraction. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using four approved COVID-19 nucleic acid detection kits. Related epidemiological data of the cases were collected. One-way analysis of variance and non-parametric test for inter-group differences analysis were conducted using SPSS25.0 software. Results: A total of 162 PCR tests were completed for novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection in 123 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Eleven PCR results were positive for a single target gene and 10 of which were positive for nucleocapsid protein (N) gene. Nineteen cases were tested with two kinds of nucleic acid detection kits and the results of different detection kits were different. Different types of samples were collected form 13 cases for nucleic acid detection and the results showed that the Ct value of sputum sample was lower than that of throat swab sample. No significant difference in Ct values of throat swab samples was observed among patients with different clinical symptoms (P Ct-N=0.797, P Ct-ORF1a/b=0.551). The 123 cases were divided into different groups according to the time interval between the onset date and the date of the first positive detection of viral nucleic acid. No significant difference in Ct values of throat swab samples was observed among different time interval groups (P Ct-N=0.373, P Ct-ORF1a/b=0.058). Conclusions: Sputum samples were better than upper respiratory tract samples for viral nucleic acid detection. The sensitivity of N gene detection was higher, but re-sampling was needed when the result was positive for the single target N gene. Appropriate detection kits should be selected according to the actual needs, and samples should be collected at multiple time points, in multiple types and form multiple sites for detection.","Li, Xiaoyan; Gao, Xin; Guo, Liru; Lyu, Likun; Lei, Yue; Dong, Xiaochun; Kong, Mei; Zou, Ming; Li, Wen; Su, Xu",Chin.

When combined, these factors may affect quality and life and increase the risk of different diseases. Therefore, assessment of physical activity levels should be encouraged to monitor and identify those at a higher risk of inactivity. Smart technology is a promising tool to assess physical activity and health, and may be particularly useful during a period of general lockdown. METHODS: An online survey was developed and shared among the Italian general population to collect data about physical activity and daily routine changes between January 2020 and the lockdown period from 23rd to 29th of March. Participants were asked to provide data such as daily step count (Steps) or heart rate (HR) measured and collected by their smart technology devices. RESULTS: Four hundred participants were included in the final analysis. During the lockdown, the number of steps dropped from 8,284±4,390 to 3,294±3,994 steps (p< 0.001), while mean peak HR decreased from 61.3±18.2% to 55.9±17.3% (p< 0.001).

Dysregulated metabolism might lead to excessive inflammatory and autoimmune responses as observed in severe and long COVID-19 patients. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 modulates cellular metabolism and reduces autophagy. Accordingly, compound-driven induction of autophagy limits SARS-CoV-2 propagation. In detail, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells show accumulation of key metabolites, activation of autophagy inhibitors (AKT1, SKP2) and reduction of proteins responsible for autophagy initiation (AMPK, TSC2, ULK1), membrane nucleation, and phagophore formation (BECN1, VPS34, ATG14), as well as autophagosome-lysosome fusion (BECN1, ATG14 oligomers). Consequently, phagophore-incorporated autophagy markers LC3B-II and P62 accumulate, which we confirm in a hamster model and lung samples of COVID-19 patients. Single-nucleus and single-cell sequencing of patient-derived lung and mucosal samples show differential transcriptional regulation of autophagy and immune genes depending on cell type, disease duration, and SARS-CoV-2 replication levels. Targeting of autophagic pathways by exogenous administration of the polyamines spermidine and spermine, the selective AKT1 inhibitor MK-2206, and the BECN1-stabilizing anthelmintic drug niclosamide inhibit SARS-CoV-2 propagation in vitro with IC50 values of 136.7, 7.67, 0.11, and 0.13 µM, respectively.

Here, we propose a retrospective methodology to estimate daily infections from daily deaths, because those are usually more accurately documented. Given the incubation period, the time from illness onset to death, and the case fatality ratio, the date of death can be estimated from the date of infection. We apply this idea conversely to estimate infections from deaths. This methodology is applied to Spain and its 19 administrative regions. Our results showed that probable daily infections during the first wave were between 35 and 42 times more than those officially documented on 14 March, when the national government decreed a national lockdown and 9 times more than those documented by the updated version of the official data. The national lockdown had a strong effect on the growth rate of virus transmission, which began to decrease immediately. Finally, the first inferred infection in Spain is about 43 days before the official data were available during the first wave. The current official data show delays of 15-30 days in the first infection relative to the inferred infections in 63% of the regions. In summary, we propose a methodology that allows reinterpretation of official daily infections, improving data accuracy in infection magnitude and dates because it assimilates valuable information from the National Seroprevalence Studies.","García-García, David; Vigo, María Isabel; Fonfría, Eva S; Herrador, Zaida; Navarro, Miriam; Bordehore, Cesar",Sci Rep,433,26

This study aims to assess the major implications of COVID-19 on our department, focusing on the blood transfusion chain and therapies, in order to support transfusion specialists in seeking efficient ways to face similar future emergencies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study compares our Transfusion Medicine Unit data collected between February and May 2020 with the same period in 2017-2019. Data on red blood cells and platelets donations, transfusions and clinical procedures were collected as aggregates from our internal electronic database. RESULTS: During the lockdown, donor centres were re-organized to reduce the risk of contagion and avoid unnecessary blood collection. Blood donations were re-scheduled to meet the decrease in elective surgery; consequently, plateletapheresis was implemented to supply the reduction of buffycoat-derived platelets. Transfusions significantly decreased together with orthopaedic and vascular surgery, while they were only marginally diminished for both cancer and onco-haematological patients. Reduced procedures for inpatients and outpatients were matched by remote medicine, addressing the need of a constant healthcare support for patients with chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The described measures were adopted to avoid excessive blood collection and expiration, guarantee the safety of our ward (for both patients and staff) and supply the necessary transfusion therapies. These measures may support the development of appropriate risk management plans and safety procedures for other hospitals and transfusion services that have to face similar events.","Schiroli, Davide; Merolle, Lucia; Molinari, Giuseppe; Di Bartolomeo, Erminia; Seligardi, Daniela; Canovi, Laura; Pertinhez, Thelma A; Mancuso, Pamela; Giorgi Rossi, Paolo; Baricchi, Roberto; Marraccini, Chiara",Vox sang,433,6

Due to this, we reviewed the literature to evaluate the use of laparoscopy and robotics during the pandemic COVID19. A literature review of viral transmission in surgery and of the available literature regarding the transmission of the COVID19 virus was performed up to April 30, 2020. We additionally reviewed surgical society guidelines and recommendations regarding surgery during this pandemic. Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery. No study has been made regarding this area during minimally invasive urology cases. To date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open, laparoscopic or robotic. There is no society consensus on restricting laparoscopic or robotic surgery. However, there is expert consensus on modification of standard practices to minimize any risk of transmission. During the pandemic COVID19 we recommend the use of specific personal protective equipment for the surgeon, anesthesiologist and nursing staff in the operating room.

The study aims to assess the short-term influence of air pollution and climate on COVID19 incidence in Lombardy (Italy), during the early stage of the outbreak, before the implementation of the lockdown measures. The daily number of COVID19 cases in Lombardy from February 25th to March 10th, 2020, and the daily average concentrations up to 15 days before the study period of particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), O3, SO2, and NO2 together with climate variables (temperature, relative humidity - RH%, wind speed, precipitation), were analyzed. A univariable mixed model with a logarithm transformation as link function was applied for each day, from 15 days (lag15) to one day (lag1) before the day of detected cases, to evaluate the effect of each variable. Additionally, change points (Break Points-BP) in the relationship between incident cases and air pollution or climatic factors were estimated. The results did not show a univocal relationship between air quality or climate factors and COVID19 incidence. PM10, PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the last lags seem to be related to an increased COVID19 incidence, probably due to an increased susceptibility of the host. In addition, low temperature and low wind speed in some lags resulted associated with increased daily COVID19 incidence. The findings observed suggest that these factors, in particular conditions and lags, may increase individual susceptibility to the development of viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2.","Stufano, Angela; Lisco, Stefania; Bartolomeo, Nicola; Marsico, Antonella; Lucchese, Guglielmo; Jahantigh, Hamidreza; Soleo, Leonardo; Moretti, Massimo; Trerotoli, Paolo; De Palma, Giuseppe; Lovreglio, Piero",Environ Res,433,15

Recently, the lung infection due to SARS-CoV-2 has affected a larger human community globally, and due to its rapidity, the World-Health-Organisation (WHO) declared it as pandemic disease. The COVID-19 disease has adverse effects on the respiratory system, and the infection severity can be detected using a chosen imaging modality. In the proposed research work; the COVID-19 is detected using transfer learning from CT scan images decomposed to three-level using stationary wavelet. A three-phase detection model is proposed to improve the detection accuracy and the procedures are as follows; Phase1- data augmentation using stationary wavelets, Phase2- COVID-19 detection using pre-trained CNN model and Phase3- abnormality localization in CT scan images. This work has considered the well known pre-trained architectures, such as ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, and SqueezeNet for the experimental evaluation. In this work, 70% of images are considered to train the network and 30% images are considered to validate the network. The performance of the considered architectures is evaluated by computing the common performance measures. The result of the experimental evaluation confirms that the ResNet18 pre-trained transfer learning-based model offered better classification accuracy (training = 99.82%, validation = 97.32%, and testing = 99.4%) on the considered image dataset compared with the alternatives.","Ahuja, Sakshi; Panigrahi, Bijaya Ketan; Dey, Nilanjan; Rajinikanth, Venkatesan; Gandhi, Tapan Kumar",Appl Intell,433,33

We evaluated the prevalence of pulmonary thrombosis and reported RV (right ventricular) dilatation/dysfunction associated with Covid-19 in a tertiary referral Covid-19 centre. Of 370 patients, positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 39 patients (mean age 62.3 ± 15 years, 56% male) underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), due to increasing oxygen requirements or refractory hypoxia, not improving on oxygen, very elevated D-dimer or tachycardia disproportionate to clinical condition. Thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature was found in 18 (46.2%) patients. However, pulmonary thrombosis did not predict survival (46.2% survivors vs 41.7% non-survivors, p = 0.796), but RV dilatation was less frequent among survivors (11.5% survivors vs 58.3% non-survivors, p = 0.002). Over the following month, we observed four Covid-19 patients, who were admitted with high and intermediate-high risk PE, and we treated them with UACTD (ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis), and four further patients, who were admitted with PE up to 4 weeks after recovery from Covid-19. Finally, we observed a case of RV dysfunction and pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension, associated with Covid-19 extensive lung disease. We demonstrated that pulmonary thrombosis is common in association with Covid-19. Also, the thrombotic risk in the pulmonary vasculature is present before and during hospital admission, and continues at least up to four weeks after discharge, and we present UACTD for high and intermediate-high risk PE management in Covid-19 patients.","Vlachou, Maria; Drebes, Anja; Candilio, Luciano; Weeraman, Deshan; Mir, Naheed; Murch, Nick; Davies, Neil; Coghlan, J Gerry",J. thromb. thrombolysis,433,30

This study aimed to review and synthesize learning from previous literature focused on the impact on grief and bereavement during other infectious disease outbreaks. We conducted a rapid scoping review according to the principles of the Joanna Briggs Institute and analyzed qualitative data using thematic synthesis. From the 218 identified articles, 6 were included in the analysis. They were four qualitative studies, one observational study, and a systematic review. Studies were conducted in West Africa, Haiti, and Singapore. No research studies have focused on outcomes and support for bereaved people during a pandemic. Studies have tended to focus on survivors who are those who had the illness and recovered, recognizing that some of these individuals will also be bereaved people. Previous pandemics appear to cause multiple losses both directly related to death itself and also in terms of disruption to social norms, rituals, and mourning practices. This affects the ability for an individual to connect with the deceased both before and after the death, potentially increasing the risk of complicated grief. In view of the limited research, specific learning from the current COVID-19 crisis and the impact on the bereaved would be pertinent. Current focus should include innovative ways to promote connection and adapt rituals while maintaining respect. Strong leadership and coordination between different bereavement organisations is essential to providing successful postbereavement support.","Mayland, Catriona R; Harding, Andrew J E; Preston, Nancy; Payne, Sheila",J. pain symptom manage,433,14

Although it is generally believed that QTc changes almost exclusively result from concomitant treatment with QT-prolonging antimicrobials, direct effects of inflammatory cytokines on ventricular repolarization are increasingly recognized. We hypothesized that systemic inflammation per se can significantly prolong QTc during acute infections, via cytokine-mediated changes in K+ channel expression. METHODS: We evaluated (1) the frequency of QTc prolongation and its association with inflammatory markers, in patients with different types of acute infections, during active disease and remission; (2) the prevalence of acute infections in a cohort of consecutive patients with Torsades de Pointes; (3) the relationship between K+ channel mRNA levels in ventricles and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and their changes in patients with acute infection over time. RESULTS: In patients with acute infections, regardless of concomitant QT-prolonging antimicrobial treatments, QTc was significantly prolonged but rapidly normalized in parallel to CRP (C-reactive protein) and cytokine level reduction. Consistently in the Torsades de Pointes cohort, concomitant acute infections were highly prevalent (30%), despite only a minority (25%) of these cases were treated with QT-prolonging antimicrobials. KCNJ2 K+ channel expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell, which strongly correlated to that in ventricles, inversely associated to CRP and IL (interleukin)-1 changes in acute infection patients. CONCLUSIONS: During acute infections, systemic inflammation rapidly induces cytokine-mediated ventricular electrical remodeling and significant QTc prolongation, regardless concomitant antimicrobial therapy. Although transient, these changes may significantly increase the risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia in these patients. It is timely and warranted to transpose these findings to the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, in which both increased amounts of circulating cytokines and cardiac arrhythmias are demonstrated along with a frequent concomitant treatment with several QT-prolonging drugs.

These results suggests that a second dose, according to the current standard regimen of vaccination, may be not necessary in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Lozano-Ojalvo, Daniel; Camara, Carmen; Lopez-Granados, Eduardo; Nozal, Pilar; Del Pino-Molina, Lucía; Bravo-Gallego, Luz Yadira; Paz-Artal, Estela; Pion, Marjorie; Correa-Rocha, Rafael; Ortiz, Alberto; Lopez-Hoyos, Marcos; Iribarren, Marta Erro; Portoles, Jose; Rojo-Portoles, Maria Pilar; Ojeda, Gloria; Cervera, Isabel; Gonzalez-Perez, Maria; Bodega-Mayor, Irene; Montes-Casado, Maria; Portoles, Pilar; Perez-Olmeda, Mayte; Oteo, Jesus; Sanchez-Tarjuelo, Rodrigo; Pothula, Venu; Schwarz, Megan; Brahmachary, Manisha; Tan, Anthony Tanoto; Le Bert, Nina; Berin, Cecilia; Bertoletti, Antonio; Guccione, Ernesto; Ochando, Jordi",Cell Rep,433,32

The majority of studies published have been conducted on inpatient cases and a shortage of tests has encouraged screening only of patients with classic presentation. A positive COVID-19 case of a healthy military male, with the chief complaint of anosmia and ageusia, instigated local re-evaluation of the screening protocol for possible COVID-19 patients. Multiple studies in Europe have implicated anosmia and ageusia as symptoms associated with COVID-19, and subsequently, anosmia and ageusia have been added to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidelines as well. There should be a higher index of suspicion when evaluating a patient with high-risk activities, travel, and atypical symptoms.

There is a paucity of data on prevalence, mortality and burden of care in the United States. This study aimed to describe hospitalizations due to lymphedema and identify factors associated with poor outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample for lymphedema-related hospitalizations from 2012 to 2017. All adults admitted with a primary diagnosis of lymphedema or a primary diagnosis of extremity cellulitis and secondary diagnosis of lymphedema were included. Weights were used to obtain national estimates and complex sampling structure was accounted for using survey methods. Chi-squared tests were performed to assess the association between patient demographics, hospital characteristics, and inpatient mortality. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2017, there were an estimated 165,055 lymphedema admissions in the United States. The vast majority of hospitalizations were for cellulitis (92%), lower extremity disease (88%), and were admitted through the emergency room (77%). Median length of stay was 3.61 days (IQR 2.24-5.77) and inpatient mortality was 0.03% (n = 505). Age >80yrs (OR 3.83, 95% CI 1.72, 8.52) and Charlson comorbidity index &#8805;3 (OR 4.13, 95% CI 2.19, 7.79) were associated with increased risk of inpatient mortality. CONCLUSION: Although mortality is low, lymphedema-related hospitalizations are a significant burden to the US healthcare system. Counseling older lymphedema patients with comorbidities on early symptoms and signs of infection and prompt treatment of same may reduce mortality.","Lopez, Marcos; Roberson, Mya L; Strassle, Paula D; Ogunleye, Adeyemi",Surg Oncol,433,16

In the current study, the authors provide data on the lasting impact of COVID-19 on cytopathology practice during the initial phases of the Italian postlockdown period. METHODS: The percentages of the cytological sample types processed at the University of Naples Federico II during the first 12 weeks of the Italian postlockdown period were compared with those of the same period in 2019. The study period was divided into four 3-week periods. Differences in the rates of malignant diagnoses were also assessed. RESULTS: During the 12-week study period, the overall cytological sample workload decreased by 41.6% in comparison with 2019. In particular, the workload significantly declined for each sample type: Pap smears, -33.3%; urine, -42.8%; serous fluids, -14.4%; thyroid, -54.5%; breast, -43%; lymph node, -27.3%; and salivary gland, -61%. By contrast, the overall malignancy rate was significantly increased (P = .0011). CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in the cytological sample workload during the postlockdown period still represents an ongoing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the rise in the overall malignancy rate reflects the importance of prioritizing diagnostic procedures for patients at high oncological risk.","Vigliar, Elena; Cepurnaite, Rima; Iaccarino, Antonino; Pisapia, Pasquale; De Luca, Caterina; Malapelle, Umberto; Bellevicine, Claudio; Troncone, Giancarlo",Cancer cytophathol,433,9

Millions of people are medically examined, and their data keep piling up awaiting classification. The data are typically both incomplete and heterogeneous which hampers classical classification algorithms. Some researchers have recently modified the popular KNN algorithm as a solution, where they handle incompleteness by imputation and heterogeneity by converting categorical data into numbers. In this article, we introduce a novel KNN variant (KNNV) algorithm that provides better results as demonstrated by thorough experimental work. We employ rough set theoretic techniques to handle both incompleteness and heterogeneity, as well as to find an ideal value for K. The KNNV algorithm takes an incomplete, heterogeneous dataset, containing medical records of people, and identifies those cases with COVID-19. We use in the process two popular distance metrics, Euclidean and Mahalanobis, in an effort to widen the operational scope. The KNNV algorithm is implemented and tested on a real dataset from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology. The experimental results show that it can efficiently and accurately classify COVID-19 cases. It is also compared to three KNN derivatives. The comparison results show that it greatly outperforms all its competitors in terms of four metrics: precision, recall, accuracy, and F-Score. The algorithm given in this article can be easily applied to classify other diseases. Moreover, its methodology can be further extended to do general classification tasks outside the medical field.","Hamed, Ahmed; Sobhy, Ahmed; Nassar, Hamed",Arab J Sci Eng,433,16

To achieve this, governments have had to respond rapidly to outbreaks with public health interventions. But the exact characteristics of an outbreak that trigger these measures differ and are poorly defined. We used existing data from epidemics in Australia to establish a practical model to assist stakeholders in making decisions about the optimal timing and extent of interventions. We found that the number of reported cases on the day that interventions commenced strongly predicted the size of the outbreaks. We quantified how effective interventions were at containing outbreaks in relation to the number of cases at the time the interventions commenced. We also found that containing epidemics from novel variants that had higher transmissibility would require more stringent interventions that commenced earlier. In contrast, increasing vaccination coverage would enable more relaxed interventions. Our model highlights the importance of early and decisive action in the early phase of an outbreak if governments aimed for zero community transmission, although new variants and vaccination coverage may change this.","Zou, Zhuoru; Fairley, Christopher K; Shen, Mingwang; Scott, Nick; Xu, Xianglong; Li, Zengbin; Li, Rui; Zhuang, Guihua; Zhang, Lei",,433,18

Nurses play a key role in fighting this disease and are at risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, there is an urgent need to assess the mental health condition of nurses and establish appropriate interventions to reduce the negative psychiatric outcomes of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the knowledge and psychological stress related to COVID-19 among nursing staff and to provide evidence of the need for targeted training and psychological intervention. METHODS: This cross-sectional web-based survey study was performed in a class 3 grade A general hospital in a southwest province of China from March 1 to March 15, 2020. A self-designed questionnaire with questions about COVID-19-related prevention and control knowledge and the Triage Assessment Form (TAF) were used to assess nursing staff's knowledge of COVID-19 and their degree of psychological stress, respectively. SPSS 23.0 was applied for statistical analysis of the collected data. RESULTS: A total of 979 nurses completed the questionnaire. The results showed that the nursing staff provided the fewest correct answers to questions about continuous viral nucleic acid testing specifications (379/979 correct answers, 38.7%), isolation/discharge criteria (539/979 correct answers, 55.1%), and management measures for patients with suspected symptoms (713/979 correct answers, 72.8%). The median total score of the TAF was 7.0 (IQR 5.0-12.0), and there were statistically significant differences in scores between different nursing roles, years of work experience, and hospital departments (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that nursing staff have insufficient knowledge about COVID-19. Meanwhile, although the psychological damage to nurses during the pandemic was found to be low, nurse managers must continue to monitor the mental health of nursing staff and perform timely interventions.","Huang, Huaping; Zhao, Wen-Jun; Li, Gui-Rong",JMIR Form Res,433,16

Our goal is twofold: first, we propose a novel spatial econometric model of the epidemic spread across NUTS-3 regions to identify the role played by commuting-to-work patterns for spatial disease transmission. Second, we explore if the imposed containment (lockdown) measures during the first pandemic wave in spring 2020 have affected the strength of this transmission channel. Our results from a spatial panel error correction model indicate that, without containment measures in place, commuting-to-work patterns were the first factor to significantly determine the spatial dynamics of daily COVID-19 cases in Germany. This indicates that job commuting, particularly during the initial phase of a pandemic wave, should be regarded and accordingly monitored as a relevant spatial transmission channel of COVID-19 in a system of economically interconnected regions. Our estimation results also provide evidence for the triggering role of local hot spots in disease transmission and point to the effectiveness of containment measures in mitigating the spread of the virus across German regions through reduced job commuting and other forms of mobility.

We intend to study the compassionate use and safety profile of remdesivir in End stage renal disease patients with moderate to severe SARS CoV2 infection. Methods: We conducted an observational prospective study in 48 dialysis dependent patients with SARS CoV2 infection who received remdesivir as part of institutional treatment protocol. During the treatment period, 100 mg of remdesivir was given 4 hours before hemodialysis sessions. Liver function tests (LFT), Inflammatory markers such as serum C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, oxygen requirement before and after remdesivir treatment were compared. Results: There were no events of significant LFT alteration with administration of 2-6 doses of remdesivir. Significant decline in Serum CRP level (p<0.001) was noted. 68.57% of patients showed an improvement in oxygen requirement. Early administration of remdesivir within 48 hours of hospital admission shortened the duration of hospitalization by mean of 5.5 days(p=0.001). Conclusion: Remdesivir was well tolerated and found safe in our study. If initiated within 48 hours of hospitalisation, it reduces recovery time.

Provision of telemonitoring programs in addition to usual care has demonstrated improved effectiveness in managing patients with heart failure (HF). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the potential clinical and health economic outcomes of a telemonitoring program for management of patients with HF during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of health care providers in Hong Kong. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to compare the outcomes of a care under COVID-19 (CUC) group and a telemonitoring plus CUC group (telemonitoring group) in a hypothetical cohort of older patients with HF in Hong Kong. The model outcome measures were direct medical cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the model assumptions and the robustness of the base-case results. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the telemonitoring group showed a higher QALY gain (1.9007) at a higher cost (US $15,888) compared to the CUC group (1.8345 QALYs at US $15,603). Adopting US $48,937/QALY (1 × the gross domestic product per capita of Hong Kong) as the willingness-to-pay threshold, telemonitoring was accepted as a highly cost-effective strategy, with an incremental cost-effective ratio of US $4292/QALY. No threshold value was identified in the deterministic sensitivity analysis. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, telemonitoring was accepted as cost-effective in 99.22% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the current outpatient care alone under the COVID-19 pandemic, the addition of telemonitoring-mediated management to the current care for patients with HF appears to be a highly cost-effective strategy from the perspective of health care providers in Hong Kong.","Jiang, Xinchan; Yao, Jiaqi; You, Joyce Hoi-Sze",J Med Internet Res,433,16

Modern information technologies have enabled global e-learning usage but also revealed a lack of personalization and adaptation in the learning process when compared to face-to-face learning. While adaptive e-learning methods exist, their practical application is slow because of the additional time and resources needed to prepare learning material and its logical adaptation. To increase e-learning materials’ usability and decrease the design complexity of automated adaptive students’ work evaluation, we propose several transformations from a competence tree-based structure to a graph-based automated e-evaluation structure. Related works were summarized to highlight existing e-evaluation structures and the need for new transformations. Competence tree-based e-evaluation structure improvements were presented to support the implementation of top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top transformations. Validation of the proposed transformation was executed by analyzing different use-cases and comparing them to the existing graph-to-tree transformation. Research results revealed that the competence tree-based learning material storage is more reusable than graph-based solutions. Competence tree-based learning material can be transformed for different purposes in graph-based e-evaluation solutions. Meanwhile, graph-based learning material transformation to tree-based structure implies material redundancy, and the competence of the tree structure cannot be restored.","Ramanauskaitė, Simona",Applied Sciences,433,21

The inadequacy of the popular explanations of seasonality is discussed, and a simple hypothesis is proposed, called temperature dependent viral tropism (TDVT), that is compatible with the above features of respiratory illness. TDVT notes that viruses can spread more effectively if they moderate their pathogenicity (thereby maintaining host mobility) and suggests that endemic respiratory viruses accomplish this by developing thermal sensitivity within a range that supports organ-specific viral tropism within the human body, whereby they replicate most rapidly at temperatures below body temperature. This can confine them to the upper respiratory tract and allow them to avoid infecting the lungs, heart, gut etc. Biochemical and tissue-culture studies show that 'wild' respiratory viruses show such natural thermal sensitivity. The typical early autumn surge of colds and the occurrence of respiratory illness in the Tropics year-round at intermediate levels are explained by the tendency for strains to adapt their thermal sensitivity to their local climate and season. TDVT has important practical implications for preventing and treating respiratory illness including Covid-19. It is testable with many options for experiments to increase our understanding of viral seasonality and pathogenicity.","Shaw Stewart, Patrick D; Bach, Julia L",Rev Med Virol,433,21

However, the effects of THP pre-treated sludge on microbial diversity, interspecies interactions, and metabolism in AD systems remain largely unknown. We therefore setup and operated an anaerobic digester during a long-term period to shed light on the effect of THP pre-treatment on AD microbial ecology in comparison to conventional AD via Illumina based 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and genome-centric metagenomics analysis. Results showed THP sludge significantly reduced the microbial diversity, shaped the microbial community structure, and resulted in more intense microbial interactions. Compared to WAS as the feed sludge, THP sludge shaped the core functional groups, but functional redundancy ensured the system's stability. The metabolic interactions between methanogens and syntrophic bacteria as well as the specific metabolic pathways were further elucidated.

This study aims to develop an ML-based model to detect the relationship between resiliency and hope with the stress of COVID-19 by mediating the role of spiritual well-being. An online survey is conducted to assess the psychological responses of Iranian people during the Covid-19 outbreak in the period between March 15 and May 20, 2020, in Iran. The Iranian public was encouraged to take part in an online survey promoted by Internet ads, e-mails, forums, social networks, and short message service (SMS) programs. As a whole, 755 people participated in this study. Sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, The Resilience Scale, The Adult Hope Scale, Paloutzian & Ellison's Spiritual Wellbeing Scale, and Stress of Covid-19 Scale were used to gather data. The findings showed that spiritual well-being itself cannot predict stress of Covid-19 alone, and in fact, someone who has high spiritual well-being does not necessarily have a small amount of stress, and this variable, along with hope and resiliency, can be a good predictor of stress. Our extensive research indicated that traditional analytical and statistical methods are unable to correctly predict related Covid-19 outbreak factors, especially stress when benchmarked with our proposed ML-based model which can accurately capture the nonlinear relationships between the collected data variables.","Nooripour, Roghieh; Hosseinian, Simin; Hussain, Abir Jaafar; Annabestani, Mohsen; Maadal, Ameer; Radwin, Laurel E; Hassani-Abharian, Peyman; Pirkashani, Nikzad Ghanbari; Khoshkonesh, Abolghasem",,433,16

Forecasting of these demands allows states to use their resources effectively. Artificial intelligence-based forecasting models play an important role in the forecasting of medical equipment demand during infectious disease periods. In this study, a deep model approach is presented, which is based on a multilayer long short-term memory network for forecasting of medical equipment demand and outbreak spreading, during the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). The proposed model consists of stages: normalization, deep LSTM networks and dropout-dense-regression layers, in order of process. Firstly, the daily input data were subjected to a normalization process. Afterward, the multilayer LSTM network model, which was a deep learning approach, was created and then fed into a dropout layer and a fully connected layer. Finally, the weights of the trained model were used to predict medical equipment demand and outbreak spreading in the following days. In experimental studies, 77-day COVID-19 data collected from the statistics data put together in Turkey were used. In order to test the proposed system, the data belonging to last 9 days of this data set were used and the performance of the proposed system was calculated using statistical algorithms, MAPE and R 2.

This is likely to be more challenging then the first wave for the diagnosis of COVID-19 because of the similar symptomology with other respiratory conditions highly prevalent in winter. This study sought to understand the care pathways in place in UK NHS hospitals during the first wave (March-July 2020) for identification of patients with COVID-19 and to learn lessons to inform optimal testing strategies within the COVID-19 National Diagnostic Research and Evaluation Platform (CONDOR). DESIGN, SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen hospital-based clinicians from 12 UK NHS Trusts covering 10 different specialties were interviewed following a semi-structured topic guide. Data were coded soon after the interviews and analysed thematically. RESULTS: We developed a diagrammatic, high-level visualisation of the care pathway describing the main clinical decisions associated with the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. COVID-19 testing influenced infection control considerations more so than treatment decisions. Two main features of service provision influenced the patient management significantly: access to rapid laboratory testing and the number of single occupancy rooms. If time to return of result was greater than 24 h, patients with a presumptive diagnosis would often be cohorted based on clinical suspicion alone. Undetected COVID-19 during this time could therefore lead to an increased risk of viral transmission. CONCLUSIONS: During the winter months, priority for provision of rapid testing at admission should be given to hospitals with limited access to laboratory services and single room availability. Access to rapid testing is essential for urgent decisions related to emergency surgery, maternity services and organ transplant. The pathway and prioritization of need will inform the economic modelling, clinical evaluations, and implementation of new clinical tests in UK.","Hicks, Timothy; Winter, Amanda; Green, Kile; Kierkegaard, Patrick; Price, D Ashley; Body, Richard; Allen, A Joy; Graziadio, Sara",BMC Health Serv Res,433,24

These uncertainties become even more phenomenal in the overwhelming mutation-dominated resurgences with vaccinated but still susceptible populations. Here we introduce a novel hybrid approach to (1) characterizing and distinguishing Undocumented (U) and Documented (D) infections commonly seen during COVID-19 incubation periods and asymptomatic infections by expanding the foundational compartmental epidemic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with two compartments, resulting in a new Susceptible-Undocumented infected-Documented infected-Recovered (SUDR) model; (2) characterizing the probabilistic density of infections by empowering SUDR to capture exogenous processes like clustering contagion interactions, superspreading and social reinforcement; and (3) approximating the density likelihood of COVID-19 prevalence over time by incorporating Bayesian inference into SUDR. Different from existing COVID-19 models, SUDR characterizes the undocumented infections during unknown transmission processes. To capture the uncertainties of temporal transmission and social reinforcement during the COVID-19 contagion, the transmission rate is modeled by a time-varying density function of undocumented infectious cases. We solve the modeling by sampling from the mean-field posterior distribution with reasonable priors, making SUDR suitable to handle the randomness, noise and sparsity of COVID-19 observations widely seen in the public COVID-19 case data.","Liu, Qing; Cao, Longbing",,433,19

One method of ensuring standard patient care within these guidelines is through the implementation of telemedicine. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine for elective orthopaedic patients in the recovery and/or rehabilitation period. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of articles in Medline/PubMed and The Cochrane Library databases was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines for prospective randomised controlled trials to compare clinical and symptomatic measures for elective patients managed routinely with remote care compared to those managed with standard in-clinic management. To be included for meta-analysis, parameters must be evaluated in &#8805;3 studies. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the meta-analyses. Both telemedicine and control cohorts were comparable for patient satisfaction (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90-1.07; I2 = 0%; p = 0.52) and patient retention analysis (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.51-3.06; p = 0.54; I2 = 0%). Similarly, there was no statistical difference appreciated between cohorts for overall Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score (p = 0.30), Timed Up and Go Test (p = 0.40), and Stair Test (p = 0.18). Significant difference did exist for visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (p = 0.02) in favour of in-clinic management. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine will serve an integral aspect of healthcare delivery throughout the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond in an effort to deliver safe, efficient and time-sensitive care to the orthopaedic patient population. The results of our meta-analyses indicate that virtual consultations are as effective as traditional in-person consultations for the care of elective orthopaedic patients in the recovery and rehabilitation period. However, further studies are needed to evaluate for initial consultations and certain sub-specialties of orthopaedics.","McDonnell, J M; Ahern, D P; Ross, T D; Gibbons, D; Synnott, K A; Butler, J S",Surg.

We use data that tracks 20 million mobile devices and their movements across physical locations, and whether the mobile devices leave their homes that day. We show that while income is correlated with differences in the ability to stay at home, the unequal diffusion of high-speed Internet in homes across regions drives much of this observed income effect. We examine compliance with state-level directives to avoid leaving your home. Devices in regions with either high-income or high-speed Internet are less likely to leave their homes after such a directive. However, the combination of having both high income and highspeed Internet appears to be the biggest driver of propensity to stay at home. Our results suggest that the digital divide---or the fact that income and home Internet access are correlated---appears to explain much inequality we observe in people's ability to self-isolate.","Chiou, L.; Tucker, C.",Working Paper Series National Bureau of Economic Research,433,16

Data were cumulative for the period of February 27, 2020 to October 7, 2020. We estimated the association of the 2018 Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) overall score and theme scores with COVID-19 tests, test positivity, and cases using multivariable negative binomial regressions. We adjusted for rurality with 2010 Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes. Regional effects were modeled as fixed effects of counties/parishes and state health department regions. The analytical sample included 1160 Alabama and 1105 Louisiana Census tracts. In both states, overall social vulnerability and vulnerability themes were significantly associated with increased COVID-19 case rates (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.45-1.70 for Alabama; RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.26-1.46 for Louisiana). There was increased COVID-19 testing with higher overall vulnerability in Louisiana (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.14-1.38), but not in Alabama (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89-1.02). Consequently, test positivity in Alabama was significantly associated with social vulnerability (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.57-1.75), whereas no such relationship was observed in Louisiana (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98-1.12). Social vulnerability is a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities and those in disadvantaged housing conditions without transportation. Increased testing targeted to vulnerable communities may contribute to reduction in test positivity and overall COVID-19 disparities.","Oates, Gabriela R; Juarez, Lucia D; Horswell, Ronald; Chu, San; Miele, Lucio; Fouad, Mona N; Curry, William A; Fort, Daniel; Hillegass, William B; Danos, Denise M",J. community health,433,1

Therefore, patients with chronic illnesses who need regular rehabilitation have been victims of the pandemic process. Because of their fear of being infected, they were deprived of the chance of their symptoms being rehabilitated. Therefore, it is extremely important to rehabilitate individuals with chronic illnesses in need of rehabilitation through telerehabilitation. In this study, we aimed to show the effect of Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises to be applied through telerehabilitation on eye movements, vision, and quality of life in a patient suffering from diplopia due to multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been found that Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises improve the quality of life and reduce the complaints of diplopia in MS patients with diplopia. In addition, the patient verbally stated that his balance increased after Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises. As a result, Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises are a rehabilitation method that gives positive results in the treatment of diplopia and it is recommended to apply this method via telerehabilitation.","Dogru-Huzmeli, Esra; Duman, Taskin; Cakmak, Ayse Idil; Aksay, Ufuk",Neurol. sci,433,1

METHODS: This retrospective, descriptive, observational study included patients presented between March 10, 2020 and April 25, 2020. The patients were classified into two groups according to RT-PCR test result: RT-PCR (+) and RT-PCR (-). The demographic characteristics and clinical endpoint-related factors were analyzed in the patients. RESULTS: The study included 840 patients; 461 men (54.9%) and 379 women (45.1%). RT-PCR test was positive in 345 patients (41.0%). The most common comorbidity was hypertension (HT) in 119 patients (34.5%); followed by diabetes mellitus (DM) in 61 patients (18.3%). At time of ED presentation, there was mild clinical manifestation in 72.2%, whereas moderate in 21.7% and severe in 6.1% of patients with positive RT-PCR testing. Of the patients with positive RT-PCR testing, 64 patients (18.6%) were discharged from ED while 255 patients (73.9%) were admitted to COVID clinic and 26 were admitted to COVID intensive care unit (ICU). Of the patients admitted, 299 patients (86.7%) were discharged while 46 patients (13.3%) died due to multi-organ failure (MOF) (50%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (32.6%), acute pulmonary embolism (APE) (10.9%) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (6.5%).

Using a model, we show that population heterogeneity can affect disease-induced immunity considerably because the proportion of infected individuals in groups with the highest contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. We estimate that if R 0 = 2.5 in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity, then the disease-induced herd immunity level can be ~43%, which is substantially less than the classical herd immunity level of 60% obtained through homogeneous immunization of the population. Our estimates should be interpreted as an illustration of how population heterogeneity affects herd immunity rather than as an exact value or even a best estimate.","Britton, Tom; Ball, Frank; Trapman, Pieter",Science,433,16

This study aim was to measure the shunt fraction and variations of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and oxygen alveolar-arterial gradient (A-a O(2)) at different FiO(2). METHODS: Shunt was measured by a non-invasive system during spontaneous breathing in 12 patients hospitalized at COVID-19 Semi-Intensive Care Unit of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy, between October 22 and November 23, 2020. RESULTS: Nine patients were men, mean age (±SD) 62±15 years, mean BMI 27.5±4.8 Kg/m(2). Systemic hypertension, diabetes type 2 and previous myocardial infarction were referred in 33%, 17%, and 7%, respectively. Mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was 234±66 and 11 patients presented a bilateral chest X-ray involvement. Mean shunt was 21±6%. Mainly in patients with a more severe respiratory failure, we found a progressive decrease of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio with higher FiO(2). Considering (A-a O(2)), we found a uniform tendency to increase with FiO(2) increasing. Even in this case, the more severe were the patients, the higher was the slope, suggesting FiO(2) insensitiveness due to a shunt effect, as strengthened by our measurements. CONCLUSION: Relying on a single evaluation of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, especially at high FiO(2), could be misleading in COVID-19. We propose a two steps evaluation, the first at low SpO(2) value (e.g., 92-94%) and the second one at high FiO(2) (i.e., &gt;0.7), allowing to characterize both the amendable (ventilation/perfusion mismatch), and the fixed (shunt) contribution quote of respiratory impairment, respectively.","Raimondi, F.; Novelli, L.; Marchesi, G.; Fabretti, F.; Grazioli, L.; Riva, I.; Allegri, C.; Biza, R.; Galimberti, C.; Lorini, F.

We examined various immune parameters including the markers of immune cells exhaustion and activation in 21 patients with COVID-19 disease hospitalised in our hospital during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia. The results showed significant progressive lymphopenia and depletion of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+) in correlation to the disease severity. Clinical recovery was associated with significant increase in CD3+ and CD3+CD4+ T-cells. Most of our patients had eosinopenia on admission, although no significant differences were seen among groups with different disease severity. Non-survivors, when compared to survivors, had significantly increased expression of PD-1 on CD4+ and CD8+ cells, but no significant difference in Tim-3 expression was observed, what suggests possible reversibility of immune paralysis in the most severe group of patients. During recovery, the expression of Tim-3 on both CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cells significantly decreased. Moreover, patients with fatal outcome had significantly higher proportion of CD38+CD8+ cells and lower proportion of CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+ cells on admission. Clinical recovery was associated with significant decrease of proportion of CD38+CD8+ cells. The highest AUC values within univariate and multivariate logistic regression were achieved for expression of CD38 on CD8+ cells and expression of PD1 on CD4+ cells alone or combined, what suggests, that these parameters could be used as potential biomarkers of poor outcome. The assessment of immune markers could help in predicting outcome and disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Our observations suggest, that apart from the degree of depletion of total lymphocytes and lymphocytes subsets, increased expression of CD38 on CD3+CD8+ cells alone or combined with increased expression of PD-1 on CD3+CD4+ cells, should be regarded as a risk factor of an unfavourable outcome in COVID-19 patients. Increased expression of PD-1 in the absence of an increased expression of Tim-3 on CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cells suggests potential reversibility of ongoing immune paralysis in patients with the most severe course of COVID-19.","Bobcakova, Anna; Petriskova, Jela; Vysehradsky, Robert; Kocan, Ivan; Kapustova, Lenka; Barnova, Martina; Diamant, Zuzana; Jesenak, Milos",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,433,1

Therefore, how to carry out ROP screening safely and effectively during the epidemic was very important and urgent. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ROP screening assisted by telemedicine network during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Wuhan Children's hospital in Wuhan, China, from January to October, 2020. The measures which were performed to make the ROP screening more safe and effective were summarized and the comparison between ROP screening assisted by telemedicine network in 2020 and usual screening in 2019 were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 267 outpatient infants completed ROP screening. The median gestational age was 32 weeks (30w to 34w) and the median birth weight was 1780 g (1460 g to 2100 g). Meanwhile, 149 (55.8%) out of 267 infants were males. During January to May in 2020, 86 screening appointments were received, among which 67 (77.9%) were from telemedicine platform online. The completing percentage of total online ROP appointments was higher than that of total face-to-face appointments (58.1% VS 22. 1%, P = 0.018). As for the number of infants screened between 2020 and 2019 from Februaryto October, 54 infants completed ROP screening in 2020, which was higher than that (51participants) in 2019 on September. Furthermore, compared with the usual screening in 2019, ROP screening assisted by telemedicine network in 2020 had smaller gestational age (32w VS 33w, p<0.001) and lower birth weight (1780 g VS 1900 g, p = 0.001). However, of the 267 infants screened, 18(6.7%) had ROP while the percentage of ROP screened in 2019 was the same (44[6.7%]). During follow-up, none of medical staffs was infected and no adverse reaction was reported. CONCLUSIONS: The screening for retinopathy of prematurity assisted by telemedicine network was safe and feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preventive measures before and after screening were very necessary, which could effectively avoid cross infection.","Guo, Zheng; Ma, Nan; Wu, Yixuan; Yuan, Hua; Luo, Wanjun; Zeng, Lingkong; Jie, Hong; Li, Shilian",BMC Ophthalmol,433,16

Each program has adapted uniquely; we discuss how our surgical education changed in our hospital. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of changes in general surgery cases, bedside procedures, and utilization of residents before and during the pandemic. Procedures were retrieved from electronic medical records. Operating room (OR) cases 1 month before and 5 weeks after the executive order were collected. Triple lumen catheter (TLC), temporary hemodialysis catheter (HDC), and pneumothorax catheter (PC) insertions by surgical residents were recorded for 5 weeks. RESULTS: Before the pandemic, an average of 27.9 cases were done in the OR, with an average of 10.1 general surgery cases. From March 23 to April 30, 2020, the average number of cases decreased to 5.1, and general surgery cases decreased to 2.2.

In order to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency treatment and ensuring the timeliness of treatment for trauma patients, The Trauma Surgery Branch of Chinese Medical Doctors' Association (CMDA) organized the drafting of the present expert consensus. This paper interprets the main views of the expert consensus, emphasizes that the safety of health care staff and patients are equally important, and that the treatment strategies and procedures for severe trauma need to be adjusted during the COVID-19 outbreak. The consensus also recommends the use of CT scan, which plays both the role of screening COVID-19 and accurate assessment of trauma, and strengthening the protection of medical staff. The consensus states that medical personnel can be exempted from isolation if they wear standard three-level protective equipment and are not accidentally exposed during the operation. This expert consensus is the first one to systematically review, summarize and analyze the progress of COVID-19 from a surgeon's perspective.

Information regarding cardiac markers for precise risk-stratification is limited. We aim to discover sensitive and reliable early-warning biomarkers for optimizing management and improving the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 2954 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were receiving treatment from the Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital in China from February 4 to April 10 were included in this retrospective cohort. Serum levels of cardiac markers were collected after admission. Coronary artery disease diagnosis and survival status were recorded. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk RNA-sequencing from different cohorts of non-COVID-19 were performed to analyze SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression. RESULTS: Among 2954 COVID-19 patients in the analysis, the median age was 60 years (50-68 years), 1461 (49.5%) were female, and 1515 (51.3%) were severe/critical. Compared to mild/moderate (1439, 48.7%) patients, severe/critical patients showed significantly higher levels of cardiac markers within the first week after admission. In severe/critical COVID-19 patients, those with abnormal serum levels of BNP (42 [24.6%] vs 7 [1.1%]), hs-TNI (38 [48.1%] vs 6 [1.0%]), &#945;- HBDH (55 [10.4%] vs 2 [0.2%]), CK-MB (45 [36.3%] vs 12 [0.9%]), and LDH (56 [12.5%] vs 1 [0.1%]) had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to patients with normal levels. The same trend was observed in the ICU admission rate. Severe/critical COVID-19 patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease (165/1,155 [10.9%]) had more cases of BNP (52 [46.5%] vs 119 [16.5%]), hs-TNI (24 [26.7%] vs 9.6 [%], &#945;- HBDH (86 [55.5%] vs 443 [34.4%]), CK-MB (27 [17.4%] vs 97 [7.5%]), and LDH (65 [41.9%] vs 382 [29.7%]), when compared with those without coronary artery disease. There was enhanced SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression in coronary artery disease compared with healthy controls. From regression analysis, patients with five elevated cardiac markers were at a higher risk of death (hazards ratio 3.4 [95% CI 2.4-4.8]). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease represented a higher abnormal percentage of cardiac markers, accompanied by high mortality and ICU admission rate. BNP together with hs-TNI, &#945;- HBDH, CK-MB and LDH act as a prognostic biomarker in COVID-19 patients with or without pre-existing coronary artery disease.","Li, Pengping; Wu, Wei; Zhang, Tingting; Wang, Ziyu; Li, Jie; Zhu, Mengyan; Liang, Yuan; You, Wenhua; Li, Kening; Ding, Rong; Huang, Bin; Wu, Lingxiang; Duan, Weiwei; Han, Yi; Li, Xuesong; Tang, Xin; Wang, Xin; Shen, Han; Wang, Qianghu; Yan, Hong; Xia, Xinyi; Ji, Yong; Chen, Hongshan",Crit Care,433,16
450362,450362,450362,Subjecting pandemic sport to a sociological procedure,15.364144,3.774598,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic had infected more than 3.5M people around the world and more than 250K people died in 187 countries by May 2020. The causal agent of this disease is a coronavirus whose onset of symptoms to death range from 6 to 41 days with a median of 14 days. This period is dependent on several factors such as the presence of comorbidities, age and the efficiency of the innate or adaptive immune responses. The effectors mechanisms of both types of immune responses depend on the pathogen involved. In the case of a viral infection, the innate immune response may approach the harmful virus through pattern recognition receptors inducing an antiviral state. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response activates antibody production to neutralize or eliminate the virus. Phenolics are plant secondary metabolites with many biological activities for plants and humans against infection. Chemical modification of proteins may enhance their biological properties; thus, a protein of medical interest, for instance, a viral protein can be used as scaffold to build a biopharmaceutical conjugated or complexated with phenolics exhibiting structural complexity or biological activities to achieve effective phenolic-protein-based therapeutics like vaccine adjuvant complexes, immunogen conjugates, and antiviral conjugates. CONCLUSION: Pharmaceutical biotechnology applies the principles of biotechnology to develop biopharmaceuticals for protein-based therapeutics; such as adjuvants, recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and antivirals. As neither a vaccine nor a treatment for COVID-19 is currently available, this manuscript focuses on insights from pharmaceutical biotechnology into phenolic biopharmaceuticals against COVID-19.","Cabral-Hipólito, Nidia; Molina-Ramírez, Brenda; Sevilla-González, María-de-la-Luz; MezaVelázquez, Rocío; García-Garza, Rubén; Velázquez Gauna, Sergio-Everardo; Castillo-Maldonado, Irais; Delgadillo-Guzmán, Dealmy; Rivera-Guillén, Mario-Alberto; Serrano-Gallardo, Luis-Benjamín; Vega-Menchaca, María-Del-Carmen; Ramírez-Moreno, Agustina; Pedroza-Escobar, David",Curr pharm. biotechnol,433,16

Several pathogens are implicated, both viruses and bacteria, one of which, Mycoplasma bovis, is under-researched. This worldwide-distributed bacterium has been shown to be highly resistant in vitro to the main antimicrobials used to treat BRD. Our objective was to monitor the relative prevalence of M. bovis during BRD episodes, its diversity, and its resistance phenotype in relation to antimicrobial use. For this purpose, a two-year longitudinal follow-up of 25 feedlots was organized and 537 nasal swabs were collected on 358 veal calves at their arrival in the lot, at the BRD peak and 4 weeks after collective antimicrobial treatments. The presence of M. bovis was assessed by real-time PCR and culture. The clones isolated were then subtyped (polC subtyping and PFGE analysis), and their susceptibility to five antimicrobials was determined. The course of the disease and the antimicrobials used had no influence on the genetic diversity of the M. bovis strains: The subtype distribution was the same throughout the BRD episode and similar to that already described in France, with a major narrowly-variable subtype circulating, st2. The same conclusion holds for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes: All the clones were already multiresistant to the main antimicrobials used (except for fluoroquinolones) prior to any treatments. By contrast, changes of AMR phenotypes could be suspected for Pasteurellaceae in two cases in relation to the treatments registered.","Becker, Claire A M; Ambroset, Chloé; Huleux, Anthéa; Vialatte, Angélique; Colin, Adélie; Tricot, Agnès; Arcangioli, Marie-Anne; Tardy, Florence",,433,20

CONTENT: COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 disease a pandemic principally contaminating the respiratory tract and bringing about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome is liable for significant mortality around the world. Far-fetched, there is no exact treatment accessible till today. Consequently, it is critical to discover the alternative methodology which can decrease the weight of illness. Trikatu powder recommended by authorities for the management of mild cases of COVID-19 is a conventional ayurvedic formulation containing three spices; Zingiber officinale, Piper nigrum, and Piper longum. A comprehensive search of the articles published since inception to 01/08/2020 on Trikatu was carried out. Major electronic medical databases such as Pub Med/MEDLINE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were used for the literature search. SUMMARY: A total of 21 records were identified by electronic searches between since inception to 01/08/2020 of which 13 records were included for review. The reviewed articles highlight Trikatu as a safe, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory property by suppression of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-17, alteration in levels of circulating immune complexes, anti-dyslipidaemia agent by reduced triglycerides and LDL cholesterol and increased HDL cholesterol, enhancing bio-availability of co-drug by reducing the elimination half-life (t1/2ß) and zero time intercept of the elimination phase. OUTLOOK: The findings of this review seem to show Trikatu as a potential anti-inflammatory, anti-dyslipidaemia, and immune-modulatory ayurvedic formulation can be used for combating flu like illnesses and also in the management of COVID-19 as an adjuvant. However, rigorous double blind randomized controlled trials with larger sample size are warranted for better validation in such clinical conditions.

Zeaxanthin, a crucial carotenoid, positively regulates plant abiotic stress responses. Therefore, this study investigated the regulatory mechanisms of zeaxanthin-induced chilling tolerance in peppers. The results indicated that the pretreatment with zeaxanthin effectively alleviated chilling damage in pepper leaves and increased the plant fresh weight and photosynthetic pigment content under chilling stress. Additionally, alterations in photosynthetic chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence induction curves after zeaxanthin treatment highlighted the participation of zeaxanthin in improving the photosystem response to chilling stress by heightening the quenching of excess excitation energy and protection of the photosynthetic electron transport system. In chill-stressed plants, zeaxanthin treatment also enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity and transcript expression, and reduced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2â¢-) content, resulting in a decrease in biological membrane damage. Additionally, exogenous zeaxanthin upregulated the expression levels of key genes encoding ß-carotene hydroxylase (CaCA1, CaCA2), zeaxanthin epoxidase (CaZEP) and violaxanthin de-epoxidase (CaVDE), and promoted the synthesis of endogenous zeaxanthin during chilling stress. Collectively, exogenous zeaxanthin pretreatment enhances plant tolerance to chilling by improving the photosystem process, increasing oxidation resistance, and inducing alterations in endogenous zeaxanthin metabolism.","Tang, Chaonan; Xie, Jianming; Lv, Jian; Li, Jing; Zhang, Jing; Wang, Cheng; Liang, Guoping",Plant Physiol Biochem,433,0

We find that the route from molten, but only marginally-overlapping single crystals to the equilibrium state must pass over a free-energy barrier that becomes large at high molecular weights. The penalty arises from elastic distortions of the entanglement network as the chains diffuse. A critical molecular weight arises naturally from the competition of elastic distortion and the free-energy of confinement.

This ""cytokine storm"" produces an excessive inflammatory and immune response, especially in the lungs, leading to acute respiratory distress (ARDS), pulmonary edema and multi-organ failure. Alleviating this inflammatory state is crucial to improve prognosis. Pro-inflammatory factors play a central role in COVID-19 severity, especially in patients with comorbidities. In these situations, an overactive, untreated immune response can be deadly, suggesting that mortality in COVID-19 cases is likely due to this virally driven hyperinflammation. Administering immunomodulators has not yielded conclusive improvements in other pathologies characterized by dysregulated inflammation such as sepsis, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS. The success of these drugs at reducing COVID-19-driven inflammation is still anecdotal and comes with serious risks. It is also imperative to screen the elderly for risk factors that predispose them to severe COVID-19. Immunosenescence and comorbidities should be taken into consideration. In this review, we summarize the latest data available about the role of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 disease severity as well as potential therapeutic approaches to ameliorate it. We also examine the role of inflammation in other diseases and conditions often comorbid with COVID-19, such as aging, sepsis, and pulmonary disorders. Finally, we identify gaps in our knowledge and suggest priorities for future research aimed at stratifying patients according to risk as well as personalizing therapies in the context of COVID19-driven hyperinflammation.","de la Rica, Roberto; Borges, Marcio; Gonzalez-Freire, Marta",Front Immunol,433,15

Such interventions are still under consideration. A model is benchmarked research and comprises target cells, virus infected cells, immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and, anti-inflammatory cytokine. The interaction of the drug with the inflammatory sub-system is analyzed with the aid of kinetic modeling. The impact of drug therapy on the immune cells is modelled and the computational framework is verified with the aid of numerical simulations. The work includes a significant hypothesis that quantifies the complex dynamics of the infection, by relating it to the effect of the inflammatory syndrome generated by IL-6. In this paper we use the cancer immunoediting process: a dynamic process initiated by cancer cells in response to immune surveillance of the immune system that it can be conceptualized by an alternating movement that balances immune protection with immune evasion. The mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy seem to broadly overlap with those used by cancers as they undergo immunoediting to evade detection by the immune system. In this process the immune system can both constrain and promote tumour development, which proceeds through three phases termed: (i) Elimination, (ii) Equilibrium, and, (iii) Escape [1]. We can also apply these concepts to viral infection, which, although it is not exactly ""immunoediting"", has many points in common and helps to understand how it expands into an ""untreated"" host and can help in understanding the SARS-CoV2 virus infection and treatment model.","Yu, Zhenhua; Ellahi, R; Nutini, Alessandro; Sohail, Ayesha; Sait, Sadiq M",J Mol Liq,433,1

The main goal of this study is to develop a more effective method for diagnosing and predicting the COVID-19 spread and to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures to reduce and stop the virus spread. To this end, the COVID-19 Decision-Making System (CDMS) was developed to study disease transmission. CDMS divides the population into groups as susceptible, infected, cured and dead. The trends of the people's number in these groups have deterministic and stochastic components. The deterministic components are described by a differential equations system with parameters determined by the data reported. The stochastic components are represented as an indicator of instability that characterizes the tendency of COVID-19 spread. The simulation experiments have shown a good agreement between the CDMS estimates and the data reported in Russia and Greece. The analysis performed showed that the newly-introduced instability indicator may be the precursor to the pandemic dynamics. In this context, our results showed three potential candidates for a second wave of COVID-19 disease: USA, Russia and Brazil. Although the proportion of infected individuals in countries with high temperatures is lower than in European countries and Russia, temperature and humidity are slowly affecting the effects of the pandemic. Finally, the results presented may contribute to the urgent need to reduce the risks associated with the second wave of the COVID-19, to improve public health intervention and safety measures to be taken by various countries.","Varotsos, Costas A; Krapivin, Vladimir F",Saf Sci,433,1

The integration of MEC with resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could enable flexible resource provisioning for supporting dynamic and computation-intensive UAV applications. Existing resource trading could facilitate this paradigm with proper incentives, which, however, may often incur unexpected negotiation latency and energy consumption, trading failures and unfair pricing, due to the unpredictable nature of the resource trading process. Motivated by these challenges, an efficient futures-based resource trading mechanism for edge computing-assisted UAV network is proposed, where a mutually beneficial and risk-tolerable forward contract is devised to promote resource trading between an MEC server (seller) and a UAV (buyer). Two key problems i.e. futures contract design before trading and power optimization during trading are studied. By analyzing historical statistics associated with future resource supply, demand, and air-to-ground communication quality, the contract design is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize both the seller's and the buyer's expected utilities, while estimating their acceptable risk tolerance. Accordingly, we propose an efficient bilateral negotiation scheme to help players reach a trading consensus on the amount of resources and the relevant price. For the power optimization problem, we develop a practical algorithm that enables the buyer to determine its optimal transmission power via convex optimization techniques. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed mechanism offers both players considerable utilities, while outperforming the onsite trading mechanism on trading failures and fairness, negotiation latency, and cost.","Liwang, Minghui; Gao, Zhibin; Wang, Xianbin",,433,9

Our investigation aims to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the home duties and workplace productivity of academic radiologists with respect to gender. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 49-question survey was distributed to 926 members of Association of University Radiologists in October 2020. Several categories were addressed: demographics; workplace changes; stress levels and personal experiences with illness; time spent on domestic obligations; and perception of productivity during COVID-19. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). RESULTS: A total of 96 responses across 30 states, 53.1% male and 46.9% female were received. Women report spending more time on unpaid domestic duties than men prior to COVID-19, with men spending a median of 5-10 h/wk and women spending a median of 10-15 h/wk (p = 0.043). With pandemic onset, both genders reported that women did more of the homecare, when not split equally. Women with young children reported a significant decrease in work-from-home productivity compared to men with young children (p = 0.007). Men reported they had more time to be productive compared to women (p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt the advancement of women in radiology leadership roles by creating disparate effects on productivity due to increased workloads at home for women. This could potentially lead to decreases in promotions and research productivity in years to come that far outlast the acute phases of the pandemic.","Plaunova, Anastasia; Heller, Samantha L; Babb, James S; Heffernan, Cathleen C",Acad. radiol,433,20

The presence of asymptomatic subjects in the population, that are responsible for about 30% of the new infections, may complicate this phase. Serological tests for the measurement of immune response could represent an effective tool for the rapid monitoring of the population with asymptomatic infections and for estimating the proportion of immune in a territory, too. OBJECTIVES: to describe the distribution of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of the Municipality of Borgosesia (Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) and to estimate the efficacy of this strategy for the identification of asymptomatic cases. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with administration of a rapid test to assess the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: all subjects resident in Borgosesia over the age of 18, where invited to participate. A rapid serological test was administered to enrolled participants to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies on peripheral blood. Subjects with IgG or IgM positivity were offered to perform a swab test for viral RNA research. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the prevalence of IgM and IgG, and the relative risks of having positive swab test and of having symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 in the recent past has been estimated. RESULTS: 4,987 subjects participated to study, 44.5% of the adult population of Borgosesia. The average age was 55 years. There was a greater participation of women (54.4%), of people with a higher education level (37.3%) and of people without specific previous symptoms (95.1%). 245 people had a positive test for IgM or IgG, and the estimated prevalence was of 4.9%. 209 out of 245 subjects who were positive to the rapid test underwent to the RT-PCR test and this allowed to isolate 24 positive subjects. CONCLUSIONS: the seroprevalence values ââestimated for subjects residing in the city of Borgosesia which underwent the rapid test for the detection of type M and type G antibodies on peripheral blood, confirmed the population-based estimates reported in literature, in particular with the results of the Italian survey of seroprevalence. Furthermore, the implementation of this test allowed the identification and isolation of completely asymptomatic subjects, that could have been identified only through screening with tests for viral RNA.","Alessi, Daniela; Borré, Silvio; Barale, Antonella; Isabella, Antonio; Milano, Fulvia; Rossi, Maicol Andrea; Silano, Virginia; Piu, Nicola; Cena, Tiziana; Faggiano, Fabrizio",Epidemiol Prev,433,22

Among the contributors to thrombosis, the contact activation system and the kallikrein/kinin system, two overlapping plasma proteolytic systems that are often considered as synonymous, regulate thrombosis from different aspects. On one hand, components of the contact activation system such as factor XII initiates activation of the coagulation proteins promoting thrombus formation on artificial surfaces through factor XI- and possibly prekallikrein-mediated intrinsic coagulation. On the other hand, physiological activation of plasma prekallikrein in the kallikrein/kinin system on endothelial cells liberates bradykinin from associated high-molecular-weight kininogen to stimulate the constitutive bradykinin B2 receptor to generate nitric oxide and prostacyclin to induce vasodilation and counterbalance angiotensin II signaling from the renin-angiotensin system which stimulates vasoconstriction. In addition to vascular tone regulation, this interaction between the kallikrein/kinin and renin-angiotensin systems has a thrombo-regulatory role independent of the contact pathway. At the level of the G-protein coupled receptors of these systems, defective bradykinin signaling due to attenuated bradykinin formation and/or decreased B2 receptor expression, as seen in murine prekallikrein and B2 receptor null mice, respectively, leads to compensatory overexpressed Mas, the receptor for angiotensin-(1-7) of the renin-angiotensin system. Mas stimulation and/or its increased expression contributes to maintaining a healthy vascular homeostasis by generating graded elevation of plasma prostacyclin which reduces thrombosis through two independent pathways: (1) increasing the vasoprotective transcription factor Sirtuin 1 to suppress tissue factor expression, and (2) inhibiting platelet activation. This review will summarize the recent advances in this field that support these understandings. Appreciating these subtle mechanisms help to develop novel anti-thrombotic strategies by targeting the vascular receptors in the renin-angiotensin and the kallikrein/kinin systems to maintain healthy vascular homeostasis.","Fang, Chao; Schmaier, Alvin H",Pharmacol Res,433,29

Previous literature identified advanced age, higher severity of illness, elevated inflammatory biomarkers, acute organ dysfunction, comorbidities, and presentation from long-term care facility as risk factors for mortality in patients from Wuhan, China, and the United States. Additional studies conducted in NYC are warranted to confirm these findings. The objective of this study was to assess the risk factors for in-hospital mortality in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections. This was a retrospective case-control study at The Brooklyn Hospital Center, a 464-bed community teaching hospital. Adult patients with a confirmed COVID-19 infection and who received at least 24 h of COVID-19 therapy were included. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Two-hundred and eighty four patients were included, of whom 95 (33.5%) were nonsurvivors and 189 (66.5%) patients were survivors. Multivariate analysis showed higher in-hospital mortality with advanced age (odds ratio [OR] 6.476; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.827-22.953), presentation from long-term care facility (OR 4.259; 95% CI 1.481-12.250), elevated total bilirubin (OR 4.947; 95% CI 1.048-23.350), vasopressor initiation (OR 36.262; 95% CI 5.319-247.216), and development of renal failure (OR 36.261; 95% CI 2.667-493.046).

In the patients who subjectively recovered from COVID-19-related OD (N = 609), recovery occurred on average after 16 days and most of the time within 1 month (""normal"" recovery range); 49 subjectively recovered in 1-2.5 months, and several cases took up to 6.5 months. Among the patients with ongoing OD (N = 2502), 974 were outside the ""normal"" recovery range (persistent OD) and reported OD for 1-10 months. Developing a persistent OD was more likely with increasing age and in women and was more often associated with parosmia and phantosmia. The deleterious impact of COVID-19-related OD on the quality of life was significantly aggravated by OD duration and was more pronounced in women. Because persistent OD is not infrequent after COVID-19, has deleterious consequences on the quality of life, and receives few solutions from the health practitioners, it would be beneficial to implement screening and treatment programs to minimize the long-term behavioral consequences of COVID-19-related OD.","Ferdenzi, Camille; Bousquet, Christophe; Aguera, Pierre-Emmanuel; Dantec, Morgane; Daudé, Christelle; Fornoni, Lesly; Fournel, Arnaud; Kassan, Aurélien; Mantel, Marylou; Moranges, Maëlle; Moussy, Erwan; Richard Ortegón, Stéphane; Rouby, Catherine; Bensafi, Moustafa",Chem. senses,433,1

In this paper we develop some critical reflections about the current situation of RECs. Our starting point is the definition of the role they should ideally play, a role that should necessarily include a collaborative approach and the focus on the ethics component of the review. This ideal is unfortunately quite far from reality: inadequacies in the functioning of RECs have been discussed for decades, along with reform proposals. Both in the US and in the European Union (EU), reforms that aim at the centralization of the review process were recently approved. Even though these reforms were needed, they nonetheless raise concerns. We focus on two such concerns, related in particular to Regulation (EU) No 536/2014: the risk of narrowing the scope of the ethics review and that of disregarding the local context. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic paved the way for the transition towards the centralized model and that an analysis of its impact on the research review process could provide some interesting insights into possible shortcomings of this new model. We conclude by identifying three objectives that define the role of a REC, objectives that any reform should preserve.","Tusino, Silvia; Furfaro, Maria",,433,25

In this study, we investigated the change in physical activity and subsequently clinical symptoms of PD during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We enrolled PD patients who were able to ambulate independently and had visited our clinic at Samsung Medical Centre from December 2019 to January 2020 (baseline) and in May 2020 (follow-up during the COVID-19 crisis), and divided them into either 'the sustained exercise group' or 'the reduced exercise group'. Then, we assessed the change in the exercise and clinical features between these two groups over the study period. RESULTS: A total of 100 subjects were recruited. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount, duration and frequency of exercise were reduced. There was decrease in number of patients who do indoor-solo exercise and increase in that of patients who do not exercise. One third reported subjective worsening of both motor and non-motor features, although Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) part 3 score was similar. Additionally, the reduced exercise group reported more motor and non-motor aggravation than the sustained exercise group, despite lack of significant difference in the UPDRS part 3 score. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a clear impact on exercise and subjective symptoms in PD patients, with reduced exercise being related to a subjective increase in both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Maintaining exercise should therefore be emphasized even in situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Song, Joomee; Ahn, Jong Hyeon; Choi, Inyoung; Mun, Jun Kyu; Cho, Jin Whan; Youn, Jinyoung",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,433,4

Little is known on the frequency and the nature of persistent symptoms beyond 3 months. Here we have assessed, in the longitudinal prospective French COVID-19 cohort, symptoms that persisted 6 months after admission for COVID-19. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Follow-up was planned with a physician's visit at month (M)3 and M6 after admission. Associations between persistence of symptoms at M6 and clinical characteristics at admission were assessed through bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: M6 data were available for 1137 participants. Median age was 61 years (IQR 51-71) and 288 (29%, 95% CI 26-32%) were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) during the acute phase. Six hundred and fifty-five (68%, 95% CI 65-71%) and 639 (60%, 95% CI 57-63%) participants had at least one symptom at M3 and M6 visit, respectively, mostly fatigue, dyspnoea, joint pain and myalgia. At M6, 255 (24%, 95% CI 21-27%) of participants had three or more persistent symptoms. The presence of three or more symptoms at M6 was independently associated with female gender (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.40, 95% CI 1.75-3.30), having three or more symptoms at admission (aOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.45-2.89) and ICU admission/transfer during acute phase (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.09-2.18), but not significantly with age or having two or more comorbidities. One hundred and twenty-five (29%, 95% CI 25-34%) of those who initially had a professional occupation were not back to work at M6. DISCUSSION: A fourth of individuals admitted to hospital for COVID-19 still had three or more persistent symptoms at M6. Longitudinal follow-up of individuals with severe COVID-19 is warranted to better understand the pathophysiology underlying this long-term persistence.","Ghosn, Jade; Piroth, Lionel; Epaulard, Olivier; Le Turnier, Paul; Mentré, France; Bachelet, Delphine; Laouénan, Cédric",Clin Microbiol Infect,433,17

RESULTS: When adolescents were motivated by preventing others from getting sick, they were more likely to engage in social distancing (same day: B = .50, SE = .09, 95% confidence interval [CI] [.32, .68] p < .001; next day: B = .49, SE = .09, 95% CI [.31, .67] p < .001). Daily social support from friends (same day: B = .04, SE = .02, 95% CI [.01, .08] p < .05; next day: B = .08, SE = .02, 95% CI [.05, .12] p < .001), connectedness with friends via technology (same day: B = .23, SE = .04, 95% CI [.14, .32] p < .001; next day: B = .12, SE = .05, 95% CI [.03, .21] p < .001), and practical knowledge about ways to prevent contracting and transmitting COVID-19 (same day: B = .12, SE = .02, 95% CI [.08, .17] p < .001; next day: B = .05, SE = .02, 95% CI [.01, .10] p < .05) positively predicted adolescents' same- and next-day engagement in social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents who were motivated by the desire to protect others were more likely to engage in social distancing. In addition, adolescents who learned about preventative health behaviors for mitigating COVID-19, received peer support, and remained virtually connected with friends were more likely to engage in daily social distancing at the onset of the pandemic.","Wang, Ming-Te; Scanlon, Christina L; Hua, Meng; Del Toro, Juan",J Adolesc Health,433,6

We reveal how an ‘adapted’ action learning intervention (a change laboratory) introduced prior to the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK, enabled learning and action to emerge within an educational programme. We utilise the theoretical lens of activity theory to illustrate the challenges and tensions of promoting and sustaining an employee wellbeing agenda. Follow-up questioning (Q) of key informants, using the insights (P–programmed knowledge) generated during the change laboratory provide evidence of learning (L). This provides insight into the learning and action that occured after the initial intervention. We explore employee wellbeing from a socio-cultural perspective and illustrate how action and learning are intertwined to produce goal-oriented outcomes. This socio-cultural perspective contributes to the theory of action learning by illuminating how activity is mediated by cultural means, the rules and tools operating in an activity system. This perspective provides a focus upon learning and agency in the workplace and supports a more complicated understanding of ‘wicked problems’, viewed as the challenges and tensions which emerge in practice as break-downs, clashes or problems. We argue that these spaces must be protected if employee wellbeing is to become, and remain, integrated within an organisation activity system. © 2021 The Author(s).

These include the four largest non-G20 fossil CO2 emitting Parties to the UN climate convention pre- Paris Agreement (Iran, Kazakhstan, Thailand and Ukraine) and one of the largest land-use GHG emitters in the world (Democratic Republic of the Congo). Other countries assessed include major economies in their respective regions (Chile, Colombia, Morocco and the Philippines). In addition to economy-wide GHG emissions projections, we also assessed the projected GHG emissions peak year and the progression of per capita GHG emissions up to 2030. Our GHG emissions projections are also compared with previous studies. On economy-wide GHG emissions, Colombia, Iran, Morocco, and Ukraine were projected to likely meet or significantly overachieve their unconditional 2030 targets with existing policies, while DRC and Thailand would come very close to their targets. Kazakhstan and the Philippines would need to strengthen their action to meet their targets, while Chile recently raised its 2030 target ambition. Only Colombia and Ukraine are projected to have peaked their emissions by 2030. Per capita GHG emissions excluding land-use under current policies were projected to increase in all countries from 2010 levels by 8 % to over 40 % depending on the country. While the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on 2030 emissions is highly uncertain, our assessment on the target achievement would not change for most countries when the emission reductions estimated for 2020 in the literature were assumed to remain in 2030. The findings of this study highlight the importance of enhanced and frequent progress-tracking of climate action of major emitters outside G20, as is currently done for G20 members, to ensure that the global collective progress will become aligned with the pathways toward Paris climate goals.","Kuramochi, Takeshi Nascimento Leonardo Moisio Mia den Elzen Michel Forsell Nicklas van Soest Heleen Tanguy Paola Gonzales Sofia Hans Frederic Jeffery M.

The weekly rate of infection gradually increased from February 2-9 to April 5-11 in the dead donor-derived allograft bone-harvesting region covered by the Bank. It is becoming clear that the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients, and that this route may have facilitated the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, the Bank stopped dead donor donation to consider the safety of medical staff. Three recipients received bone allografts following pre-operative COVID-19 screening by PCR.

We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 at 25 hospitals across Japan. Eligible patients were adolescents and adults admitted with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic or mildly ill and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to early or late favipiravir therapy (in the latter case, the same regimen starting on day 6 instead of day 1). The primary endpoint was viral clearance by day 6. The secondary endpoint was change in viral load by day 6. Exploratory endpoints included time to defervescence and resolution of symptoms. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 69 were virologically evaluable. Viral clearance occurred within 6 days in 66.7% and 56.1% of the early and late treatment groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.76 to 2.62).

The MinION sequencing device allows for rapid, cost-effective, high-throughput sequencing; useful features for translation to clinical laboratory settings. Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) approaches provide the opportunity to examine the entire genomic material of a sample; allowing for detection of emerging and clinically relevant pathogens that may be missed in targeted assays. Here we present a pilot study on the performance of Sequence-Independent Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) to amplify RNA randomly for the detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2. We designed a classifier that corrects for barcode crosstalk between specimens. Our assay yielded 100% specificity overall and 95.2% sensitivity for specimens with a RT-qPCR cycle threshold value less than 30. We assembled 10 complete (>95% coverage at 20x depth), and one near-complete (>80% coverage at 20x depth) genomes from 20 specimens that were classified as positive by mNGS. We characterized these genomes through phylogenetic analysis and found that 10/11 specimens from British Columbia had a closest relative to another British Columbian specimen. Of five samples that we had both assembled genomes, as well as Variant of Concern (VOC) PCR results, we found 100% concordance between these results. Additionally, our assay was able to distinguish between the Alpha and Gamma variants, which was not possible with our VOC PCR technique. This study supports future work examining the broader feasibility of SISPA as a diagnostic strategy for the detection and characterization of viral pathogens.","Gauthier, Nick P.G; Nelson, Cassidy; Bonsall, Michael B; Locher, Kerstin; Charles, Marthe; MacDonald, Clayton; Krajden, Mel; Chorlton, Samuel D; Manges, Amee R",,433,0

Bilateral pulmonary opacities including consolidations and ground glass opacifications are some of the radiological manifestations of COVID-19 infection. There has been recent sporadic reports of pneumomediastinum in patients with COVID-19. Spontaneous or primary pneumomediastinum generally occurs when no underlying factors can be identified. Secondary pneumomediastinum occurs due to traumatic causes or non-traumatic respiratory diseases or infections. In this case series, we report seven patients with COVID-19 who developed secondary pneumomediastinum and also discuss the lung protective strategies. Case Description: We present this case series in a table format. Seven patients ages 45-77 (63.7+/-) were included. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was positive and chest X-ray performed in the Emergency Department showed bilateral subpleural opacities in all. All patients required supplemental oxygen and were transferred from medical floor to the Intensive Care Unit due to worsening respiratory distress. Patients were treated according to individual medical requirements and institutional standard of care. None of the patients had any history of smoking or pneumothorax. Five patients presented with constitutional and respiratory symptoms. Six patients (Patients 1, 3-7) were treated with non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) prior to diagnosis of pneumomediastinum. Two patients (Patients 4, 7) required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Interestingly, patient 2 had pneumomediastinum on admission. Patient 6 developed both pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax (PTX). Five patients developed pneumomediastinum on noninvasive ventilation. BiPAP pressure varied and these patient's IPAP/EPAP values were in the range of 12-18/6-12. Patient 7 developed pneumomediastinum while mechanically ventilated on pressure control mode. Pneumomediastinum for patients 1-7 was managed conservatively. Patient 4 had pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax and so a chest tube was placed. Pneumomediastinum resolved in patients 3-7. Patients 1,2, and 4 died of multi-organ failure. Discussion: Pneumomediastinum has several known causes including trauma of the trachea or esophagus and positive pressure ventilation associated barotrauma. Viral pneumonia has rarely been associated with pneumomediastinum, but inflammatory lung parenchyma damage may also cause alveolar rupture. We postulate that the patients in this case series suffered pneumomediastinum secondary to SARS CoV-2-related inflammatory lung damage which lowered the threshold for non-invasive positive pressure ventilation-mediated barotrauma. Weaning patients off BiPAP to high flow system or intubation and mechanical ventilation should be considered as a potential strategy. Finally, more studies are needed regarding occurrence of pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 to understand the mechanism and prognostic value.","Srinivasan, A.; Wilson, B.; Krishnamani, P.

While preventive vaccination and monoclonal antibody therapies have been rapidly developed and deployed, early in the pandemic the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was a common means of passive immunization, with the theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection remaining undetermined. Though vaccines elicit a strong and protective immune response, and transfusion of CCP with high titers of neutralization activity are correlated with better clinical outcomes, the question of whether antibodies in CCP can enhance infection of SARS-CoV2 has not been directly addressed. In this study, we analyzed for and observed passive transfer of neutralization activity with CCP transfusion. Furthermore, to specifically understand if antibodies against the spike protein (S) enhance infection, we measured the anti-S IgG, IgA, and IgM responses and adapted retroviral-pseudotypes to measure virus neutralization with target cells expressing the ACE2 virus receptor and the Fc alpha receptor (FcR) or Fc gamma receptor IIA (Fc{gamma}RIIA). Whereas neutralizing activity of CCP correlated best with higher titers of anti-S IgG antibodies, the neutralizing titer was not affected when Fc receptors were present on target cells. These observations support the absence of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) by IgG and IgA isotypes found in CCP. The results presented, therefore, support the clinical use of currently available antibody-based treatment including the continued study of CCP transfusion strategies.","Clark, Natasha M; Janaka, Sanath Kumar; Hartman, William; Stramer, Susan; Goodhue, Erin; Weiss, John; Evans, David T.; Connor, Joseph P.",,433,10

We do not find detectable effects of these policies on disease spread or deaths. We find small but measurable effects on mobility that dissipate over time. And we find small, delayed effects on unemployment. We conduct additional analyses that separately assess the effects of expanding versus withdrawing SIP orders and test whether there are spillover effects in other states. Our results are consistent with prior studies showing that SIP orders have accounted for a relatively small share of the mobility trends and economic disruptions associated with the pandemic. We reanalyze two prior studies purporting to show that SIP orders caused large reductions in disease prevalence, and show that those results are not reliable. Our results do not imply that social distancing behavior by individuals, as distinct from SIP policy, is ineffective.","Berry, Christopher R; Fowler, Anthony; Glazer, Tamara; Handel-Meyer, Samantha; MacMillen, Alec",Proc.

AIM OF STUDY: This review provided comprehensive and up-to-date information about botanic characterization and distribution, ethnopharmacology, secondary metabolites, pharmacological activities, and toxicology of plants of genus Stemona to explore the scientific potential and future therapeutic potential of the plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article conducted a literature review on information about the Stemona species in multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Wiley, Science Direct, Elsevier, Google Scholar, ACS publications, SpringerLink, Elsevier, and China National Knowledge Internet. Information was also derived from other literature sources (e.g. Chinese Pharmacopoeia, 2015 edition, Chinese herbal classic books, PhD and MSc thesis, etc). RESULTS: Our comprehensive analysis of the scientific literatures indicated that many Stemona species are popular and valuable herbal medicines with therapeutic potentials to treat various ailments. Phytochemical analyses identified alkaloids and stilbenoids as the major bioactive substances of Stemona species. Numerous studies have shown that the extracts and secondary metabolites isolated from these plants have a wide range pharmacological activity, including anti-inflammatory, antitussive, antitumour, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, insecticidal and antifeedant, and anti-virus activities. CONCLUSION: Though plants of genus Stemona have been put to enormous traditional uses, the pharmacological studies conducted were insufficient. Nowadays, researches were mainly focused on the antitussive, anti-inflammatory as well as insecticidal and antifeedant activities. Therefore, more secondary metabolites need to be studied for more detailed pharmacological studies. Further studies are also required to establish the mechanisms which mediate the plants' bioactivities in relation to the medicinal uses as well as investigate any potential toxicity for future clinical studies.","Liu, Yaoqi; Shen, Yue; Teng, Li; Yang, Longfei; Cao, Kun; Fu, Qiang",J Ethnopharmacol,433,16

The past year has highlighted risks to immunosuppressed cancer patients and shown the need for health equity among vulnerable groups. In this study, we describe the utilization of virtual visits by patients with gynecologic malignancies and assess their social vulnerability. METHODS: Virtual visit data of 270 gynecology oncology patients at a single institution from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020 was obtained by querying a cohort discovery tool. Through geocoding, the CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was utilized to assign social vulnerability indices to each patient and the results were analyzed for trends and statistical significance. RESULTS: African American patients were the most vulnerable with a median SVI of 0.71, Asian 0.60, Hispanic 0.41, and Caucasian 0.21. Eighty-seven percent of patients in this study were Caucasian, 8.9% African American, 3.3% Hispanic, and 1.1% Asian, which is comparable to the baseline institutional gynecologic cancer population. The mean census tract SVI variable when comparing patients to all census tracts in the United States was 0.31 (range 0.00 least vulnerable to 0.98 most vulnerable). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual visits were utilized by patients of all ages and gynecologic cancer types. African Americans were the most socially vulnerable patients of the cohort. Telemedicine is a useful platform for cancer care across the social vulnerability spectrum during the pandemic and beyond. To ensure continued access, further research and outreach efforts are needed.","McAlarnen, Lindsey A; Tsaih, Shirng-Wern; Aliani, Rana; Simske, Natasha M; Hopp, Elizabeth E",Gynecol Oncol,433,20

However, to train a practical DRL trading agent that decides where to trade, at what price, and what quantity involves error-prone and arduous development and debugging. In this paper, we introduce a DRL library FinRL that facilitates beginners to expose themselves to quantitative finance and to develop their own stock trading strategies. Along with easily-reproducible tutorials, FinRL library allows users to streamline their own developments and to compare with existing schemes easily. Within FinRL, virtual environments are configured with stock market datasets, trading agents are trained with neural networks, and extensive backtesting is analyzed via trading performance. Moreover, it incorporates important trading constraints such as transaction cost, market liquidity and the investor's degree of risk-aversion. FinRL is featured with completeness, hands-on tutorial and reproducibility that favors beginners: (i) at multiple levels of time granularity, FinRL simulates trading environments across various stock markets, including NASDAQ-100, DJIA, S&P 500, HSI, SSE 50, and CSI 300; (ii) organized in a layered architecture with modular structure, FinRL provides fine-tuned state-of-the-art DRL algorithms (DQN, DDPG, PPO, SAC, A2C, TD3, etc.), commonly-used reward functions and standard evaluation baselines to alleviate the debugging workloads and promote the reproducibility, and (iii) being highly extendable, FinRL reserves a complete set of user-import interfaces. Furthermore, we incorporated three application demonstrations, namely single stock trading, multiple stock trading, and portfolio allocation. The FinRL library will be available on Github at link https://github.com/AI4Finance-LLC/FinRL-Library.","Liu, Xiao-Yang; Yang, Hongyang; Chen, Qian; Zhang, Runjia; Yang, Liuqing; Xiao, Bowen; Wang, Christina Dan",,433,24

Rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) are promising tools for large-scale screenings due to timely results and feasibility for on-site testing. Nonetheless, the diagnostic performance of RADT in detecting infectious individuals is not yet fully determined. In this study, RT-qPCR and virus culture of RT-qPCR-positive samples were used to evaluate and compare the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test in detecting SARS-CoV-2-infected and possibly infectious individuals. To this end, two combined oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at a routine SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic center. A total of 2,028 samples were tested, and 118 virus cultures were inoculated. SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 210 samples by RT-qPCR, representing a positive rate of 10.36%. The Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test yielded a positive result in 92 (4.54%) samples resulting in an overall sensitivity and specificity of 42.86 and 99.89%, respectively. For adjusted CT values of <20 (n = 14), <25 (n = 57), and <30 (n = 88), the RADT reached sensitivities of 100, 98.25, and 88.64%, respectively. All 29 culture-positive samples were detected by the RADT. Although the overall sensitivity was low, the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test reliably detected patients with high RNA loads. In addition, negative RADT results fully corresponded with the lack of viral cultivability in Vero E6 cells.

To date, the coronavirus pandemic has infected over eighty million people and has killed more than 1.78 million worldwide. This study aims to explore “how useful is Reddit social media platform to surveil COVID-19 pandemic?” and “how do people’s concerns/behaviors change over the course of COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina?”. The purpose of this study was to compare people’s thoughts, behavior changes, discussion topics, and the number of confirmed cases and deaths by applying natural language processing (NLP) to COVID-19 related data.MethodsIn this study, we collected COVID-19 related data from 18 subreddits of North Carolina from March to August 2020. Next, we applied methods from natural language processing and machine learning to analyze collected Reddit posts using feature engineering, topic modeling, custom named-entity recognition (NER), and BERT-based (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) sentence clustering. Using these methods, we were able to glean people’s responses and their concerns about COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina.ResultsWe observed a positive change in attitudes towards masks for residents in North Carolina. The high-frequency words in all subreddit corpora for each of the COVID-19 mitigation strategy categories are: Distancing (DIST)—“social distance/distancing”, “lockdown”, and “work from home”;Disinfection (DIT)—“(hand) sanitizer/soap”, “hygiene”, and ""wipe"";Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)—“mask/facemask(s)/face shield”, “n95(s)/kn95”, and “cloth/gown”;Symptoms (SYM)—“death”, “flu/influenza”, and “cough/coughed”;Testing (TEST)—“cases”, “(antibody) test”, and “test results (positive/negative)”.ConclusionThe findings in our study show that the use of Reddit data to monitor COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina (NC) was effective.

This work was aimed to analyze the association between preadmission cardiometabolic therapy (antidiabetic, antiaggregant, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering drugs) and in-hospital mortality among patients &#8805;80 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) hospitalized for COVID-19. METHOD: We conducted a nationwide, multicenter, observational study in patients &#8805;80 years with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 1 and May 29, 2020. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between preadmission cardiometabolic therapy and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the 2 763 patients &#8805;80 years old hospitalized due to COVID-19, 790 (28.6%) had T2DM. Of these patients, 385 (48.7%) died during admission. On the multivariate analysis, the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.502, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.309-0.815, p = .005) and angiotensin receptor blockers (AOR 0.454, 95% CI: 0.274-0.759, p = .003) were independent protectors against in-hospital mortality, whereas the use of acetylsalicylic acid was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (AOR 1.761, 95% CI: 1.092-2.842, p = .020).

The outbreak has been so rapid and widespread that even the most developed countries are still struggling with ways to contain the spread of the virus. The virus began spreading from Wuhan in China in December 2019 and has currently affected more than200 countries worldwide. Nanotechnology has huge potential for killing viruses as severe as HIV, herpes, human papilloma virus, and viruses of the respiratory tract, both inside as well as outside the host. Metal-nanoparticles can be employed for biosensing methodology of viruses/bacteria, along with the development of novel drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 and future pandemics. It is thus required for the nanoparticles to be synthesized quickly along with precise control over their size distribution. In this study, we propose a simple microfluidic-reactor-platform for in-situ metal-nanoparticle synthesis to be used against the pandemic for the development of preventive, diagnostic, and antiviral drug therapies. The device has been fabricated using a customized standard photolithography process using a simple and cost-effective setup. The confirmation on standard silver and gold metal nanoparticle formation in the microfluidic reactor platform was analysed using optical fiber spectrophotometer. This novel microfluidic platform provides the advantage of in-situ synthesis, flow parameter control and reduced agglomeration of nanoparticles over the bulk synthesis due to segregation of nucleation and growth stages inside a microchannel. The results are highly reproducible and hence scaling up of the nanoparticle production is possible without involving complex instrumentation.","Prabhakar, Amit; Bansal, Ishita; Jaiswar, Ankur; Roy, Nimisha; Verma, Deepti",,433,24

Anticipatory planning for birth rates is important for health care systems and government agencies to accurately estimate size of economy and model working and/or aging populations. Objective: To use projection modeling based on electronic health care records in a large US university medical center to estimate changes in pregnancy and birth rates prior to and after the COVID-19 pandemic societal lockdowns. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included all pregnancy episodes within a single US academic health care system retrospectively from 2017 and modeled prospectively to 2021. Data were analyzed September 2021. Exposures: Pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic societal shutdown measures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was number of new pregnancy episodes initiated within the health care system and use of those episodes to project birth volumes. Interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the degree to which COVID-19 societal changes may have factored into pregnancy episode volume. Potential reasons for the changes in volumes were compared with historical pregnancy volumes, including delays in starting prenatal care, interruptions in reproductive endocrinology and infertility services, and preterm birth rates. Results: This cohort study documented a steadily increasing number of pregnancy episodes over the study period, from 4100 pregnancies in 2017 to 4620 in 2020 (28â¯284 total pregnancies; median maternal [interquartile range] age, 30 [27-34] years; 18â¯728 [66.2%] White women, 3794 [13.4%] Black women; 2177 [7.7%] Asian women). A 14% reduction in pregnancy episode initiation was observed after the societal shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (risk ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.92; P < .001). This decrease appeared to be due to a decrease in conceptions that followed the March 15 mandated COVID-19 pandemic societal shutdown. Prospective modeling of pregnancies currently suggests that a birth volume surge can be anticipated in summer 2021. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study using electronic medical record surveillance found an initial decline in births associated with the COVID-19 pandemic societal changes and an anticipated increase in birth volume. Future studies can further explore how pregnancy episode volume changes can be monitored and birth rates projected in real-time during major societal events.","Stout, Molly J; Van De Ven, Cosmas J M; Parekh, Vikas I; Pardo, Jennifer L; Garifullin, Maxim; Xu, Min; Fenner, Dee E; Smith, Roger D",JAMA Netw Open,433,14

This has again led to search for alternate re-purposed drugs and/or effective “add-on” nutritional supplementation, which can complement or enhance the therapeutic effect of re-purposed drug. Focus has been shifted to therapeutic targets of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which includes specific enzymes and regulators of lipid metabolism.

A preclinical study has shown synergistic effect of quercetin (a flavonoid) and fenofibrate in reducing the cholesterol content, which might be useful in COVID-19 treatment. Based on the scientific literature, use of quercetin and fenofibrate in COVID-19 seems meaningful in pharmaceutical and biomedical research, and warrants basic, experimental and clinical studies.

The factors that influence the implementation and use of telehealth in critical access hospitals are in need of exploration. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to understand the factors that influenced telehealth uptake and use in a set of frontier critical access hospitals in the United States. METHODS: This work was conducted as part of a larger evaluation of a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services-funded demonstration program to expand cost-based reimbursement for services for Medicare beneficiaries for frontier critical access hospitals. Our sample was 8 critical access hospitals in Montana, Nevada, and North Dakota that implemented the telehealth aspect of that demonstration. We reviewed applications and progress reports for the demonstration program and conducted in-person site visits. We used a semistructured discussion guide to facilitate conversations with clinical, administrative, and information technology staff. Using NVivo software (QSR International), we coded the notes from the interviews and then analyzed the themes. RESULTS: Several factors influenced the implementation and use of telehealth in critical access hospitals, including making changes to workflow and infrastructure as well as practitioner acceptance and availability. Participants also cited technical assistance and support for implementation as supportive factors. CONCLUSIONS: Frontier critical access hospitals may adopt telehealth to overcome challenges such as distance from specialty practitioners and workforce challenges. Telehealth can be used for provider-to-patient and provider-to-provider interactions to improve access to care, remove barriers, and improve quality. However, the ability of telehealth to improve outcomes is limited by factors such as workflow and infrastructure changes, practitioner acceptance and availability, and financing.","Haque, Saira Naim; DeStefano, Sydney; Banger, Alison; Rutledge, Regina; Romaire, Melissa",JMIR Form Res,433,16

However, epidemiological studies in ophthalmology are still scarce in Japan, and the sizes of the cohorts are relatively small. ""Ganka-Ekigaku Network"" (GEN, an acronym for the epidemiological network in ophthalmology in Japanese) is established to develop a capacity to boost each epidemiological study and enrich a potential inter-study collaboration to identify risk factors of visual impairment in aged society. METHODS: We reviewed cohort studies in Japan with the inclusion criteria as: (1) at least n = 1000 at baseline, (2) multiple modalities of ophthalmic data, and (3) diagnosis reviewed by ophthalmologist(s), and (4) ophthalmologists are involved in the investigators group. As of January 2020, GEN includes 4 individual Japanese epidemiological studies namely, Hisayama study, Yamagata Study (Funagata), Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort study, and the Nagahama Prospective Genome Cohort for Comprehensive Human Bioscience. RESULTS: GEN includes approximately 25,000 Japanese participants. The baseline surveys started from 1998 to 2012, and since then the data has been prospectively collected approximately every 5 years. A variety of ophthalmic measurements and other factors have been collected in each study in GEN: ophthalmic measurements (fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, etc.), systemic conditions (laboratory data, etc.), and others (DNA, etc.). CONCLUSION: GEN is an open platform for observational ophthalmic epidemiological studies to share standardized methodologies. While each study in GEN pursues specific and original research questions, standardization of the methods will enable us to conduct reliable meta-analysis/pooled data analyses.","Sasaki, Mariko; Miyake, Masahiro; Fujiwara, Kohta; Nanba, Hiroyuki; Akiyama, Masato; Yanagi, Yasuo; Harada, Sei; Tabara, Yasuharu; Yasuda, Miho; Yamashita, Hidetoshi; Kayama, Takamasa; Tsubota, Kazuo; Matsuda, Fumihiko; Hashimoto, Sawako; Ueda, Emi; Ninomiya, Toshiharu; Takebayashi, Toru; Tsujikawa, Akitaka; Sonoda, Koh-Hei; Kawasaki, Ryo",Ophthalmic Epidemiol,433,1

Here, we claim that we reliably detected A-to-G RNA modifications in the RNA-seq data of SARS-CoV-2 with high signal to noise ratios, presumably caused by the host's deamination enzymes. Intriguingly, since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, it is technically impossible to distinguish SNPs and RNA modifications from the RNA-seq data alone without solid evidence, making it difficult to tell the evolutionary patterns behind the mutation spectrum. Researchers should clarify their biological significance before they automatically regard the mutations as SNPs or RNA modifications.

Emergency department point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is a first-line modality for diagnosis of CAP. The current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic creates a unique opportunity to incorporate lung POCUS into the evaluation of a broader range of children. It has increased the utility of lung POCUS in both evaluation and follow-up of pediatric coronavirus cases. An increased use of lung POCUS creates an opportunity for earlier diagnosis while allowing the opportunity for overdiagnosis of small infiltrates and atelectasis. We collated a case series to demonstrate the benefit of lung POCUS in a very broad range of children. Methods: We collected a case series of 5 patients between December 2018 and December 2019 who presented nonclassically and were diagnosed with CAP on POCUS by a pediatric emergency physician. Conclusion: Routine lung POCUS in ill children will allow treating physicians to identify and follow a pulmonary infiltrate consistent with CAP quickly. We anticipate that early and more frequent use of POCUS and earlier diagnosis of CAP may improve outcomes by decreasing healthcare encounters within the same illness and by reducing the incidence of late sequelae of pneumonia such as empyema and effusions. However, we acknowledge that this may come at the expense of the overtreatment of viral infiltrates and atelectasis. Further study is required to improve the specificity of lung POCUS in the evaluation of CAP.","Scheier, Eric; Levick, Nadine; Peled, Julia; Balla, Uri",Pediatr Qual Saf,433,16

In this article, we analyzed different Italian COVID-19 data at the regional level for the period 24 February to 29 March 2020. The analysis pipeline includes the following steps. After individuating groups of similar or dissimilar regions with respect to the ten types of available COVID-19 data using statistical test, we built several similarity matrices. Then, we mapped those similarity matrices into networks where nodes represent Italian regions and edges represent similarity relationships (edge length is inversely proportional to similarity). Then, network-based analysis was performed mainly discovering communities of regions that show similar behavior. In particular, network-based analysis was performed by running several community detection algorithms on those networks and by underlying communities of regions that show similar behavior. The network-based analysis of Italian COVID-19 data is able to elegantly show how regions form communities, i.e., how they join and leave them, along time and how community consistency changes along time and with respect to the different available data.","Milano, Marianna; Cannataro, Mario",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),433,1

This study aimed to compare the sleep quality of medical personnel conscripted to the Wuhan Union Cancer Centre to offer support during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic to the sleep quality of those who remained at Anhui Medical University Hospital and to determine the role of interventions in improving sleep quality. MATERIAL AND METHODS Questionnaires were completed by 369 individuals who were conscripted to support Wuhan (N=137) and others who were not (the control group; N=232). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure the duration and quality of sleep. The Anhui Provincial Health Commission organized a comprehensive intervention, consisting of physical-psychological-social dimensions, over the course of 2 weeks. RESULTS Only 34.21% of the Wuhan support workers reported better sleep quality, as opposed to the 55.60% of the control group at stage 1 (t/&#967;²=14.005, P<.001). Furthermore, despite the Wuhan support group being more prone to poor sleep quality, their sleep quality significantly improved after the interventions. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this study showed that medical staff who were conscripted to offer support during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic suffered from impaired quality of sleep. The use of questionnaire-based sleep assessments may provide individualized approaches to supporting medical personnel during future epidemics and pandemics. Furthermore, our results indicate that relevant interventions can significantly improve sleep quality, while a prolonged break after interventions does not affect sleep quality.","Zhu, Wen; Fang, Yue; Bai, Zhong-Liang; Li, Nian-Nian; Zhao, Jia-Yun; Hu, Zhi",Med Sci Monit,433,16

However, manual assessment of ONSD by a human operator is cumbersome and prone to human error. We aimed to develop and test an automated algorithm for ONSD measurement using ultrasound images and compare it to measurements performed by physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from the Neurological Intensive Care Unit. Ultrasound images of the optic nerve sheath from both eyes were obtained using an ultrasound unit with an ocular preset. Images were processed by two attending physicians to calculate ONSD manually. The images were processed as well using a novel computerized algorithm that automatically analyzes ultrasound images and calculates ONSD. Algorithm-measured ONSD was compared to manually measured ONSD using multiple statistical measures. RESULTS: Forty-Four patients with an average/standard deviation (SD) intracranial pressure of 14(9.7) mm Hg were recruited and tested (with a range between 1 and 57 mm Hg). A t-test showed no statistical difference between the ONSD from left and right eyes (P > 0.05). Furthermore, a paired t-test showed no significant difference between the manual and algorithm measure ONSD with a mean difference (SD) of 0.012(0.046) cm (P > 0.05) and percentage error of difference of 6.43% (P = 0.15). Agreement between the two operators was highly correlated (Interclass Correlation coefficient = 0.8, P = 0.26). Bland-Altman analysis revealed mean difference (SD) of 0.012 (0.046) (P = 0.303) and limits of agreement between -0.1 and 0.08. Receiver operator curve analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.965 (P < 0.0001) with high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The automated image-analysis algorithm calculates ONSD reliably and with high precision when compared to measurements obtained by expert physicians. The algorithm may have a role in computer-aided decision support systems in acute brain injury.","Rajajee, Venkatakrishna; Soroushmehr, Reza; Williamson, Craig A; Najarian, Kayvan; Gryak, Jonathan; Awad, Abdelrahman; Ward, Kevin R; Tiba, Mohamad H",Mil. med,433,1

To yield the well-interconnected macroporous structures with equiaxed pores and nanofibrous architectures, the TIPS technique is combined with particulate leaching. The macroporous structure of produced scaffolds duplicates the predefined three-dimensional template structure. The homogenous macrostructure with well-interconnected equiaxed pores and no particular orientation is created. Modulating the size and shape of microspheres has precise control over porosity, pore size, and interconnection of the matrix.

Even though the static structure of Remdesivir binding to RdRp has been solved and biochemical experiments have suggested it to be a ""delayed chain terminator"", the underlying molecular mechanisms is not fully understood. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 24 microseconds to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of Remdesivir on nucleotide addition and proofreading. We found that when Remdesivir locates at an upstream site in RdRp, the 1'-cyano group experiences electrostatic interactions with a salt bridge (Asp865-Lys593), which subsequently halts translocation. Our findings can supplement the current understanding of the delayed chain termination exerted by Remdesivir and provide an alternative molecular explanation about Remdesivir's inhibitory mechanism. Such inhibition also reduces the likelihood of Remdesivir to be cleaved by ExoN acting on 3'-terminal nucleotides. Furthermore, our study also suggests that Remdesivir's 1'-cyano group can disrupt the cleavage site of ExoN via steric interactions, leading to a further reduction in the cleavage efficiency. Our work provides plausible and novel mechanisms at the molecular level of how Remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication, and our findings may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.","Zhang, Lu; Zhang, Dong; Wang, Xiaowei; Yuan, Congmin; Li, Yongfang; Jia, Xilin; Gao, Xin; Yen, Hui-Ling; Cheung, Peter Pak-Hang; Huang, Xuhui",Phys Chem Chem Phys,433,15

However, the ramp down in cardiac surgery volumes may result in unintended harm to patients who are at high risk of mortality if their conditions are left untreated. To help optimize triage decisions, we derived and ambispectively validated a clinical score to predict intensive care unit length of stay after cardiac surgery. Methods and Results Following ethics approval, we derived and performed multicenter valida tion of clinical models to predict the likelihood of short (&#8804;2 days) and prolonged intensive care unit length of stay (&#8805;7 days) in patients aged &#8805;18 years, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and/or aortic, mitral, and tricuspid value surgery in Ontario, Canada. Multivariable logistic regression with backward variable selection was used, along with clinical judgment, in the modeling process. For the model that predicted short intensive care unit stay, the c-statistic was 0.78 in the derivation cohort and 0.71 in the validation cohort. For the model that predicted prolonged stay, c-statistic was 0.85 in the derivation and 0.78 in the validation cohort. The models, together termed the CardiOttawa LOS Score, demonstrated a high degree of accuracy during prospective testing. Conclusions Clinical judgment alone has been shown to be inaccurate in predicting postoperative intensive care unit length of stay. The CardiOttawa LOS Score performed well in prospective validation and will complement the clinician's gestalt in making more efficient resource allocation during the COVID-19 period and beyond.","Sun, Louise Y; Bader Eddeen, Anan; Ruel, Marc; MacPhee, Erika; Mesana, Thierry G",J Am Heart Assoc,433,10

When reviewing the literature it became obvious that keeping up-to-date with all relevant publications is almost impossible. We searched for and summarised clinically relevant topics that could help making clinical decisions. This is a subjective analysis of literature concerning specific topics raised in our daily practice (e.g., clinical features of COVID-19 patients; ventilation of the critically ill COVID-19 patient; diagnostic of infection with SARS-CoV-2; stability of the virus; Covid-19 in specific patient populations, e.g., paediatrics, immunosuppressed patients, patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, kidney or liver disease; co-medication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); antiviral treatment) and we believe that these answers help colleagues in clinical decision-making.

The evolutionary transition from water to land demands various morphological and physiological adaptations of tissues and organs including the sensory and nervous system. In this review, we aim to compare the brain architecture between selected terrestrial and closely related marine representatives of the crustacean taxa Amphipoda, Isopoda, Brachyura, and Anomala with an emphasis on the elements of the olfactory pathway including receptor molecules. Our comparison of neuroanatomical structures between terrestrial members and their close aquatic relatives suggests that during the convergent evolution of terrestrial life-styles, the elements of the olfactory pathway were subject to different morphological transformations. In terrestrial anomalans (Coenobitidae), the elements of the primary olfactory pathway (antennules and olfactory lobes) are in general considerably enlarged whereas they are smaller in terrestrial brachyurans compared to their aquatic relatives. Studies on the repertoire of receptor molecules in Coenobitidae do not point to specific terrestrial adaptations but suggest that perireceptor events - processes in the receptor environment before the stimuli bind - may play an important role for aerial olfaction in this group. In terrestrial members of amphipods (Amphipoda: Talitridae) as well as of isopods (Isopoda: Oniscidea), however, the antennules and olfactory sensilla (aesthetascs) are largely reduced and miniaturized. Consequently, their primary olfactory processing centers are suggested to have been lost during the evolution of a life on land. Nevertheless, in terrestrial Peracarida, the (second) antennae as well as their associated tritocerebral processing structures are presumed to compensate for this loss or rather considerable reduction of the (deutocerebral) primary olfactory pathway. We conclude that after the evolutionary transition from water to land, it is not trivial for arthropods to establish aerial olfaction. If we consider insects as an ingroup of Crustacea, then the Coenobitidae and Insecta may be seen as the most successful crustacean representatives in this respect.","Krieger, Jakob; Hörnig, Marie K; Kenning, Matthes; Hansson, Bill S; Harzsch, Steffen",Arthropod Struct Dev,433,21

Healthcare professionals, especially dentists, are exposed to a higher risk of getting infected due to close contact with infected patients. The current study was conducted to assess anxiety and fear of getting infected among dentists while working during the current novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) outbreak. In addition, dentists' knowledge about various practice modifications to combat COVID-19 has been evaluated. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from 10th to 17th March 2020. The well-constructed questionnaire was designed and registered at online website (Kwiksurveys) and validated. A total of 669 participants from 30 different countries across the world responded. After scrutiny, completed questionnaires (n = 650) were included in the study. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Chi-Square and Spearman correlation tests were applied to control confounders and assess the relation of dentists' response with respect to gender and educational level. More than two-thirds of the general dental practitioners (78%) from 30 countries questioned were anxious and scared by the devastating effects of COVID-19. A large number of dentists (90%) were aware of recent changes in the treatment protocols. However, execution of amended treatment protocol was recorded as 61%. The majority of the dentists (76%) were working in the hospital setting out of which 74% were from private, and 20% were from government setups. Individually we received a large number of responses from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but collectively more than 50% of the responses were from other parts of the world. Despite having a high standard of knowledge and practice, dental practitioners around the globe are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective fields due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on humanity. A number of dental practices have either modified their services according to the recommended guidelines to emergency treatment only or closed down practices for an uncertain period.","Ahmed, M.

Significant efforts to improving safety have been employed, including the use of personal protective equipment, preoperative COVID-19 testing, and recently the use of a modified surgical mask barrier. OBJECTIVE: To reduce the risks of pathogen transmission during endoscopic skull base surgery. METHODS: This study was exempt from Institutional Review Board approval. Our study utilizes a 3-dimensional (3D)-printed mask with an anterior aperture fitted with a surgical glove with ports designed to allow for surgical instrumentation and side ports to accommodate suction ventilation and an endotracheal tube. As an alternative, a modified laparoscopic surgery trocar served as a port for instruments, and, on the contralateral side, rubber tubing was used over the endoscrub endosheath to create an airtight seal. Surgical freedom and aerosolization were tested in both modalities. RESULTS: The ventilated mask allowed for excellent surgical maneuverability and freedom. The trocar system was effective for posterior surgical procedures, allowing access to critical paramedian structures, and afforded a superior surgical seal, but was limited in terms of visualization and maneuverability during anterior approaches. Aerosolization was reduced using both the mask and nasal trocar. CONCLUSION: The ventilated upper airway endoscopic procedure mask allows for a sealed surgical barrier during endoscopic skull base surgery and may play a critical role in advancing skull base surgery in the COVID-19 era. The nasal trocar may be a useful alternative in instances where 3D printing is not available. Additional studies are needed to validate these preliminary findings.","Helman, Samuel N; Soriano, Roberto M; Tomov, Martin L; Serpooshan, Vahid; Levy, Joshua M; Pradilla, Gustavo; Solares, C Arturo",Oper. neurosurg.

Unfortunately, information on protocols of individual studies differs from registry to registry. Furthermore, study designs, criteria for stratification of patients and choice of outcomes are quite heterogeneous. All this makes data sharing and secondary analysis difficult. At last, small single centre studies and the use of drugs on a compassionate basis should be replaced by highly powered, multi-centre, multi-arm clinical trials, in order to provide the required evidence of safety and efficacy of novel or repurposed candidate drugs.

In addition to common respiratory symptoms such as cough and fever, some patients also have cardiac injury, however, the mechanism of cardiac injury is not clear. In this study, we analyzed the RNA expression atlases of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), cathepsin B (CTSB) and cathepsin L (CTSL) in the human embryonic heart at single-cell resolution. RESULTS: The results showed that ACE2 was preferentially enriched in cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, serine protease transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) had less expression in cardiomyocytes, but CTSB and CTSL, which belonged to cell protease, could be found to be enriched in cardiomyocytes. The results of enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ACE2-positive cardiomyocytes were mainly enriched in the processes of cardiac muscle contraction, regulation of cardiac conduction, mitochondrial respiratory chain, ion channel binding, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes and viral transcription. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that both atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes are potentially susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2), and SARS-CoV-2 may enter ventricular cardiomyocytes using CTSB/CTSL for S protein priming.

In 2020 with their cocirculation, coinfections began to be observed and reported in different countries. As expected, this syndemic is evident in different areas and deserves proper characterisation and studies in Peru. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the clinical, epidemiological, diagnostic characteristics and outcomes in a Social Security Hospital of Chiclayo, Lambayeque, Peru, of patients that were diagnosed simultaneously with COVID-19 and dengue during May-August 2020. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients with COVID-19/dengue coinfection were identified. Of them, 60% presented thrombocytopenia, and 52% fever, among other findings. The case fatality rate in this group was 28%, being higher in those patients initially classified as severe dengue (100%), as well as in females (55%) than males (21%) (OR = 4.65; 95%CI 1.18-18.45). DISCUSSION: Co-occurrence of COVID-19/Dengue is growing as a consequence of the syndemic of these viral diseases in endemic areas, such as Latin America, and as both conditions may evolve to severe disease, their epidemiological but clinical interaction in terms of outcomes need further assessment in future studies in the region.","Mejía-Parra, Jorge Luis; Aguilar-Martinez, Sergio; Fernández-Mogollón, Jorge Luis; Luna, Camila; Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Díaz-Vélez, Cristian",Travel Med Infect Dis,433,1

After collecting the information, we collated, summarized, and reported the results using narrative synthesis. RESULTS: The search identified 181 articles. After the removal of duplicates and screening, 24 full-text articles were reviewed and included in this study: 14 original articles, 8 commentaries or editorials, and 2 protocols. Contrary to expectations, preliminary evidence suggested that gambling behavior often either decreased or stayed the same for most gamblers during the pandemic. However, for the minority who showed increased gambling behavior, there was frequently an association with problem gambling. CONCLUSION: The available literature on COVID-19 and gambling is limited and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gambling behavior and gambling problems is still unclear. Therefore, there is a need for more research on this topic, both qualitative and mixed methods studies, to better understand the impact of the pandemic on gambling. Considering the results, we need to be careful, particularly with problem gamblers and other subgroups of the population who seem to be more vulnerable to increased gambling habits during this pandemic period.","Brodeur, Magaly; Audette-Chapdelaine, Sophie; Savard, Annie-Claude; Kairouz, Sylvia",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,433,15

Limited data are available on how a patient's concomitant cancer diagnosis affected ethical concerns raised during the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all COVID-related ethics consultations registered in a prospectively collected ethics database at a tertiary cancer center between March 14, 2020, and April 28, 2020. Primary and secondary ethical issues, as well as important contextual factors, were identified. RESULTS: Twenty-six clinical ethics consultations were performed on 24 patients with cancer (58.3% male; median age, 65.5 years). The most common primary ethical issues were code status (n = 11), obligation to provide nonbeneficial treatment (n = 3), patient autonomy (n = 3), resource allocation (n = 3), and delivery of care wherein the risk to staff might outweigh the potential benefit to the patient (n = 3). An additional nine consultations raised concerns about staff safety in the context of likely nonbeneficial treatment as a secondary issue. Unique contextual issues identified included concerns about public safety for patients requesting discharge against medical advice (n = 3) and difficulties around decision making, especially with regard to code status because of an inability to reach surrogates (n = 3). CONCLUSION: During the early pandemic, the care of patients with cancer and COVID-19 spurred a number of ethics consultations, which were largely focused on code status. Most cases also raised concerns about staff safety in the context of limited benefit to patients, a highly unusual scenario at our institution that may have been triggered by critical supply shortages.","Friedman, Danielle Novetsky; Blackler, Liz; Alici, Yesne; Scharf, Amy E; Chin, Martin; Chawla, Sanjay; James, Monique C; Voigt, Louis P",JCO Oncol Pract,433,20

DESIGN: Nationwide cohort study with propensity-score matching. SETTING: Population-based nationwide cohort in Korea. STUDY POPULATION: Data were obtained from the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service of Korea, including all patients older than 40 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing in South Korea between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020 (excluding self-referral). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was the primary outcome and severe clinical outcome of COVID-19 was the secondary outcome. RESULTS: The unmatched cohort consisted of 135,435 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 4531 (3.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 5493 (4.1%) patients had AMD. After propensity score matching, exudative AMD was associated with an increased likelihood of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.25), and a considerably greater risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (aOR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.02 to 5.26), but not any AMD and non-exudative AMD. CONCLUSIONS: In a Korean nationwide cohort, our data suggest that clinicians should be aware of the greater risk of susceptibility to severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with exudative AMD. Our findings provide an improved understanding of the relationship between the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and chronic neurological disorders.","Yang, Jee Myung; Moon, Sung Yong; Lee, Joo Young; Agalliu, Dritan; Yon, Dong Keon; Lee, Seung Won",Am J Ophthalmol,433,15

The combination of both approaches shall revolutionize healthcare, accelerating clinical trial processes and reducing the costs and time involved in drug research and development. AREAS COVERED: This review explores the basics of artificial intelligence and systems biology approaches in the vaccine development pipeline. The topics include a detailed description of epitope prediction tools for designing epitope-based vaccines and agent-based models for immune system response prediction, along with a focus on their potentiality to facilitate clinical trial phases. EXPERT OPINION: Artificial intelligence and systems biology offer the opportunity to avoid the inefficiencies and failures that arise in the classical vaccine development pipeline. One promising solution is the combination of both methodologies in a multiscale perspective through an accurate pipeline. We are entering an 'in silico era' in which scientific partnerships, including a more and more increasing creation of an 'ecosystem' of collaboration and multidisciplinary approach, are relevant for addressing the long and risky road of vaccine discovery and development. In this context, regulatory guidance should be developed to qualify the in silico trials as evidence for intelligent vaccine development.","Russo, Giulia; Reche, Pedro; Pennisi, Marzio; Pappalardo, Francesco",Expert Opin Drug Discov,433,16

To better devise control strategies, policymakers should adjust policies based on scientific evidence in hand. Several countries have limited the epidemics of COVID-19 by prioritizing containment strategies to mitigate the impacts on public health and healthcare systems. However, asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19 complicated traditional symptom-based approaches for disease control. In addition, drastic population-based interventions usually have significant societal and economic impacts. Therefore, in Taiwan, the containment strategies consisted of the more extended case-based interventions (e.g., case detection with enhanced surveillance and contact tracing with active monitoring and quarantine of close contacts) and more targeted population-based interventions (e.g., face mask use in recommended settings and risk-oriented border control with corresponding quarantine requirement).

Zinc is known to modulate antiviral and antibacterial immunity and regulate inflammatory response. Despite the lack of clinical data, certain indications suggest that modulation of zinc status may be beneficial in COVID­19. In vitro experiments demonstrate that Zn2+ possesses antiviral activity through inhibition of SARS­CoV RNA polymerase. This effect may underlie therapeutic efficiency of chloroquine known to act as zinc ionophore. Indirect evidence also indicates that Zn2+ may decrease the activity of angiotensin­converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), known to be the receptor for SARS­CoV­2. Improved antiviral immunity by zinc may also occur through up­regulation of interferon &#945; production and increasing its antiviral activity. Zinc possesses anti­inflammatory activity by inhibiting NF­&#954;B signaling and modulation of regulatory T­cell functions that may limit the cytokine storm in COVID­19. Improved Zn status may also reduce the risk of bacterial co­infection by improving mucociliary clearance and barrier function of the respiratory epithelium, as well as direct antibacterial effects against S. pneumoniae. Zinc status is also tightly associated with risk factors for severe COVID­19 including ageing, immune deficiency, obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, since these are known risk groups for zinc deficiency. Therefore, Zn may possess protective effect as preventive and adjuvant therapy of COVID­19 through reducing inflammation, improvement of mucociliary clearance, prevention of ventilator­induced lung injury, modulation of antiviral and antibacterial immunity.

This large and rapidly growing field may overwhelm the synthesizing abilities of both researchers and policy-makers. To provide a sinopsis, prevent errors, and detect cognitive gaps that may require interdisciplinary research methods, the literature on COVID-19 is summarized, twice. The overall purpose of this study is to generate a dialogue meant to explain the genesis of and/or find remedies for omissions and contradictions. The first review starts in Biology and ends in Policy. Policy is chosen as a destination because it is the setting where cognitive integration must occur. The second review follows the opposite path: it begins with stated policies on COVID-19 and then their assumptions and disciplinary relationships are identified. The purpose of this interdisciplinary method on methods is to yield a relational and explanatory view of the field -one strategy likely to be incomplete but usable when large bodies of literature need to be rapidly summarized. These reviews identify nine inter-related problems, research needs, or omissions, namely: [1] nation-wide, geo-referenced, epidemiological data collection systems (open to and monitored by the public); [2]metrics meant to detect non-symptomatic cases -e.g., test positivity-; [3]cost-benefit oriented methods, which should demonstrate they detect silent viral spreaders even with limited testing; [4] new personalized tests that inform on biological functions and disease correlates, such as cell-mediated immunity, co-morbidities, and immuno-suppression; [5] factors that influence vaccine effectiveness, [6]economic predictions that consider the long-term consequences likely to follow epidemics that growth exponentially; [7] the errors induced by self-limiting and/or implausible paradigms, such as binary and reductionist approaches; [8] new governance models that emphasize problem-solving skills, social participation, and the use of scientific knowledge; and [9] new educational programs that utilize visual aids and audience-specific communication strategies. The analysis indicates that, to optimally address these problems, disciplinary and social integration is needed. By asking what is/are the potential cause(s) and consequence(s) of each issue, this methodology generates visualizations that reveal possible relationships as well as omissions and contradictions. While inherently limited in scope and likely to become obsolete, these shortcomings are avoided when this 'method on methods' is frequently practiced.

Method: The participants in Turkey to 532 adolescents (304 females, 228 males) are formed. In the study COVID-19 Fear Scale, Life Satisfaction Scale, Subjective Vitality Scale, and Problematic Internet Use Scale were used. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, education was not held in schools, so data were collected online. For this, scales were sent to the participants through online data collection prepared via Google Forms. Results: Relationships between adolescents' fear of experiencing coronavirus and their life satisfaction, fitness, and problematic internet use were determined by Pearson correlation analysis. It is seen that the problematic internet use has a positive relationship with the fear of COVID-19, a negative relationship with life satisfaction and other vitality, and low follow-up. It is observed that there is a low level, negatively significant relationship between COVID-19 and life satisfaction and vitality. Regression analysis examined the mediating relationship between life satisfaction and age's fear of COVID-19 and internet use. The research was performed by Hayes (2009) to test the mediating effect. The process was carried out in the macro mirror. In this method, 5000 resampling method was chosen. Discussion: Their results mediate the relationship between life satisfaction and health fear of COVID-19 and problematic internet use.","Peker, A.; Cengiz, S.; Yildiz, M.

Psychological preparedness, the primed cognitive awareness and anticipation of dealing with emotional responses in an adverse situation, has assumed a compelling relevance during a health disaster of this magnitude. METHODS: An anonymized eSurvey was conducted in India to assess psychological preparedness toward the ongoing pandemic with a focus on knowledge, management of own and others' emotional response, and anticipatory coping mechanisms among the survey population. An adapted version of the qualitative Psychological Preparedness for Natural Disaster Scale validated by the World Health Organization was widely circulated over the Internet and various social media platforms for assessment. Results are expressed as median ± standard deviation. Descriptive statistics were used and figures downloaded from surveymonkey.com. RESULTS: Of the 1120 respondents (M:F 1.7:1, age 35 years ±14.1), most expressed a high level of perceived knowledge and confidence of managing COVID-19, such as awareness of the symptoms of the illness (95.1%), actions needed (94.4%), hospital to report to (88.9%), and emergency contact number (89.1%). A majority (95%) monitored regularly the news bulletins and scientific journals regarding COVID-19. However, nearly one-third (29.2%) could not assess their likelihood of developing COVID-19, and 17.5% were unaware of the difference between a mild and severe infection. Twenty-three percent (23.3%) were unfamiliar with the materials needed in an acute illness situation. CONCLUSION: Psychological disaster preparedness is reasonable, although lacking in specific domains. Timely but focused interventions can be a cost-efficient administrative exercise, which federal agencies may prioritize working on.","Agarwal, Vishwesh; Sharma, Supriya; Gupta, Latika; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Davalbhakta, Samira; Agarwal, Vikas; Goel, Ashish; Aggarwal, Shelley",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,433,27

METHODS: We examined 265 vertigo/dizziness outpatients at the ear, nose, and throat department of the Nara Medical University between March 01, 2020, and May 31, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. We also focused on 478 vertigo/dizziness outpatients between March 01, 2019, and May 31, 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, to compare the number of cancellations between these 2 periods. The reasons for cancellation and noncancellation were investigated using telephone multiple-choice questionnaires (telMCQs), particularly for patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Meniere's disease (MD). RESULTS: There were many cancellations for medical examinations during the 2020 study period. The total number of vertigo/dizziness outpatients decreased by 44.6% in the 2020 period compared to the same period in 2019. The percent reduction in clinic attendance from 2019 to 2020 (ie, [2019-2020]/2019) for patients with BPPV was higher than that for patients with MD. Compared to the other vertigo-associated conditions, patients with MD exhibited a lower percent reduction in clinic attendance. According to the results of the telMCQs, 75.0% of BPPV cases and 88.2% of MD cases cancelled their appointment and gave up visiting hospitals due to fear of COVID-19 infection, even if they had moderate to severe symptoms. On the contrary, 25.0% and 80.0% patients with BPPV and MD, respectively, did not cancel their appointment; they should not have visited the hospital but stayed at home because they had slight symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that advanced forms should be prepared for medical care, such as remote medicine. These forms should not only be for the disease itself but also for the mental distress caused by persistent symptoms.","Ueda, Keita; Ota, Ichiro; Yamanaka, Toshiaki; Kitahara, Tadashi",Ear Nose Throat J,433,30

OBJECTIVE: To review a selective for a course in diagnostic pathology geared toward undergraduate medical students, including its design, technical implementation, instructor and student evaluations, and suggestions for options for further adjusting and optimizing the selective. DESIGN: Whole slide images (WSI) were anonymized and students were given remote access to university computers, which were prepared with two freely available WSI viewers. Each topic was taught in a four-part module: Self-assigned reading, lecture via Zoom, quiz based on digital slide sets, and a frontal review of the slides via Zoom. Fifty-nine students participated in the selective. Following the course, students completed an anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 59 participants, 42% (n = 25) responded. None of the respondents had any previous instruction in diagnostic pathology. Overall, the course was rated very favorably: 68% (n = 17) gave at least 3 points on a 4-point scale on questions relating to course interest, improvement in understanding of the covered diseases, and how strongly they would recommend a student take this course if given an option. The most significant disadvantage of the class, as reported by 80% (n = 20) were technical challenges in accessing the slides. CONCLUSION: We believe the course was a success and can be a model for future virtual pathology electives. Great effort should be done to provide technical support to the students.

In this case-based review, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, and in-hospital course of acute myocarditis. In addition, the limitations of the myocarditis diagnosis were discussed since only fulminant myocarditis cases have been mentioned in the current literature. METHODS We performed a review of the literature of all patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis using the databases of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane. RESULTS 16 case reports were found to be related to COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis. We observed that the ECG findings in most of the COVID-19 patients were non-specific, including diffuse ST-segment elevation, non-specific intraventricular conduction delay, sinus tachycardia, and inverted T-waves in anterior leads. Echocardiographic findings of COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis patients ranged from preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without segmental abnormalities to reduced LVEF with global hypokinesia. Interestingly, a few patients with COVID-19-induced acute fulminant myocarditis were steroid-responsive and had an amelioration with glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin therapy. CONCLUSION Despite the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, a limited number of cases has been shared in the current literature. There are a lot of difficulties in the differential diagnosis of acute myocarditis in the context of COVID-19.","Çinar, Tufan; Hayiroglu, Mert Ilker; Çiçek, Vedat; Uzun, Mehmet; Orhan, Ahmet Lütfullah",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),433,32

The adverse prognostic impact of the combination of HF and CAD in these patients is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: we analysed data from 954 consecutive patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 in five Italian Hospitals from February 23 to May 22, 2020. The study was a systematic prospective data collection according to a pre-specified protocol. All-cause mortality during hospitalization was the outcome measure. Mean duration of hospitalization was 33 days. Mortality was 11% in the total population and 7.4% in the group without evidence of HF or CAD (reference group). Mortality was 11.6% in the group with CAD and without HF (odds ratio [OR]: 1.6, p = 0.120), 15.5% in the group with HF and without CAD (OR: 2.3, p = 0.032), and 35.6% in the group with CAD and HF (OR: 6.9, p<0.0001). The risk of mortality in patients with CAD and HF combined was consistently higher than the sum of risks related to either disorder, resulting in a significant synergistic effect (p<0.0001) of the two conditions. Age-adjusted attributable proportion due to interaction was 64%. Adjusting for the simultaneous effects of age, hypotension, and lymphocyte count did not significantly lower attributable proportion which persisted statistically significant (p = 0.0360). CONCLUSION: The combination of HF and CAD exerts a marked detrimental impact on the risk of mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, which is independent on other adverse prognostic markers.","Angeli, Fabio; Marazzato, Jacopo; Verdecchia, Paolo; Balestrino, Antonella; Bruschi, Claudio; Ceriana, Piero; Chiovato, Luca; Dalla Vecchia, Laura Adelaide; De Ponti, Roberto; Fanfulla, Francesco; La Rovere, Maria Teresa; Perego, Francesca; Scalvini, Simonetta; Spanevello, Antonio; Traversi, Egidio; Visca, Dina; Vitacca, Michele; Bachetti, Tiziana",Eur J Intern Med,433,33

METHODS: The aim of the present study was to compare the 4C mortality score, other measures of the systemic inflammatory response and clinicopathological characteristics in two consecutive cohorts of patients on admission with COVID-19. Electronic patient records for 2 consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to two urban teaching hospitals with COVID-19 during two 7-week periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Glasgow, U.K. (cohort 1: 17/3/2020-1/5/2020) and (cohort 2: 18/5/2020-6/7/2020) were examined for routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data. RESULTS: Compared with cohort 1, cohort 2 were older (p<0.001), more likely to be female (p<0.05) and have less independent living circumstances (p<0.001). More patients in cohort 2 were PCR positive, CXR negative (both p<0.001) and had low serum albumin concentrations (p<0.001). 30-day mortality was similar between both cohorts (23% and 22%). In cohort 2, age >70 (p<0.05), male gender (p<0.05), COPD (p<0.05), cognitive impairment (p<0.05), frailty (p<0.001), delirium (p = 0.001), CRP>150mg/L (p<0.05), albumin <30 g/L (p<0.01), elevated perioperative Glasgow Prognostic Score (p<0.05), elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001), low haematocrit (p<0.01), elevated PT (p<0.05), sodium <133 mmol/L (p<0.01) elevated urea (p<0.001), creatinine (p<0.001), glucose (p<0.05) and lactate (p<0.001) and the 4C score (p<0.001) were associated with 30-day mortality. In multivariate analysis, greater frailty (CFS>3) (OR 11.3, 95% C.I. 2.3-96.7, p<0.05), low albumin (<30g/L) (OR 2.5, 95% C.I. 1.0-6.2, p<0.05), high NLR (&#8805;3) (OR 2.2, 95% C.I. 1.5-4.5, p<0.05) and the 4C score (OR 2.4, 95% C.I. 1.0-5.6, p<0.05) remained independently associated with 30-day mortality.

Therefore it was not clear either how the pandemic would impact the healthcare system. As a result it was initially predicted that the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark would overwhelm the healthcare system and thus both the diagnosis and treatment of other hospital patients were compromised for an extended period. AIM: To develop a mathematical model, which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected persons, for early estimation of the epidemic's course, its Infection Fatality Rate and the healthcare system load in Denmark, both retrospectively and prospectively. METHODS: The SEIRS (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) model including deaths outside hospitals and separate assessments of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (based on seroprevalence) with different immunological memories. Optimal model parameters are in part identified by Monte Carlo based Least Square Error methods while micro-outbreaks are modeled by noise and explored in Monte Carlo simulations. Estimates for infected population sizes are obtained by using a quasi steady state method. RESULTS: The calculations and simulations made by the model were shown to fit with the observed development of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark. The antibody prevalence in the general population in May 2020 was 1.37%, which yields a relative frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of 1 to 5.2. Due to the large asymptomatic population, the Infection Mortality Rate was only 0.4%. However, with no non-pharmacological restrictions the COVID-19 death toll was calculated to have more than doubled the national average yearly deaths within a year. The transmission rate â0 was 5.4 in the initial free epidemic period, 0.4 in the lock-down period and 0.8-1.0 in the successive re-opening periods through August 2020. The large asymptomatic population made the termination of the epidemic difficult and micro-outbreaks occurred when the country re-opened. The estimated infected population size July 15 to August 15 was 2,100 and 12,200 for October 1-20, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the model show, that COVID-19 has a low Infection Fatality Rate because the majority of infected persons are either asymptomatic or with few symptoms. A minority of the infected persons, therefore, requires hospitalization. That means that for a given infection pressure of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected there will be a lower pressure on the capacity of the health care system than previously predicted. Further the epidemic will be difficult to terminate since about 84% of the infected individuals are asymptomatic but still contagious. The model may be useful if a major infection wave occurs in the autumn-winter season as it could make robust estimates both for the scale of an ongoing expanding epidemic and for the expected load on the healthcare system. The simulation may also be useful to evaluate different testing strategies based on estimated infected population sizes. The model can be adjusted and scaled to other regions and countries, which is illustrated with Spain and USA.","Rasmussen, Steen; Petersen, Michael Skytte; Høiby, Niels",PLoS One,433,21

STUDY DESIGN: Observational retrospective study. METHODS: Actions taken by military practitioners in the Parisian military hospitals, which contained 500 beds, to fight COVID-19 were listed and described. RESULTS: The Parisian military hospitals were fully reorganized to offer 147% more intensive care unit beds and took care of 665 inpatients with COVID-19 while continuing their core mission of war-wounded military care. A strategy to prioritize the use of medicine and medical devices was designed to avoid shortages. Field intensive care unit deployment and airborne collective medical evacuation by the SSA's MoRPHEE system avoided hospital saturation. CONCLUSIONS: Key facets of this achievement were interunit collaboration, esprit de corps, and health workers' adaptability.

Through brief observation of user behaviour in this server instance, the paper explores accessed titles, especially with focus on their copyright status. Design/methodology/approach: Library usage was observed in a branch of a DL, which enabled remote access to copyright-protected documents. Data were obtained from Google Analytics and access logs enriched with metadata. Findings: Academic DL users overwhelmingly preferred titles that are copyright protected, monographs in particular. Their spectrum of interests was wide, and thus, mass digitisation is essential. Originality/value: The paper presents a solution to provide free remote access to library users during closure on a national level. The case study reveals the needs and interests of DL users via a brief analysis of accessed titles and gives grounds for further changes towards a more open remote access DL model, which would be possible within the current copyright restrictions.","Pokorná, Lenka; Indrák, Michal; Grman, Maroš; Stepanovsky, Frantisek; Smetánková, Martina",Digit.

Elective interventions have been postponed to give care of patients with COVID-19. However, some interventions cannot be delayed, such as trauma surgery, acute abdomen, and emergency endoscopies. To maintain the sustainability of the healthcare system, the protection of healthcare providers should be the top priority.

COVID-19 presents a high mortality rate, estimated at 3.4%. More than 1 out of 4 hospitalized COVID-19 patients require admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for respiratory support, and a large proportion of these ICU-COVID-19 patients, between 17% and 46%, have died. In these patients COVID-19 infection causes an inflammatory response in the lungs that can progress to inflammation with cytokine storm, Acute Lung Injury (ALI), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), thromboembolic events, disseminated intravascular coagulation, organ failure, and death. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are potent immunomodulatory cells that recognize sites of injury, limit effector T cell reactions, and positively modulate regulatory cell populations. MSCs also stimulate local tissue regeneration via paracrine effects inducing angiogenic, anti-fibrotic and remodeling responses. MSCs can be derived in large number from the Umbilical Cord (UC). UC-MSCs, utilized in the allogeneic setting, have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials for a number of disease conditions including inflammatory and immune-based diseases. UC-MSCs have been shown to inhibit inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs and have been utilized to treat patients with severe COVID-19 in pilot, uncontrolled clinical trials, that reported promising results. UC-MSCs processed at our facility have been authorized by the FDA for clinical trials in patients with an Alzheimer's Disease, and in patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). We hypothesize that UC-MSC will also exert beneficial therapeutic effects in COVID-19 patients with cytokine storm and ARDS. We propose an early phase controlled, randomized clinical trial in COVID-19 patients with ALI/ARDS. Subjects in the treatment group will be treated with two doses of UC-MSC (l00 x 106 cells). The first dose will be infused within 24 hours following study enrollment. A second dose will be administered 72 +/- 6 hours after the first infusion. Subject in the control group will receive infusion of vehicle (DPBS supplemented with 1% HSA and 70 U/kg unfractionated Heparin, delivered IV) following the same timeline. Subjects will be evaluated daily during the first 6 days, then at 14, 28, 60, and 90 days following enrollment (see Schedule of Assessment for time window details). Safety will be determined by adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) during the follow-up period. Efficacy will be defined by clinical outcomes, as well as a variety of pulmonary, biochemical and immunological tests. Success of the current study will provide a framework for larger controlled, randomized clinical trials and a means of accelerating a possible solution for this urgent but unmet medical need. The proposed early phase clinical trial will be performed at the University of Miami (UM), in the facilities of the Diabetes Research Institute (DRI), UHealth Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the Clinical Translational Research Site (CTRS) at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and at the Jackson Memorial Hospital (JMH).","Lanzoni, G.; Linetsky, E.; Correa, D.; Alvarez, R.

History: A Covid-19 patient undergoing mechanical ventilation due to related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), presented altered mental status in the ICU. Video-EEG revealed a focal monomorphic theta slowing in bilateral frontal-central regions. Concordant with the EEG localization, MRI showed abundant microbleeds located in bilateral white matter junction, various regions of corpus callosum and internal capsule, suggestive of Critical Illness-Associated Cerebral Microbleeds. CSF analysis excluded the presence of encephalitis, SARS-Cov2 RNA-PCR in CSF was negative. Clinical and biological picture was suggestive of cytokine release syndrome. Conclusion: This is the first reported case of Critical Illness-Associated Cerebral Microbleeds in the context of Covid-19. Knowledge of Covid-19 is still partial and acute neurological complications should be explored systematically. In our case, EEG helped to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus, but revealed focal dysfunction, justifying further investigations. EEG plays a crucial role in these patients, allowing investigating the presence of focal or diffuse cerebral dysfunction. This is particularly helpful for Covid-19 patients in the ICU, where the neurological examination is challenging by the severity of the respiratory illness.","De Stefano, Pia; Nencha, Umberto; De Stefano, Ludovico; Mégevand, Pierre; Seeck, Margitta",Clin.

The acidic vesicles of the endolysosomal (EL) compartment represent an additional endogenous Ca2+ store, which is targeted by several second messengers, including nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P2], and may release intraluminal Ca2+ through multiple Ca2+ permeable channels, including two-pore channels 1 and 2 (TPC1–2) and Transient Receptor Potential Mucolipin 1 (TRPML1). Herein, we discuss the emerging, pathophysiological role of EL Ca2+ signaling in the CV system. We describe the role of cardiac TPCs in β-adrenoceptor stimulation, arrhythmia, hypertrophy, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. We then illustrate the role of EL Ca2+ signaling in VSMCs, where TPCs promote vasoconstriction and contribute to pulmonary artery hypertension and atherosclerosis, whereas TRPML1 sustains vasodilation and is also involved in atherosclerosis. Subsequently, we describe the mechanisms whereby endothelial TPCs promote vasodilation, contribute to neurovascular coupling in the brain and stimulate angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Finally, we discuss about the possibility to target TPCs, which are likely to mediate CV cell infection by the Severe Acute Respiratory Disease-Coronavirus-2, with Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to alleviate the detrimental effects of Coronavirus Disease-19 on the CV system.","Negri, Sharon Faris Pawan Moccia Francesco",International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology,433,21

Hollow Prussian nanospheres have attracted much attention due to excellent near-infrared photothermal conversion effect and drug-loading capability within an empty cavity. However, to date, the hollow Prussian nanospheres have been prepared by a complex procedure or in organic media, and their shell thickness and size cannot be controlled. Thus, a simple and controllable route is highly desirable to synthesize hollow Prussian nanospheres with controllable parameters. Materials and Methods: Here, in our designed synthesis route, the traditional FeCl3 precursor was replaced with Fe2O3 nanospheres, and then the Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles were engineered into hollow-structured PB (HPB) nanospheres through an interface reaction, where the Fe2O3 colloidal template provides Fe3+ ions. The reaction mechanism and control factors of HPB nanospheres were systematically investigated. Both in vitro and in vivo biological effects of the as-synthesized HPB nanospheres were evaluated in detail. Results: Through systematical experiments, a solvent-mediated interface reaction mechanism was put forward, and the parameters of HPB nanospheres could be easily adjusted by growth time and template size under optimal water and ethanol ratio. The in vitro tests show the rapid and remarkable photothermal effects of the as-prepared HPB nanospheres under NIR laser irradiation (808 nm). Meanwhile, HPB nanospheres also demonstrated a high DOX loading capacity of 440 mg g-1 as a drug carrier, and the release of the drug can be regulated by the heat from PB shell under the exposure of an NIR laser. The in vivo experiments confirmed the outstanding performance of HPB nanospheres in photothermal/chemo-synergistic therapy of cancer. Conclusion: A solvent-mediated template route was developed to synthesize hollow Prussian blue (HPB) nanospheres in a simple and controllable way. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate the as-synthesized HPB nanospheres as a promising candidate due to their low toxicity and high efficiency for cancer therapy.","Lu, Long; Zhang, Chuanbin; Zou, Bingfang; Wang, Yongqiang",Int J Nanomedicine,433,2

The Government of India (GoI) is advising personal hygiene practices as prophylaxis, however, remains poorly understood by the people. Too, believing in social media-based misinformation leading to pseudoscientific practices suggesting all from giving up non-vegetarian food to eating garlic is afflicting. This review sheds light on pseudoscientific beliefs and practices of the Indian public to prevent COVID-19. Methods: This narrative review gathered scientific evidence to describe the facts against pseudoscientific beliefs and practices in the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined available evidence from relevant research articles to present the facts about pseudoscientific practices. In particular, regarding the use of complementary and alternative medicine and its practice to prevent COVID-19, we searched the high-quality literature in PubMed, PubMed Central, and Cochrane Library databases for the determined outcomes. Results: Based on scientific shreds of evidence, it is apparent that social media-based misinformation and its pseudoscientific practices severely affecting the public health in the COVID-19 pandemic. The public must look into the facts rigorously before performing pseudoscientific practices and need to follow GoI instructions perpetually. The findings of this review suggest a high level of public awareness of evidence-based prophylactic measures. Conclusion: There is an urgent need for public health promotion initiatives to bring up awareness of the COVID-19 spread and its preventive hygiene practices. The dissemination of health awareness to the public across the nation is warranted.","Senthilkumar, Chinnu Sugavanam; Balakrishnan, Natarajan",J. Health Biol. Sci. (Online),433,3

This article aims to develop some strategies in dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic to prevent nosocomial infection and ensure the safety of healthcare workforce and employees. METHODS: This is a prospectively registered and retrospective descriptive study investigating the clinical characteristics, results of diagnostic tests, and patients' disposition from February 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, at a tertiary medical center in Northern Taiwan. RESULTS: There is no nosocomial spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in our facility. The following strategies were followed: information transparency; epidemic prevention resources planning by authorities; multidisciplinary cooperation; informative technologies; immigration quarantine policies; travel restrictions; management of diversion/subdivision; self-health monitoring; social distancing; screening of travel, occupation, contact, and cluster (TOCC) history; traffic control bundling (TCB); training of using personal protective equipment; real-name visiting management; and employee care. The patients' basic characteristics and diagnostic results were gathered. Of the 3832 cases, about 25.9% had travel history. Most of them were traveling to Asia (419 people/time, 10.9%) and from China (256 people/time, 6.7%). Meanwhile, healthcare personnel accounted for 316 people/time (8.3%) and cleaning personnel, 6 people/time (0.16%). The 36 cases who care or have contact with confirmed cases have negative results from the COVID-19 test. The most frequent symptoms were fever and upper respiratory infection followed by gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSION: The above strategies were followed. Patients were stratified based on the risk of TOCC history assessment to ensure the safety of healthcare personnel and patients' appropriate and timely medical services.","Lan, Kai-Ping; Hsu, Yueh-Shuang; Chang, Ching-I; Wei, Pi-Ching; Guo, Ti-Gen; Yen, David Hung-Tsang; Hsu, Teh-Fu; Tzeng, Yuann-Meei; Ming, Jin-Lain",J Chin Med Assoc,433,22

Background: Early warning score has been developed to facilitate early detection of deterioration by categorizing a patients’ severity of illness and prompting nursing staff to request a medical review at specific trigger points. Patients and Methods: A prospective, control/intervention groups’, quasi-experimental design was utilized. A sample of 364 adult patients were admitted to the inpatient unit at an emergency hospital for six months. The patients were divided into a study group (174 patients) and a control group (190 patients). All study patients were followed up to either death or hospital discharge before and after implementing a new observation chart. The patients’ outcomes were compared and analyzed between both groups. Results: In the intervention period, compared to the control period, a significant reduction was seen in the number of cardiopulmonary arrest (4.7% vs 1.1%, p = 0.046), unplanned ICU admission (5.3% vs 1.7%, p = 0.049), emergency surgery (6.3% vs 0%, p = 0.001), acute kidney injury (6.8% vs 1.1%, p = 0.006). As well, there was a significant increase in the number of patients receiving medical reviews following clinical deterioration in terms of escalation plan (3.2% vs 26.4%, p = &lt; 0.001).

Evidence shows severe acute respiratory syndrome is closely related to the induced cytokine storm. Interleukin-6 is a key player;its role in systemic inflammation is well known. AIM: To evaluate the effect of tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, on the outcomes for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, MedRxiv, Science Direct, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 9th June 2020 for observational or prospective studies reporting results of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 infection treated with TCZ. Effect sizes were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and an OR less than 1 was associated with a better outcome in those treated with TCZ. RESULTS: Overall 13476 patients (33 studies;n = 3264 received TCZ) with COVID-19 pneumonia and various degree of severity were included. Outcome was improved with TCZ. In the primary analysis (n = 19 studies reporting data), mortality was reduced in patients treated with TCZ (OR = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.47-0.87;P &lt; 0.01).

Poor communication while wearing respirators may have fatal complications for patients, and no solution has been proposed to date. Objective: To examine whether use of an in-ear communication device is associated with improved communication while wearing different personal protective equipment (N95 mask, half-face elastomeric respirator, and powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR]) in the operating room. Design, Setting, and Participants: This quality improvement study was conducted in June 2020. Surgical residents from the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, were recruited. All participants had normal hearing, were fluent in English, and had access to the operating rooms at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Exposures: All participants performed the speech intelligibility tasks with and without an in-ear communication device. Main Outcomes and Measures: Speech intelligibility was measured using a word recognition task (Modified Rhyme Test) and a sentence recognition task (AzBio Sentence Test). A percentage correct score (0% to 100%) was obtained for each speech intelligibility test. Listening effort was assessed using the NASA Task Load Index. An overall workload score, ranging from 0 points (low workload) to 100 points (high workload), was obtained. Results: A total of 12 participants were included (mean [SD] age, 31.2 [1.9] years; 8 women [66.7%]). AzBio Sentence Test results revealed that, while wearing the N95 mask, the mean (SD) speech intelligibility was 98.8% (1.8%) without the in-ear device vs 94.3% (7.4%) with the device. While wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator, the mean speech intelligibility was 58.5% (12.4%) without the in-ear device vs 90.8% (8.9%) with the device. While wearing the PAPR, the mean speech intelligibility was 84.6% (9.8%) without the in-ear device vs 94.5% (5.5%) with the device. Use of the in-ear device was associated with a significant improvement in speech intelligibility while wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator (32.3%; 95% CI, 23.8%-40.7%; P < .001) and the PAPR (9.9%; 95% CI, 1.4%-18.3%; P = .01). Furthermore, use of the device was associated with decreased listening effort. The NASA Task Load Index results reveal that, while wearing the N95 mask, the mean (SD) overall workload score was 12.6 (10.6) points without the in-ear device vs 17.6 (9.2) points with the device. While wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator, the mean overall workload score was 67.7 (21.6) points without the in-ear device vs 29.3 (14.4) points with the in-ear device. While wearing the PAPR, the mean overall workload score was 42.2 (18.2) points without the in-ear device vs 23.8 (12.8) points with the in-ear device. Use of the in-ear device was associated with a significant decrease in overall workload score while wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator (38.4; 95% CI, 23.5-53.3; P < .001) and the PAPR (18.4; 95% CI, 0.4-36.4; P = .04). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that among participants using facial respirators that impaired communication, a novel in-ear device was associated with improved communication and decreased listening effort. Such a device may be a feasible solution for protecting health care workers in the operating room while allowing them to communicate safely, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nguyen, Don Luong; Kay-Rivest, Emily; Tewfik, Marc A; Hier, Michael; Lehmann, Alexandre",JAMA Netw Open,433,1

Early clinical experiences have demonstrated the wide spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 presentations, including various reports of atypical presentations of COVID-19 and possible mimic conditions.This article summarises the current evidence surrounding atypical presentations of COVID-19 including neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, otorhinolaryngology and geriatric features. A case from our hospital of pneumocystis pneumonia initially suspected to be COVID-19 forms the basis for a discussion surrounding mimic conditions of COVID-19. The dual-process model of clinical reasoning is used to analyse the thought processes used to make a diagnosis of COVID-19, including consideration of the variety of differential diagnoses.While SARS-CoV-2 is likely to remain on the differential diagnostic list for a plethora of presentations for the foreseeable future, clinicians should be cautious of ignoring other potential diagnoses due to availability bias. An awareness of atypical presentations allows SARS-CoV-2 to be a differential so that it can be appropriately investigated. A knowledge of infectious mimics prevents COVID-19 from overshadowing other diagnoses, hence preventing delayed diagnosis or even misdiagnosis and consequent adverse outcomes for patients.","Coleman, Jamie J; Manavi, Kaveh; Marson, Ella J; Botkai, Adam H; Sapey, Elizabeth",Postgrad Med J,433,10

It can therefore be difficult to differentiate actively replicating virus from input challenge virus. For SARS-CoV-2, specific monitoring of actively replicating virus is critical to investigate the protective and therapeutic efficacy of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral drugs. We developed a SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) RT-PCR assay to differentiate productive infection from inactivated or neutralized virus. Subgenomic RNAs are generated after cell entry and are poorly incorporate into mature virions, and thus may provide a marker for actively replicating virus. We show envelope (E) sgRNA was degraded by RNase in infected cell lysates, while genomic RNA (gRNA) was protected, presumably due to packaging into virions. To investigate the capacity of the sgRNA assay to distinguish input challenge virus from actively replicating virus in vivo, we compared the E sgRNA assay to a standard nucleoprotein (N) or E total RNA assay in convalescent rhesus macaques and in antibody-treated rhesus macaques after experimental SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In both studies, the E sgRNA assay was negative, suggesting protective efficacy, whereas the N and E total RNA assays remained positive. These data suggest the potential utility of sgRNA to monitor actively replicating virus in prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 studies.ImportanceDeveloping therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a public health priority. During challenge studies, respiratory viruses are delivered and sampled from the same anatomical location. It is therefore important to distinguish actively replicating virus from input challenge virus. The most common assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting nucleocapsid total RNA, cannot distinguish neutralized input virus from replicating virus. In this study, we assess SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA as a potential measure of replicating virus in rhesus macaques.","Dagotto, Gabriel; Mercado, Noe B; Martinez, David R; Hou, Yixuan J; Nkolola, Joseph P; Carnahan, Robert H; Crowe, James E; Baric, Ralph S; Barouch, Dan H",J. virol,433,1

This disruption is causing unprecedented downstream effects to traditionally established channels of patient care delivery, including those of essential anatomic pathology services. With Washington state being the initial North American COVID-19 epicenter, the University of Washington in Seattle has been at the forefront of conceptualizing and implementing innovative solutions in order to provide uninterrupted quality patient care amidst this growing crisis. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a rapid validation study assessing our ability to reliably provide diagnostic Neuropathology services via a whole slide imaging (WSI) platform as part of our departmental COVID-19 planning response. DESIGN: This retrospective study assessed diagnostic concordance of neuropathological diagnoses rendered via WSI as compared to those originally established via traditional histopathology in a cohort of 30 cases encompassing a broad range of neurosurgical and neuromuscular entities. This study included the digitalization of 93 slide preparations, which were independently examined by groups of board-certified neuropathologists and neuropathology fellows. RESULTS: There were no major or minor diagnostic discrepancies identified in either the attending neuropathologist or neuropathology trainee groups for either the neurosurgical or neuromuscular case cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that accuracy of neuropathological diagnoses and interpretation of ancillary preparations via WSI are not inferior to those generated via traditional microscopy. This study provides a framework for rapid subspecialty validation and deployment of WSI for diagnostic purposes during a pandemic event.","Henriksen, Jonathan; Kolognizak, Teresa; Houghton, Tracy; Cherne, Steve; Zhen, Daisy; Cimino, Patrick J; Latimer, Caitlin S; Scherpelz, Kathryn P; Yoda, Rebecca A; Alpers, Charles E; Chhieng, David F; Dirk Keene, C; Gonzalez-Cuyar, Luis F",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

DBS teleprogramming technology was developed and deployed in China before the COVID-19 outbreak. In this report, the authors share their experiences with telemedical DBS treatment of patients with psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Four patients (2 with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 1 with major depressive disorder, and 1 with anorexia nervosa) underwent DBS surgery at Ruijin Hospital and received continuous postoperative DBS telemedicine case management from January 2020 to July 2020. DBS teleprogramming, individualized psychological support, and medical consultations were provided via the authors' DBS telemedicine platform, which also incorporated a synchronous real-time video communication system. RESULTS: Forty-five DBS telemedicine sessions were conducted; there was no unexpected loss of network connection during the sessions. Of these, 28 sessions involved DBS teleprogramming. Adjustments were made to the stimulation voltage, frequency, pulse width, and contact site in 21, 12, 9, and 9 sessions, respectively. Psychological support and troubleshooting were provided during the remaining telemedicine sessions. Modest to substantial clinical improvements after DBS surgery were observed in some but not all patients, whereas stimulation-related side effects were reported by 2 patients and included reversible sleep and mood problems, headache, and a sensation of heat. CONCLUSIONS: DBS telemedicine seems to offer a feasible, safe, and efficient strategy for maintaining the delivery of medical care to psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. The authors propose that implementation of a comprehensive DBS telemedicine system, which combines DBS teleprogramming with psychological counseling, medical consultations, and medication prescriptions and delivery, could be an efficient and effective approach to manage the mental health and quality of life of patients with psychiatric disorders during future local or global public health crises.","Lin, Zhengyu; Zhang, Chencheng; Zhang, Yingying; Dai, Lulin; Voon, Valerie; Li, Dianyou; Sun, Bomin",Neurosurg Focus,433,4

Lung transplant recipients may be particularly at risk due to the high degree of immunosupression and the lung being the organ primarily affected by COVID-19. We describe a 16-year old male and a 64-year old female recently lung transplanted patients with COVID-19 during inpatient rehabilitation. Both patients were on triple immunosuppressive therapy and had no signs of allograft dysfunction. Both patients had close contact to a person who developed COVID-19 and were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, both patients underwent systematic screening and SARS-CoV-2 was detected ultimately. While the 16-year old boy was completely asymptomatic, the 64-year old woman developed only mild COVID-19. Immunosuppressive therapy was unchanged and no experimental treatment was initiated. No signs of graft involvement or dysfunction were noticed. In conclusion, our report of patients with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild COVID-19 respectively, may indicate that lung transplant recipients are not per se at risk for severe COVID-19.

COVID-19 is associated with an increased mortality in the elderly and particularly those with obesity, hypertension and diabetes, features which are typically seen in patients with OSA. This article describes the COVID-19 environment in New York City in which patients were evaluated and treated for OSA. METHODS: A telephone questionnaire survey of 112 OSA patients determined the occurrence of COVID-19 in the sleep apnea population and the patients' perspective on sleep apnea Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) management during the COVID-19 outbreak. The three main objectives of the survey were as follows: (1) To discover how patients were coping with COVID-19 pandemic in terms of their sleep apnea and PAP use, (2) To determine whether PAP usage changed after the onset of the outbreak in terms of adherence, and (3) To find out if patients were concerned about whether they were at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 because of their sleep apnea and, if they became infected, whether COVID-19 might result in greater complications because of the presence of sleep apnea. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The adjustment in clinical management of OSA patients is described both during the peak of the outbreak in New York State (NYS), as well as the proposed modifications that will be instituted in order to return to full sleep center activities.","Thorpy, Michael; Figuera-Losada, Mariana; Ahmed, Imran; Monderer, Renee; Petrisko, Monica; Martin, Chris; Akhtar, Jamal; Thorpy, Jacqueline; Haines, Carver",Sleep Med,433,10

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects with definite (confirmed by positive RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab or serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies) and probable COVID-19 were identified via telephone survey among PWE treated at the university epilepsy clinic. RESULTS: Of 252 screened subjects, 17 (6.7%) had definite and 14 (5.5%) probable COVID-19. The percentage of PWE with definite COVID-19 was much higher than the percentage of subjects with confirmed COVID-19 in Polish general population (3.65%).

We aimed to investigate and characterize associations between clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with RT-PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic at presentation. All were retrospectively identified from 825 patients with chest CT scans and positive RT-PCR following exposure or travel risks in outbreak settings in Japan and China. CTs were obtained for every patient within a day of admission and were reviewed for infiltrate subtypes and percent with assistance from a deep learning tool. Correlations of clinical, laboratory, and imaging features were analyzed and comparisons were performed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Forty-eight of 74 (65%) initially asymptomatic patients had CT infiltrates that pre-dated symptom onset by 3.8 days. The most common CT infiltrates were ground glass opacities (45/48; 94%) and consolidation (22/48; 46%). Patient body temperature (p < 0.01), CRP (p < 0.01), and KL-6 (p = 0.02) were associated with the presence of CT infiltrates. Infiltrate volume (p = 0.01), percent lung involvement (p = 0.01), and consolidation (p = 0.043) were associated with subsequent development of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 CT infiltrates pre-dated symptoms in two-thirds of patients. Body temperature elevation and laboratory evaluations may identify asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 CT infiltrates at presentation, and the characteristics of CT infiltrates could help identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients who subsequently develop symptoms. The role of chest CT in COVID-19 may be illuminated by a better understanding of CT infiltrates in patients with early disease or SARS-CoV-2 exposure. KEY POINTS: â¢ Forty-eight of 74 (65%) pre-selected asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 had abnormal chest CT findings. â¢ CT infiltrates pre-dated symptom onset by 3.8 days (range 1-5). â¢ KL-6, CRP, and elevated body temperature identified patients with CT infiltrates.

However, research is needed to assess value, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcomes in the delivery of telehealth PT. Purposes: We sought to compare patient satisfaction with in-person and telehealth PT and to determine the factors-such as age, gender, or insurance payer-that contributed to patient satisfaction scores. Methods: Patients between the ages of 18 and 90 years who received outpatient PT at our institution were texted a patient satisfaction survey. Surveys were sent to patients who received in-person PT from January 1 to May 8, 2020, and to patients who received telehealth PT from April 21 to May 8, 2020. Patients' age, gender, insurance payer, and written comments were also collected. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare survey scores between groups. &#967;-squared tests were used to compare categorical patient characteristics between groups. Results: In total, 12,345 surveys were sent out. We included completed surveys from 1147 patients in the analysis. Of these, 33% identified as male and 67% as female, mean age was 60.3 years, 58% had commercial insurance, 36% had Medicare, 3% had Medicaid, 2% had no-fault/worker's compensation, and 1% had international insurance. The question of satisfaction was answered by 1074 patients. No statistical difference in satisfaction was seen in age or gender groups. Satisfaction differed by insurance type, but when analysis excluded patients with international insurance, there was no difference between groups. In-person PT patients reported higher satisfaction in achieving treatment goals, as rated on a 1-to-5 scale (4.7 ± 0.6), than telehealth PT patients (4.6 ± 0.6), although it is unclear if this result is clinically meaningful. There was no significant difference in the remaining follow-up questions. Conclusion: We found no overall difference in patient satisfaction between those receiving in-person PT and those receiving telehealth PT. This was true for initial and follow-up visits, with the exception of two categories: the ""ability of scheduling an appointment"" and ""progress towards attaining your treatment goals."" However, the clinical significance of these two exceptions is questionable. Ongoing research is indicated to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth PT while identifying the best patients and conditions for use during non-crisis times. Future studies should determine the effect of telehealth PT on patient-reported outcome measures, function, and value.","Eannucci, Erica Fritz; Hazel, Kayla; Grundstein, M Jake; Nguyen, Joseph T; Gallegro, James",HSS J,433,16

He initially needed 4L of oxygen but decompensated rapidly requiring intubation and ICU care. His serologies were significant for elevated inflammatory markers and his chest x-ray showed multifocal opacities. Based on the available evidence at the time, he was started on hydroxychloroquine but continued to decline into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs) needing prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade. Given his worsening pulmonary mechanics and hypoxia, he was also treated with convalescent plasma. Despite this, he remained intubated for a total of 34 days before receiving tracheostomy due to the recommendations of waiting for 2 negative COVID-19 tests 24 hours apart which our patient did not exhibit. During his stay, he was tested over 9 times to facilitate the procedure, with varying results, (see table). Given the risks of such prolonged intubation and his development of a nosocomial pneumonia, we ultimately proceeded with a tracheostomy despite the PCR results. While this expedited his liberation from the ventilator, he continued to test positive throughout the remainder of his hospital stay but was eventually transferred out of the ICU. DISCUSSION: Our case shows the importance of RT-PCR in the testing and diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Such a test allows for early detection and appropriate triage of patients. However, it also indicates a significant false-positive and negative rate showing the limited role RT-PCR plays in viral infectivity. The genetic diversity and rapid evolution of the coronavirus causes mutations in its genome. This in addition to errors in sampling technique and location can lead to significant false-negative RT-PCR tests, as we know that nasopharyngeal sampling is less accurate than tracheal or bronchial sampling. Other data suggests that RT-PCR positivity typically declines after 3 weeks but may persist up to 6 weeks in severely ill patients due to persistent viral shedding which may be the case for our patient. Finally, previous studies have indicated different viral load kinetics in different patients suggesting that sampling timing and period of the disease development play an important role in real-time PCR results. CONCLUSION(S): As we continue to learn more about this novel coronavirus, the role of viral culture, may prove more helpful when caring for patients, and creating public health guidelines. For now, we must be cautious when using RT- PCR as a sole criterion for hospital discharge and the discontinuation of patient isolation. Reference #1: Tahamtan A, Ardebili A.

Here, we collated and analysed in vitro dose-response curves of >70 NAbs and constructed a landscape defining the spectrum of neutralization efficiencies of NAbs elicited. We mimicked responses of individuals by sampling NAb subsets of known sizes from the landscape and found that they recapitulated responses of convalescent patients. Combining individual responses with a mathematical model of within-host SARS-CoV-2 infection post-vaccination, we predicted how the population-level protection conferred would increase with the NAb response to vaccination. Our predictions captured the outcomes of vaccination trials. Our formalism may help optimize vaccination protocols, given limited vaccine availability.","Padmanabhan, P.; Desikan, R.; Dixit, N.

People were mainly advised to remain home quarantined to curb the virus spread. Industrial and vehicular movements were ceased as a result of lockdown, and therefore the rate of pollutants entering the ecosystem also reduced in many places. Water and air pollution remained a major concern in the last few decades as these were gradually deteriorating in many spheres including the hydrosphere and atmosphere. As the nation-wide lockdown period in India completed more than two months, this study attempted to analyze the impact of lockdown on water and air quality to understand the short-term environmental changes. Using remote sensing data, this study demonstrated the improvements in ambient water quality in terms of decreased turbidity levels for a section of the Sabarmati River in the Ahmedabad region of India. The Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentrations are evaluated to underline the turbidity levels in the study area before and during the lockdown period using the Landsat 8 OLI images. We noticed that the average SPM has significantly decreased by about 36.48% when compared with the pre-lockdown period; and a drop of 16.79% was observed from the previous year's average SPM. Overall, the average SPM concentration during the lockdown period (8.08 mg/l), was the lowest when compared with pre-lockdown average and long-term (2015–2019) April month average. The atmospheric pollution level (NO2, PM2.5, and PM10) data obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board for Ahmedabad city also shows a significant improvement during the study period, implying a positive response of COVID-19 imposed lockdown on the environmental fronts.","Aman, Mohammad Adil; Salman, Mohd Sadiq; Ali P, Yunus",Remote sensing applications : society and environment,433,16

Optimal fluid management should provide adequate oxygen delivery to the body, while avoiding inadvertent increase in lung edema which further impairs gas exchange. In ARDS patients, positive fluid balance has been associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer ICU and hospital stay, and higher mortality. Accordingly, a restrictive strategy has been compared to a more liberal approach in randomized controlled trials conducted in various clinical settings. Restrictive strategies included fluid restriction guided by the monitoring of extravascular lung water, pulmonary capillary wedge or central venous pressure, and furosemide targeted to diuresis and/or albumin replacement in hypoproteinemic patients. Overall, restrictive strategies improved oxygenation significantly and reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, but had no significant effect on mortality. Fluid management may require different approaches depending on the time course of ARDS (i.e., early vs. late period). The effects of fluid strategy management according to ARDS phenotypes remain to be evaluated. Since ARDS is frequently associated with sepsis-induced acute circulatory failure, the prediction of fluid responsiveness is crucial in these patients to avoid hemodynamically inefficient—hence respiratory detrimental—fluid administration. Specific hemodynamic indices of fluid responsiveness or mini-fluid challenges should be preferably used. Since the positive airway pressure contributes to positive fluid balance in ventilated ARDS patients, it should be kept as low as possible. As soon as the hemodynamic status is stabilized, correction of cumulated fluid retention may rely on diuretics administration or renal replacement therapy.","Vignon, Philippe; Evrard, Bruno; Asfar, Pierre; Busana, Mattia; Calfee, Carolyn S.; Coppola, Silvia; Demiselle, Julien; Geri, Guillaume; Jozwiak, Mathieu; Martin, Greg S.; Gattinoni, Luciano; Chiumello, Davide",Intensive Care Med,433,20

As the pandemic's socioeconomic consequences worsen and pandemic fatigue settles in, another frailty is unveiled to the public and media space: the lack of a critical mass of health communicators, which has direct consequences on how the pandemic is managed. Communicating in such a context of crisis and uncertainty requires identifying what are the important facts to communicate to different population segments, clarifying myths and fake information, responding to ongoing uncertainties, listening to and involving stakeholders, developing and testing messages, and monitoring and evaluating implemented strategies. The use of communication as a management support strategy allows organizations to build confidence and reputation, manage relationships with internal and external stakeholders, and prepare for future uncertainties, which are crucial competencies in managing a health crisis. Given the lack of scientific evidence about health communication practiced in Portugal, a significant part of the analysis and diagnosis is based on the authors' empirical knowledge, obtained through professional experience in communications at several health institutions. At the end of the article, the authors propose guiding principles to think through, develop and implement health communication in Portugal, particularly during a health crisis, supported by a culture of leadership, collaboration, and confidence.","Miranda, Débora; Galhordas Alves, Isa; Salavisa, Marta",Acta med. port,433,26

Some of this variability may be due to the interplay of pre-existing demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors in a given population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the statistical associations between the statewise prevalence, mortality rate, and case fatality rate of COVID-19 in 24 regions in India (23 states and Delhi), as well as key demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related indices. METHODS: Data on disease prevalence, crude mortality, and case fatality were obtained from statistics provided by the Government of India for 24 regions, as of June 30, 2020. The relationship between these parameters and the demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related indices of the regions under study was examined using both bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: COVID-19 prevalence was negatively associated with male-to-female sex ratio (defined as the number of females per 1000 male population) and positively associated with the presence of an international airport in a particular state. The crude mortality rate for COVID-19 was negatively associated with sex ratio and the statewise burden of diarrheal disease, and positively associated with the statewise burden of ischemic heart disease. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the COVID-19 crude mortality rate was significantly and negatively associated with sex ratio. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the transmission and impact of COVID-19 in a given population may be influenced by a number of variables, with demographic factors showing the most consistent association.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",JMIR Public Health Surveill,433,17

Some studies have suggested that diabetes is associated with a greater risk of developing severe forms of COVID‐19. The primary objective of the present study was to compare the clinical features and outcomes in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients with vs. without diabetes. METHODS: All consecutive adult patients admitted to Amiens University Hospital (Amiens, France) with confirmed COVID‐19 up until April 21(st), 2020, were included. The composite primary endpoint comprised admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death. Both components were also analyzed separately in a logistic regression analysis and a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 433 patients (median age: 72; 238 (55%) men; diabetes: 115 (26.6%)) were included. Most of the deaths occurred in non‐ICU units and among older adults. Multivariate analyses showed that diabetes was associated neither with the primary endpoint (odds ratio (OR): 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66‐1.90) nor with mortality (hazard ratio: 0.73; 95%CI: 0.40‐1.34) but was associated with ICU admission (OR: 2.06; 95%CI 1.09‐3.92, p=0.027) and a longer length of hospital stay. Age was negatively associated with ICU admission and positively associated with death. DISCUSSION: Diabetes was prevalent in a quarter of the patients hospitalized with COVID‐19; it was associated with a greater risk of ICU admission but not with a significant elevation in mortality.

Our aim was to evaluate subjective symptoms and quality of life in Finnish hospitalized COVID-19 patients at six months follow-up. METHODS: Hospitalised adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March to June 2020 were recruited. We conducted a survey on demographics and comorbidities, ten specific symptoms, and a RAND-36 quality of life questionnaire six months after hospital discharge. We collected clinical data manually from medical records. RESULTS: 101 patients (54 male) out of 246 invited completed the survey. Their median age was 60 years, and the mean hospital length of stay was 15 d. Most patients (90%) experienced symptoms, the most common of which were tiredness (88%), fatigue (79%), sleeping problems (76%), and dyspnoea (70%). In regard to gender, women showed a shorter time of hospitalization (p = .048) and lower peak flow of supplementary oxygen (p = .043). Women reported more frequently dyspnoea, fatigue, tiredness, sleeping problems, and mood problems (p = .008-.033), and a lower quality of life in seven of eight dimensions (p < .001-.015). Five explanatory variables for the reduced quality of life were identified in multivariate analysis: age, female sex, BMI, sleep apnoea, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Of the patients who worked full-time before COVID-19, 11% had not returned to work. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients experienced symptoms six months after hospital discharge. Women reported more symptoms and a lower quality of life than men. These findings highlight the differences in recovery between men and women and call for active rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients.","Lindahl, Anna; Aro, Miia; Reijula, Jere; Mäkelä, Mika J; Ollgren, Jukka; Puolanne, Mervi; Järvinen, Asko; Vasankari, Tuula",Infect Dis (Lond),433,21

While numbers of deaths can be used to estimate actual number of infections after a time lag, counties with low death counts early on have considerable uncertainty about true numbers of cases in the future. Here we show that supplementing county-scale mortality statistics with socioeconomic data helps estimate true numbers of COVID-19 infections in low-data counties, and hence provide an early warning of future concern. We fit a LASSO negative binomial regression to select a parsimonious set of five predictive variables from thirty-one county-level covariates. Of these, population density, public transportation use, voting patterns and % African-American population are most predictive of higher COVID-19 death rates.

Theme: Urbanization,15.795151,3.699477,2021-03-12,"BACKGROUND: Glioma is a malignant brain tumor; its location is complex and is difficult to remove surgically. To diagnosis the brain tumor, doctors can precisely diagnose and localize the disease using medical images. However, the computer-assisted diagnosis for the brain tumor diagnosis is still the problem because the rough segmentation of the brain tumor makes the internal grade of the tumor incorrect. METHODS: In this paper, we proposed an Aggregation-and-Attention Network for brain tumor segmentation. The proposed network takes the U-Net as the backbone, aggregates multi-scale semantic information, and focuses on crucial information to perform brain tumor segmentation. To this end, we proposed an enhanced down-sampling module and Up-Sampling Layer to compensate for the information loss. The multi-scale connection module is to construct the multi-receptive semantic fusion between encoder and decoder. Furthermore, we designed a dual-attention fusion module that can extract and enhance the spatial relationship of magnetic resonance imaging and applied the strategy of deep supervision in different parts of the proposed network. RESULTS: Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed framework is the best on the BraTS2020 dataset, compared with the-state-of-art networks.

These mathematical models play a significant role in the understanding of COVID‐19 transmission mechanisms, structures, and features. Considering that the disease has spread sporadically around the world, causing large scale socioeconomic disruption unwitnessed in contemporary ages since World War II, researchers, stakeholders, government, and the society at large are actively engaged in finding ways to reduce the rate of infection until a cure or vaccination procedure is established. We advanced argument for the various forms of the mathematical model of epidemics and highlighted their relevance in the containment of COVID‐19 at the present time. Mathematical models address the need for understanding the transmission dynamics and other significant factors of the disease that would aid policymakers to make accurate decisions and reduce the rate of transmission of the disease.","Adekola, Hafeez Aderinsayo; Adekunle, Ibrahim Ayoade; Egberongbe, Haneefat Olabimpe; Onitilo, Sefiu Adekunle; Abdullahi, Idris Nasir",J Public Aff,433,15

Theme: Environmental contaminants,15.70028,4.0128946,2021-01-19,"BACKGROUND: It is now well recognised that the risk of severe COVID-19 increases with some long-term conditions (LTCs). However, prior research primarily focuses on individual LTCs and there is a lack of data on the influence of multimorbidity (≥2 LTCs) on the risk of COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of multimorbidity, more detailed understanding of the associations with multimorbidity and COVID-19 would improve risk stratification and help protect those most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Here we examine the relationships between multimorbidity, polypharmacy (a proxy of multimorbidity), and COVID-19; and how these differ by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological prognostic factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied data from UK Biobank (428,199 participants; aged 37–73; recruited 2006–2010) on self-reported LTCs, medications, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological measures which were linked to COVID-19 test data. Poisson regression models examined risk of COVID-19 by multimorbidity/polypharmacy and effect modification by COVID-19 prognostic factors (age/sex/ethnicity/socioeconomic status/smoking/physical activity/BMI/systolic blood pressure/renal function). 4,498 (1.05%) participants were tested; 1,324 (0.31%) tested positive for COVID-19. Compared with no LTCs, relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 in those with 1 LTC was no higher (RR 1.12 (CI 0.96–1.30)), whereas those with ≥2 LTCs had 48% higher risk; RR 1.48 (1.28–1.71). Compared with no cardiometabolic LTCs, having 1 and ≥2 cardiometabolic LTCs had a higher risk of COVID-19; RR 1.28 (1.12–1.46) and 1.77 (1.46–2.15), respectively. Polypharmacy was associated with a dose response higher risk of COVID-19. All prognostic factors were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in multimorbidity; being non-white, most socioeconomically deprived, BMI ≥40 kg/m2, and reduced renal function were associated with the highest risk of COVID-19 infection: RR 2.81 (2.09–3.78); 2.79 (2.00–3.90); 2.66 (1.88–3.76); 2.13 (1.46–3.12), respectively. No multiplicative interaction between multimorbidity and prognostic factors was identified. Important limitations include the low proportion of UK Biobank participants with COVID-19 test data (1.05%) and UK Biobank participants being more affluent, healthier and less ethnically diverse than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing multimorbidity, especially cardiometabolic multimorbidity, and polypharmacy are associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19. Those with multimorbidity and additional factors, such as non-white ethnicity, are at heightened risk of COVID-19.","McQueenie, Ross; Foster, Hamish M.

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 severe pneumonia receiving standard of care + tocilizumab who were alive and free from mechanical ventilation at day 6 after treatment initiation were included in this retrospective, multicenter cohort study. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to identify predictors of mechanical ventilation or death by day-28 from treatment initiation and β-coefficients were used to develop a risk score. Secondary outcome was mortality. Patients with the same inclusion criteria as the derivation cohort from 3 independent hospitals were used as validation cohort. RESULTS: 266 patients treated with tocilizumab were included. By day 28 of hospital follow-up post treatment initiation, 40 (15%) underwent mechanical ventilation or died [26 (10%)].

SURE UK, which is one of a series of individual studies that comprise the SURE programme, evaluated the use of OW semaglutide in a real-world patient population with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the UK. METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, adults (≥ 18 years) with ≥ 1 documented glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) value ≤ 12 weeks before semaglutide initiation were enrolled. The primary endpoint was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to end of study (EOS; ~ 30 weeks, although due to the COVID-19 pandemic, visits up to week 52 were permitted). Secondary endpoints included change in body weight, waist circumference and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Physicians were to report all episodes of documented or severe hypoglycaemia, fatal events, serious adverse drug reactions, pregnancies and adverse events (AEs) in foetuses/newborn infants; other AEs during the study period could be reported on a voluntary basis. RESULT: The estimated mean change in HbA(1c) from baseline to EOS was − 16.3 mmol/mol [95% confidence interval (CI): − 18.22, − 14.37] (− 1.5%-points [95% CI − 1.67, − 1.31]; p < 0.0001) among the 171 enrolled patients who completed the study on treatment. Mean body weight change was − 5.8 kg (95% CI − 6.75, − 4.94; p < 0.0001). Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. Improvements were also observed in other secondary endpoints, including PROs. No new safety concerns were identified with semaglutide treatment. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving OW semaglutide experienced statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions from baseline in HbA(1c) and body weight. These results are in line with those of the SUSTAIN RCTs and support the use of OW semaglutide in routine clinical practice in adults with T2D in the UK.

It is a continuing matter of debate under which circumstances HSV-1 is a relevant pathogen for pneumonitis. While its role during critical illness has been investigated by prospective interventional studies, comparatively little systematic data is available on the role of HSV-1 for pneumonitis in outpatients with autoimmune disease under a maintenance regimen of immunosuppression. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of ~1400 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that were followed at the outpatient clinic of a German University hospital during the years 2000–2007. Episodes of admission to a ward resulting in the diagnosis of pneumonia/pneumonitis were identified, and the type of pneumonia and clinical features retrospectively studied. RESULTS: 63 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, or SLE were admitted to a ward and diagnosed to have pneumonia/pneumonitis. Using bronchoscopy a total of 6 cases of pulmonary infection associated with HSV-1 in the lower respiratory tract were identified. Among those, 2 cases suggested a causative role of HSV-1 as the sole agent causing pneumonitis that proved clinically responsive to antiviral treatment. In the remaining 4 cases HSV-1 appeared as a bystander of bacterial infection. Maintenance therapy with leflunomide, which inhibits HSV-1 assembly in vitro, was associated with a milder course of pneumonitis in one patient. Detection of HSV-1 was associated with stronger immunosuppressive regimens and vasculitic disease. CONCLUSION: The present study analyzed the frequency and hallmarks of cases of HSV-1 associated pneumonitis that occurred in a comparatively large cohort of patients with rheumatologic autoimmune diseases. In an area of controversy, this study provides further evidence that HSV-1 causes isolated pneumonitis in the immunocompromised. The study may provide an estimate on the frequency of relevant HSV-1 infection and bacterial agents in outpatients with autoimmune disease.","Witt, Matthias N; Braun, Gerald S; Ihrler, Stephan; Schmid, Holger",BMC Pulm Med,433,16

So far, there is no specific drug or vaccine for COVID-19. Therefore, it is urgent to establish a rapid and sensitive early diagnosis platform, which is of great significance for physical separation of infected persons after rapid diagnosis. Here, we propose a colorimetric/SERS/fluorescence triple-mode biosensor based on AuNPs for the fast selective detection of viral RNA in 40 minutes. AuNPs with average size of 17 nm were synthesized, and colorimetric, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and fluorescence signals of sensors are simultaneously detected based on their basic aggregation property and affinity energy to different bio-molecules. The sensor achieves a limit detection of femtomole level in all triple modes, which is 160 fM in absorbance mode, 259 fM in fluorescence mode, and 395 fM in SERS mode. The triple-mode signals of the sensor are verified with each other to make the experimental results more accurate, and the capacity to recognize single-base mismatch in each working mode minimizes the false negative/positive reading of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed sensing platform provides a new way for the fast, sensitive, and selective detection of COVID-19 and other diseases.","Gao, Yakun; Han, Yingkuan; Wang, Chao; Qiang, Le; Gao, Jianwei; Wang, Yanhao; Liu, Hong; Yu Zhang; Han, Lin",Anal Chim Acta,433,33

Dental practitioners are routinely exposed to infectious bodily excretions, for example, saliva, blood, and respiratory excretions. Therefore, they are in the first line of SARS-CoV-2 infection-prone health care providers. The purposes of the current review are to trace documented cases of COVID-19 transmission inside dental settings worldwide and to explore the clinical management of these cases. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Google Scholar for all possible reported cases of COVID-19 transmission in dental practice as of December 1, 2019, until May 13, 2020. Multiple terms and combinations were used, including “coronavirus,” “COVID-19,” “SARS-CoV-2,” “dental,” “dentistry,” “transmission,” and “nosocomial.” Articles that were not written in English were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 78 articles were found from December 29, 2019, until May 13, 2020. Of these, 31 articles discussed the risks related to dental practice and recommended infection management protocols for dental health care personnel. Of these articles, only 1 had reported data on transmission of COVID-19 in dental practice. Two possible transmissions of COVID-19 to dental personnel were reported in China before its recognition as an epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Although it seems that there are almost no reported cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 during dental treatments, occupational or nosocomial transmission could not be ruled out.

Unprecedented progress made in global health over the past 20 years has reverted and economic growth has already evaporated, giving rise to a global recession, the likes of which we may not have experienced since the Second World War. Our aim is to draw the attention of the neglected tropical disease (NTD) community towards some of the major emerging economic opportunities which are quickly appearing on the horizon as a result of COVID-19. MAIN TEXT: This scoping review relied on a literature search comprised of a sample of articles, statements, and press releases on initiatives aimed at mitigating the impact of COVID-19, while supporting economic recovery. Of note, the donor scenario and economic development agendas are highly dynamic and expected to change rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, as are donor and lender priorities. CONCLUSIONS: The NTD community, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), will need to work quickly, diligently, and in close collaboration with decision-makers and key stakeholders, across sectors at national and international level to secure its position. Doing so might enhance the odds of grasping potential opportunities to access some of the massive resources that are now available in the form of contributions from corporate foundations, trust funds, loans, debt relieve schemes, and other financial mechanisms, as part of the ongoing and future economic development agendas and public health priorities driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper should serve as a starting point for the NTD community to seek much needed financial support in order to sustain and revitalize control and elimination efforts pertaining to NTDs in LMICs.

The prediction was performed based on the growth rate of new cases in a stable period, and the graphics plotted with the significant governmental decisions to evaluate the impact on the epidemic curve in each Brazilian state and city. Analysis of the predicted new cases was correlated with the total number of hospitalizations and deaths related to COVID-19. Because Brazil is a vast country, with high heterogeneity and complexity of the regional/local characteristics and governmental authorities among Brazilian states and cities, we individually predicted the epidemic curve based on a specific stable period with reduced or minimal interference on the growth rate of new cases. We found good accuracy, mainly in a short period (weeks). The most critical governmental decisions had a significant temporal impact on pandemic curve growth. A good relationship was found between the predicted number of new cases and the total number of inpatients and deaths related to COVID-19. In summary, we demonstrated that interventional and preventive measures directly and significantly impact the COVID-19 pandemic using a simple mathematical model.

However, little has been done to account for the potential confounding effects of these factors. Using a large multivariate analysis, this study illuminates modulators of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in U.S. counties while controlling for risk factors across multiple domains. Methods: Data on COVID-19 and various risk factors in all U.S. counties was collected from publicly available data sources through April 14, 2020. Counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases were included in case analyses and those with at least 10 deaths were included in mortality models. The 661 counties meeting inclusion criteria for number of cases were grouped into quartiles and comparisons of risk factors were made using t-tests between the highest and lowest quartiles. Similar comparisons for 217 counties were made for above average and below average deaths/100,000. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of factors that significantly impacted cases and deaths. Results: Univariate analyses demonstrated numerous significant differences between cohorts for both cases and deaths. Risk factors associated with increased cases and/or deaths per 100,000 included increased GDP per capita, decreased social distancing, increased age, increased percent Black, decreased percent Hispanic, decreased percent Asian, decreased health, increased poverty, increased diabetes, increased coronary heart disease, increased physical inactivity, increased alcohol consumption, increased tobacco use, and decreased access to primary care. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcome independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other mitigating factors. Lower daily temperatures was also an independent risk factor in case load but not deaths. Conclusions: U.S. counties with a higher proportion of Black residents are associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. However, the various suggested mechanisms, such as socioeconomic and healthcare predispositions, did not appear to drive the effect of race in our model. Counties with higher average daily temperatures are also associated with decreased COVID-19 cases but not deaths. Several theories are posited to explain these findings, including prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Additional studies are needed to further understand these effects.","Li, Adam Y; Hannah, Theodore C; Durbin, John; Dreher, Nickolas; McAuley, Fiona M; Marayati, Naoum Fares; Spiera, Zachary; Ali, Muhammad; Gometz, Alex; Kostman, JT; Choudhri, Tanvir F",,433,1

The sensitivity of an expert to any change in the overall performance of the alternative supplier is also considered. Finally, the FWI operator is used to aggregate the comparison results by all experts, for which an expert’s authority level is set to a value proportional to the consistency of his/her pairwise comparison results. The cFGM-FTOPSIS-FWI approach has been applied to select suitable alternative suppliers for a Taiwanese foundry in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Toly; Wang, Yu-Cheng; Wu, Hsin-Chieh",Healthcare (Basel),433,20

Sorting out what matters to a patient as being relevant to a specific decision is therefore essential. METHODS: An explorative mixed-methods study was performed to investigate patients’ values for health treatment decisions and their importance in order to develop a future decision aid on value clarification. Ten semi-structured interviews with patient partners were conducted followed by an online survey among the broader population of patients. Qualitative content analysis was performed. Data from the online survey were analysed descriptively and quantitatively. RESULTS: According to patients, 17 important health treatment decisions in rheumatoid arthritis care can occur. The most commonly reported decisions concerned the use of medication. A variety of values may guide patients’ health treatment decisions. We found 66 values among four domains of values – decisional, situational, external and global. Among decisional values, reported main values were a) effectiveness of treatment on inflammation, functioning, pain and fatigue; b) avoiding negative side-effects; and c) keeping in good physical condition. In addition, situational values turned out to be a) staying independent; b) being able to meet people; and c) leading as normal a life as possible. Furthermore, patients prefer healthcare professionals who a) take comorbidity into account, b) have enough time, and c) take the patient seriously in their choices – the external values. Finally, as global values were expressed a) autonomy; b) self-image, and c) intimacy. All values are specified by underlying quotes, for example, the value effectiveness on inflammation; “That inflammation has got to go, because you’ve then got the risk that you’ll develop all kinds of things in the course of time”. CONCLUSION: A variety of values may guide patients’ health treatment decisions within rheumatoid arthritis care. Patients and professionals should discuss patients’ values continuously.","Cornelissen, Lisa Emily; van der Mark, Elise J; Pennings, Patricia; Maat, Bertha; Foekens, Theo; Willemsen-de Mey, Gerardine; Voogdt-Pruis, Helene R",Patient Prefer Adherence,433,1

The present study proposed and established a detailed induction and assessment protocol for a unique and cost-effective preclinical steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) in rats with pulsed injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and methylprednisolone (MPS). METHODS: Sixteen 24-week-old male Sprague–Dawley rats were used to induce SAON by one intravenous injection of LPS (0.2 mg/kg) and three intraperitoneal injections of MPS (100 mg/kg) with a time interval of 24 hour, and then, MPS (40 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected three times a week from week 2 until sacrifice. Additional 12 rats were used as normal controls. Two and six weeks after induction, animals were scanned by metabolic dual energy X-ray absorptiometry for evaluation of tissue composition; serum was collected for bone turnover markers, Microfil perfusion was performed for angiography, the liver was collected for histopathology and bilateral femora and bilateral tibiae were collected for histological examination. RESULTS: Three rats died after LPS injection, i.e., with 15.8% (3/19) mortality. Histological evaluation showed 100% incidence of SAON at week 2. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry showed significantly higher fat percent and lower lean mass in SAON group at week 6. Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) showed significant bone degradation at proximal tibia 6 weeks after SAON induction. Angiography illustrated significantly less blood vessels in the proximal tibia and significantly more leakage particles in the distal tibia 2 weeks after SAON induction. Serum amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen and osteocalcin were significantly lower at both 2 and 6 weeks after SAON induction, and serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide was significantly lower at 6 weeks after SAON induction. Histomorphometry revealed significantly lower osteoblast surface and higher marrow fat fraction and oedema area in SAON group. Hepatic oedema appeared 2 weeks after SAON induction, and lipid accumulation appeared in the liver of SAON rats 6 weeks after SAON induction. CONCLUSION: The present study successfully induced SAON in rats with pulsed injection of LPS and MPS, which was well simulating the clinical feature and pathology. Apart from available large animal models, such as bipedal emus or quadrupedal rabbits, our current SAON small model in rats could be a cost-effective preclinical experimental model to study body metabolism, molecular mechanism of SAON and potential drugs developed for prevention or treatment of SAON. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: The present study successfully induced SAON in a small animal model in rats with pulsed injection of LPS and MPS. The evaluation protocols with typical histopathologic ON features and advanced evaluation approaches to identify the metabolic disorders of SAON could be used in future rat SAON studies. The SAON rat model is a suitable and cost-effective animal model to study molecular mechanism of SAON and potential drugs developed for prevention and treatment of SAON.","Zheng, Li-Zhen; Wang, Jia-Li; Kong, Ling; Huang, Le; Tian, Li; Pang, Qian-Qian; Wang, Xin-Luan; Qin, Ling",J Orthop Translat,433,20

To control the spread of COVID‐19, cutting off the transmission route is a critical step. In this work, the efficient inactivation of human coronavirus with photodynamic therapy (PDT) by employing photosensitizers with aggregation‐induced emission characteristics (DTTPB) is reported. DTTPB is designed to bear a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails, mimicking the structure of phospholipids on biological membranes. DTTPB demonstrates a broad absorption band covering the whole visible light range and high molar absorptivity, as well as excellent reactive oxygen species sensitizing ability, making it an excellent candidate for PDT. Besides, DTTPB can target membrane structure, and bind to the envelope of human coronaviruses. Upon light irradiation, DTTPB demonstrates highly effective antiviral behavior: human coronavirus treated with DTTPB and white‐light irradiation can be efficiently inactivated with complete loss of infectivity, as revealed by the significant decrease of virus RNA and proteins in host cells. Thus, DTTPB sensitized PDT can efficiently prevent the infection and the spread of human coronavirus, which provides a new avenue for photodynamic combating of COVID‐19.","Wu, Ming‐Yu; Gu, Meijia; Leung, Jong‐Kai; Li, Xinmei; Yuan, Yuncong; Shen, Chao; Wang, Lianrong; Zhao, Engui; Chen, Sijie",Small,433,20

Due to the country specific scenario of high social and demographic heterogeneity, combined with limited testing capacity, lack of reliable data, under-reporting of cases, and restricted testing policy, the focus of this study is twofold: (i) to develop a generalized SEIRD model that implicitly takes into account the quarantine measures, and (ii) to estimate the response of the COVID-19 spread dynamics to perturbations/uncertainties. By investigating the projections of cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases, as well as the effective reproduction number, we show that the model parameter related to social distancing measures is one of the most influential along all stages of the disease spread and the most influential after the infection peak. Due to such importance in the outcomes, different relaxation strategies of social distancing measures are investigated in order to determine which strategies are viable and less hazardous to the population. The results highlight the need of keeping social distancing policies to control the disease spread. Specifically, the considered scenario of abrupt social distancing relaxation implemented after the occurrence of the peak of positively diagnosed cases can prolong the epidemic, with a significant increase of the projected numbers of confirmed and death cases. An even worse scenario could occur if the quarantine relaxation policy is implemented before evidence of the epidemiological control, indicating the importance of the proper choice of when to start relaxing social distancing measures.","Volpatto, D.

The objective was to determine the circulatory biomarkers for macrophage activation at baseline and after serum glucose normalization in obese type 2 diabetes (OT2D) subjects. A case-controlled interventional pilot study in OT2D (n = 23) and control subjects (n = 23). OT2D subjects underwent hyperinsulinemic clamp to normalize serum glucose. Plasma macrophage-related proteins were determined using Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer-scan plasma protein measurement at baseline (control and OT2D subjects) and after 1-h of insulin clamp (OT2D subjects only). Basal M1 macrophage activation was characterized by elevated levels of M1 macrophage-specific surface proteins, CD80 and CD38, and cytokines or chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, RANTES) released by activated M1 macrophages. Two potent M1 macrophage activation markers, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were decreased in OT2D. Activated M2 macrophages were characterized by elevated levels of plasma CD163, TFGβ-1, MMP7 and MMP9 in OT2D. Conventional mediators of both M1 and M2 macrophage activation markers (IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-13) were not altered. No changes were observed in plasma levels of M1/M2 macrophage activation markers in OT2D in response to acute normalization of glycemia. In the basal state, macrophage activation markers are elevated, and these reflect the expression of circulatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, that were not changed by glucose normalisation. These differences could potentially predispose diabetic individuals to increased infection severity complicated by ARDS.

Currently, the novel coronavirus has spread to most countries in the world, and its impact on the public is also increasing. As a high-risk group in direct contact with the virus, medical workers should be monitored, and their mental health deserves extensive attention. The aim of this study was to explore the mental health of medical workers facing the novel coronavirus and the main factors affecting it. Methods: The present cross-sectional study including 2,100 eligible individuals from 1,050 hospitals in China was conducted through the network platform powered by www.wjx.cn, a platform providing functions equivalent to Amazon Mechanical Turk. We used a self-designed questionnaire to collect demographic information and data on mental states, including gender, age (years), educational level, job rank, body and mind reaction, cognition of risk, and the judgment of the epidemic situation. Independent samples t-tests and one-way (ANOVA) analysis were carried out to compare the differences in the mental reactions according to the demographic and psychological states of the participants. Results: There were 502 males (23.9%) and 1,598 females (76.1%). The participants reported feeling calm (39.1%), tense (63.0%), scared (31.4%), angry (18.8%), sad (49.0%), afraid (34.7%), optimistic (5.1%), impressed (65.0%), and confident (31.1%) during the epidemic. At the same time, the psychological stress responses of medical staff were significantly different according to the levels of exposure in their environments, duration and personal experience.

The number of patients receiving RRT was 6,054 (889 per million population [pmp]), of whom 51.6% (3,123, 451 pmp) were receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD), 10.9% (662, 97 pmp) hemodialysis (HD), and 37.5% (2,269, 334 pmp) had functioning kidney transplants. The net increase from the previous year in the number of patients receiving RRT was 3.1%. The incidence of end-stage renal failure in patients undergoing RRT was 954 (140 pmp). The median ages of existing and new patients receiving RRT were 55 and 56 years, respectively. There was a trend towards an increasing number of elderly dialysis patients. Diabetes was the third major cause of renal failure among existing RRT patients and the most common cause of renal failure in new cases. The rate of serologic positivity for hepatitis B infection in RRT patients was 9.68%, while that for hepatitis C infection was 3.28%. In Hong Kong, most patients were put on PD when RRT was required. Of all patients on dialysis, 83% were on PD, of whom 94.8% were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Most CAPD patients were on disconnect systems. HD was used in 17.5% of all patients on dialysis. Of the 2,269 patients with functioning kidney transplants, 836 (36.8%) were transplanted in Hong Kong. Of these, 495 (59.2%) had undergone cadaveric kidney transplantation. Of all patients receiving RRT, 30% were receiving erythropoietin. For the year ending 31 March 2004, the annual crude mortality rate for all RRT was 10% (15.3% for PD, 13% for HD, and 1.9% for transplantation).

Hospitalised COVID-19 patients die of respiratory and multi-organ failure and these patients have evidence of extensive immune cell death, which would result in the release of nuclear material, such as histones. Extracellular histones have been associated with adverse clinical outcome and our work has shown that they are directly pro-coagulant [Blood. 2020, in press], pro-inflammatory [J Immunology. 2013;191(5):2495-2502] (induce C-reactive protein (CRP) release) and can cause pulmonary thrombosis [AJRCCM. 2013;187(2):160-9]. We therefore hypothesize that circulating histones play a central role in affecting poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Methods One hundred and three COVID-19 patients were recruited at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, in accordance with the ISARIC/WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol for Severe Emerging Infections in the UK (CCP-UK). Inclusion criteria: (1) proven confirmed swab positive or high likelihood of infection OR (2) one or more of the following symptoms: fever of ≥ 38⁰C, new cough, dyspnoea OR tachypnoea AND admitted to a healthcare facility. Exclusion criteria: confirmed diagnosis of a pathogen unrelated to COVID-19 and no indication or likelihood of co-infection with a relevant pathogen. Patients were categorised into three groups based on severity of infection: mild (minimal symptoms and/or incidental finding), severe (dyspnoea or hypoxia) and critical (respiratory failure, shock or multi-organ failure). Circulating histones were quantified in patient plasma and associated with severity of infection, coagulation parameters, inflammatory and organ injury markers. Results Admission histone levels were significantly (P<0.001) elevated in patients with increasing severity of COVID-19 infection (Mild; 2.00µg/ml [0.68-6.62], Severe; 9.75µg/ml [3.61-21.88], Critical; 23.37µg/ml [11.35-30.02]). Histones were associated with a pro-coagulant (histones vs d-dimer; R=0.596, P<0.001) and pro-inflammatory phenotype (histones vs CRP; R=0.730, P<0.001, histones vs fibrinogen; R=0.677, P<0.001). Increased circulating histones were associated with organ dysfunction including hypoxia (oxygen saturations ≤93%; P=0.008), raised bilirubin (R=0.568, P=0.002) and elevated serum creatinine (R=0.508, P=0.009). Patients with elevated histones required critical care admission (P<0.001), increased duration of mechanical ventilation (R=0.778, P=0.022) and overall length of hospital stay (R=0.618, P<0.001). Conclusions Admission histone levels are associated with disease severity, coagulation activation, inflammation and organ dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. This study indicates that elevated circulating histones might play a key role in the immuno-thrombotic pathogenesis of COVID-19.

AMD patients are tormented by progressive central blurring/loss of vision and have limited therapeutic options to date. Drusen accumulation causing retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell damage is the hallmark of AMD pathogenesis, in which oxidative stress and inflammation are the well-known molecular mechanisms. However, the underlying mechanisms of how RPE responds when exposed to drusen are still poorly understood. Programmed cell death (PCD) plays an important role in cellular responses to stress and the regulation of homeostasis and diseases. Apart from the classical apoptosis, recent studies also discovered novel PCD pathways such as pyroptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, which may contribute to RPE cell death in AMD. This evidence may yield new treatment targets for AMD. In this review, we summarized and analyzed recent advances on the association between novel PCD and AMD, proposing PCD’s role as a therapeutic new target for future AMD treatment.","Yang, Ming; So, Kwok-Fai; Lam, Wai Ching; Lo, Amy Cheuk Yin",Int J Mol Sci,433,24

The presentation on mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions was made by the Head of the Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU), Ken Currie, and identified the key potential options for mitigation by 2020. In this paper, we compare the mitigation potential identified for each proposed option with the 2019 outturn. The largest mitigation options identified were improved end use energy efficiency across the economy and the generation and use of low carbon electricity. Our analysis finds that these have been the key options adopted. Reductions in primary energy use, resulting from improvements in energy efficiency were concentrated in the period 2005–2012 which in 1989 were widely considered to be ambitious. Decarbonisation of electricity has been achieved by the displacement of coal, initially by gas and more recently by renewable electricity. Renewable electricity has exceeded 1989 expectations in the last 5 years and is now the biggest source of CO(2) reductions from electricity generation. The contribution envisaged by nuclear electricity has not occurred, largely due its failure to compete in liberalised generation markets. In all cases, the policy environment has been important.

At present, revealing the molecular mechanisms of osteoporosis and developing effective prevention and treatment methods are of great significance to health worldwide. LncRNA is a non-coding RNA peptide chain with more than 200 nucleotides. Researchers have identified many lncRNAs implicated in the development of diseases and lncRNA H19 is an example. RESULTS A large amount of evidence supports the fact that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes, such as H19, have multiple, far-reaching effects on various biological functions. It has been found that lncRNA H19 has a role in the regulation of different types of cells in the body including the osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts found in bones. Therefore, it can be postulated that lncRNA H19 affects the incidence and development of osteoporosis. CONCLUSION The prospect of targeting lncRNA H19 in the treatment of osteoporosis is promising because of the effects that lncRNA H19 has on the process of osteogenic differentiation. In this review, we summarize the molecular pathways and mechanisms of lncRNA H19 in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and summarize the research progress of targeting H19 as a treatment option. Research is emerging that explores more effective treatment possibilities for bone metabolism diseases using molecular targets.","Chen, Senxiang; Liu, Da; Zhou, Zimo; Qin, Sen",Molecular medicine,433,16

Consequently, this has created an exigency in the search for new drugs with improved clinical utility or means of potentiating available ones. To this end, accumulating empirical evidence supports molecular target therapy as a plausible egress and, β-glucuronidase (βGLU) – a lysosomal acid hydrolase responsible for the catalytic deconjugation of β-d-glucuronides has emerged as a viable molecular target for several therapeutic applications. The enzyme’s activity level in body fluids is also deemed a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of some pathological conditions. Moreover, due to its role in colon carcinogenesis and certain drug-induced dose-limiting toxicities, the development of potent inhibitors of βGLU in human intestinal microbiota has aroused increased attention over the years. Nevertheless, although our literature survey revealed both natural products and synthetic scaffolds as potential inhibitors of the enzyme, only few of these have found clinical utility, albeit with moderate to poor pharmacokinetic profile. Hence, in this review we present a compendium of exploits in the present millennium directed towards the inhibition of βGLU. The aim is to proffer a platform on which new scaffolds can be modelled for improved βGLU inhibitory potency and the development of new therapeutic agents in consequential.","Awolade, Paul; Cele, Nosipho; Kerru, Nagaraju; Gummidi, Lalitha; Oluwakemi, Ebenezer; Singh, Parvesh",Eur J Med Chem,433,4

Design: Two-center observational study Setting: A university hospital and a core hospital in Yokohama, Japan Patients: Adults with COVID-19 whose serum iron levels were measured within the first 5 days of hospitalization were included. Patients who refused mechanical ventilation were excluded from the study. Measurements and Main Results: One hundred thirty-six patients were included in this study. We analyzed the association between COVID-19 severity and serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels. Disease severity was defined as the worst respiratory status during hospitalization. Serum iron levels were significantly lower in patients with mild respiratory failure (RF) (n=55, median serum iron level: 24 [interquartile range: 19-42] mg/dL) than in the non-RF group (n=44, 40 [24-80] mg/dL) and the severe RF group (n=37, 60 [23.5-87] mg/dL); however, there were no significant differences in iron levels between the non-RF and severe RF groups (non-RF vs. mild RF: p=0.019, non-RF vs. severe RF: p>0.999, and mild RF vs. severe RF: p=0.009). That is, there was a U-shaped association between serum iron levels and disease severity. TIBC levels decreased significantly with increasing severity; consequently, TSAT was significantly higher in patients with severe RF than in other patients. Multivariate analysis including only patients with RF adjusted for age and sex demonstrated that higher serum iron or TSAT levels were independently associated with development of severe RF. Conclusions: A U-shaped association between serum iron level and RF severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was observed. Higher serum iron levels in COVID-19 patients with RF are associated with the development of severe RF, indicating that inadequate response to lower serum iron might be an exacerbating factor for COVID-19.","Tojo, K.; Sugawara, Y.; Oi, Y.; Ogawa, F.; Higurashi, T.; Yoshimura, Y.; Miyata, N.; Hayami, H.; Yamaguchi, Y.; Ishikawa, Y.; Takeuchi, I.; Tachikawa, N.; Goto, T.",,433,33

Although Bangladesh is amongst the top 10 countries with diabetic people, data on these patients with COVID-19 is scarce from this region. This study aimed to illustrate the clinical features and outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and DM in Bangladesh while comparing survivors and deceased. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with pre-existing Diabetes Mellitus in a specialized COVID-19 hospital in Bangladesh. Data from hospital records were analyzed. Among 921 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 admitted during the study period, 231 (~25%) patients with pre-existing DM (median age 60 years) were included in the analysis. The death rate among all hospitalized patients (with and without DM) was 2.8% compared to 11.3% among diabetic patients. The median hospital stay was 13 days (IQR 10.5, 17.0) for survivors and five days (IQR 2.0-8.3) for the deceased. The clinical features were not significantly different between survivors and the deceased. However, deceased patients had significantly lower blood oxygen level (85% vs 93%, p <0.001), and higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (7.9 vs 4.5, p 0.003) and serum ferritin (946.0 vs 425.0 ng/ml, p 0.03). Glycemic status was poor in both groups.

METHODS: Key population-level disease projections in deaths, intensive care unit bed days, and non–intensive care unit bed days were taken from the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team report of March 2020, which influenced the decision to introduce suppression policies in the United Kingdom. National income loss estimates were from a study that estimated the impact of a hypothetical pandemic on the UK economy, with sensitivity analyses based on projections that are more recent. Individual quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss and costed resource use inputs were taken from published sources. RESULTS: Imperial model projected suppression polices compared to an unmitigated pandemic, even with the most pessimistic national income loss scenarios under suppression (10%), give incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below £50 000 per QALY. Assuming a maximum reduction in national income of 7.75%, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for Imperial model projected suppression versus mitigation are below 60 000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Results are uncertain and conditional on the accuracy of the Imperial model projections; they are also sensitive to estimates of national income loss. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to claim that the hypothetical Imperial model–projected suppression policies are obviously cost-ineffective relative to the alternatives available. Despite evolving differences between government policy and Imperial model–projected suppression policy, it is hoped this article will provide some early insight into the trade-offs that are involved.","Zala, Darshan; Mosweu, Iris; Critchlow, Simone; Romeo, Renee; McCrone, Paul",Value Health,433,20

In this retrospective study including consecutive adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted between 3/2020 and 30/9/20, we aimed to identify post-discharge outcomes and risk factors for re-admission among COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Mortality and re-admissions were documented for a median post discharge follow up of 59 days (interquartile range 28,161). Univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors for re-admission were performed. Overall, 618 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included. Of the 544 patient who were discharged, 10 patients (1.83%) died following discharge and 50 patients (9.2%) were re-admitted. Median time to re-admission was 7 days (interquartile range 3, 24). Oxygen saturation or treatment prior to discharge were not associated with re-admissions. Risk factors for re-admission in multivariate analysis included solid organ transplantation (hazard ratio [HR] 3.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.73–7.5, p = 0.0028) and higher Charlson comorbidity index (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.23–1.46, p < 0.0001).

This permits the easy isolation of human monoclonal antibodies specific for different antigens by a Kohler and Milstein-based method. Here we studied the human HIV-specific antibody response in the circulation of mice after intrasplenic transfer of PBMC from untreated HIV-infected patients with detectable to high viral load as well as from HAART-treated and from untreated patients, who kept an undetectable viral load (the latter referred to as “natural suppressors”). Excellent B cell expansion was obtained for all PBMC. High level replication of virus was observed after transfer of PBMC of untreated viremic patients only. A strong and multispecific HIV-specific antibody response was observed after transfer of PBMC of untreated viremic patients and natural suppressors. In contrast, only a weak and pauci-specific antibody response was detected in mice reconstituted with PBMC from successfully treated patients. Based on these observations we conclude that the use of the intraspleen mouse model confirmed a) the presence of HIV-specific circulating memory B cells in untreated patients and natural suppressors; b) the nearly complete absence of circulating memory B cells in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Using the intraspleen model we generated large numbers of immortalized B cells and isolated two anti-p24 human monoclonal antibodies. We further conclude that the intraspleen huPBL NOD/SCID model is a small animal model useful for the analysis of the antibody response against HIV found in patients.","Steyaert, Sophia; Verhoye, Lieven; Beirnaert, Els; Donners, Helen; Fransen, Katrien; Heyndrickx, Leo; Vanham, Guido; Leroux-Roels, Geert; Vanlandschoot, Peter",J Immunol Methods,433,12

Elective surgeries, visits with general practitioners, and diagnoses of medical emergencies were consequently delayed. OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of patients admitted to a northern Israeli hospital with common surgical complaints during three periods: the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Second Lebanon War in 2006, and a regular period. METHODS: Demographic, medical, laboratory, imaging, intraoperative, and pathological data were collected from electronic medical files of patients who received emergency treatment at the surgery department of a single hospital in northern Israel. We retrospectively compared the characteristics of patients who were admitted with various conditions during three periods. RESULTS: Patients’ mean age and most of the clinical parameters assessed were similar between the periods. However, pain was reportedly higher during the COVID-19 than the control period (8.7 vs. 6.4 on a 10-point visual analog scale, P < 0.0001). During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Second Lebanon War, and the regular period, the mean numbers of patients admitted daily were 1.4, 4.4, and 3.0, respectively. The respective mean times from the onset of symptoms until admission were 3, 1, and 1.5 days, P < 0.001. The respective proportions of surgical interventions for appendiceal disease were 95%, 96%, and 69%; P = 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a routine period, patients during the COVID-19 outbreak waited longer before turning to hospitalization, and reported more pain at arrival. Patients during both emergency periods were more often treated surgically than non-operatively.","Abu Shakra, Ibrahim; Bez, Maxim; Ganam, Samer; Francis, Rola; Muati, Amir; Bickel, Amitai; Merei, Fahed; Talmi, Ziv; Kamal, Khatib; Kakiashvili, Eli",BMC Surg,433,8

Also, it signifies the importance of the disease to the community. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the net reproductive number of COVID-19 in Iran and its different provinces. Methods: This study was conducted on the data of COVID-19 patients in Iran from February 21 to March 8, 2020. To determine the net reproductive number of COVID-19 in Iran, the serial interval and β value were first determined using linear regression analysis. Then, the net reproductive number values were calculated for Iran and its different provinces. Results: The results of this study showed that the net reproductive number of COVID-19 in Iran was 1.31. Using the available data up to March 15, 2020, the highest net reproductive number was in Mazandaran, Yazd, Isfahan, Qazvin, and Zanjan provinces, with values of 2.07, 1.86, 1.84, and 1.76, respectively. The net reproductive number also showed an increasing trend in Kohgiluyeh and BoyerAhmad province. Conclusion: It seems that although the net reproductive number of the virus had a decreasing trend in the provinces, it is still high. Therefore, sanitary measures in these provinces should be pursued more seriously. On the other hand, social distancing is a topic that should be taken into consideration, that is, social gatherings and contacts should be avoided as much as possible and strategies and facilities for this action should be developed by the government and health policymakers.","Moradi, Yousef; Eshrati, Babak",Med J Islam Repub Iran,433,1

However, in China, the general public displayed more psychological problems than the front-line workers during the pandemic. Therefore, we investigated the influence of perceived stress on the sleep quality of the non-diseased general public and developed a moderated mediation model to explain said relationship. METHODS: Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted online from February 18–25, 2020 with 1,630 Chinese participants (aged 18–68 years). RESULTS: Around one-third (36.38%) of participants were poor sleepers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, higher perceived stress was significantly associated with higher anxiety levels, which, in turn, was associated with lower sleep quality. Self-esteem moderated the indirect effect of perceived stress on sleep quality through its moderation of the effect of perceived stress on anxiety. This indicated that the mediation effect of anxiety was stronger in those with low levels of self-esteem than in those with high levels of self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that both the sleep quality and perceived stress levels of the non-diseased general public required attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also identify personality characteristics related to better sleep quality, demonstrating the important role of self-esteem in environmental adaptation.","Zhao, Xiaolin; Lan, Mengxue; Li, Huixiang; Yang, Juan",Sleep Med,433,14

We aimed to investigate this association using the population-based National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) data in the USA. METHODS: We included all adult (aged ≥18 years) COVID-19 cases with any health-care encounter from 54 clinical sites in the USA, with data being deposited into the N3C. The outcomes were COVID-19 disease severity, hospitalisation, and mortality. Encounters in the same health-care system beginning on or after January 1, 2018, were also included to provide information about pre-existing health conditions (eg, comorbidities). Logistic regression models were employed to estimate the association of HIV infection and HIV markers (CD4 cell count, viral load) with hospitalisation, mortality, and clinical severity of COVID-19 (multinomial). The models were initially adjusted for demographic characteristics, then subsequently adjusted for smoking, obesity, and a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess moderation effects by demographic characteristics. FINDINGS: In the harmonised N3C data release set from Jan 1, 2020, to May 8, 2021, there were 1 436 622 adult COVID-19 cases, of these, 13 170 individuals had HIV infection. A total of 26 130 COVID-19 related deaths occurred, with 445 among people with HIV. After adjusting for all the covariates, people with HIV had higher odds of COVID-19 death (adjusted odds ratio 1·29, 95% CI 1·16–1·44) and hospitalisation (1·20, 1·15–1·26), but lower odds of mild or moderate COVID-19 (0·61, 0·59–0·64) than people without HIV. Interaction terms revealed that the elevated odds were higher among older age groups, male, Black, African American, Hispanic, or Latinx adults. A lower CD4 cell count (<200 cells per μL) was associated with all the adverse COVID-19 outcomes, while viral suppression was only associated with reduced hospitalisation. INTERPRETATION: Given the COVID-19 pandemic's exacerbating effects on health inequities, public health and clinical communities must strengthen services and support to prevent aggravated COVID-19 outcomes among people with HIV, particularly for those with pronounced immunodeficiency.

Therapeutics for treatment of SARS-CoV-2-triggered respiratory inflammation are urgent to be discovered. Our previous study shows that Salvianolic acid C potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we investigated the antiviral effects of a Salvia miltiorrhiza compound, Danshensu, in vitro and in vivo, including the mechanism of S protein-mediated virus attachment and entry into target cells. In authentic and pseudo-typed virus assays in vitro, Danshensu displayed a potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with EC(50) of 0.97 μM, and potently inhibited the entry of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-pseudo-typed virus (SARS-CoV-2 S) into ACE2-overexpressed HEK-293T cells (IC(50) = 0.31 μM) and Vero-E6 cell (IC(50) = 4.97 μM). Mice received SARS-CoV-2 S via trachea to induce ALI, while the VSV-G treated mice served as controls. The mice were administered Danshensu (25, 50, 100 mg/kg, i.v., once) or Danshensu (25, 50, 100 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), oral administration, for 7 days) before SARS-CoV-2 S infection. We showed that SARS-CoV-2 S infection induced severe inflammatory cell infiltration, severely damaged lung tissue structure, highly expressed levels of inflammatory cytokines, and activated TLR4 and hyperphosphorylation of the NF-κB p65; the high expression of angiotensinogen (AGT) and low expression of ACE2 at the mRNA level in the lung tissue were also observed.

This is the third serious coronavirus outbreak in <20 years, following SARS in 2002–2003 and MERS in 2012. So far, there are almost no specific clinically effective drugs and vaccines available for COVID-19. Polysaccharides with good safety, immune regulation and antiviral activity have broad application prospects in anti-virus, especially in anti-coronavirus applications. Here, we reviewed the antiviral mechanisms of some polysaccharides, such as glycosaminoglycans, marine polysaccharides, traditional Chinese medicine polysaccharides, and their application progress in anti-coronavirus. In particular, the application prospects of polysaccharide-based vaccine adjuvants, nanomaterials and drug delivery systems in the fight against novel coronavirus were also analyzed and summarized. Additionally, we speculate the possible mechanisms of polysaccharides anti-SARS-CoV-2, and propose the strategy of loading S or N protein from coronavirus onto polysaccharide capped gold nanoparticles vaccine for COVID-19 treatment. This review may provide a new approach for the development of COVID-19 therapeutic agents and vaccines.","Chen, Xiangyan; Han, Wenwei; Wang, Guixiang; Zhao, Xia",Int J Biol Macromol,433,29

However, there is still an urgent need for alternative vaccine technologies inducing/boosting long-lasting and cross-reactive immunity in different populations. As a possible vaccine candidate, we employed the rotavirus VP6-protein platform to construct a fusion protein (FP) displaying receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) at the N-terminus of VP6. The recombinant baculovirus-insect cell produced VP6-RBD FP was proven antigenic in vitro and bound to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The FP was used to immunize BALB/c mice, and humoral- and T cell-mediated immune responses were investigated. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific T cells were induced at a high quantity; however, no RBD or S-specific antibodies were detected. The results suggest that conformational B cell epitopes might be buried inside the VP6, while RBD-specific T cell epitopes are available for T cell recognition after the processing and presentation of FP by the antigen-presenting cells. Further immunogenicity studies are needed to confirm these findings and to assess whether, under different experimental conditions, the VP6 platform may present SARS-CoV-2 antigens to B cells as well.","Tamminen, Kirsi; Heinimäki, Suvi; Gröhn, Stina; Blazevic, Vesna",Vaccines (Basel),433,1

This memory is designated Immune Training, in which the host animals that had experienced pathogen infection earlier acquire improved resistance to a second infection. Innate immune memory is mediated by an epigenetic mechanism traced to transcriptional memory that is conserved throughout evolution and has been selected for the ability to mount an adaptive response to shifting environments. Accumulating evidence shows that not only peripheral myeloid cells but hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs/HSPCs) can acquire epigenetic memory upon pathogen exposure. Systemic pathogen infection causes HSCs to exit from quiescence and facilitate myeloid-biased differentiation that leads to efficient host defense. This sequence of events is common in HSC memory generation, which is triggered by different stimuli. Recent studies show that not only pathogens but other stimuli such as metabolic stress can generate memory in HSCs. This review summarizes recent publications relevant to HSC memory. We discuss the current understanding of initial sensors, soluble mediators/cytokines involved in memory formation, including Type I and Type II interferons along with future implications.","Chen, Lili; Ozato, Keiko",Front Immunol,433,16

In the body, 7-ketocholesterol is both provided by food and produced endogenously. This pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory molecule, which can activate apoptosis and autophagy at high concentrations, is an abundant component of oxidized Low Density Lipoproteins. 7-Ketocholesterol appears to significantly contribute to the development of age-related diseases (cardiovascular diseases, age-related macular degeneration, and Alzheimer's disease), chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and to certain cancers. Recent studies have also shown that 7-ketocholesterol has anti-viral activities, including on SARS-CoV-2, which are, however, lower than those of oxysterols resulting from the oxidation of cholesterol on the side chain. Furthermore, 7-ketocholesterol is increased in the serum of moderately and severely affected COVID-19 patients. In the case of COVID-19, it can be assumed that the antiviral activity of 7-ketocholesterol could be counterbalanced by its toxic effects, including pro-oxidant, pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant activities that might promote the induction of cell death in alveolar cells. It is therefore suggested that this oxysterol might be involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 by contributing to the acute respiratory distress syndrome and promoting a deleterious, even fatal outcome. Thus, 7-ketocholesterol could possibly constitute a lipid biomarker of COVID-19 outcome and counteracting its toxic effects with adjuvant therapies might have beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients.","Ghzaiel, Imen; Sassi, Khouloud; Zarrouk, Amira; Nury, Thomas; Ksila, Mohamed; Leoni, Valerio; Bouhaouala-Zahar, Balkiss; Hammami, Sonia; Hammami, Mohamed; Mackrill, John J.; Samadi, Mohammad; Ghrairi, Taoufik; Vejux, Anne; Lizard, Gérard",J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,433,16

This subsequently creates a huge burden to the health care systems across the globe for an immediate arrangement of ventilator facilities, oxygen supply and advanced health care. We evaluated the pathological similarity of COVID-19 with other airway obstructive disorders such as COPD and asthma and found typical mucus hypersecretion and mucus plugging in COVID-19 subjects. From several bronchoscopy and clinical autopsy carried out in COVID 19 patients, the overexpression of mucin gene was evident which play a significant role in mucus hypersecretion and accumulation, leading to airway obstruction and further to respiratory distress. In the present work, we highlight the need for intense research inputs to elucidate the exact role the mucus plays in worsening COVID-19 symptoms. This will further help to find a proper approach to quantify the airway mucus plugging in each patient and to develop an appropriate therapy either to inhibit mucus secretion or to improve mucus clearance through well-designed clinical trials.","Kumar, Sarath S.; Binu, Aiswarya; Devan, Aswathy.R.; Nath, Lekshmi.R.",Med Hypotheses,433,24

A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted in a cross-sectional design in three groups of participants: (1.) patients with RD, (2.) hospital workers, and (3.) high-school teachers/academic staff. Psychiatric status was evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Impact of Event Scale-Revised scale. Overall response rate was 34.7%. We studied 771 patients with RD, 535 hospital workers, and 917 teachers/academic staff. Most of the patients with RD were unwilling to go to the hospital (86%), while 22% discontinued their medications. Biological DMARDS were the most frequent drugs whose doses were altered. Only 4% were willing to take hydroxychloroquine for protection. Moreover, the frequency of anxiety (20%), depression (43%), and post-traumatic stress (28%) among patients with RD were found to be comparable to that found among the teachers/academic staff (23%, 43% and 29%, respectively), whereas significantly less than that observed among the hospital workers (40%, 62%, and 46%, respectively) (p < 0.001).

We compared the status of cancer management before and after COVID-19 and analyzed how cancer care continuity was maintained in Korea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the medical records on the number of cancer diagnosis, cancer surgery, radiation therapy and scheduled chemotherapy conducted in Korea University Anam Hospital from January 1 to April 30, 2019 and from the same period in 2020. We also collected the data of metastatic cancer patients who were hospitalized due to respiratory disease. RESULTS: 1694 cancer diagnoses were made in the study period of 2019, and 1445 diagnoses in 2020 (decreased by 14.7%); the cancer surgery performed 830 and 800 cases; the set-up for radiation therapy decreased from 185 to 140 cases; the number of systemic chemotherapies for metastatic cancer patients treated in department of medical oncology increased from 2555 to 2878 cases. Among hospitalized patients, emergency center visit, intensive care unit admission, discharge after recovery and death reveal no drastic changes.

Insights from the Danish model,15.357691,3.689355,2020-06-03,"This report arises from the intersection of service learning and population health at an academic medical center. At the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), the Office of Population Health and Accountable Care (OPHAC) employs health care navigators to help patients access and benefit from high-value care. In early 2020, facing COVID-19, UCSF leaders asked OPHAC to help patients and employees navigate testing, treatment, tracing, and returning to work protocols. OPHAC established a COVID hotline to route callers to the appropriate resources, but needed to increase the capacity of the navigator workforce. To address this need, OPHAC turned to UCSF's service learning program for undergraduates, the Patient Support Corps (PSC). In this program, UC Berkeley undergraduates earn academic credit in exchange for serving as unpaid patient navigators. In July 2020, OPHAC provided administrative funding for the PSC to recruit and deploy students as COVID hotline navigators. In September 2020, the PSC deployed 20 students collectively representing 2.0 full-time equivalent navigators. After training and observation, and with supervision and escalation pathways, students were able to fill half-day shifts and perform near the level of staff navigators. Key facilitators relevant to success reflected both PSC and OPHAC strengths. The PSC onboards student interns as institutional affiliates, giving them access to key information technology systems, and trains them in privacy and other regulatory requirements so they can work directly with patients. OPHAC strengths included a learning health systems culture that fosters peer mentoring and collaboration. A key challenge was that, even after training, students required around 10 h of supervised practice before being able to take calls independently. As a result, students rolled on to the hotline in waves rather than all at once. Post-COVID, OPHAC is planning to use student navigators for outreach. Meanwhile, the PSC is collaborating with pipeline programs in hopes of offering this internship experience to more students from backgrounds that are under-represented in healthcare. Other campuses in the University of California system are interested in replicating this program. Adopters see the opportunity to increase capacity and diversity while developing the next generation of health and allied health professionals.","Belkora, Jeffrey; Weinberg, Tia; Murphy, Jasper; Karthikeyan, Sneha; Tran, Henrietta; Toliver, Tasha; Lopez, Freddie; Tominaga, Grant; Helle, Michael; Intinarelli, Gina; Adler, Joshua",Front Public Health,433,1

We reviewed our patient data-base to determine if similar or other novel trends were present. RESULTS: Our Thrombectomy Stroke Center experienced marked declines in ED visits from 2,349 in early March to 1,178 in late April, stroke alerts dropped from 34 to 14 during the same period. Average monthly stroke admissions dropped from 34 in 2019 to 23 in 2020. Nonetheless, in March, we had 12 patients eligible for tPA, which is twice the typical caseload and was unexpected given the low overall stroke presentations. Although the neurointervention caseload was low, the patients were significantly younger. Of the acute intervention patients in March, 5 of the 12 patients were ≤ 60 years old, and two were in their 30’s. These trends are similar to those reported elsewhere but were highly unusual for our center as our catchment area is predominantly Caucasian with 45% of the population > 65 years of age.

Surveys were conducted in the fall of 2019 and 2020 in Georgia, a major cucurbit-producing state of the USA, to identify the viruses infecting cucurbits and their distribution. Symptomatic samples were collected and small RNA libraries were prepared and sequenced from three cantaloupes, four cucumbers, and two yellow squash samples. An analysis of the sequences revealed the presence of the criniviruses cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV), cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV), and the begomovirus cucurbit leaf crumple virus (CuLCrV). CuLCrV was detected in 76%, CCYV in 60%, and CYSDV in 43% of the total samples (n = 820) tested. The level of mixed infections was high in all the cucurbits, with most plants tested being infected with at least two of these viruses. Near-complete genome sequences of two criniviruses, CCYV and CYSDV, were assembled from the small RNA sequences. An analysis of the coding regions showed low genetic variability among isolates from different hosts. In phylogenetic analysis, the CCYV isolates from Georgia clustered with Asian isolates, while CYSDV isolates clustered with European and USA isolates. This work enhances our understanding of the distribution of viruses on cucurbits in South Georgia and will be useful to develop strategies for managing the complex of whitefly-transmitted viruses in the region.","Kavalappara, Saritha Raman; Milner, Hayley; Konakalla, Naga Charan; Morgan, Kaelyn; Sparks, Alton N; McGregor, Cecilia; Culbreath, Albert K; Wintermantel, William M; Bag, Sudeep",Viruses,433,16

METHODS: In this study, 202 patients were included, primarily of whom 164 had fulfilled the inclusion criteria. This cross-sectional, two-center study that involved 164 symptomatic adults hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 5 and April 5, 2020, was performed to analyze the frequency of rRT-PCR results, distribution of comorbidities, and initial clinicolaboratory data in severe and non-severe cases, comparing the compatibility of two methods for categorizing the severity of the disease. RESULTS: According to our findings, 111 patients were rRT-PCR positive (67.6%), and 53 were rRT-PCR negative (32.4%), indicating no significant difference between severity groups that were not related to the date of symptoms' onset before admission. Based on the National Guideline, among vital signs and symptoms, mean oxygen saturation and frequency of nausea showed a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05); however, no significant difference was observed in comorbidities. In CURB-65 groups, among vital signs and comorbidities, mean oxygen saturation, diabetes, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, chronic heart disease (CHD), and asthma showed a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was seen in symptoms. CONCLUSION: In this study, rRT-PCR results of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were not related to severity categories. From initial clinical characteristics, decreased oxygen saturation appears to be a more common abnormality in severe and non-severe categories. National Guideline indices seem to be more comprehensive to categorize patients in severity groups than CURB-65, and there was compatibility just in non-severe groups of National Guideline and CURB-65 categories.","Karimi, Farnaz; Saleh, Mahshid; Vaezi, Amir Abbas; Qorbani, Mostafa; Avanaki, Foroogh Alborzi",Virol J,433,20

Institutions have all had to prepare and adapt to a large number of admissions, and the influence on elective and emergency surgical services, including burn care, has been significant; it may be some time before we know the full extent of this. While many centers were able to commence more normal activities for a while, we are now seeing an exponential rise in cases again, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the provision of burn care. METHODS: A review of all admissions, operative cases and clinic visits between 1 April and 31 August 2020 was undertaken at an American Burn Association verified burn center. These data were compared with the same five-month period in the preceding two years. RESULTS: Selected data highlights are tabulated (Table 1). During the five months in question, fewer patients were admitted than the previous two years (N=81 versus 121). The mean total body surface area was slightly higher this year (13.7%), and the mean length of hospital stay longer (18 days). The male-to-female ratio of admitted patients was greater during the five months of 2020, at 2.9:1, compared to 1.7:1. No significant differences in terms of etiology were detected, however. As expected, clinic visits reduced dramatically from a mean of 160 patient visits per month to just 81 per month, with the majority conducted virtually. During 2020 the operative cases were similar in number to previous years (N=176), but the mean duration was significantly longer (190 minutes). The total time utilised for burn surgery was similar to previous years (572 hours). [Image: see text] Table 1. Selected burn center data comparing 2020 with 2019 and 2018. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that although total admissions were slightly reduced, the demands on Burn ICU bed resources and burn operating time were similar. The data supports the notion that removing scheduled operating time for our service resulted in less efficient execution of acute burn surgeries and longer hospital stays.

As the number of new cases is skyrocketing, pandemic fatigue and public apathy towards different intervention strategies pose new challenges to government officials to combat the pandemic. Henceforth, it is indispensable for the government officials to understand the future dynamics of COVID-19 flawlessly to develop strategic preparedness and resilient response planning. In light of the above circumstances, probable future outbreak scenarios in Brazil, Russia, and the United kingdom have been sketched in this study with the help of four deep learning models: long short term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), convolutional neural network (CNN) and multivariate convolutional neural network (MCNN). In our analysis, the CNN algorithm has outperformed other deep learning models in terms of validation accuracy and forecasting consistency. It is unearthed in our study that CNN can provide robust long-term forecasting results in time-series analysis due to its capability of essential features learning, distortion invariance, and temporal dependence learning. However, the prediction accuracy of the LSTM algorithm has been found to be poor as it tries to discover seasonality and periodic intervals from any time-series dataset, which were absent in our studied countries. Our study has highlighted the promising validation of using convolutional neural networks instead of recurrent neural networks when forecasting with very few features and less amount of historical data.","Nabi, Khondoker Nazmoon; Tahmid, Md Toki; Rafi, Abdur; Kader, Muhammad Ehsanul; Haider, Md.

First, the dramatic increase in pandemics in the past decade alone suggests that the current relationship of humans with the environment is quickly becoming unstable, with potentially catastrophic consequences. In order to reduce the toll in life and property, we would need to shift our emphasis from control of nature to a symbiosis with nature. This, then, can become the new framework for dealing effectively with environmental issues such as climate change, whereby properly applied medical science would provide the necessary impetus for action. Second, the existence of superspreaders of infection among populations in this pandemic requires that we develop objective tests, most likely of a genetic nature, to identify them rather than apply indiscriminate and draconian controls across the board. Not identifying superspreaders in a timely fashion could allow this pandemic to turn into a black swan event, with a catastrophic impact on society. Third, we need to refocus our efforts in dealing with this pandemic from the virus itself to the human hosts. An objective morbidity risk index can be developed such that most of us can go about our daily business without the fear of becoming seriously ill, while measures can be implemented to protect those who are most vulnerable to this virus. These observations point clearly to a need for a paradigm shift.","Ingersoll, John G.",Diseases,433,8

For some highly lipophilic drugs (typically log P > 5, lipid solubility > 50 mg/g), however, association with lymph lipoproteins in the enterocyte leads to transport to the systemic circulation via the intestinal lymph. The attendant delivery benefits associated with lymphatic drug transport include a reduction in first-pass metabolism and lymphatic exposure to drug concentrations orders of magnitude higher than that attained in systemic blood. In the current review we briefly describe the mechanisms by which drug molecules access the lymph and the formulation strategies that may be utilised to enhance lymphatic drug transport. Specific focus is directed toward recent advances in understanding regarding the impact of lipid source (both endogenous and exogenous) and intracellular lipid trafficking pathways on lymphatic drug transport and enterocyte-based first-pass metabolism.","Trevaskis, Natalie L.; Charman, William N.; Porter, Christopher J.H.",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,433,28

Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) in this patient group can result from primary damage to the central and peripheral neuronal swallowing network but also from the frequently prolonged intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilation. Clinical observations indicate persistence of dysphagia in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (long COVID), so that these patients probably also need long-term interventions for rehabilitation of safe and sufficient oral feeding. Therefore, structured disease-specific monitoring of dysphagia symptoms should be integrated into the treatment of COVID-19 patients and respiratory therapy should be an essential part of dysphagia management to re-establish cough effectiveness and breathing-swallowing coordination. Challenges arise from necessary adjustments to established treatment standards to prevent infections. Furthermore, the selection and intensity of therapeutic measures have to be adapted to the capacities and the specific pathophysiology of COVID-19 and long COVID patients to prevent further functional deterioration.","Frank, Ulrike; Frank, Katrin",Nervenarzt,433,8

The aim of this study is to describe a group of patients who died with TB (active disease or sequelae) and COVID-19 in two cohorts. Data from 49 consecutive cases in 8 countries (cohort A) and 20 hospitalized patients with TB and COVID-19 (cohort B) were analysed and patients who died were described. Demographic and clinical variables were retrospectively collected, including co-morbidities and risk factors for TB and COVID-19 mortality. Overall, 8 out of 69 (11.6%) patients died, 7 from cohort A (14.3%) and one from cohort B (5%). Out of 69 patients 43 were migrants, 26/49 (53.1%) in cohort A and 17/20 (85.0%) in cohort B. Migrants: 1) were younger than natives; in cohort A the median (IQR) age was 40 (27-49) VS. 66 (46-70) years, whereas in cohort B 37 (27-46) VS. 48 (47-60) years; 2) had a lower mortality rate than natives (1/43, 2.3% versus 7/26, 26.9%; p-value: 0.002); 3) had fewer co-morbidities than natives (23/43, 53.5 % versus 5/26- 19.2%) natives; p-value: 0.005). The study findings show that: 1) mortality is likely to occur in elderly patients with co-morbidities; 2) TB might not be a major determinant of mortality and 3) migrants had lower mortality, probably because of their younger age and lower number of co-morbidities. However, in settings where advanced forms of TB frequently occur and are caused by drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, higher mortality rates can be expected in young individuals.","Motta, Ilaria; Centis, Rosella; D’Ambrosio, Lia; García-García, José-María; Goletti, Delia; Gualano, Gina; Lipani, Filippo; Palmieri, Fabrizio; Sánchez-Montalvá, Adrián; Pontali, Emanuele; Sotgiu, Giovanni; Spanevello, Antonio; Stochino, Claudia; Tabernero, Eva; Tadolini, Marina; van den Boom, Martin; Villa, Simone; Visca, Dina; Migliori, Giovanni Battista",Pulmonology,433,20

Recent clinical successes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in therapy for viral infections demonstrate that mAbs offer a solution for these emerging biothreats. We have explored this with respect to Junin virus (JUNV), an arenavirus classified as a category A high-priority agent and the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). There are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs available for preventing or treating AHF, although immune plasma from convalescent patients is used routinely to treat active infections. However, immune plasma is severely limited in quantity, highly variable in quality, and poses significant safety risks including the transmission of transfusion-borne diseases. mAbs offer a highly specific and consistently potent alternative to immune plasma that can be manufactured at large scale. We previously described a chimeric mAb, cJ199, that provided protection in a guinea pig model of AHF. To adapt this mAb to a format more suitable for clinical use, we humanized the mAb (hu199) and evaluated it in a cynomolgus monkey model of AHF with two JUNV isolates, Romero and Espindola. While untreated control animals experienced 100% lethality, all animals treated with hu199 at 6 d postinoculation (dpi) survived, and 50% of animals treated at 8 dpi survived. mAbs like hu199 may offer a safer, scalable, and more reproducible alternative to immune plasma for rare viral diseases that have epidemic potential.","Zeitlin, Larry; Cross, Robert W.; Geisbert, Joan B.; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Agans, Krystle N.; Prasad, Abhishek N.; Enterlein, Sven; Aman, M.

However, there is a need to reconsider these relationships in light of accelerating climate change and associated social and policy shifts in the USA, including the rising cost of flood insurance, the challenge of obtaining aid to rebuild, and growing interest in “managed retreat” from places at greatest risk. This article presents data from a survey of individuals who opted either to rebuild in place or relocate with the help of a voluntary home buyout after Hurricane Sandy. Findings show those who lived in buyout-eligible areas and relocated were significantly less likely to report worsened stress than those who rebuilt in place. This suggests access to a government-supported voluntary relocation option may, under certain circumstances, lessen the negative mental health consequences associated with disaster-related housing damage.","Koslov, Liz; Merdjanoff, Alexis; Sulakshana, Elana; Klinenberg, Eric",Clim Change,433,1

The methodology included a classification framework to assess common failures observed in the implementation of water management programs (WMPs). We reviewed reports from fourteen CDC-led investigations between 1 January 2015 and 21 June 2019 to identify EDs associated with outbreaks of LD. We developed an abstraction guide to standardize data collection from outbreak reports and define relevant parameters. We categorized each ED according to three criteria: ED type, WMP-deficiency type, and source of deficiency. We calculated the prevalence of EDs among facilities and explored differences between facilities with and without WMPs. A majority of EDs identified (81%) were classified as process failures. Facilities with WMPs (n = 8) had lower prevalence of EDs attributed to plumbed devices (9.1%) and infrastructure design (0%) than facilities without WMPs (n = 6; 33.3% and 24.2%, respectively). About three quarters (72%) of LD cases and 81% of the fatalities in our sample originated at facilities without a WMP. This report highlights the importance of WMPs in preventing and mitigating outbreaks of LD. Building water system process management is a primary obstacle toward limiting the root causes of LD outbreaks. Greater emphasis on the documentation, verification, validation, and continuous program review steps will be important in maximizing the effectiveness of WMPs.","Clopper, Benjamin R.; Kunz, Jasen M.; Salandy, Simone W.; Smith, Jessica C.; Hubbard, Brian C.; Sarisky, John P.",Microorganisms,433,8

As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries. Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of early evidence on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU. We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes. Applying this approach, we provide distributions for total hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community. RESULTS: We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52). Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies. ICU LoS was reported by eight studies—four each within and outside China—with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively. Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR 10–19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR 3–9) days outside of China. For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5–13) days for China and 7 (4–11) days outside of China). There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere. This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic. In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside China.","Rees, Eleanor M.; Nightingale, Emily S.; Jafari, Yalda; Waterlow, Naomi R.; Clifford, Samuel; B.

Distinctively, a substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients develop olfactory dysfunction of uncertain underlying mechanism which can be severe and prolonged. The roles of inflammatory obstruction of the olfactory clefts leading to conductive impairment, inflammatory cytokines affecting olfactory neuronal function, destruction of olfactory neurons or their supporting cells, and direct invasion of olfactory bulbs, in causing olfactory dysfunction are uncertain. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the location for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 from the olfactory epithelium (OE) of the nasopharynx to the olfactory bulb of golden Syrian hamsters. RESULTS: After intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, inflammatory cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses were detected in the nasal turbinate tissues which peaked between 2 to 4 days post-infection with the highest viral load detected at day 2 post-infection. Besides the nasopharyngeal pseudo-columnar ciliated respiratory epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens were also detected in the more superficial mature olfactory sensory neurons labeled by olfactory marker protein (OMP), the less mature olfactory neurons labelled by Tuj1 at more basal position, and the sustentacular cells which provide metabolic and physical support for the olfactory neurons, resulting in apoptosis and severe destruction of the OE. During the whole course of infection, SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens were not detected in the olfactory bulb. CONCLUSIONS: Besides acute inflammation at OE, infection of mature and immature olfactory neurons, and the supporting sustentacular cells by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the unique olfactory dysfunction of COVID-19 which is not reported with SARS-CoV.","Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Chu, Hin; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Fan, Zhimeng; Li, Can; Liu, Feifei; Chen, Yanxia; Yuan, Shuofeng; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Cai, Jian-Piao; Wu, Kenneth Lap-Kei; Sridhar, Siddharth; Chan, Ying-Shing; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Clin Infect Dis,433,20

RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are key sensors of viral RNA species in the host cell cytoplasm. Activation of RLRs in response to viral RNA triggers an antiviral defense program through the production of hundreds of antiviral effector proteins including cytokines, chemokines, and host restriction factors that directly interfere with distinct steps in the virus life cycle. To avoid premature or abnormal antiviral and proinflammatory responses, which could have harmful consequences for the host, the signaling activities of RLRs and their common adaptor molecule, MAVS, are delicately controlled by cell-intrinsic regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, viruses have evolved multiple strategies to modulate RLR-MAVS signal transduction to escape from immune surveillance. Here, we summarize recent progress in our understanding of the regulation of RLR signaling through host factors and viral antagonistic proteins.","Chiang, Jessica J.; Davis, Meredith E.; Gack, Michaela U.",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,433,20

OBJECTIVE: This study compares access to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 related health care and mental health of people with and without disability. METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of 12,703 adults (16–64 years) who participated in W9 (2017–2019) and the April and/or May COVID-19 special surveys of the UK Understanding Society study. Descriptive analyses and Poisson regression (adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and financial stress) were conducted to estimate associations between disability (measured at Wave 9) and a number of different COVID-19-related health and health care outcomes (COVID-19 symptoms, testing and hospitalisation), mental health and loneliness, and non-COVID-19 related health care (e.g. outpatient and inpatient hospital care, prescription medications). RESULTS: Results from the fully-adjusted regression models found that people with disability were more likely: to be hospitalised if symptomatic (adjusted PRR 3.0 95% 1.07–8.43); to experience current symptoms of psychological distress (PRR 1.15, 95% CI 1.05–1.26) and to report being lonely (PRR 1.75, 95% CI 1.46–2.09) compared to non-disabled people. People with disability reported much higher levels of comorbidities than people without disability. However, inability to access health care and treatment were similar.

This delay was seen in the production of both intracellular and extracellular virus. However, the final titers were similar to those produced by MHV-infected cells maintained in normal medium. The manifestation of virus-induced cell fusion was similarly found to be delayed, but not otherwise decreased in severity, when ammonium chloride was present in the culture medium. Ammonium chloride caused similar delays in production of virus-specific, positive-sense RNAs and of viral polypeptides. The relative proportions and apparent molecular weights of viral RNAs and polypeptides were similar to those found in MHV-infected cells cultured in normal medium. In vitro translation of endogenously produced viral RNAs in cell extracts, prepared from MHV-infected cells, was not inhibited by ammonium chloride. Thus, ammonium chloride has no specific, inhibitory effect on viral protein synthesis. Ammonium chloride did not reduce the number of virus-infected cells in culture, as monitored by infectious center assay. Analysis of early events in MHV infection showed that ammonium chloride did not affect adsorption or internalization of MHV by L-2 cells. However, the subsequent eclipse phase, as monitored by decline in infectivity of internalized virus inoculum proceeded less efficiently in the presence of ammonium chloride. On the basis of the known inhibitory effects of ammonium chloride on lysosomal/endosomal functions, the results suggest an endosomal mechanism of MHV uncoating. Thus the primary effect of ammonium chloride on MHV infection of L-2 cells is to attenuate virus uncoating, thereby chronologically displacing all subsequent virus-encoded functions.","Mizzen, Lee; Hilton, Anne; Cheley, Steve; Anderson, Robert",Virology,433,1

Vivli, a non-profit organisation, operates a global platform for sharing of individual participant-level trial data and associated documents. Sharing of these data collected from each trial participant enables combining of these data to drive new scientific insights or assess reproducibility—not possible with the aggregate or summary data tables historically made available. We report on our initial experience including key metrics, lessons learned and how we see our role in the data sharing ecosystem. We also describe how Vivli is addressing the needs of the COVID-19 challenge through a new dedicated portal that provides a direct search function for COVID-19 studies, availability for fast-tracked request review and data sharing. DATA SUMMARY: The Vivli platform was established in 2018 and has partnered with 28 diverse members from industry, academic institutions, government platforms and non-profit foundations. Currently, 5400 trials representing 3.6 million participants are shared on the platform. From July 2018 to September 2020, Vivli received 201 requests. To date, 106 of 201 requests received approval, 5 have been declined, 27 withdrew and 27 are in the revision stage. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has only magnified the necessity for data sharing. If most data are shared and in a manner that allows interoperability, then we have hope of moving towards a cohesive scientific understanding more quickly not only for COVID-19 but also for all diseases. Conversely, if only isolated pockets of data are shared then society loses the opportunity to close vital gaps in our understanding of this rapidly evolving epidemic. This current challenge serves to highlight the value of data sharing platforms—critical enablers that help researchers build on prior knowledge.","Li, Rebecca; Wood, Julie; Baskaran, Amrutha; Neumann, Stanley; Graham, Elizabeth; Levenstein, Marcia; Sim, Ida",BMJ Open,433,16

Scalable, sensitive and specific serological assays are essential to this process. The detection of antibody in hospitalized patients with severe disease has proven straightforward; detecting responses in subjects with mild disease and asymptomatic infections has proven less reliable. We hypothesized that the suboptimal sensitivity of antibody assays and the compartmentalization of the antibody response may contribute to this effect. METHODS: We systemically developed an ELISA assay, optimising different antigens and amplification steps, in serum and saliva from symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects. RESULTS: Using trimeric spike glycoprotein, rather than nucleocapsid enabled detection of responses in individuals with low antibody responses. IgG1 and IgG3 predominate to both antigens, but more antispike IgG1 than IgG3 was detectable. All antigens were effective for detecting responses in hospitalized patients. Anti-spike, but not nucleocapsid, IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses were readily detectable in saliva from non-hospitalized symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Antibody responses in saliva and serum were largely independent of each other and symptom reporting. CONCLUSIONS. Detecting antibody responses in both saliva and serum is optimal for determining virus exposure and understanding immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. FUNDING.

This review highlights important progress made toward the mitigation of Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19 outbreaks. These epidemics and their shared features suggest a unified policy and technology agenda that could broadly improve global health security. RECENT FINDINGS Molecular epidemiology is not yet in widespread use, but shows promise toward informing on-the-ground decision-making during outbreaks. Point-of-care (POC) diagnostics have been achieved for each of these threats; however, deployment of Zika and Ebola diagnostics lags behind those for COVID-19. POC metagenomics offers the possibility of identifying novel viruses. Vaccines have been successfully approved for Ebola and COVID-19, due in large part to public-private partnerships and advance purchase commitments. Therapeutics trials conducted during ongoing epidemics have identified effective antibody therapeutics for Ebola, as well as steroids (both inhaled and oral) and a broad-spectrum antiviral for COVID-19. SUMMARY Achieving global health security remains a challenge, though headway has been made over the past years.

We reviewed the literature highlighting recent technological advancements in efforts to counteract this challenge. We also provided insights into strategies that can improve the outcomes from current BO screening practises. RECENT FINDINGS: The standard method for BO detection, endoscopy, is invasive and expensive and therefore inappropriate for mass screening. On the other hand, endoscopy is more cost-effective for screening a high-risk population. A consensus has however not been reached on who should be screened. Risk prediction algorithms have been tested as an enrichment pre-screening tool reporting modest AUC’s but require more prospective evaluation studies. Less invasive endoscopy methods like trans-nasal endoscopy, oesophageal capsule endsocopy and non-endoscopic cell collection devices like the Cytosponge coupled with biomarker analysis have shown promise in BO detection with randomised clinical trial evidence. SUMMARY: A three-tier precision cancer programme whereby risk prediction algorithms and non-endoscopic minimally invasive cell collection devices are used to triage test a wider pool of individuals may improve the detection rate of current screening practises with minimal cost implications.","Yusuf, Aisha; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C.",Curr Treat Options Gastroenterol,433,20

METHODS: We analyzed all patients undergoing PPCI <24 hours STEMI included in the prospective France PCI registry. The 2 groups were compared on mean monthly number of patients, delays in the pathway care, and in‐hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE: death, stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, unplanned coronary revascularization, stroke, and major bleeding). RESULTS: From January 15, 2019 to April 14, 2020, 2064 STEMI patients undergoing PPCI were included: 1942 in the prelockdown group and 122 in the lockdown group. Only 2 cases in the lockdown group were positive for COVID‐19. A significant drop (12%) in mean number of STEMI/month was observed in the lockdown group compared with prelockdown (139 vs 122, P < 0.04). A significant increase in “symptom onset to first medical contact” delay was found for patients who presented directly to the emergency department (ED) (238 minutes vs 450 minutes; P = 0.04). There were higher rates of in‐hospital MACE (7.7% vs 12.3%; P = 0.06) and mortality (4.9% vs 8.2%; P = 0.11) in the lockdown group but the differences were not significant.

However, it remains elusive whether or not a pathogen-derived protein can function as a cytosolic pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). In this study, we demonstrate that delivering the membrane gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) into HEK293T, HEK293ET, and immobilized murine bone marrow-derived macrophage (J2-Mφ) cells significantly upregulates beta interferon (IFN-β) production. Both NF-κB and TBK1-IRF3 signaling cascades are activated by M gene products. M protein rather than M mRNA is responsible for M-mediated IFN-β induction that is preferentially associated with the activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor proteins MyD88, TIRAP, and TICAM2 but not the RIG-I signaling cascade. Blocking the secretion of M protein by brefeldin A (BFA) failed to reverse the M-mediated IFN-β induction. The antagonist of both TLR2 and TLR4 did not impede M-mediated IFN-β induction, indicating that the driving force for the activation of IFN-β production was generated from inside the cells. Inhibition of TRAF3 expression by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) did not prevent M-mediated IFN-β induction. SARS-CoV pseudovirus could induce IFN-β production in an M rather than M(V68A) dependent manner, since the valine-to-alanine alteration at residue 68 in M protein markedly inhibited IFN-β production. Overall, our study indicates for the first time that a pathogen-derived protein is able to function as a cytosolic PAMP to stimulate type I interferon production by activating a noncanonical TLR signaling cascade in a TRAF3-independent manner.","Wang, Yi; Liu, Li",mBio,433,20

Several reports of allergic reactions concerning for anaphylaxis have been reported early into the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine campaign in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom. Objective To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis characterizing the risks of COVID-19 versus vaccine anaphylaxis, comparing universal COVID-19 vaccination vs. risk-stratified vaccination approaches. Methods Cohort analysis models were created to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination vs. risk-stratified vaccination (e.g., contraindicated in persons with a history of any prior episode of anaphylaxis) with a threshold for cost-effective care at $10,000,000 per death prevented. In the base case, risk of anaphylaxis was estimated at 0.1% with case-fatality estimated at 0.3%. Results On a population level (n=300,000,000 simulated persons), universal vaccination was associated with a cost-savings of $503,596,316 and saved 7,607 lives, but the cost-savings was sensitive to increasing rates of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis. The universal strategy dominated at higher rates of COVID-19 infection and low rates of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis in both the healthcare and societal perspectives. When the risk of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis exceeded 0.8%, the risk-stratified approach to vaccination was the most cost-effective strategy. There was also an interaction between anaphylaxis risk and anaphylaxis fatality, with a risk-stratified approach becoming cost-effective as each risk increased concurrently. Stratified observation time by anaphylaxis history (15 minutes vs 30 minutes) was not cost-effective until a 1% anaphylaxis case-fatality was assumed and risk of vaccine anaphylaxis exceeded 6%. Conclusion This study demonstrates that unless vaccine anaphylaxis rates exceed 0.8% a universal vaccination approach dominates a risk-stratified approach where persons with any history of anaphylaxis would be contraindicated from vaccination, with lower cost and superior health outcomes.","Shaker, Marcus; Abrams, Elissa M.; Greenhawt, Matthew",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,433,16

Thus, in the RESTART study we compared antigen and RT-PCR testing methods on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and salivary samples. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study among COVID-19 hospitalized patients between 10th December 2020 and 1st February 2021. Paired saliva and NP samples were investigated by RT-PCR (Cobas 6800, Roche-Switzerland) and by two rapid antigen tests: One Step Immunoassay Exdia(R) COVID-19 Ag (Precision Biosensor, Korea) and Standard Q(R) COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche-Switzerland). Results: A total of 58 paired NP-saliva specimens were collected. Thirty-two of 58 (55%) patients were hospitalized in the intensive care unit and the median duration of symptoms was 11 days (IQR 5-19). NP and salivary RT-PCR exhibited sensitivity of 98% and 69% respectively whereas the specificity of these RT-PCRs assays were of 100%. NP RAT exhibited much lower diagnostic performances with sensitivities of 35% and 41% for the Standard Q(R) and Exdia(R) assays respectively, when a wet-swab approach was used (i.e. when the swab was diluted in the viral transport medium (VTM) before testing). The sensitivity of the dry-swab approach was slightly better (47%). These antigen tests exhibited very low sensitivity (4 and 8%) when applied to salivary swabs. Conclusions: Nasopharyngeal RT-PCR is the most accurate test for COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitalized patients. RT-PCR on salivary samples may be used when nasopharyngeal swabs are contraindicated. RAT are not appropriate for hospitalized patients.","Kritikos, A.; Caruana, G.; Brouillet, R.; Miroz, J.-P.; Abed-Maillard, S.; Stieger, G.; Opota, O.; Croxatto, A.; Vollenweider, P.; Bart, P.-A.; Chiche, J.-D.; Greub, G.",,433,18

Often however, effective vaccinations are carried out insufficiently. In March 2020, the German measles protection law was introduced to raise the level of population (herd) immunity to over 95 %. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted among the population on the Measles Protection Act with self-declarations on measles vaccination/illness of participants and their children and evaluation of various sanctions. RESULTS: 1,594 adults participated. 19.3 % were affected by the law. Of these, only 77.5 % were immune to measles, 14.0 % wanted to be fully vaccinated when the law came into force, which would lead to 91.5 % immunity. Assuming that participants with unclear vaccination status or measles disease are immune, an immunity of > 95 % can be achieved. 86.4 % of the children (aged 2 to 17 years) had developed immunity. Parents’ willingness to have their children vaccinated because of the sanctions provided for in the Measles Protection Act was only 0.8 %. CONCLUSION: The level of immunity to measles in adults and children was under 95 % in our study. The sanctions of the Measles Protection Act are a greater incentive for adults to undergo measles vaccination than for parents. Strategies to increase immunity with the target group of parents should continue to be pursued.","Neugebauer, Michael; Ebert, Matthias; Vogelmann, Roger",Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes,433,1

We determined the metallomes of fly strains selected for lighter or darker cuticles in a laboratory evolution experiment, asking whether any specific element changed in abundance in concert with pigment deposition. The results showed a correlation between total iron content and strength of pigmentation, which was further corroborated by ferritin iron quantification. To ask if the observed increase in iron body content along with increased pigment deposition could be generalizable, we crossed yellow and ebony alleles causing light and dark pigmentation, respectively, into similar genetic backgrounds and measured their metallomes. Iron remained unaffected in the various mutants providing no support for a causative link between pigmentation and iron content. In contrast, the combined analysis of both experiments suggested instead a correlation between pigment deposition and total copper body content, possibly due to increased demand for epidermal tyrosinase activity.","Vásquez-Procopio, Johana; Rajpurohit, Subhash; Missirlis, Fanis",Biometals,433,1

While coronaviruses have been known to infect animals for decades, the true intermediate host of the virus has not been identified, with no cases of SARS-CoV-2 in wild animals. The screening of wild, farmed, and domesticated animals is necessary to help us understand the virus and its origins and prevent future outbreaks of both COVID-19 and other diseases. There is intriguing evidence that farmed mink infections (acquired from humans) have led to infection of other farm workers in turn, with a recent outbreak of a mink variant in humans in Denmark. A thorough examination of the current knowledge and evidence of the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect different animal species is therefore vital to evaluate the threat of animal to human transmission and reverse zoonosis.","Prince, Tessa; Smith, Shirley L.; Radford, Alan D.; Solomon, Tom; Hughes, Grant L.; Patterson, Edward I.",Viruses,433,1

AHCY catalyzes the reversible break of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the by-product and a potent inhibitor of methyltransferases activity. In mammals, AHCY is the only enzyme capable of performing this reaction. Controlled subcellular localization of AHCY is believed to facilitate local transmethylation reactions, by removing excess of SAH. Accordingly, AHCY is recruited to chromatin during replication and active transcription, correlating with increasing demands for DNA, RNA, and histone methylation. AHCY deletion is embryonic lethal in many organisms (from plants to mammals). In humans, AHCY deficiency is associated with an incurable rare recessive disorder in methionine metabolism. In this review, we focus on the AHCY protein from an evolutionary, biochemical, and functional point of view, and we discuss the most recent, relevant, and controversial contributions to the study of this enzyme.","Vizán, Pedro; Di Croce, Luciano; Aranda, Sergi",Front Cell Dev Biol,433,1

This work presents three different original approaches that competed in a grand challenge on the “Drone vs. Bird” detection problem. The goal is to detect one or more drones appearing at some time point in video sequences where birds and other distractor objects may be also present, together with motion in background or foreground. Algorithms should raise an alarm and provide a position estimate only when a drone is present, while not issuing alarms on birds, nor being confused by the rest of the scene. In particular, three original approaches based on different deep learning strategies are proposed and compared on a real-world dataset provided by a consortium of universities and research centers, under the 2020 edition of the Drone vs. Bird Detection Challenge. Results show that there is a range in difficulty among different test sequences, depending on the size and the shape visibility of the drone in the sequence, while sequences recorded by a moving camera and very distant drones are the most challenging ones. The performance comparison reveals that the different approaches perform somewhat complementary, in terms of correct detection rate, false alarm rate, and average precision.","Coluccia, Angelo; Fascista, Alessio; Schumann, Arne; Sommer, Lars; Dimou, Anastasios; Zarpalas, Dimitrios; Méndez, Miguel; de la Iglesia, David; González, Iago; Mercier, Jean-Philippe; Gagné, Guillaume; Mitra, Arka; Rajashekar, Shobha",Sensors (Basel),433,1

BAC vector sequences were inserted into the thymidine kinase gene of HSV-2 by homologous recombination. DNA from cells infected with the resulting recombinant virus was transformed into E. coli, and colonies containing the HSV-2 BAC (HSV2-BAC) were isolated and analyzed for the expected genotype. HSV2-BAC DNA was infectious when transfected back into mammalian cells and the resulting virus was thymidine kinase negative. When used to immunize mice, the HSV2-BAC DNA elicited a strong HSV-2 specific antibody response that was equal to or greater than live virus immunization. Further, HSV2-BAC immunization was protective when animals were challenged with a lethal dose of virus. The utility of the HSV2-BAC for construction of recombinant virus genomes was demonstrated by elimination of the HSV-2 glycoprotein D (gD) gene. A recombinant HSV-2 BAC with the gD gene deleted was isolated and shown to be incapable of producing infectious virus following transfection unless an HSV gD gene was expressed in a complementing cell line. Immunization of mice with the HSV2 gD-BAC also elicited an HSV-2 specific antibody response and was protective. The results demonstrate the feasibility of DNA immunization with HSV-2 bacterial artificial chromosomes for replicating and nonreplicating candidate HSV-2 vaccines, as well as the utility of BAC technology for construction and maintenance of novel HSV-2 vaccines. The results further suggest that such technology will be a powerful tool for dissecting the immune response to HSV-2.","Meseda, Clement A.; Schmeisser, Falko; Pedersen, Robin; Woerner, Amy; Weir, Jerry P.",Virology,433,18

After patients are discharged, SARS-CoV-2 recurring cases are reported and the recurrence could profoundly impact patient healthcare and social economics. To date, no data on the effects of medical treatments on recurrence has been published. We analyzed the treatment data of combinations of ten different drugs for the recurring cases in a single medical center, Shenzhen, China. A total of 417 patients were considered and 414 of them were included in this study (3 deaths) with mild-to-critical COVID-19. Patients were treated by 10 different drug combinations and followed up for recurrence for 28 days quarantine after being discharged from the medical center between February and May, 2020. We applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to overcome the rare recurring events in certain age groups and performed Virtual Twins (VT) analysis facilitated by random forest regression for medical treatment-recurrence classification.

The processes that trigger organ damage in COVID-19 are incompletely understood. METHODS: Samples were donated from hospitalized patients. Sera, plasma, and autopsy-derived tissue sections were examined employing flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunohistochemistry. PATIENT FINDINGS: Here, we show that severe COVID-19 is characterized by a highly pronounced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) inside the micro-vessels. Intravascular aggregation of NETs leads to rapid occlusion of the affected vessels, disturbed microcirculation, and organ damage. In severe COVID-19, neutrophil granulocytes are strongly activated and adopt a so-called low-density phenotype, prone to spontaneously form NETs. In accordance, markers indicating NET turnover are consistently increased in COVID-19 and linked to disease severity. Histopathology of the lungs and other organs from COVID-19 patients showed congestions of numerous micro-vessels by aggregated NETs associated with endothelial damage.

That paradox has important practical implications for the use of the drug Tocilizumab in Covid-19. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) orchestrates the so-called cytokine storm leading to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the life-threatening condition that is responsible for Covid-19 deaths. However, IL-6 has a paradoxical effect in many viral infections. For pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis B for example, mild elevations of IL-6 show a protective effect whereas high elevations show a toxic effect and are associated with higher mortality (e.g. they promote progression to AIDS in HIV patients). IL-6 can be therefore considered as being both a pro-inflammatory and an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Several studies have shown that severe COPD is associated with extremely-high levels of IL-6, whereas mild COPD is associated with mild elevations of IL-6. It is plausible that the chronic, mildly-elevated concentrations of IL-6 found in mild COPD patients is protective against the deterioration of Covid-19, as it is the case for other viral diseases. That may explain why COPD is surprisingly an uncommon comorbidity in Covid-19 intensive care units. This may have an important practical implication for the treatment of Covid-19 patients: our hypothesis is that Tocilizumab must be used exclusively in patients with an ongoing cytokine storm. Otherwise, an early use of Tocilizumab can be harmful, especially in patients affected by COPD or other conditions with mildly-elevated IL-6.","Bruzzese, Vincenzo; Ivan Lazzarino, Antonio",Med Hypotheses,433,1

The aim of this experimental study was to analyze the efficacy of spray mist reduction with an intraoral high-volume evacuation system (HVE) during simulated high-speed tooth preparation for suboptimal versus optimal suction positions of 16 mm sized cannulas and different flow rates of the HVE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a manikin head, the upper first premolar was prepared with a dental turbine, and generated particles of 5–50 microns were analyzed fifty millimeters above the mouth opening with the shadow imaging technique (frame: 6.6×5.3×1.1 mm). This setup was chosen to generate a reproducible spray mist in a vertical direction towards an imaginary operator head (worst case scenario). The flow rate (FR) of the HVE was categorized into five levels (≤120 l/min up to 330 l/min). The number of particles per second (NP; p/s) was counted, and the mass volume flow of particles per second (MVF; μg/s*cm(3)) was calculated for 10 sec. Statistical tests were nonparametric and two-sided (p≤0.05). RESULTS: With increasing flow rate, the NP/MVF values decreased significantly (eta: 0.671/0.678; p≤0.001). Using a suboptimally positioned cannula with an FR≤160 l/min, significantly higher NP values (mean±SD) of 731.67±54.24 p/s (p≤0.019) and an MVF of 3.72±0.42 μg/s*cm(3) (p≤0.010) were measured compared to those of the optimal cannula position and FR≥300 l/min (NP/MVF: 0/0). No significant difference in NP and MVF was measurable between FR≥250 l/min and FR>300 l/min (p = 0.652, p = 0.664). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of the current experimental study, intraoral high-flow rate suction with ≥300 l/min with an HVE effectively reduced 5–50 μm sized particles of the spray mist induced by high-speed tooth preparation with a dental turbine.","Koch, Martin; Graetz, Christian",PLoS One,433,1

We aimed to examine the impact of these changes on perceived stress, mental health and (study-)related health behavior of students in a longitudinal study. METHODS: For two timepoints – the year before the COVID-19 pandemic (2019, n = 1377) and the year during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020, n = 1867) – we surveyed students of all faculties at one German university for perceptions and preventive behavior regarding the COVID-19 pandemic using standard instruments for stress, anxiety, depression, and behavior and experience patterns. RESULTS: About 90% of students (n = 1633) in 2020 did not have a known contact infected with SARS-CoV-2, while 180 (9.8%) did have one. Only 10 respondents (0.5%) reported an infection with SARS-CoV-2. Wearing masks and washing hands more often were practiced by ≥80% of students. Taking more care about cleanliness (51.8%) and using disinfectants (39.2%) were practiced much less. A higher percentage of female compared with male students and medical/health science students compared with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics students engaged more frequently in specific or nonspecific preventive measures. More than three quarters (77.1%) of all students rated their general health as (very) good. There were no significant differences in general health, stress, and depression between 2019 and 2020 in the students who responded at both timepoints. The distribution of behavior and experience patterns for this group showed a slight but significant difference from 2019 to 2020, namely decreasing proportions of students with a healthy pattern and a risk pattern for overexertion. Students with different behavior and experience patterns showed marked differences in perceptions and reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as psychosocial stress and symptoms, with higher scores for mental health symptoms and lower scores in preventive behavior regarding risk patterns. CONCLUSION: Despite massive alterations to students’ lives in 2020, there were only moderate consequences for mental health compared with 2019 in the total student group of this German university. However, identifying students at risk would offer opportunities to foster mental health in relevant subgroups.

The antibody-dependent enhancement of virus infection is a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies that are not neutralizing enhance the entry of infectious virus into immune cells causing their death. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been reported for different coronaviruses. This phenomenon happens due to a decrease in the binding strength of neutralizing antibodies to the virus, which converts these antibodies into suboptimal—not neutralizing ones. According to our hypothesis, such a decrease in affinity may be associated with a change in the conformation of the viral S-protein.

We used spherical gold nanoparticles (average diameter, 15 nm) as a platform for the antigen for swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The literature data demonstrate that immunization of animals with the TGEV antigen coupled to gold nanoparticles (GNPs) not only activates antigen-presenting cells but also increases the proliferative activity of splenic lymphoid (antibody-forming) cells. The contents of γ-IFN, IL-1β, and IL-6 in animals immunized with GNP-antigen conjugates were found to be higher than those in intact animals or in animals given the antigen alone. The increased concentration of IL-1β in the immunized animals directly correlated with the activity of macrophages and stimulated B cells, which produce this cytokine when activated. The increased concentration of IL-6 indicates that the injected preparations are stimulatory to cellular immunity. Immunization with the TGEV antigen conjugated to GNPs as a carrier activates the respiratory activity of lymphoid cells and peritoneal macrophages, which is directly related to their transforming activity and to the activation of antibody generation. Furthermore, the use of this conjugate allows marked improvement of the structure of the animals’ immune organs and restores the morphological–functional state of these organs. The microanatomical changes (increased number of follicles) indicate the activation of the B-dependent zone of the spleen and, consequently, the development of a humoral-type immunological reaction. The degradative processes observed in the animals immunized with TGEV antigen alone are evidence of weak resistance to pathogen attack. These results can be used to develop vaccines against this infection by employing TGEV antigen coupled to gold nanoparticles as a carrier.","Staroverov, Sergey A.; Volkov, Alexei A.; Mezhenny, Pavel V.; Domnitsky, Ivan Yu.; Fomin, Alexander S.; Kozlov, Sergey V.; Dykman, Lev A.; Guliy, Olga I.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,433,30

This have led to limited effective medicines for several diseases. To address these challenges, efficient strategies, novel technologies, and policies are urgently needed. The main obstacles in drug discovery and development are the mounting cost, risk, and time frame needed to develop new medicines. Fair pricing and accessibility is another unmet global challenge. Areas covered: Here, the authors cover the pace, risks, cost, and challenges facing drug development processes. Additionally, they introduce disease-associated data which demand global attention and propose solutions to overcome these challenges. Expert opinion: The massive challenges encountered during drug development urgently call for a serious global rethinking of the way this process is done. A partial solution might be if many consortiums of multi-nations, academic institutions, clinicians, pharma companies, and funding agencies gather at different fronts to crowdsource resources, share knowledge and risks. Such an ecosystem can rapidly generate first-in-class molecules that are safe, effective, and affordable. We think that this article represents a wake-up call for the scientific community to immediately reassess the current drug discovery and development procedures.","Aghila Rani, Koippallil Gopalakrishnan; Hamad, Mohamad A.; Zaher, Dana M.; Sieburth, Scott McN; Madani, Navid; Al-Tel, Taleb H.",Expert opinion on drug discovery,433,1

Taking Northwest Syria as a case study, we simulated an outbreak in high-density informal Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps using a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model. Expanding on previous studies, taking social conditions and population health/structure into account, we modelled several interventions feasible in these settings: moderate self-distancing, self-isolation of symptomatic cases and protection of the most vulnerable in ‘safety zones’. We considered complementary measures to these interventions that can be implemented autonomously by these communities, such as buffer zones, health checks and carers for isolated individuals, quantifying their impact on the micro-dynamics of disease transmission. All interventions significantly reduce outbreak probability and some of them reduce mortality when an outbreak does occur. Self-distancing reduces mortality by up to 35% if contacts are reduced by 50%. A reduction in mortality by up to 18% can be achieved by providing one self-isolation tent per eight people. Protecting the most vulnerable in a safety zone reduces the outbreak probability in the vulnerable population and has synergistic effects with the other interventions. Our model predicts that a combination of all simulated interventions may reduce mortality by more than 90% and delay an outbreak’s peak by almost 2 months. Our results highlight the potential for non-medical interventions to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. Similar measures may be applicable to controlling COVID-19 in other informal settlements, particularly IDP camps in conflict regions, around the world.","Pascual-García, Alberto; Klein, Jordan D; Villers, Jennifer; Campillo-Funollet, Eduard; Sarkis, Chamsy",BMJ Glob Health,433,17

Although diagnostic criteria for SARS have been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), simple adoption of the established criteria may lead to overdiagnosis in patients with cancer or to an increase in the risk of spreading SARS within cancer hospitals. METHODS: The authors report their experience with the exclusion and quarantine of patients with cancer during the peak of the SARS epidemic in Beijing, China. The patients included 4 males and 7 females with a median age of 66 years (range, 39–73 years). RESULTS: All 11 patients met the WHO diagnostic criteria for probable SARS. Among those 11 patients with probable SARS, only 1 had confirmed SARS; for the other 10 patients, the possibility of SARS infection was ruled out. CONCLUSIONS: Special attention must be paid to patients with cancer who have symptoms similar to those seen in SARS. Although the WHO diagnostic criteria for SARS should be widely accepted, they are not definite or practical in certain populations.

Similar to the human SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 shares strong sequence homologies with a sarbecovirus circulating in Rhinolophus affinis bats. Because bats are expected to be able to transmit their coronaviruses to intermediate animal hosts that in turn are a source of viruses able to cross species barriers and infect humans (so-called spillover model), the identification of an intermediate animal reservoir was the subject of intense researches. It was claimed that a reptile (Ophiophagus hannah) was the intermediate host. This hypothesis was quickly ruled out and replaced by the pangolin (Manis javanica) hypothesis. Yet, pangolin was also recently exonerated from SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans, leaving other animal species as presumed guilty. Guided by the spillover model, several laboratories investigated in silico the species polymorphism of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to find the best fits with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding site. Following the same strategy, we used multi-sequence alignment, 3-D structure analysis, and electrostatic potential surface generation of ACE2 variants to predict their binding capacity to SARS-CoV-2. We report evidence that such simple in silico investigation is a powerful tool to quickly screen which species are potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. However, possible receptor binding does not necessarily lead to successful replication in host. Therefore, we also discuss here the limitations of these in silico approaches in our quest on the origins of COVID-19 pandemic.","Devaux, Christian A.; Pinault, Lucile; Osman, Ikram Omar; Raoult, Didier",Front Public Health,433,16

It is has resulted in and continues in over a million deaths worldwide and halted medical systems and particularly elective surgeries worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of the initial COVID-19 pandemic months on orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia. METHODS: The study surveyed (June until August 2020) 187 orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia affiliated with the University of British Columbia or the British Columbia Orthopaedic Association using an online survey to help identify the impact of COVID-19 on patient care, work and personal life. RESULTS: Eighty-seven out of 187 (46.5%) orthopaedic surgeons participated in the online survey. All types of surgeries were completely cancelled for 23 respondents. Elective surgeries were cancelled for most respondents (in-hospital n = 38 and/or ambulatory n = 32). Trauma cases were reduced according to 35 respondents. Outpatient clinics were stopped initially and transferred in virtual clinics (telemedicine). Approximately 40% of respondents were afraid of infecting others (patients, family) and 25% admitted to drink more heavily. Ninety percent of respondents reported an income loss of > 15% (range 0–100%). CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic surgeons and their patients have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Cancellation of surgeries has created an increased backlog of 32,400 orthopaedic surgeries in British Columbia. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the implementation of telemedicine, which will be a long-lasting benefit in providing healthcare.","Simon, Maciej J.

Design: A prospective descriptive study was carried out. Setting: Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of Istanbul Medeniyet University, Goztepe Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. Patients: A total of 115 patients hospitalized in the PICU were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Children with underlying comorbidities and those who did not require mechanical ventilation were excluded. Main variables of interest: Demographic, clinical, laboratory test and radiographic data were recorded. Results: A total of 63 patients were eligible for the study. The most common diagnosis was bronchiolitis (57.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent causal virus (36.5%). The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (28.6%). Multiple viral infection was identified in 20.6% of the patients, the most common in this subgroup being rhinovirus. Patients with bocavirus infection had a higher likelihood of needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at presentation. Children who died were likely to be < 12 months old, have ARDS, hepatitis, pneumomediastinum, multiple viral infection, and required IMV support with an increased duration of MV. Additionally, they were found to have a high Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score, Predicted Death Rate and increased need for inotropic support at admission.

Remarkable advances in devices used to record infants' and toddlers' everyday experiences, as well as in repositories to aggregate and share such recordings across teams of theorists, have yielded a potential gold mine of insights to spur next-generation theories of experience-dependent change. Making full use of these advances, however, currently requires manual annotation. Manually annotating many hours of everyday life is a dedicated pursuit requiring significant time and resources, and in many domains is an endeavor currently lacking foundational facts to guide potentially consequential implementation decisions. These realities make manual annotation a frequent barrier to discoveries, as theorists instead opt for narrower scoped activities. Here, we provide theorists with a framework for manually annotating many hours of everyday life designed to reduce both theoretical and practical overwhelm. We share insights based on our team's recent adventures in the previously uncharted territory of everyday music. We identify principles, and share implementation examples and tools, to help theorists achieve scalable solutions to challenges that are especially fierce when annotating extended timescales. These principles for quantifying everyday ecologies will help theorists collectively maximize return on investment in databases of everyday recordings and will enable a broad community of scholars—across institutions, skillsets, experiences, and working environments—to make discoveries about the experiences upon which development may depend.","Mendoza, Jennifer K.; Fausey, Caitlin M.",Front Psychol,433,9

DESIGN: Qualitative study using critical thematic analysis. METHODS: We conducted semi‐structured interviews with 15 community members who were pregnant and/or gave birth and 14 nurses who worked in the perinatal setting between April and August 2020. Participants were recruited via purposive and snowball sampling, and interviews were conducted virtually via the Zoom platform.

CONCLUSIONS: Visitor restriction policies have had a disproportionately harmful effect on BIPOC patients and families, leading some patients to make decisions that increase their physical risks to alleviate their risk of labouring and birthing without desired support. IMPACT: While this pandemic is nearing the end, these results can guide structuring of policy not only for the next pandemic, but also for universal policy development.

Sociodemographic data, presence of comorbidities, food habits, and physical activity (PA) patterns were evaluated. The HRQoL was evaluated according to the SF-36 Health Survey. The multilinear regression analysis was developed to determine the association of variables with HRQoL and its physical and mental health dimensions. Results: The female sex in the three countries reported negative association with HRQoL (Mexico: β −4.45, p = 0.004; Chile: β −8.48, p < 0.001; Spain: β −6.22, p = 0.009). Similarly, bad eating habits were associated negatively with HRQoL (Mexico: β −6.64, p < 0.001; Chile: β −6.66, p = 0.005; Spain: β −5.8, p = 0.032). In Mexico, PA limitations presented a negative association with HRQoL (β −4.71, p = 0.011). In Chile, a sedentary lifestyle (h/day) was linked negatively with HRQoL (β −0.64, p = 0.005). In Spain, the highest associations with HRQoL were the presence of comorbidity (β −11.03, p < 0.001) and smoking (β −6.72, p = 0.02). Moreover, the PA limitation in Mexico (β −5.67, p = 0.023) and Chile (β −9.26, p = 0.035) was linked negatively with mental health. Conclusions: The bad eating habits, PA limitations, female sex, comorbidity presence, and smoking were parameters linked negatively with HRQoL.","Gutiérrez-Pérez, Ilse Adriana; Delgado-Floody, Pedro; Jerez-Mayorga, Daniel; Soto-García, Diego; Caamaño-Navarrete, Felipe; Parra-Rojas, Isela; Molina-Gutiérrez, Nacim; Guzmán-Guzmán, Iris Paola",Int J Environ Res Public Health,433,24

The 148-amino acid nsp10 subunit contains two zinc fingers and is known to interact with both nsp14 and nsp16, stimulating their respective 3′-5′ exoribonuclease and 2′-O-methyltransferase activities. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, in cellulo bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments, and in vitro pulldown assays, we have now identified the key residues on the nsp10 surface that interact with nsp14. The functional consequences of mutations introduced at these positions were first evaluated biochemically by monitoring nsp14 exoribonuclease activity. Disruption of the nsp10-nsp14 interaction abrogated the nsp10-driven activation of the nsp14 exoribonuclease. We further showed that the nsp10 surface interacting with nsp14 overlaps with the surface involved in the nsp10-mediated activation of nsp16 2′-O-methyltransferase activity, suggesting that nsp10 is a major regulator of SARS-CoV replicase function. In line with this notion, reverse genetics experiments supported an essential role of the nsp10 surface that interacts with nsp14 in SARS-CoV replication, as several mutations that abolished the interaction in vitro yielded a replication-negative viral phenotype. In contrast, mutants in which the nsp10-nsp16 interaction was disturbed proved to be crippled but viable. These experiments imply that the nsp10 surface that interacts with nsp14 and nsp16 and possibly other subunits of the viral replication complex may be a target for the development of antiviral compounds against pathogenic coronaviruses.","Bouvet, Mickaël; Lugari, Adrien; Posthuma, Clara C.; Zevenhoven, Jessika C.; Bernard, Stéphanie; Betzi, Stéphane; Imbert, Isabelle; Canard, Bruno; Guillemot, Jean-Claude; Lécine, Patrick; Pfefferle, Susanne; Drosten, Christian; Snijder, Eric J.; Decroly, Etienne; Morelli, Xavier",Journal of Biological Chemistry,433,30

The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has also enjoyed widespread adoption, mostly for its ability to add “sensing” and “actuation” capabilities to existing CPS infrastructures. However, attention must be paid to the impact of IoT protocols on the dependability of CPS infrastructures. We address the issues of CPS dependability by using an epidemic model of the underlying dynamics within the CPS’ IoT subsystem (CPS-IoT) and an interference-aware routing reconfiguration. These help to efficiently monitor CPS infrastructure—avoiding routing oscillation, while improving its safety. The contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, a CPS orchestration model is proposed that relies upon: (i) Inbound surveillance and outbound actuation to improve dependability and (ii) a novel information diffusion model that uses epidemic states and diffusion sets to produce diffusion patterns across the CPS-IoT. Secondly, the proposed CPS orchestration model is numerically analysed to show its dependability for both sensitive and non-sensitive applications. Finally, a novel interference-aware clustering protocol called “INMP”, which enables network reconfiguration through migration of nodes across clusters, is proposed. It is then bench-marked against prominent IoT protocols to assess its impact on the dependability of the CPS.","Bagula, Antoine; Ajayi, Olasupo; Maluleke, Hloniphani",Sensors (Basel),433,11

While initially preparing for a period of time, where it would likely be impossible to supervise trials in the usual way and precautionary measures had to be implemented to care for medication supply and general safety of study participants it is now important to consider, how the impact of the pandemic on trial outcome can be assessed, which measures are needed to decide, how to proceed with the trial and what is needed to compensate to irregularity introduced by the pandemic situation. Obviously not all trials will suffer to the same degree: some trials may be close to finalizing recruitment, others may not yet have started. Similarly not all clinical trials investigate vulnerable patient populations, but some will and may in addition have recruited to an extent that beneficial effects achieved in the initial phase of the trial may be outweighed by an increase e.g. in mortality that impacts both treatment groups. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the pandemic reached different countries in the world and even cities in one country at different points in time with different severity. Our example is a randomized and double-blind clinical trial comparing digitoxin and placebo in patients with advanced chronic heart failure. This trial has recruited roughly 1/3 of the overall 2200 patients when the disease outbreak reached Germany. We discuss how simulations and theoretical considerations can be used to address questions about the need to increase the overall sample-size to be recruited to compensate for a potential shrinkage of the treatment effect caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and what role the degree of consistency could play when comparing pre-, during- and post- COVID-19 periods of trial conduct regarding the question, whether the treatment effect can be considered consistent and with this generalizable. This is dependent on the size of the treatment effect and the impact of the pandemic. We argue, that in case of doubt, it may be wise to proceed with the original study plan.","Großhennig, Anika; Koch, Armin",Contemp Clin Trials,433,3

Internet-based interventions have been found to be effective in addressing depressive symptoms, but it is open if this also applies to interventions directed at academic stress. It is also largely unclear if the techniques employed in such programs provide significant additional benefits when controlling for non-specific intervention effects. A sample of N = 200 students with elevated levels of depression (CES-D ≥ 16) of a large distance-learning university were randomly assigned to either an Internet- and App-based stress intervention group (IG; n = 100) or an active control group (CG; n = 100) receiving an Internet-based psychoeducational program of equal length. Self-report data was assessed at baseline, post-treatment (7 weeks) and three-month follow-up. The primary outcome was depression (CES-D) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk factors, and academic outcomes. We found significant between-group effects on depressive symptom severity (d = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.08–0.64), as well as behavioral activation (d = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.30–0.91), perceived stress (d = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18–0.73), anxiety (d = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.03–0.67) and other secondary outcomes post-treatment. Effects on depression were sustained at three-month follow-up. Response rates for depressive symptoms were significantly higher in the IG (26%) than the CG (14%) at post-test (χ(2)=4.5, p = 0.04), but not at three-month follow-up (p = 0.454). We also found significant effects on relevant academic outcomes, including work impairment (follow-up; d = 0.36), work output (post-treatment; d = 0.27) and work cutback (follow-up; d = 0.36). The intervention was more effective for depressive symptoms compared to the CG, and so controlling for unspecific intervention effects. This suggests that specific techniques of the intervention may provide significant additional benefits on depressive symptoms.

In the HHC context, one main challenge faced by service-sharing platforms is the matching of demand with supply, while considering the heterogeneity of care requests and service providers. From a centralized perspective of service-sharing platforms regarding three stakeholders (i.e., platform, caregiver, and customer), different matching strategies are used, including the “self-interested”, “customer-first”, “hard-work-happy-life”, and “social-welfare” strategies. When addressing the matching problem at an operational level, the platforms must comply with various requirements and rules, including break requirements, temporal dependencies, and flexible service durations. In this study, mixed-integer linear programming models and a branch-and-price approach are designed to match demand with supply using different matching strategies while satisfying all of the requirements and rules. The effects of key factors on performance indicators (e.g., platform revenue, caregiver profit, and customer surplus) are examined, and the matching strategies are compared. The results indicate that the “customer-first” and “self-interested” strategies benefit more from flexible service durations, however they are more and less negatively affected by break requirements and temporal dependencies, respectively, as compared to the “social-welfare” and “hard-work-happy-life” strategies. A comparison between the “social-welfare” strategy and the other three strategies indicates that the former strategy is beneficial for all three stakeholders of the service-sharing platforms as well as the government. Another comparison between the service-sharing platforms and traditional HHC institutions indicates the sharing economy has a positive impact on caregiver profit and customer surplus.","Lin, Meiyan; Ma, Lijun; Ying, Chengshuo",Transp Res E Logist Transp Rev,433,20

We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital. Methods Patient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad. Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders. We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV. Findings Initial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea. Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Both patients developed acute renal failure. MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22·9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22·5 for upE and 23·9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive. The two patients shared the same room for 3 days. The incubation period was estimated at 9–12 days for the second case. No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected. Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure. Interpretation Patients with respiratory symptoms returning from the Middle East or exposed to a confirmed case should be isolated and investigated for MERS-CoV with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed incubation period of 12 days. Immunosuppression should also be taken into account as a risk factor.

The incidence of asthma has increased dramatically during this time period, with the highest increases in the urban areas of developed countries. It seems that the incidence in developing countries may follow this trend as well. While our knowledge of the pathophysiology of asthma and the available of newer, safer medication have both improved, the mortality of the disease has undergone an overall increase in the past 30 years. Asthma treatment goals in children include decreasing mortality and improving quality of life. Specific treatment goals include but are not limited to decreasing inflammation, improving lung function, decreasing clinical symptoms, reducing hospital stays and emergency department visits, reducing work or school absences, and reducing the need for rescue medications. Non-pharmacological management strategies include allergen avoidance, environmental evaluation for allergens and irritants, patient education, allergy testing, regular monitoring of lung function, and the use of asthma management plans, asthma control tests, peak flow meters, and asthma diaries. Achieving asthma treatment goals reduces direct and indirect costs of asthma and is economically cost-effective. Treatment in children presents unique challenges in diagnosis and management.

The aim of this study was to explore the ways in which that first wave of novel coronavirus infections resulted in uncertainties, as experienced by members of the oral health care workforce in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: This qualitative inquiry purposefully recruited frontline oral health care workers, including dentists, dental hygienists, certified dental assistants, and administrative staff, via remote semi-structured interviews between April 20 and May 4, 2020. Coding, categories, and themes were inductively assigned. RESULTS: A total of 45 interviews, lasting between 39 and 74 minutes each, were conducted involving 18 dentists (6 females), 12 dental hygienists (11 females), 6 certified dental assistants (all females), and 9 administrators/front-desk staff (7 females). Fifty-one hours of audio recordings and more than 650 single-spaced pages of transcripts were produced. Five main themes emerged pertaining to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, patient care, personal lives and infectiousness, concern for the future, and variations among different pandemics. Certitudes were less evident, but surfaced mostly when considering a potential new normal resulting from the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Participants indicated that the uncertainties they felt were dependent upon what is known, and unknown, about the pandemic and the provision of oral health care during the first wave of infections. Future studies are needed to include the viewpoints of oral health care workers from other provinces, as well the perceptions of patients who received oral health care during the height of the first wave of the pandemic.","Brondani, Mario; Almeida, Fernanda; Cua, Denise; Maragha, Tala; Mathu-Muju, Kavita; Shayanfar, Melody; von Bergmann, HsingChi; Donnelly, Leeann",PLoS One,433,0
