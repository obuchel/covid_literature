3249,Social Support Moderates Effects of Natural Disaster Exposure on Depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms: Effects for Displaced and Nondisplaced Residents,2018-04-05,"Social support is a known protective factor against the negative psychological impact of natural disasters. Most past research has examined how the effects of exposure to traumatic events influences whether someone meets diagnostic criteria for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); it has also suggested sequelae of disaster exposure depends on whether survivors are displaced from their homes. To capture the full range of the psychological impact of natural disasters, we examined the buffering effects of social support on depressive symptoms and cluster‐specific PTSD symptoms, with consideration of displacement status. In a survey conducted 18 to 24 months after Hurricane Katrina, 810 adults exposed to the disaster reported the number of Katrina‐related traumatic events experienced, perceived social support 2 months post‐Katrina, and cluster‐specific PTSD and depressive symptoms experienced since Katrina. Analyses assessed the moderating effects of social support and displacement and the conditional effects of displacement status. Social support significantly buffered the negative effect of Katrina‐related traumatic events on depressive symptoms, B = −0.10, p = .001, and avoidance and arousal PTSD symptoms, B = −0.02, p = .035 and B = −0.02, p = .042, respectively. Three‐way interactions were nonsignificant. Conditional effects indicated social support buffered development of depressive symptoms across all residents; however, the moderating effects of support on avoidance and arousal symptoms only appeared significant for nondisplaced residents. Results highlight the protective effects of disaster‐related social support among nondisplaced individuals, and suggest displaced individuals may require more formal supports for PTSD symptom reduction following a natural disaster.","McGuire, Adam P.; Gauthier, Jami M.; Anderson, Lisa M.; Hollingsworth, David W.; Tracy, Melissa; Galea, Sandro; Coffey, Scott F.",J Trauma Stress,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6020825/,397
10322,Oral Presentation Sessions,2017-10-13,"Abstract: Although several major immunologic hurdles need to be overcome, the pig is currently considered the most likely source animal of cells, tissues and organs for transplantation into humans. Concerns have been raised with regard to the potential for the transfer of infectious agents with the transplanted organ to the human recipient. This risk is perceived to be increased as it is likely that the patient will be iatrogenically immunocompromised and the organ‐source pig may be genetically engineered in such a way to render its organs particularly susceptible to infection with human viruses. Furthermore, the risk may not be restricted to the recipient, but may have consequences for the health of others in the community. The identification of porcine endogenous retroviruses and of hitherto unknown viruses have given rise to the most concern. We document here the agents we believe should be excluded from the organ‐source pigs. We discuss the likelihood of achieving this aim and outline the potential means by which it may best be achieved.","Onions, D.; Cooper, D. K. C.; Alexander, T. J.

12532,"The Current State of Research, Challenges, and Future Research Directions of Blockchain Technology in Patient Care: Systematic Review",2020-07-20,"During mammalian embryogenesis, differential gene expression gradually builds the identity and complexity of each tissue and organ system(1). Here we systematically quantified mouse polyA-RNA from day 10.5 of embryonic development to birth, sampling 17 tissues and organs. The resulting developmental transcriptome is globally structured by dynamic cytodifferentiation, body-axis and cell-proliferation gene sets that were further characterized by the transcription factor motif codes of their promoters. We decomposed the tissue-level transcriptome using single-cell RNA-seq (sequencing of RNA reverse transcribed into cDNA) and found that neurogenesis and haematopoiesis dominate at both the gene and cellular levels, jointly accounting for one-third of differential gene expression and more than 40% of identified cell types. By integrating promoter sequence motifs with companion ENCODE epigenomic profiles, we identified a prominent promoter de-repression mechanism in neuronal expression clusters that was attributable to known and novel repressors. Focusing on the developing limb, single-cell RNA data identified 25 candidate cell types that included progenitor and differentiating states with computationally inferred lineage relationships. We extracted cell-type transcription factor networks and complementary sets of candidate enhancer elements by using single-cell RNA-seq to decompose integrative cis-element (IDEAS) models that were derived from whole-tissue epigenome chromatin data. These ENCODE reference data, computed network components and IDEAS chromatin segmentations are companion resources to the matching epigenomic developmental matrix, and are available for researchers to further mine and integrate.","He, Peng; Williams, Brian A.; Trout, Diane; Marinov, Georgi K.; Amrhein, Henry; Berghella, Libera; Goh, Say-Tar; Plajzer-Frick, Ingrid; Afzal, Veena; Pennacchio, Len A.; Dickel, Diane E.; Visel, Axel; Ren, Bing; Hardison, Ross C.; Zhang, Yu; Wold, Barbara J.",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7410830/,397
12977,Improved RIDIT statistic approach provides more intuitive and informative interpretation of EQ-5D data,2020-08-21,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of healthcare-acquired infections (HAI) and rising levels of antimicrobial resistance places significant economic and public health burdens on modern healthcare systems. A group of highly drug resistant pathogens known as the ESKAPE pathogens, along with C. difficile, are the leading causes of HAIs. Interactions between patients, healthcare workers, and environmental conditions impact disease transmission. Studying pathogen transfer under varying contact scenarios in a controlled manner is critical for understanding transmission and disinfectant strategies. In lieu of human subject research, this method has the potential to contribute to modeling the routes of pathogen transmission in healthcare settings. METHODS: To overcome these challenges, we have developed a method that utilizes a synthetic skin surrogate to model both direct (skin-to-skin) and indirect (skin-to fomite-to skin) pathogen transfer between infected patients and healthy healthcare workers. This surrogate material includes a background microbiome community simulating typical human skin flora to more accurately mimic the effects of natural flora during transmission events. RESULTS: We demonstrate the ability to modulate individual bacterial concentrations within this microbial community to mimic bacterial concentrations previously reported on the hands of human subjects. We also explore the effect of various decontamination approaches on pathogen transfer between human subjects, such as the use of handwashing or surface disinfectants. Using this method, we identify a potential outlier, S. aureus, that may persist and retain viability in specific transfer conditions better than the overall microbial community during decontamination events. CONCLUSIONS: Our work describes the development of an in vitro method that uses a synthetic skin surrogate with a defined background microbiota to simulate skin-to-skin and skin-to fomite-to skin contact scenarios. These results illustrate the value of simulating a holistic microbial community for transfer studies by elucidating differences in different pathogen transmission rates and resistance to common decontamination practices. We believe this method will contribute to improvements in pathogen transmission modeling in healthcare settings and increase our ability to assess the risk associated with HAIs, although additional research is required to establish the degree of correlation of pathogen transmission by skin or synthetic alternatives.","Weber, Katharina L.; LeSassier, Danielle S.; Kappell, Anthony D.; Schulte, Kathleen Q.; Westfall, Nicole; Albright, Nicolette C.; Godbold, Gene D.; Palsikar, Veena; Acevedo, Carlos A.; Ternus, Krista L.; Hewitt, F.

14296,A Smartphone-Based Technique to Detect Dynamic User Preferences for Tailoring Behavioral Interventions: Observational Utility Study of Ecological Daily Needs Assessment,2020-11-13,"Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIMs) have been studied within the framework of autoimmune diseases where skeletal muscle appears to have a passive role in the illness. However, persiting weakness even after resolving inflammation raises questions about the role that skeletal muscle plays by itself in these diseases. ""Non-immune mediated"" hypotheses have arisen to consider inner skeletal muscle cell processes as trigger factors in the clinical manifestations of IIMs. Alterations in oxidative phosphorylation, ATP production, calcium handling, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, among others, have been proposed as alternative cellular pathophysiological mechanisms. In this study, we used skeletal muscle-derived cells, from healthy controls and IIM patients to determine mitochondrial function and mitochondrial ability to adapt to a metabolic stress when deprived of glucose. We hypothesized that mitochondria would be dysfunctional in IIM samples, which was partially true in normal glucose rich growing medium as determined by oxygen consumption rate. However, in the glucose-free and galactose supplemented condition, a medium that forced mitochondria to function, IIM cells increased their respiration, reaching values matching normal derived cells. Unexpectedly, cell death significantly increased in IIM cells under this condition. Our findings show that mitochondria in IIM is functional and the decrease respiration observed is part of an adaptative response to improve survival. The increased metabolic function obtained after forcing IIM cells to rely on mitochondrial synthesized ATP is detrimental to the cell’s viability. Thus, therapeutic interventions that activate mitochondria, could be detrimental in IIM cell physiology, and must be avoided in patients with IIM.","Basualto-Alarcón, Carla; Urra, Félix A.; Bozán, María Francisca; Jaña, Fabián; Trangulao, Alejandra; Bevilacqua, Jorge A.; Cárdenas, J.

Invasions are often dominated by one or a small number of genotypes, yet the underlying factors driving invasions are poorly understood. The chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica first decimated the North American chestnut, and a more recent outbreak threatens European chestnut stands. To unravel the chestnut blight invasion of southeastern Europe, we sequenced 230 genomes of predominantly European strains. Genotypes outside of the invasion zone showed high levels of diversity with evidence for frequent and ongoing recombination. The invasive lineage emerged from the highly diverse European genotype pool rather than a secondary introduction from Asia or North America. The expansion across southeastern Europe was mostly clonal and is dominated by a single mating type, suggesting a fitness advantage of asexual reproduction. Our findings show how an intermediary, highly diverse bridgehead population gave rise to an invasive, largely clonally expanding pathogen.","Stauber, Lea; Badet, Thomas; Feurtey, Alice; Prospero, Simone; Croll, Daniel",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7935491/,397

Intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) are needle-free, mimic the natural route of infection, and elicit robust immunity. However, some LAIVs require reconstitution and cold-chain requirements restrict storage and distribution of all influenza vaccines. We generated a dry-powder, thermostable LAIV (T-LAIV) using Preservation by Vaporization technology and assessed the stability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of T-LAIV alone or combined with delta inulin adjuvant (Advax™) in ferrets. Stability assays demonstrated minimal loss of T-LAIV titer when stored at 25 °C for 1 year. Vaccination of ferrets with T-LAIV alone or with delta inulin adjuvant elicited mucosal antibody and robust serum HI responses in ferrets, and was protective against homologous challenge. These results suggest that the Preservation by Vaporization-generated dry-powder vaccines could be distributed without refrigeration and administered without reconstitution or injection. Given these significant advantages for vaccine distribution and delivery, further research is warranted.","Luczo, Jasmina M.; Bousse, Tatiana; Johnson, Scott K.; Jones, Cheryl A.; Pearce, Nicholas; Neiswanger, Carlie A.; Wang, Min-Xuan; Miller, Erin A.; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Wentworth, David E.; Bronshtein, Victor; Papania, Mark; Tompkins, Stephen M.",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060263/,397

Every year 1.2 million people die due to this exposure. Second-hand smoke is also related to various other diseases like cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, low birth weight, maternal depression, etc. The purpose of this review is to look over various studies and to gain an understanding of existing research about second-hand smoke and its adverse effects. In addition, we tried to identify the barriers behind creating a smoke-free environment at home and successful strategies employed and suggestion given in various studies. A comprehensive search of the recent literature related to Second-hand smoke was undertaken using electronic databases like MEDLINE, PUBMED, Google Scholar, and Research gate. Keyword searches were conducted for publications published since 2004 or later on Second-hand smoke exposure in pregnant women. Prevalence of SHS among pregnant women ranged from 24% 92%. Lack of knowledge, absence of comprehensive smoking ban, low status of women was among the main contributing factors. Community awareness and counseling by primary health-care physician was found to be successful strategies. There are various cultural and social barriers behind a smoke-free home for pregnant women. Interventional approaches like focused counseling by primary care physicians can help to overcome this issue. There is a need for behavioral interventions and community awareness to be done in this aspect.","Sharma, Twinkle; Khapre, Meenakshi",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8208198/,397

However, research on the use of exposure therapy in clinical practice has presented mixed results, potentially due to differences in samples and training programs across countries. The present study aimed to extend upon existing research by examining the use and predictors of use of exposure therapy in a sample of psychologists working in clinical practice in Australia who treat clients with an anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: One hundred registered psychologists (M(age) = 40.60; SD = 10.78; range 23 to 71 years; 84% female) participated in an online study investigating their clinical practices. RESULTS: Results suggested that while the general use of exposure therapy is high, the use of disorder specific techniques was considerably lower, particularly for anxiety disorders and PTSD but not OCD. Psychology registration status and level of training were positively associated with use of exposure therapy as was the experience in treating anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that further or ongoing professional training may be required to optimize the use of disorder specific techniques.

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate these strategies by displacing female camels equipped with GPS trackers 6 km away from home to totally unfamiliar locations. The experiments comprised displacing nursing or non-nursing female camels 6 km from their living pens to an unfamiliar release site. Some camels were taken to the release site on foot, others were hauled on a truck, both during daytime and nighttime. Displacements journeys were either in a straight direction to the release points, or they consisted of a convoluted path. As a result, camels that had straight outward journeys were able to return home efficiently and rather directly, but camels that had convoluted trips to the release point failed to do so. Moreover, impairing olfactory, visual, and auditory inputs by using mouth/nose muzzles, eye covers and headphones did not affect homing ability. Based on these experiments the most likely hypothesis is that during their small-scale round trips the camels relied on path integration, and that this strategy is disrupted when the camels were subjected to disorientation procedures before release.","Alyan, Sofyan H.",Biol Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8353260/,397
20258,Health-related quality of life in a general population sample in Kazakhstan and its sociodemographic and occupational determinants,2021-08-21,"PURPOSE: Secondary lung cancer (SLC) can offset the benefit of adjuvant breast radiotherapy (RT), and risks compound sharply after 25 to 30 years. We hypothesized that SLC risk is mainly an issue for early-stage breast cancer, and that lives could be saved using different RT techniques. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The SEER database was used to extract breast patient age, stage survival, and radiotherapy utilization over time and per stage and to assess the factors associated with increased SLC risk with a multivariable competing risk Cox model. The number of SLC was calculated using the BEIR model modified with patient survival, age, and use of RT from the SEER database. Stage distribution and number of new breast cancer cases were obtained from the NAACCR. Mean lung dose for various irradiation techniques was obtained from measurement or literature. RESULTS: Out of the 765,697 non-metastatic breast cancers in the SEER database from 1988 to 2012, 49.8% received RT. RT significantly increased the SLC risk for longer follow-up (HR=1.58), early stage including DCIS, stage I and IIA (HR = 1.11), and younger age (HR=1.061) (all p<0.001). More advanced stages did not have significantly increased risk. In 2019, 104,743 early-stage breast patients received radiotherapy, and an estimated 3,413 will develop SLC (3.25%) leading to an excess of 2,900 deaths (2.77%). VMAT would reduce this mortality by 9.9%, hypofractionation 26 Gy in five fractions by 38.8%, a prone technique by 70.3%, 3D-CRT APBI by 43.3%, HDR brachytherapy by 71.1%, LDR by 80.7%, and robotic 4π APBI by 85.2%. CONCLUSIONS: SLC after breast RT remains a clinically significant issue for early-stage breast cancers.

A Qualitative Study Exploring Substance Use and Risk Factors Among the Youth of Jimma Town, Southwest Ethiopia",2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Non-prescription antibiotic use at community is a main driver of antimicrobial resistance. Cough is a common condition and prevalent in all townships, including China. This study aims to investigate the non-prescription antibiotic use for cough in China and explore to which extent antibiotic use knowledge was correctly instructed in communities. METHODS: A probability-proportionate-to-size sampling method was adopted to survey from all 14 townships in Yiwu city, China. All participants were investigated by face-to-face interview on Portable Android Devices. The continuous variables were presented by mean and standard deviation or medium and inter-quartile range (IQR). The categorical variables were presented using percentage or constituent ratio. Chi-square test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis were conducted to assess the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 3034 respondents across all the 14 townships and the 50 natural villages/streets completed all key items of the questionnaire. Of 2400 (79.10%) respondents stated that they experienced cough in the past 12 months with the medium age of 36.5 (IQR: 26–49) and 12.21% (293/2400) respondents had the non-prescription antibiotic use behavior. Among those 293 respondents, the proportion of non-prescription antibiotic use for cough peaked at around 16% among people aged 30–39 years old. The major sources of antibiotics were pharmacy (77.70%) and/or family storage (43.92%). CONCLUSIONS: Non-prescription antibiotics use for cough is prevalent in the community, especially among people in their thirties. Strengthened drug purchase regulation and well-trained professional pharmacists would be promising alternatives to ameliorate AMR.

This continuous monitoring generates insights on the sexual and reproductive health of young people in Germany. The survey provides an important basis for the development of sexuality education and family planning measures. AIM: The current sexual and contraceptive behavior of adolescents and young adults will be summarized using initial descriptive results from the ninth iteration of the survey. METHODS: A total of N = 6032 adolescents and young adults participated in the survey. Data collection was conducted by computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) in 2019. RESULTS: A key finding of this iteration is that with regards to the age of the first sexual intercourse, the proportion of adolescents younger than 17 years has been declining for several years. For contraception, adolescents most frequently used condoms, and use of the pill has decreased. DISCUSSION: The data from the current iteration indicate safe and responsible contraceptive behavior among young people in Germany. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain the commitment in the field of sexual health promotion and expand prevention measures for specific target groups.

We describe the long-term patterns of paediatric disease associated with three of these viruses, HCoV-NL63, OC43 and 229E, in coastal Kenya. Methods: Continuous surveillance of pneumonia admissions was conducted at the Kilifi county hospital (KCH) located in the northern coastal region of Kenya. Children aged <5 years admitted to KCH with clinically defined syndromic severe or very severe pneumonia were recruited. Respiratory samples were taken and tested for 15 virus targets, using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Unadjusted odds ratios were used to estimate the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and HCoV positivity. Results: From 2007 to 2019, we observed 11,445 pneumonia admissions, of which 314 (3.9%) tested positive for at least one of the HCoV types surveyed in the study. There were 129 (41.1%) OC43, 99 (31.5%) 229E, 74 (23.6%) NL63 positive cases and 12 (3.8%) cases of HCoV to HCoV coinfection. Among HCoV positive cases, 47% (n=147) were coinfected with other respiratory virus pathogens. The majority of HCoV cases were among children aged <1 year (66%, n=208), though there was was no change in the proportion infected by age. HCoV-OC43 was predominant of the three HCoV types throughout the surveillance period. Evidence for seasonality was not identified. Conclusions: Overall, 4% of paediatric pneumonia admissions were associated with three endemic HCoVs, with a high proportion of cases co-occurring with another respiratory virus, no clear seasonal pattern, and with the age-distribution of cases following that of pneumonia admissions (i.e. highest in infants). These observations suggest, at most, a small severe disease contribution of endemic HCoVs in this tropical setting and offer insight into their potential future burden and epidemiological characteristics.","Otieno, Grieven P.; Murunga, Nickson; Agoti, Charles N.; Gallagher, Katherine E.; Awori, Juliet O.; Nokes, D.

43262,Addressing the relationship between perceived fear of COVID-19 virus infection and emergence of burnout symptoms in a sample of Egyptian physicians during COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study,2020-12-17,"BACKGROUND: Direct agglutination test (DAT) as a simple, accurate and reliable method, has been widely used for serodiagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) during the last three decades. The present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of DAT for serodiagnosis of human VL. METHODS: Electronic databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), SCOPUS, Web of Science, SID and Mag Iran (two Persian scientific search engines) were searched from December 2004 to April 2019. We determined the pooled sensitivity and specificity rates of DAT for the diagnosis of human VL, calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), and constructed summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves parameters across the eligible studies. RESULTS: Of the 2928 records identified in the mentioned electronic databases and after examining reference lists of articles, 24 articles met inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the systematic review and out of them 20 records qualified for meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity rates of DAT was 96% [95% CI, 92–98] and 95% [CI95% 86–99], respectively. The likelihood ratio of a positive test (LR+) was found to be 21 [CI95%, 6.6–66.5] and the likelihood ratio of a negative test (LR−) was found to be 0.04 [(CI95%, 0.02–0.08]. The combined estimate of the diagnostic odds ratio for DAT was high [467 (CI95%, 114–1912]). We found that the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) is positioned near the upper left corner of the curve and the area under curve (AUC) was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.97 to 0.99). CONCLUSION: Referring to our analysis, we determined that DAT can be considered as a valuable tool for the serodiagnosis of human VL with high sensitivity and specificity. As DAT is a simple, accurate and efficient serological test, it can be recommended for serodiagnosis of human VL particularly in endemic areas.","Mohebali, Mehdi; Keshavarz, Hossein; Shirmohammad, Sedigheh; Akhoundi, Behnaz; Borjian, Alireza; Hassanpour, Gholamreza; Mamishi, Setareh; Mahmoudi, Shima",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7729288/,397

These are traditionally implemented imperatively, using shared mutable state and callbacks. This is efficient, but is also difficult to reason about and error prone. Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) provides an elegant alternative which allows GUIs to be designed in a declarative fashion. However, most FRP languages are synchronous and continually check for new data. This means that an FRP-style GUI will “wake up” on each program cycle. This is problematic for applications like text editors and browsers, where often nothing happens for extended periods of time, and we want the implementation to sleep until new data arrives. In this paper, we present an asynchronous FRP language for designing GUIs called [Formula: see text] . Our language provides a novel semantics for widgets, the building block of GUIs, which offers both a natural Curry–Howard logical interpretation and an efficient implementation strategy.","Graulund, Christian Uldal; Szamozvancev, Dmitrij; Krishnaswami, Neel",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984123/,397
51924,P43 Did COVID-19 Pandemic change Anaesthesia Practices in India: A Multi-centre Cross-sectional Study,2021-04-08,"Recent advances in the field of digital technology have enabled the expansion of the business market to a new level. Digital business markets encompass eminent features like increased transparency, enhanced customer relationship, flexible business targets, customer participation, etc. It aids in enhancing traditional business quality by bridging the relationship between the suppliers and the customers. The massive development of internet technology in recent years has largely contributed to the emergence of digital business. The digitization of the business world helps small and medium enterprises create a new digital network, which allows overcoming large enterprises' dominance. Since small and medium enterprises play a major role in determining a country's economy, the digital market's emergence and development are very important. The self-organizing capability of the digital market is the main advantage for newly emerging enterprises. Recently, the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in customers' migration from offline shopping to the online market. These changing business models mandate the need for policies and control mechanisms. Using these policies, digital business projects are developed using an open environment using which the small and medium enterprises can interact with each other. These policies and control mechanisms outline the rules to be followed to avoid the current digital market issues. These policies must be designed to improve and ensure the welfare of future digital business systems. Thus, this paper aims to explore the policies associated with regulating and promoting the digital business economy.","Zhou, Xuesong; Chen, Zhengyang; Zhan, Xiang; BalaMurugan, S.; Thilak, K.

52083,Telepsychotherapie als Chance und Herausforderung: Eine longitudinale Mixed-Methods Studie,2021-04-27,"INTRODUCTION: Not all causes of vitamin B12 deficiency require intramuscular hydroxocobalamin (IMH). NICE guidance states that diet-related deficiency can be treated orally, but pernicious anaemia must be excluded via anti-intrinsic factor antibodies (anti-IFAB). Our aim was to audit the management of B12 deficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic when reducing footfall is vital. Then, implement staff education strategies to improve adherence to guidance. METHODS: Data for patients who received IMH from March-June 2020 was retrospectively analysed for: full blood count (FBC), B12, folate and anti-IFAB levels. These patients were sent letters to have blood tests for the missing investigations. Results were presented at meetings and flowchart-posters were distributed. Audit was closed with prospective data for patients who requested IMH from September-October 2020. RESULTS: From 46 patients identified, 82.6% had B12 and folate checked prior to therapy commencement, but 23.7% had an untreated folate deficiency. 79.3% of patients receiving IMH had never been tested for anti-IFAB; none of those tested were positive. A lack of awareness of the NICE guidance was identified as a key cause for non-adherence. Following the intervention, all 34 patients were appropriately investigated. Out of these, 8.8% had positive anti-IFAB levels and following a review of their clinical histories, all patients were commenced on appropriate therapy. DISCUSSION: IMH can have great benefit; but it is invasive, has financial and nursing-time implications, and increases the risk of contagion via footfall in the practice. Thus, this multi-cycle audit shows that appropriate investigations prior to commencing therapy is key.","Desai, Chaitya; Machado, Beno; Kumar, Sanjay; Desai, Chaitya",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030162/,397

Being the largest tertiary care health facility under Delhi Government, our center was designated as a 2000 bedded dedicated COVID hospital. In addition to establishing areas for COVID management, COVID Obstetrics and Gynecology area requires a dedicated set up for delivering women, an operating room, and a neonatal care unit. A phased evacuation plan begins by curtailing non-emergency services and postponing elective surgeries, this process may take longer for obstetrics than other specialties on account of labor and postnatal care. The percentage reduction in the number of elective obstetric and gynecological surgeries was 73% and further fell by 98% (n = 4; category C, D) over a period of 1 month of the evacuation phase, whereas the reduction in emergency cases was only 15% (n = 200) in the beginning and fell to 89%. During the surge phase of COVID, we were able to increase the inpatient surge capacity by 8% (n = 100) as the bed occupancy increased exponentially from 30% to 88%. The start of evacuation of the facility until the endpoint of the surge marks the most dynamic phase of establishing a COVID facility during a pandemic. Pre-event planning for surge capacity at the inception of such pandemics should be based on the local and regional policies which depend on the competing demands of resources to maintain sustainability. These logistical demands are dynamic and vary as the pandemic progresses through its phases.","Dhiman, Niharika; Sethi, Chetna Arvind; Gupta, Sangeeta; Agarwal, Krishna; Pandey, Nalini Bala; Rathore, Asmita Muthal",Indian J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8219021/,397

We analyzed the cytotoxic effect of piperine combined with cisplatin compound in the human MCF-7 breast cancer cell line and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: The present in vitro study was performed on MCF-7 cell line in Jahrom University of Medical Sciences between, Jahrom, Iran from 2016 to 2017. Cultured MCF-7 cells were seeded into four groups: a control group (untreated group), a group treated with cisplatin, a group treated with piperine and a group treated with cisplatin and piperine. Cell viability was analyzed using the MTT assay method. Flow c-ytometric analysis was investigated for apoptosis. The mRNA and protein expression of the apoptotic regulators p53, Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3 and caspase 9 were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting analysis. RESULTS: Piperine (20 and 30 μM) in combination with cisplatin (5, 10 and 15 μM) for 24 h synergistically inhibited cell viability of MCF-7 breast cancer cells more than piperine and cisplatin used alone. Synergistic anti-breast cancer activities cisplatin (5 μM) and piperine (20 μM) were via inducing apoptosis. Piperine (20 μM) and cisplatin (5 μM) for 24 h induce apoptosis strongly through reduction of Bcl-2 and increase of caspase 3, p53, caspase 9, and Bax. CONCLUSION: Piperine in combination with cisplatin could trigger p53-mediated apoptosis more effective than cisplatin alone in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, reducing the toxic dose of cisplatin used in cancer chemotherapy.","Fattah, Abolfazl; Morovati, Ali; Niknam, Zahra; Mashouri, Ladan; Asadi, Amirhooman; Rizi, Shirin Tvangar; Abbasi, Mojtaba; Shakeri, Fatemeh; Abazari, Omid",Iran J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8223570/,397
56068,"Editorial: Violence and the Young: A Public Health Problem - Etiology, Epidemiology, Intervention, and Prevention",2021-07-09,"China launched an ambitious strategy known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013 with an objective to promote regional economic growth and integration. The initiative was implemented primarily through massive investment in transportation infrastructure development among the Belt and Road countries to improve transportation connectivity and reduce trade costs. While such a strategy has been implemented for more than seven years, it remains unclear to what extent the investment of transportation infrastructure has affected the regional economic performance in various countries. To clarify this question, this study provides an in-depth assessment of BRI investment in transportation infrastructure using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Different from previous studies, the regional economic impact was evaluated through CGE simulations based on the actual investment data obtained from various sources. In addition, both the change of intraregional and interregional trade costs as a result of BRI transportation infrastructure investment was estimated. The results show that the transportation infrastructure investment in BRI has generated different impacts among regions. In particular, China, Central and West Asian countries have gained significant growth in GDP, employment, and economic welfare, whereas the economic impact of transportation infrastructure investment in the Central and West Europe is relatively minor. Overall, the research findings provide important policy implications for future transportation infrastructure investment in BRI countries and beyond.","Chen, Zhenhua; Li, Xinmeng",Asia Eur J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8290391/,397

TuMV infection led to the amalgamation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, COPII coatamers, and chloroplasts into a perinuclear globular structure that also contained viral proteins. One consequence of TuMV infection was that protein secretion was blocked at the ER-Golgi interface. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments indicated that the perinuclear structure cannot be restocked in viral components but was dynamically connected to the bulk of the Golgi apparatus and the ER. Experiments with 6K(2) fused to photoactivable green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed that production of motile peripheral 6K(2) vesicles was functionally linked to the perinuclear structure. Disruption of the early secretory pathway did not prevent the formation of the perinuclear globular structure, enhanced the clustering of peripheral 6K(2) vesicles with COPII coatamers, and led to inhibition of cell-to-cell virus movement. This suggests that a functional secretory pathway is not required for the formation of the TuMV perinuclear globular structure and peripheral vesicles but is needed for successful viral intercellular propagation.","Grangeon, Romain; Agbeci, Maxime; Chen, Jun; Grondin, Gilles; Zheng, Huanquan; Laliberté, Jean-François",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01146-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22718813/,397

Proteases and antiproteases are secreted from the respiratory epithelium and are involved in respiratory homeostasis. Modifications to the protease/antiprotease balance can lead to the development of lung diseases such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, altered protease/antiprotease balance, in favor for increased protease activity, is associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections such as influenza virus. However, nutritional antioxidants induce antiprotease expression/secretion and decrease protease expression/activity, to protect against viral infection. As such, this review will elucidate the impact of this balance in the context of respiratory viral infection and lung disease, to further highlight the role epithelial cell-derived proteases and antiproteases contribute to respiratory immune function. Furthermore, this review will offer the use of nutritional antioxidants as possible therapeutics to boost respiratory mucosal responses and/or protect against infection.","Meyer, Megan; Jaspers, Ilona",American journal of physiology.

The reality is that the U.S. is ill equipped to realize health equity in prevention and control efforts for any type of health outcome, including an infectious disease pandemic. In this article, we address an important question: When new waves of the current pandemic emerge or another novel pandemic emerges, how can the U.S. be better prepared and also ensure a rapid response that reduces rather than exacerbates social and health inequities? We argue for a health equity framework to pandemic preparedness, grounded in meaningful community engagement that, while recognizing the fundamental causes of social and health inequity, has a clear focus on upstream and midstream preparedness and downstream rapid response efforts that put social and health equity at the forefront.","Alberti, Philip M; Lantz, Paula M; Wilkins, Consuelo H","Journal of health politics, policy and law",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-8641469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32464654/,397

Data on the efficacy and safety of VR are variable and there are few predictors of successful outcome. This study aimed to examine whether or not an adverse obstetric history influenced the functional outcome following VR for ODS. METHOD This was a retrospective study of a cohort of 76 consecutive patients who had undergone VR for ODS at a tertiary referral centre between 2012 and 2015. Patients were followed up by telephone questionnaire. The obstetric history and pre- and postoperative symptoms of ODS and faecal incontinence (FI) were obtained from telephone interviews. RESULTS In this cohort, symptoms of ODS were significantly improved by surgery, with 56% of patients showing a reduction of symptoms of 50% or more (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that a lower body mass index (BMI; 24.4 vs 27.3 kg/m2 ; P < 0.05) and shorter duration of symptoms (7 vs 10 years; P < 0.05) led to a better outcome. VR had no effect on FI. Obstetric factors such as foetal weight, instrumental delivery, episiotomy, perineal tear and total number of deliveries did not influence outcomes. CONCLUSION Patients with a less straightforward obstetric history can be reassured that this should not adversely influence the functional outcome after VR for ODS. Colorectal surgeons who offer this surgery should warn patients with an elevated BMI or with longstanding symptoms that the operation may be less successful than for those with a lower BMI or shorter duration of symptoms.","Kremel, D; Riss, S; Müller, C; von Strauss, M; Winstanley, C; Winstanley, J; Potter, M; Paterson, H; Collie, M",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.14392; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171744/,397

In this analysis, 10-year health outcomes and healthcare costs of one year of the LABBPS intervention versus control are projected. Methods: A discrete event simulation of hypertension care processes projected blood pressure, medication-related adverse events, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease events, and non-cardiovascular disease death in LABBPS participants. Program costs, total direct healthcare costs (2019 USD), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated for the LABBPS intervention and control arms from a healthcare sector perspective over a 10-year horizon. Future costs and QALYs were discounted 3% annually. High and intermediate cost-effectiveness thresholds were defined as <$50,000 and <$150,000 per QALY gained, respectively. Results: At 10 years, the intervention was projected to cost an average of $2,356 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] -$264-$4,611) more per participant than the control arm and gain 0.06 (95% UI 0.01-0.10) QALYs. The LABBPS intervention was highly cost-effective, with a mean cost of $42,717 per QALY gained (58% probability of being highly and 96% of being at least intermediately cost-effective). Exclusive use of generic drugs improved the cost-effectiveness to $17,162 per QALY gained. The LABBPS intervention would be only intermediately cost effective if pharmacists were less likely to intensify antihypertensive medications when systolic blood pressure was ≥150 mmHg or if pharmacist weekly time driving to barbershops increased.

Objective To understand why the burden is so high, qualitative and quantitative research was carried out to gain insights from experts, guidelines and published studies on the unmet clinical needs and therapeutic strategies in VTE prevention and treatment in three populations identified as being at increased risk of VTE and in whom VTE prevention and treatment were regarded as suboptimal: pregnant women, the elderly and obese patients. Methodology A gap analysis methodology was created to highlight unmet needs in VTE management and to discover the patient populations considered most at risk. A questionnaire was devised to guide qualitative interviews with 44 thrombosis and haemostasis experts, and a review of the literature on VTE in the specific patient groups from 2015 to 2017 was completed. This was followed by a Think Tank meeting where the results from the research were discussed. Results This review highlights the insights gained and examines in detail the unmet needs with regard to VTE risk-assessment tools, biomarkers, patient stratification methods, and anticoagulant and dosing regimens in pregnant women, the elderly and obese patients. Conclusions Specifically, in pregnant women at high risk of VTE, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the therapy of choice, but it remains unclear how to use anticoagulants when VTE risk is intermediate. In elderly patients, evaluation of the benefit of VTE prophylaxis against the bleeding risk is particularly important, and a head-to-head comparison of efficacy and safety of LMWH versus direct oral anticoagulants is needed. Finally, in obese patients, lack of guidance on anticoagulant dose adjustment to body weight has emerged as a major obstacle in effective prophylaxis and treatment of VTE.","Brenner, Benjamin; Arya, Roopen; Beyer-Westendorf, Jan; Douketis, James; Hull, Russell; Elalamy, Ismail; Imberti, Davide; Zhai, Zhenguo",Thrombosis journal,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12959-019-0214-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31889915/,397

Symptoms can be severe and lead to the interruption of cancer treatments. However, there is limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying 5-FU-induced intestinal toxicity. In this study, well-established 3D organoid models of human colon and small intestine (SI) were used to characterize 5-FU transcriptomic and metabolomic responses. Clinically relevant 5-FU concentrations for in vitro testing in organoids were established using physiologically based pharmacokinetic simulation of dosing regimens recommended for cancer patients, resulting in exposures to 10, 100 and 1000 µM. After treatment, different measurements were performed: cell viability and apoptosis; image analysis of cell morphological changes; RNA sequencing; and metabolome analysis of supernatant from organoids cultures. Based on analysis of the differentially expressed genes, the most prominent molecular pathways affected by 5-FU included cell cycle, p53 signalling, mitochondrial ATP synthesis and apoptosis. Short time-series expression miner demonstrated tissue-specific mechanisms affected by 5-FU, namely biosynthesis and transport of small molecules, and mRNA translation for colon; cell signalling mediated by Rho GTPases and fork-head box transcription factors for SI. Metabolomic analysis showed that in addition to the effects on TCA cycle and oxidative stress in both organoids, tissue-specific metabolic alterations were also induced by 5-FU. Multi-omics integration identified transcription factor E2F1, a regulator of cell cycle and apoptosis, as the best key node across all samples. These results provide new insights into 5-FU toxicity mechanisms and underline the relevance of human organoid models in the safety assessment in drug development.","Rodrigues, Daniela; de Souza, Terezinha; Coyle, Luke; Di Piazza, Matteo; Herpers, Bram; Ferreira, Sofia; Zhang, Mian; Vappiani, Johanna; Sévin, Daniel C; Gabor, Attila; Lynch, Anthony; Chung, Seung-Wook; Saez-Rodriguez, Julio; Jennen, Danyel G J; Kleinjans, Jos C S; de Kok, Theo M",Archives of toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-021-03092-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151400/,397

64964,Relationships between geometrical parameters and mechanical properties for a helical braided flow diverter stent.,2017,"BACKGROUND Many control methods have been implemented to tackle onchocerciasis and great successes have been achieved, leading to a paradigm shift from control of morbidity to interruption of transmission and ultimately elimination. The mandate of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) ended in 2015, and endemic countries are to plan and conduct elimination activities by themselves, with technical assistance by the Expanded Special Project for Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (ESPEN). To this end, an elimination expert committee was set up in Cameroon in 2018. This committee identified the need to update the data on the current situation of onchocerciasis. The present study aims to systematically review and report all available epidemiological data, including prevalence, intensity and transmission of onchocerciasis to provide pertinent information that will be useful to design optimal strategies to achieve onchocerciasis elimination in Cameroon. METHODS PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science will be searched from inception onwards. Grey literature will be identified through Google Scholar searches, dissertation databases and other relevant documents such as government reports. Eligible studies will be mostly observational, including cohort and cross-sectional surveys. No limitations will be imposed on publication status and study period. The primary outcomes will be (1) the prevalence and intensity of Onchocerca volvulus infection in humans, (2) transmission intensity and (3) impact of interventions on prevalence, intensity and transmission of onchocerciasis. Secondary outcomes will be environmental and socio-demographic factors supporting the primary outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion. Methodological quality including bias will be appraised using appropriate approaches. A narrative synthesis will describe quality and content of the epidemiological evidence. Prevalence and intensity of infection estimates will be stratified according to gender, age, geographical location and year of publication. DISCUSSION This study will provide the health authorities as well as the scientific community with up-to-date information about the epidemiological situation of onchocerciasis in Cameroon. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of the infection will help to define alternative and complementary strategies to accelerate onchocerciasis elimination in the country. Results of this review will also be used to update existing epidemiological models for onchocerciasis in order to fine-tune predictions of elimination timeframes in the country.

Our aim was to document long-term clinical outcomes of liver transplant recipients managed in this 'hub-and-spoke' healthcare model. METHODS A retrospective analysis of all adult patients who underwent liver transplantation between 1987 and 2016, with post-transplant follow-up in two non-transplant centres in the UK (Nottingham) and Canada (Ottawa), was performed. RESULTS The 1-, 5-, 10- and 20-year patient survival rates were 98%, 95%, 87% and 62%, and 100%, 96%, 88% and 62% in the Nottingham and Ottawa groups, respectively (p=0.87). There were no significant differences between the two centres in 1-, 5-, 10- and 20-year cumulative incidence of death-censored graft-survival (p=0.10), end-stage renal disease (p=0.29) or de novo cancer (p=0.22). Nottingham had a lower incidence of major cardiovascular events (p=0.008).

66113,Kaleidoscope.,2018,"Specific polymorphisms in the endoplasmic reticulum amino peptidase genes ERAP1 and ERAP2, when present with certain MHC class receptor types, have been associated with increased risk for specific cancers, infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders in humans. This increased risk has been linked to distinct polymorphisms in both ERAPs and MHC class I receptors that affect the way cell-generated peptides are screened for antigenicity. The incidence of cancer, infectious disease and autoimmune disorders differ greatly among pure breeds of dogs as it does in humans and it is possible that this heightened susceptibility is also due to specific polymorphisms in ERAP1 and ERAP2. In order to determine if such polymorphisms exist, the ERAP1 and ERAP2 genes of 10 dogs of nine diverse breeds were sequenced and SNPs causing synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid changes, deletions or insertions were identified. Eight ERAP1 and 10 ERAP2 SNPs were used to create a Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX based test panel which defined 24 ERAP1, 36 ERAP2 and 128 ERAP1/2 haplotypes. The prevalence of these haplotypes was then measured among dog, wolf, coyote, jackal and red fox populations. Some haplotypes were species specific, while others were shared across species, especially between dog, wolf, coyote and jackal. The prevalence of these haplotypes was then compared among various canid populations, and in particular between various populations of random- and pure-bred dogs. Human-directed positive selection has led to loss of ERAP diversity and segregation of certain haplotypes among various dog breeds. A phylogenetic tree generated from 45 of the most common ERAP1/2 haplotypes demonstrated three distinct clades, all of which were rooted with haplotypes either shared among species or specific to contemporary dogs, coyote and wolf.","Pedersen, N C; Dhanota, J K; Liu, H",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.08.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27590425/,397

MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-eight pig bladders, each weighing from 120 to 150 g, were randomly divided into three groups: Group 1 (interrupted polyglactin 910 suture group), group 2 (running polyglactin 910 suture group), and group 3 (running barbed polyglyconate suture group). The bladder defects were closed laparoscopically, and the suturation times were noted. Two surgeons evaluated the integrity of each bladder closure. A cystometry was performed, and the filling and leak pressures were noted. A Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis test was used to compare the results of the three groups, and P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS There was a statistically significant difference between the mean suturation times of three groups: Group 1, 15.2 minutes; group 2, 9.14 minutes; and group 3, 7.13 minutes (P<0.05). Mean bladder capacity at the time of leakage was 276.2, 353.8, and 419.7 mL for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSION For the first time, we demonstrated laparoscopic knotless closure of bladder defects using the barbed polyglyconate suture material in an experimental in-vitro model. Closing the pig bladder with running knotless barbed suture provides a more effective and faster watertight bladder closure than traditional polyglactin 910 suture material.","Gözen, Ali Serdar; Arslan, Murat; Schulze, Michael; Rassweiler, Jens",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2011.0194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22007838/,397

Policy guidance recommended that they should serve populations of 30 000-50 000 people to perform effectively. AIM To describe variation in the size and characteristics of PCNs and their populations. DESIGN AND SETTING Cross-sectional analysis in England. METHOD Using published information from January 2020, PCNs were identified that contained <30 000, between 30 000-50 000, and >50 000 people. Percentiles were calculated to describe variation in size and population characteristics. PCN composition within each commissioning region was also examined. RESULTS In total, 6758 practices had formed 1250 PCNs. Seven hundred and twenty-six (58%) PCNs had the recommended population of 30 000-50 000 people. Eighty-four (7%) PCNs contained <30 000 people. Four hundred and forty (35%) PCNs contained >50 000 people. Thirty-four (3%) PCNs comprised just one practice and 77 (6%) PCNs contained >10 practices. Some PCNs contained more than double the proportions of older people and people with chronic conditions compared to other PCNs. More than half of the population were from very socioeconomically deprived areas in 172 (14%) PCNs. Only six (4%) of the 135 commissioning regions ensured all PCNs were in the recommended population range. All practices had joined a single PCN in three (2%) commissioning regions. CONCLUSION More than 40% of the PCNs were not of the recommended size, and there was substantial variation in their composition and characteristics. This high variability between PCNs is a risk to their future performance.","Morciano, Marcello; Checkland, Katherine; Hammond, Jonathan; Lau, Yiu-Shing; Sutton, Matt",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp20x713441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139335/,397

Normal reference value (no injury) was obtained from the contra lateral not injured limb at a mirror-like location of the injury. The relative variations resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) at the time of injury was confronted with the not injured values. Relative variations between acute measurements and post medication ones on intramuscular seroma and bursitis have been computed. In intramuscular seroma and trochanteric bursitis we have obtained a percent of change between injury data and after medical intervention. On myositis ossificans, localized BIA showed a 7-8 % decrease in Xc whereas the percent of change of R was negligible (1 %). These percent of changes are in concordance with histological evidence. In the case of a presence of seroma or the lower thigh and trochanteric bursitis, the soft tissue cavity accumulates fluid. Post-injury localized BIA, relative with respect to non-injured side, confirmed sizeable soft tissue destruction evidenced by 50 % decrease of Xc and 24-31 % decrease of R due to interstitial fluid accumulation. Once the seroma and the blood in the bursitis was removed the localized the immediate post-injury BIA parameters increased as follows: a) intramuscular seroma + 10 % on R and + 74 % of Xc; b) trochanteric bursitis + 20 % of R and +24 % of Xc. Localized BIA other than classifying soft tissue injuries, can be useful to understand the pathophysiology and structural impairments of other kind of injuries and to understand their behavior.","Nescolarde, L; Yanguas, J; Lukaski, H; Rodas, G; Rosell-Ferrer, J",Conference proceedings : ...

OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to evaluate the utility of the C-MAC as a DL for intubations in the emergency department (ED). METHODS This was an analysis of prospectively collected continuous quality-improvement data during the 6-year period from February 1, 2009 to January 31, 2015, when both the C-MAC and Macintosh DL (Mac DL) were clinically available in our ED. This analysis included adult patients who underwent rapid sequence intubation by an emergency medicine resident in the ED with a C-MAC initially used as a DL or a Mac DL. The primary outcome measure was the first pass success (FPS). RESULTS When the C-MAC was used as a DL, the initial DL attempt was successful in 199 of 346 (57.6%) cases. When the attempt could not be completed using the C-MAC as a DL, the operator utilized the video monitor and successfully completed the intubation using VL in 104 of 134 (77.6%) cases, thus achieving an overall FPS of 303 of 346 (87.6%). When the Mac DL was used, the FPS was 505 of 671 (75.3%). CONCLUSIONS The C-MAC is a useful device for DL because in the event of a failed DL attempt, operators have the option of switching to the video monitor to successfully complete the intubation using VL without having to make a second attempt.","Sakles, John C; Mosier, Jarrod M; Patanwala, Asad E; Arcaris, Brittany; Dicken, John M",The Journal of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2016.05.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27471132/,397

Eight well-trained male runners completed 3 randomized time-trials in 32.2 ± 0.8° C and 48.6 ± 6.7% relative humidity. A 30-minute warm-up was completed with no cooling (Control), precooling by an ice vest (Vest), or ice packs covering the thighs (Packs). Before the warm-up and after the time-trial, supramaximal femoral nerve stimulation was delivered during and following maximal isometric contractions. Core and skin temperature, heart rate, and perceptual ratings were recorded before and during the warm-up and time-trial. Overall performance time was improved in Packs compared with Control (1,407 ± 80 seconds vs. 1,492 ± 88 seconds; p ≤ 0.05) but not in Vest (1,444 ± 71 seconds; p > 0.05). In Packs, a higher exercise intensity (p ≤ 0.05) and less cumulative time (p < 0.01) were evident during the last kilometer compared with Control. Maximum voluntary force, voluntary activation, muscle contractility, and membrane excitability were not different after exercise or between conditions. Ten minutes after the warm-up, skin temperature was lower in Vest and Packs compared with Control (p < 0.01). Thermal strain and body heat content change was lower in Vest and Packs, respectively (p ≤ 0.05). Findings indicate that torso and thigh precooling during a warm-up reduces thermoregulatory strain. However, thigh opposed to torso precooling provides greater performance improvements. Neuromuscular function did not aid performance, indicating that transient changes in afferent feedback and muscle recruitment may enhance endurance trial performance.","Randall, Carla A; Ross, Emma Z; Maxwell, Neil S",Journal of strength and conditioning research,https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000000840; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26102259/,397

Although OTC self-medication is a convenient way to manage some health issues, older persons may be at higher risk of experiencing medication-related problems. This study examines the prevalence, practices, and preferences associated with OTC medication use in older adult residents of senior living communities. OBJECTIVES The study aimed to examine the characteristics of OTC medication users and to quantify the prevalence, attitudes, perceptions, preferences, and practices regarding OTC medication use and decision-making in 2 senior living communities in central Virginia. METHODS The study used survey methodology. A 51-item semistructured questionnaire was designed by the research team of geriatrics specialists, and mixed-methods and evaluation researchers. The questionnaire was administered in-person to participants (N = 88). Descriptive analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4. Characteristics of those using OTC medications as directed by a health professional were compared with those of whom were self-medicating with OTC medications. RESULTS Most of the sample were women (55%), black (61%) and had less than or equal to a high school education (55%). Analgesics were the most (76%) prevalent OTC therapeutic category used, and aspirin was the most (65%) prevalent OTC medication. A greater (82%) proportion of respondents reported self-recommended OTC medication use (self-medication with OTC medications) rather than physician recommended use (18%). A high (41%) prevalence of inappropriate use of OTC medications was observed in this sample of older adults. Most (80%) considered OTC medications safe and effective. The pharmacy was the most (93%) commonly reported purchase location to buy an OTC medication. Physicians were the most (90%) commonly reported information source for OTC medications. CONCLUSION Considering the high percentage of self-reported self-medication, inappropriate use, and experiences of adverse effects, steps should be taken to develop consumer education and relationships with pharmacists to encourage the responsible use of OTC medications in this population.","Paliwal, Yoshita; Jones, Resa M; Moczygemba, Leticia R; Gendron, Tracey L; Nadpara, Pramit A; Parab, Purva; Slattum, Patricia W",Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2021.05.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140254/,397

Glutamine (Gln) and alanyl-glutamine (Ala-Gln) are nutrients with potential preservation functions similar to those of the intestinal epithelial barrier. The protective role of Gln and Ala-Gln on ZEN-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction was evaluated in this study. Additionally, the ability of Gln and Ala-Gln to protect the intestinal barrier was investigated. Our results showed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, paracellular permeability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level were increased by ZEN, while the glutathione (GSH) level was decreased by ZEN. Gln and Ala-Gln promoted the proliferation of cells and attenuated the ZEN-induced increase in cytotoxicity, cell apoptosis and paracellular permeability. Gln and Ala-Gln alleviated barrier function damage, which was additionally induced by ZEN by increasing the antioxidant capacity of cells. In addition, Gln and Ala-Gln upregulated intestinal barrier associated gene expressions including pBD-1, pBD-2, MUC-2, ZO-1, occludin and claudin-3. This study revealed that Gln and Ala-Gln had similar effects in protecting intestinal epithelial barrier function against ZEN exposure in IPEC-J2 cells. A new treatment for alleviating ZEN-induced injury to the intestine through nutritional intervention is provided.","Gu, Aixin; Yang, Lige; Wang, Jingjing; Li, Jianping; Shan, Anshan",Research in veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2021.04.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932823/,397

Since then, the virus has spread to over 30 states and caused significant economic losses in the US swine industry due to the high mortality in newborn piglets less than 2 weeks of age. A mild-variant strain OH851 of PEDV in the US was first reported in January 2014. Here, we report histological changes in the small intestines of five piglets infected with the variant strain OH851 of PEDV. The lesions observed were milder, compared to the US classical strain of PEDV. Our study, for the first time, reports the histological lesions caused by the variant PEDV OH851 strain from a field case. In addition, genomic characterization demonstrated that US variant PEDV is more closely related to European-like strains in the first 1170 nt of the 5' spike gene but to US classical PEDV strains in the remaining genome, suggesting that the variant PEDV strain may derive from a recombinant event between the US classical and European-like PEDV strains.","Wang, Leyi; Hayes, Jeff; Byrum, Beverly; Zhang, Yan",Virus genes,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-016-1334-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27059242/,397
75549,Advanced Digital Health Technologies for COVID-19 and Future Emergencies.,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND Prosthetic reinforcement is now routine in the management of inguinal and incisional hernia, and it significantly reduces the risk of recurrence. After surgery, chronic pain is often attributed to the characteristics of the mesh and to the method of fixation in the wound, with a potential risk of nerve or muscle injuries. AIM To evaluate the properties of a new ""self adhering"" prosthesis in an experimental animal study. MATERIALS AND METHODS The self adhering prosthesis, a lightweight (40 mg/m(2)) polypropylene mesh coated with a synthetic glue on one side, was implanted laparoscopically in pigs. Removal of the prosthesis was performed at one day, one week and one month post operatively. A macroscopic and microscopic evaluation was performed. The results, using a quantitative score, were compared to those of a control group using the same polypropylene mesh without glue, but fixed by staples. RESULTS The operative time was significantly lower in the self adhering group: 23 min (15-32) versus 31 min (21-40) (P = 0.01). The average time interval from the introduction of the mesh into the preperitoneal space until the appearance of the first tough adhesion was 3 min (2-4). In the control group, the mesh handling time was 8.3 min (5-14) (P = 0.01). At the time of implantation, the score was at a maximum value in all cases for the self adhering prostheses, especially concerning handling and adhesiveness. Upon removal, this score was noted to be good or very good in 90-100% of the cases. There was a good integration in the muscle confirmed histologically, and there was no shrinkage, no mobilisation and no migration. At one month, the thickness of the fibrosis at the limits of the meshes was significantly higher for the self adhering prostheses (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION In this experimental study, the self adhering prosthesis demonstrated its adhesive properties and its ability to be well tolerated, with a good macroscopic and microscopic integration into the abdominal wound. This should allow us to perform a clinical prospective study in an open and laparoscopic approach with the double objective of reducing post operative pain induced by mechanical fixation and decreasing the cost of these procedures by reducing the operative time and by eliminating staple fixation.","Champault, G; Polliand, C; Dufour, F; Ziol, M; Behr, L",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-008-0419-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18726066/,397
75792,Mental health impact of COVID-19 in frontline healthcare workers in a Belgian Tertiary care hospital: a prospective longitudinal study.,2021-03-28,"BACKGROUND The Cormack-Lehane (C-L) grade III airway is considered to be a challenging airway to intubate and is associated with a poor intubation success rate. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the holding position, shapes, bend angles of the endotracheal tube (ET) and the stylet-assisted lifting of the epiglottis could improve the success rate of intubation. METHODS Thirty-two participants, 26 physicians, 2 residents, and 4 nurse practitioners, with 12.09 ± 5.38 years of work experience in the emergency department and more than 150 annual intubation events, were enrolled in this randomized, cross-over mannequin study. We investigated the effects of straight-to-cuff ET shapes with 35° and 50° bend angles, banana-shaped ET with longitudinal distances of 28 cm and 26 cm, two methods of holding the ET (either on the top or in the middle), and lifting or not the epiglottis, on the intubation duration, its success rate, and its subjective difficulty. The aim of the study is to provide optimized intubation strategies for difficult airway with C-L IIb or III grades, when the inlet of the trachea cannot be visualized. RESULTS The two groups that lifted the epiglottis using the stylets, in bend angles of 35° and 50°, had the shortest duration of intubation (23.75 ± 14.24 s and 20.72 ± 6.90 s, hazard ratios 1.54 and 1.85 with 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] of 1.01-2.34 and 1.23-2.78, respectively) and a 100% success rate in intubations. In the survival analysis, lifting of the epiglottis was the only significant factor (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 1.34-2.11) associated with the success rate of intubation. CONCLUSIONS The use of the epiglottic lift as an adjunctive technique can facilitate the intubation and improve its success rate without increasing procedure difficulty, in C-L III airway, when only the epiglottis is seen.

76159,Health-Related Quality of Life for People With Acute and Chronic Illnesses During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021,"BACKGROUND Novel microbial detection technologies have revealed that chronic bacterial biofilms, which are recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, are common in failed orthopedic procedures. QUESTIONS Are bacteria present on failed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions? Is there a difference in the presence or nature of bacteria in failed ACL reconstructions relative to a control set of healthy ACL's? METHODS We used a case-control study design, where we analyzed the bacterial composition of 10 failed ACL reconstructions and compared it to 10 native ACL's harvested during total knee arthroplasty. The IBIS Universal Biosensor was used to determine the nature of bacteria on ACL specimens, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to visualize bacteria in a subset of cases. RESULTS Bacteria are present in failed ACL reconstructions. Bacteria are present in ACL's harvested during total knee arthroplasty, but the nature of the species differs significantly between experimental and control sets. Twelve genera were detected in the experimental set (in both allografts and autografts), and in four samples multiple species were detected. In contrast, the control group was characterized by presence of Propionibacterium acnes. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate the presence of bacteria on failed ACLs surgeries, and open the door to investigate whether and how bacteria and the associated immune responses could possibly contribute to graft failure. CLINICAL RELEVANCE If microbial pathogens can be linked to failed grafts, it could provide: (1) markers for early diagnosis of abnormal healing in ACL surgeries, and (2) targets for early treatment to prevent additional reconstruction surgeries.","Hiller, N Luisa; Chauhan, Aakash; Palmer, Michael; Jain, Sameer; Sotereanos, Nicholas G; Altman, Gregory T; Nistico, Laura; Kreft, Rachael; Post, J Christopher; Demeo, Patrick J",SpringerPlus,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40064-015-1213-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26339561/,397

By avoiding fixed time-in-training and single training sites, training can be offered at multiple centers in Africa, even with lower patient volumes. It also creates opportunities for accredited international surgical outreach programs to contribute to training. CONCLUSIONS Having prescribed reading and appropriate Entrustable Professional Activities that are assessed through Workplace Based Assessment, and having a summative virtual oral examination ensures that fellows are fit-for-purpose to practice in an African resource-constrained setting.

This study examines the results and complications of FDD for small aneurysms at this location. METHODS From February 2010 to December 2013, 14 patients (10 women; mean age 59 years) with 15 small MCA aneurysms were treated with FDD. All procedures were performed with the Pipeline embolization device (PED). RESULTS Complete occlusion was obtained in 12/15 aneurysms (80%) and partial occlusion in 3 (20%). Among 13 aneurysms with a side branch, this was patent at the angiographic control in 4 cases, showed decreased filling in 6, and was occluded in 3 (with neurological deficits in 2). All PEDs were patent at follow-up. Post-procedural ischemic complications occurred in 4 (27%) procedures with permanent neurological deficit (modified Rankin score 2) in 3 (21%). No early or delayed aneurysm rupture, no subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage and no deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment with FDD is a relatively safe treatment for small MCA aneurysms resulting in a high occlusion rate. The findings of this study suggest that complete occlusion after endovascular treatment with FDD can be delayed (>6 months). Ischemic complications may occur as early or delayed, particularly at clopidogrel interruption.","Briganti, Francesco; Delehaye, Luigi; Leone, Giuseppe; Sicignano, Carmine; Buono, Giuseppe; Marseglia, Mariano; Caranci, Ferdinando; Tortora, Fabio; Maiuri, Francesco",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25603808/,397

In today's clinical settings, practitioners continue to follow conventional guidelines to categorize NSLBP patients based on subjective approaches, such as the STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST). This study aimed to develop a sensor-based machine learning model to classify NSLBP patients into different subgroups according to quantitative kinematic data, i.e., trunk motion and balance-related measures, in conjunction with STarT output. Specifically, inertial measurement units (IMU) were attached to the trunks of ninety-four patients while they performed repetitive trunk flexion/extension movements on a balance board at self-selected pace. Machine learning algorithms (support vector machine (SVM) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP)) were implemented for model development, and SBST results were used as ground truth. The results demonstrated that kinematic data could successfully be used to categorize patients into two main groups: high vs. low-medium risk. Accuracy levels of ~75% and 60% were achieved for SVM and MLP, respectively. Additionally, among a range of variables detailed herein, time-scaled IMU signals yielded the highest accuracy levels (i.e., ~75%). Our findings support the improvement and use of wearable systems in developing diagnostic and prognostic tools for various healthcare applications. This can facilitate development of an improved, cost-effective quantitative NSLBP assessment tool in clinical and home settings towards effective personalized rehabilitation.","Abdollahi, Masoud; Ashouri, Sajad; Abedi, Mohsen; Azadeh-Fard, Nasibeh; Parnianpour, Mohamad; Khalaf, Kinda; Rashedi, Ehsan",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20123600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604794/,397

Each new device has benefits and limitations in regards to tissue interactions that, if known, allow for optimal use. However, most surgeons are unaware of these attributes and, therefore, new device introduction creates a ""knowledge gap"" that is potentially dangerous. The goal of this review is to present a framework for the study of device- tissue interactions and to initiate the process of ""filling in"" the knowledge gap via the available literature. Surgical staplers, which are continually being developed, are the focus of this piece. The integrity of the staple line, which depends on adequate tissue compression, is the primary factor in creating a stable anastomosis. This review focuses on published studies that evaluated the creation of stable anastomoses in bariatric, thoracic, and colorectal procedures. Understanding how staplers interact with target tissues is key to improving patient outcomes. It is clear from this review that each tissue type presents unique challenges. The thickness of each tissue varies as do the intrinsic biomechanical properties that determine the ideal compressive force and prefiring compression time for each tissue type. The correct staple height will vary depending on these tissue-specific properties and the tissue pathology. These studies reinforce the universal theme that compression, staple height, tissue thickness, tissue compressibility, and tissue type must all be considered by the surgeon prior to choosing a stapler and cartridge. The surgeon's experience, therefore, is a critical factor. Educational programs need to be established to inform and update surgeons on the characteristics of each stapler. It is hoped that the framework presented in this review will facilitate this process.","Chekan, Edward; Whelan, Richard L",Medical devices,https://doi.org/10.2147/mder.s67338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25246812/,397
80583,Perspectives of opioid use disorder treatment providers during COVID-19: Adapting to flexibilities and sustaining reforms.,2021-05-31,"Introduction: Hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe structure, has significant implications in memory formation and learning. Although hippocampus activity is believed to be affected by socioeconomic status (SES), limited knowledge exists on which SES indicators influence hippocampus function. Purpose: This study explored the separate and combined effects of three SES indicators, namely parental education, family income, and neighborhood income, on adolescents' hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task. As some of the effects of parental education may be through income, we also tested if the effect of parental education on hippocampus activation during our N-Back memory task is mediated by family or neighborhood income. Methods: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study is a national multi-center investigation of American adolescents' brain development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of a total sample of 3067 9-10-year-old adolescents were used. The primary outcome was left- hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task (mean beta weight for N-Back run 1 2 back versus 0 back contrast in left hippocampus). The independent variable was parental education. Family income and neighborhood income were two possible mediators. Age, sex, and marital status were the covariates. To test mediation, we used hierarchical linear regression models first without and then with our mediators. Full mediation was defined according to Kenny. The Sobel test was used to confirm statistical mediation. Results: In the absence of family and neighborhood income in the model, higher parental educational attainment was associated with lower level of left hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. This effect was significant while age, sex, and marital status were controlled. The association between parental educational attainment and hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task was no more significant when we controlled for family and neighborhood income. Instead, family income was associated with hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. These findings suggested that family income fully mediates the effect of parental educational attainment on left hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. Conclusions: The effect of parental educational attainment on adolescents' hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task is fully explained by family income. That means low family income is why adolescents with low-educated parents show highlighted hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task. Given the central role of the hippocampus in learning and memory and as income is a modifiable factor by tax and economic policies, income-redistribution policies, fair taxation, and higher minimum wage may have implications for promotion of adolescent equality and social justice. There is a need to focus on family-level economic needs across all levels of neighborhood income.","Assari, Shervin; Boyce, Shanika; Bazargan, Mohsen; Caldwell, Cleopatra H",Brain sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10080520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764344/,397

In doing so, the study complements mathematical modeling techniques for disease spread, as well as modeling applications focused on the spread of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial infections in hospitals. Twenty different emergency department scenarios were simulated, with further simulation of four infection control strategies. The agent-based modeling approach represents systems modeling, in which the emergency department was modeled as a collection of agents (patients and healthcare workers) and their individual characteristics, behaviors, and interactions. The framework was coded in C++ using Qt4 libraries running under the Linux operating system. A simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to analyze the data, in which the percentage of patients that became infected in one day within the simulation was the dependent variable. The results suggest that within the given instance context, patient-oriented infection control policies (alternate treatment streams, masking symptomatic patients) tend to have a larger effect than policies that target healthcare workers. The agent-based modeling framework is a flexible tool that can be made to reflect any given environment; it is also a decision support tool for practitioners and policymakers to assess the relative impact of infection control strategies. The framework illuminates scenarios worthy of further investigation, as well as counterintuitive findings.","Laskowski, Marek; Demianyk, Bryan C P; Witt, Julia; Mukhi, Shamir N; Friesen, Marcia R; McLeod, Robert D",IEEE transactions on information technology in biomedicine : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,https://doi.org/10.1109/titb.2011.2163414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21813364/,397

Emerging evidence from preclinical and human studies indicates an age-dependent reduction of cellular NAD+, possibly due to reduced synthesis and increased consumption. In preclinical models, NAD+ repletion extends healthspan and / or lifespan and mitigates several conditions, such as premature ageing diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. These findings suggest that NAD+ replenishment through NAD+ precursors has great potential as a therapeutic target for ageing and age-predisposed diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Here, we provide an updated review on the biological activity, safety, and possible side effects of NAD+ precursors in preclinical and clinical studies. Major NAD+ precursors focused on by this review are nicotinamide riboside (NR), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and the new discovered dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH).

These devises infer additional costs and may lead to associated risks and complications. We aimed to evaluate the safety of gallbladder retrieval without the use of a retrieval device. METHODS A prospective study was conducted across two teaching hospitals in the Republic of Ireland from July 2010-2013. Patients undergoing planed elective day case laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the two institutions were included in the study. Data were collected on patient demographics, the use of a bag, any need for extension of fascial incision, any unexpected over night stay, any 30-day post operative complications and presence of port site hernia within 1 year surgery. RESULTS There were 373 planned elective day case laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed during the study period. A bag was not used to retrieve the gallbladder in 41 % (n = 152) patients. A retrieval bag was used in the majority of patients (71 %) who required over night stay due to pain. Overall wound infection rate was low (2.4 %), with 57 % of those being in patients where no retrieval bag was used. An increase incision in the fascia was required in 9.7 % of patients. The majority of these were in patients in whom a retrieval bag was used (75 %). At 1 year follow up, there were no recorded cases of port site hernia for the no retrieval bag group and two (0.9 %) cases of umbilical port site hernias in the group where retrieval bag was used. CONCLUSION In cases of elective uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy for radiologically confirmed benign disease there was no benefit in using a retrieval bag. Furthermore, not using a bag was associated with less need for increasing the size of the fascial incision thereby reducing post operative pain and risk of port site hernia.","Majid, Muhamed Hamid; Meshkat, Babak; Kohar, Haseeb; El Masry, Sherif",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-016-0181-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27643488/,397

We investigated Depatux-M in combination with temozolomide or as single agent in a randomized controlled phase II trial in recurrent EGFR amplified glioblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible were patients with centrally confirmed EGFR amplified glioblastoma at first recurrence after chemo-irradiation with temozolomide. Patients were randomized to either Depatux-M 1.25 mg/kg every 2 weeks intravenously, or this treatment combined with temozolomide 150-200 mg/m2 day 1-5 every 4 weeks, or either lomustine or temozolomide. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. RESULTS 260 patients were randomized. In the primary efficacy analysis with 199 events (median follow-up 15.0 months) the hazard ratio (HR) for the combination arm compared to the control arm was 0.71, 95% CI [0.50, 1.02]; p = 0.062. The efficacy of Depatux-M monotherapy was comparable to that of the control arm (HR =1.04, 95%CI [0.73, 1.48]; p = 0.83).

In the long-term follow-up analysis with median follow-up of 28,7 months the HR for the comparison of the combination arm versus the control arm was 0.66 (95%CI [0.48, 0.93]. CONCLUSION This trial suggests a possible role for the use of Depatux-M in combination with temozolomide in EGFR amplified recurrent glioblastoma, especially in patients relapsing well after the end of first-line adjuvant temozolomide treatment.

METHODS The current study aimed at evaluating the difference between target concentrations of propofol and performance, which was measured using the SLOG/TCI-III system in children. Thirty children fulfilling the I-II criteria according to American Society of Anesthesiology were enrolled in the study. The target plasma concentration of propofol was fed into the SLOG/TCI-III system and compared with the measured concentrations of propofol. Blood samples were collected and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector. The performance error (PE) was determined for each measured blood propofol concentration. The performances of the TCI-III system were determined by the median performance error (MDPE), the median absolute performance error (MDAPE), and Wobble (the median absolute deviation of each PE from the MDPE), respectively. RESULTS Concentration against target concentration showed good linear correlation: concentration = 1.3428 target concentration - 0.2633 (r = 0.8667). The MDPE and MDAPE of the pediatric system were 10 and 22%, respectively, and the median value for Wobble was 24%. MDPE and MDAPE were less than 15 and 30%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The performance of TCI-III system seems to be in the accepted limits for clinical practice in children.","Yang, Wan-hua; Gu, Hong-bin; Chen, Bing; Li, Juan; Fan, Qiu-wei; Yuan, Yong-fang; Wang, Xiangdong",Journal of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-9-187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22044738/,397

Methods This study was retrospectively conducted on patients registered in the Korean acute-on-chronic liver failure study cohort, and on 474 consecutive cirrhotic patients hospitalized with variceal bleeding from January 2013 to December 2013 at 21 university hospitals. ACLF was defined as described by the European Association for the Study of Liver-Chronic Liver Failure Consortium. Results Among a total of 474 patients, 61 patients were diagnosed with ACLF. The cumulative overall survival (OS) rate was lower in the patients with ACLF than in those without (P<0.001), and patients with higher ACLF grades had a lower OS rate (P<0.001). The chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment (CLIF-SOFA) score was identified as a significant prognostic factor in patients hospitalized with variceal bleeding (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-1.50; P<0.001), even in ACLF patients with variceal bleeding (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19-1.46, P<0.001). Concerning the prediction of the mortality risk at 28- and 90-day using CLIF-SOFA scores, c-statistics were 0.895 (95% CI, 0.829-0.962) and 0.897 (95% CI, 0.842-0.951), respectively, and the optimal cut-off values were 6.5 and 6.5, respectively. Conclusions In cirrhotic patients hospitalized with variceal bleeding, the prognosis was poor when accompanied by ACLF, especially depending upon CLIF-SOFA score. CLIF-SOFA model well predicted the 28-day or 90-day mortality for cirrhotic patients who experienced variceal bleeding.","Shin, Jongbeom; Yu, Jung Hwan; Jin, Young-Joo; Yim, Hyung Joon; Jung, Young Kul; Yang, Jin Mo; Song, Do Seon; Kim, Young Seok; Kim, Sang Gyune; Kim, Dong Joon; Suk, Ki Tae; Yoon, Eileen L; Lee, Sang Soo; Kim, Chang Wook; Kim, Hee Yeon; Jang, Jae Young; Jeong, Soung Won",Clinical and molecular hepatology,https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2020.0034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937688/,397
89249,'It's literally giving them a solution in their hands': the views of young Australians towards patient-delivered partner therapy for treating chlamydia.,2021-01-13,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ablation (LA) of colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) is frequently performed in combination with laparoscopic liver resection or as a stand-alone procedure. However, LA is technically demanding and whether the results are comparable with those of open ablation (OA) has not been determined to date. This study compared the effectiveness of LA and OA in achieving local tumor control of CRLMs. METHODS Patients undergoing LA or OA of CRLMs at Ghent University Hospital between June 2007 and February 2018 were identified from a prospective database. Lesions treated by LA and OA were matched 1:1 using a propensity score based on lesions (liver segment, size, deepness, proximity to a vessel), patients, and procedural characteristics. Ablation sites were followed up with computed-tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to assess the completeness of the ablation and ablation-site recurrence (ASR). Analysis of ASR was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. RESULTS In this study, 163 patients underwent the surgical ablation (78 LA, 85 OA) of 333 CRLMs (143 LA, 190 OA). After matching, 220 lesions (110 LA, 110 OA) were analyzed. Ablation was complete in 93.7% (LA) and 97.3% (OA) of the sites (p = 0.195). No difference in ASR was observed (p = 0.351), with a cumulative risk of ASR at 12 months of 9.1% (LA) and 8.2% (OA). After multivariable analysis, ASR was confirmed to be independent of the surgical approach. CONCLUSION The findings showed that LA and OA achieve a comparable local control of CRLMs. This result further supports the adoption of a laparoscopic approach for the treatment of CRLMs.","Giglio, Mariano Cesare; Logghe, Bram; Garofalo, Eleonora; Tomassini, Federico; Vanlander, Aude; Berardi, Giammauro; Montalti, Roberto; Troisi, Roberto Ivan",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08243-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32060758/,397
89546,Rapid Implementation of Telehealth Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-07-17,"Background Increasing hernia sizes lead to higher recurrence rates after ventral hernia repair. A better grip might reduce the failure rates. Material and methods A biomechanical model delivering dynamic intermittent strain (DIS) was used to assess grip values at various hernia orifices. The model consists of a water-filled aluminium cylinder covered with tissues derived from pig bellies which are punched with a central defect varying in diameter. DIS was applied mimicking coughs lasting for up to 2 s with peak pressures between 180 and 220 mmHg and a plateau phase of 0.1 s. Ventral hernia repair was simulated with hernia meshes in the sublay position secured by tacks, glue or sutures as needed to achieve certain grip values. Grip was calculated taking into account the mesh: defect area ratio and the fixation strength. Data were assessed using non-parametric statistics. Results Using a mesh classified as highly stable upon DIS testing (DIS class A) a reduced overlap without fixation led to early slippage (p < 0.001). With the application of 16 fixation points, transmural sutures were better than tacks with Securestrap® being better than Absorbatack® (p < 0.001). Plotting the likelihood of a durable repair as a function of the calculated grip higher grip values were needed with increasing hernia diameter to achieve biomechanical stability. This is important for clinical work since the calculated grip values both from a registry and from published data tend to drop as hernia sizes increase indicating biomechanical instability. Conclusion The experimental work reported here demonstrates for the first time that higher grip values should be reached when repairing larger ventral hernias.","Kallinowski, F; Gutjahr, D; Vollmer, M; Harder, F; Nessel, R",Annals of medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2019.04.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061707/,397

Headaches are a common symptom of COVID-19 infections. Patients generally describe them as bilateral, predominantly frontal, squeezing and of moderate or severe intensity. Searching for ""Red Flags"" often allows distinction from primary headaches - usually fever, cough, and elevated inflammatory markers accompany COVID-19-associated headaches. Prospective studies did not confirm caveats against the use of ibuprofen as symptomatic treatment. While carrying facial masks often caused headaches, probably by compressing sensory nerves, many patients' migraine frequencies dropped during lockdown. Treatment of patients with primary headaches was complicated by quarantine and many centres offered online consultations.","Pohl, Heiko; Gantenbein, Andreas R",Praxis,https://doi.org/10.1024/1661-8157/a003661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33726510/,397

91701,Prevalence of Pre-existing Conditions Among Community Health Center Patients With COVID-19: Implications for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.,2021-02-01,"INTRODUCTION Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common abdominal emergency. This article aims to document the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on timely diagnosis of AA, duration of symptoms before examination in a medical institution, levels of laboratory inflammatory markers, and the length of hospital stay. Collected data were compared with current world literature. METHOD Two datasets were created, comprising patients with the histological diagnosis of AA determined from March 1 to June 30, 2019 (before of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic) and in the same period of the spring pandemic of COVID-19 in 2020. The following information was obtained from patient medical records: Demographic data, information on symptom duration before AA diagnosis, information on laboratory inflammatory marker levels, the used surgical method, antibiotic treatment, histopathological findings, and the length of hospital stay. These data were processed using descriptive statistics methods and the two created datasets were compared with the use of statistical methods (an unpaired t-test and Welchs t-test). RESULTS Thirty seven patients (26 men and 11 women) with the median age of 41 years were operated on for acute appendicitis at the Department of Surgery, Military University Hospital in Prague from March 1 to June 30, 2019. Thirty four patients (19 men and 15 women) with the median age of 42 years were operated on in the same period of 2020. No significant differences were found between these two compared datasets in terms of symptom duration, laboratory inflammatory marker levels or the length of hospital stay. The distributions of histopathological findings and used antibiotic treatments were also similar. CONCLUSION In our study, we were unable to demonstrate any statistically significant differences between the datasets of patients operated on before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hána, L; Ryska, M; Pohnán, R",Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti,https://doi.org/10.33699/pis.2021.100.9.429-434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34649451/,397
92195,Telehealth in pediatric primary care.,2021-01-01,"Background Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may need hospitalization for supplemental oxygen, and some need intensive care unit (ICU) admission for escalation of care. Practice of adjunctive and supportive treatments remain uncertain and may vary widely between countries, within countries between hospitals, and possibly even within ICUs. We aim to investigate practice of adjunctive and supportive treatments, and their associations with outcome, in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods The 'PRactice of Adjunctive Treatments in Intensive Care Unit Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019' (PRoAcT-COVID) study is a national, observational study to be undertaken in a large set of ICUs in The Netherlands. The PRoAcT-COVID includes consecutive ICU patients, admitted because of COVID-19 to one of the participating ICUs during a 3-month period. Daily follow-up lasts 28 days. The primary endpoint is a combination of adjunctive treatments, including types of oxygen support, ventilation, rescue therapies for hypoxemia refractory to supplementary oxygen or during invasive ventilation, other adjunctive and supportive treatments, and experimental therapies. We will also collect tracheostomy rate, duration of invasive ventilation and ventilator-free days and alive at day 28 (VFD-28), ICU and hospital length of stay, and the mortality rates in the ICU, hospital and at day 90. Discussion The PRoAcT-COVID study is an observational study combining high density treatment data with relevant clinical outcomes. Information on treatment practices, and their associations with outcomes in COVID-19 patients in highly and urgently needed. The results of the PRoAcT-COVID study will be rapidly available, and circulated through online presentations, such as webinars and electronic conferences, and publications in peer-reviewed journals-findings will also be presented at a dedicated website. At request, and after agreement of the PRoAcT-COVID steering committee, source data will be made available through local, regional and national anonymized datasets.

92681,Pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects: a European consensus statement.,2017,"BACKGROUND Obesity remains a significant health problem associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Panniculectomy in the obese patient population aims at treating complications related to excess abdominal skin in an attempt to improve quality of life, increase mobility, and potentially prepare the patient for subsequent bariatric surgery or enrollment in a weight-loss program. We describe the indications and outcomes of ""supersize"" panniculectomy in the extreme obesity patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS A Duke University institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review of patients who underwent a ""supersize"" panniculectomy by a single surgeon during a 6-year period was conducted. Data on patient demographics, operative indication, preoperative imaging, concomitant operations, and postoperative complications were collected. RESULTS Twenty-six patients underwent a ""supersize"" panniculectomy for indications including immobility secondary to excess abdominal skin, panniculitis, ventral hernia, and presence of a gynecologic tumor. The mean pannus resection weight was 15.6 kg and the mean follow-up was 15.7 months. Twelve patients underwent preoperative abdominal computed tomographic imaging. Eleven patients underwent concomitant surgical procedures at the time of their panniculectomy. The overall wound complication rate for the ""supersize"" panniculectomy was 42.3% (11/26 patients). However, the rate of major complications, defined as those complications requiring a return to the operating room, was only 11.5% (3/26 patients). CONCLUSIONS ""Supersize"" panniculectomy is defined as a panniculectomy in the obese patient population with a resected pannus specimen weight greater than or equal to 10 kg, and a pannus formation that extends to the mid-thigh level or below. Despite the obstacles and reported high complication rates, the incidence of major complications in this series justifies the operative intervention in patients with an otherwise therapy-resistant ""supersize"" pannus. A preoperative computed tomographic imaging may rule out an underlying hernia in most cases and is recommended by the authors.","Pestana, Ivo A; Campbell, Douglas; Fearmonti, Regina M; Bond, Jennifer E; Erdmann, Detlev",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0b013e31827f5496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23722576/,397
93517,"Effectiveness of brushing teeth in patients with reduced oral hygiene by laypeople: a randomized, controlled study.",2021-04-30,"The influenza A matrix 2 (M2) transmembrane protein facilitates virion release from the infected host cell. In particular, M2 plays a role in the induction of membrane curvature and/or in the scission process whereby the envelope is cut upon virion release. Here we show using coarse-grained computer simulations that various M2 assembly geometries emerge due to an entropic driving force, resulting in compact clusters or linearly extended aggregates as a direct consequence of the lateral membrane stresses. Conditions under which these protein assemblies will cause the lipid membrane to curve are explored, and we predict that a critical cluster size is required for this to happen. We go on to demonstrate that under the stress conditions taking place in the cellular membrane as it undergoes large-scale membrane remodeling, the M2 protein will, in principle, be able to both contribute to curvature induction and sense curvature to line up in manifolds where local membrane line tension is high. M2 is found to exhibit linactant behavior in liquid-disordered-liquid-ordered phase-separated lipid mixtures and to be excluded from the liquid-ordered phase, in near-quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Our findings support a role for M2 in membrane remodeling during influenza viral budding both as an inducer and a sensor of membrane curvature, and they suggest a mechanism by which localization of M2 can occur as the virion assembles and releases from the host cell, independent of how the membrane curvature is produced.","Madsen, Jesper J; Grime, John M A; Rossman, Jeremy S; Voth, Gregory A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1805443115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150411/,397

We investigated whether student perceptions of school connectedness were associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, even during remote learning due to COVID-19. In June of 2020, after 13 weeks of remote learning, 320 middle and high school students in one Massachusetts school district completed an online survey that included questions about their perceptions of school connectedness, social connectedness, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Students were approximately evenly distributed across grades, with 37% in middle school (grades 6-8) and 63% in high school (grades 9-12). School connectedness had a significant negative association with symptoms of anxiety and depression. This association persisted in models controlling for demographic factors and social connectedness. Findings indicate that school connectedness is associated with student mental health, even in the context of remote learning due to COVID-19. Schools engaged in remote learning should consider how to foster school connectedness as a means of supporting youth mental health, particularly given expected increases in the mental health needs of adolescents.","Perkins, Kesha N; Carey, Katie; Lincoln, Emma; Shih, Amanda; Donalds, Rachael; Kessel Schneider, Shari; Holt, Melissa K; Green, Jennifer Greif",The journal of primary prevention,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10935-021-00649-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34654995/,397

OBJECTIVES To estimate the incidence, origins and avoidable harm of diagnostic errors in English general practice. Diagnostic errors were defined as missed opportunities to make a correct or timely diagnosis based on the evidence available (missed diagnostic opportunities, MDOs). METHOD Retrospective medical record reviews identified MDOs in 21 general practices. In each practice, two trained general practitioner reviewers independently conducted case note reviews on 100 randomly selected adult consultations performed during 2013-2014. Consultations where either reviewer identified an MDO were jointly reviewed. RESULTS Across 2057 unique consultations, reviewers agreed that an MDO was possible, likely or certain in 89 cases or 4.3% (95% CI 3.6% to 5.2%) of reviewed consultations. Inter-reviewer agreement was higher than most comparable studies (Fleiss' kappa=0.63). Sixty-four MDOs (72%) had two or more contributing process breakdowns. Breakdowns involved problems in the patient-practitioner encounter such as history taking, examination or ordering tests (main or secondary factor in 61 (68%) cases), performance and interpretation of diagnostic tests (31; 35%) and follow-up and tracking of diagnostic information (43; 48%). 37% of MDOs were rated as resulting in moderate to severe avoidable patient harm. CONCLUSIONS Although MDOs occurred in fewer than 5% of the investigated consultations, the high numbers of primary care contacts nationally suggest that several million patients are potentially at risk of avoidable harm from MDOs each year. Causes of MDOs were frequently multifactorial, suggesting the need for development and evaluation of multipronged interventions, along with policy changes to support them.","Cheraghi-Sohi, Sudeh; Holland, Fiona; Singh, Hardeep; Danczak, Avril; Esmail, Aneez; Morris, Rebecca Lauren; Small, Nicola; Williams, Richard; de Wet, Carl; Campbell, Stephen M; Reeves, David",BMJ quality & safety,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2020-012594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127547/,397

Platoons of Cadets were randomly allocated to either Self-Reflection Resilience Training (SRT; n = 96) or an exposure-matched active control group that received training as usual (i.e., cognitive-behavioral skill development training) and communication skills seminars (n = 108). Compared to the active control group, SRT was more effective at preventing the onset of depression symptoms and promoting stable levels of perceived stress during a period of increased exposure to training stressors, consistent with a resilient trajectory. The Self-Reflection group unexpectedly demonstrated higher anxiety symptoms than the Control group at immediate follow-up, but these symptoms returned to baseline levels at longer term follow-up. In contrast, the Control group experienced increasing anxiety symptoms between immediate and longer term follow-up. Mediation analyses supported an indirect effect of SRT on all three outcome measures via brooding, but not via reflection. This study provides support for the capacity of a practical, sustainable, and scalable intervention based on self-reflection to strengthen resilience in the military training setting.

98080,The Day the Earth Stood Still: COVID-19.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction respiratory viral panel (RVP) testing offers enhanced test performance characteristics compared with older testing methods. However, the impact of RVP testing on physician antimicrobial prescription practices remains unclear. Our objective was to assess the potential relationship of RVP testing to physician treatment practices for children hospitalized with acute respiratory illness (ARI). METHODS We performed a retrospective chart review of children hospitalized for ARI during peak prevalence of respiratory viral infections in 2009-2011. Demographics, diagnostic testing, antimicrobial use, and clinical outcomes were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Antimicrobial use was compared with RVP testing data. RESULTS A total of 1727 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 254 (14.7%) children who were hospitalized for ARI received oseltamivir and 856 (49.6%) children received antibiotics. More children who received oseltamivir were positive for influenza by RVP (76.9% vs 18.0%; P < .0001). Children who underwent RVP testing received antibiotics more often than those who were not tested (53.7% vs 46.0%; P = .001), but children with a positive RVP test result received antibiotics less often (51.6% vs 67.0%; P = .003). A total of 5.8% of children who were positive for a viral pathogen by RVP had antibiotics discontinued. Antibiotics were started in fewer children when RVP results were positive (10.9% vs 100.0%; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS Respiratory viral panel testing was associated with more appropriate oseltamivir use in children hospitalized with ARI. Physicians started antibiotics more often in children with a negative RVP test result and occasionally discontinued antibiotics in children diagnosed with a viral pathogen. These results suggest that RVP testing may enhance physician decision-making when prescribing antimicrobials in children hospitalized with ARI.","McCulloh, Russell J; Andrea, Sarah; Reinert, Steven; Chapin, Kimberle",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/pit073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26625367/,397
98298,Expert Consensus: Telehealth Skills for Health Care Professionals.,2020-11-25,"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi emerged amidst widespread anti-Government demonstrations and subsequently mass gatherings. This paper describes the incidence and factors associated with the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi. METHODOLOGY This was a retrospective study on public data analysing geopolitical and immigration activities that occurred between 2 April and 8 September 2020. We used chi-square test of independence to tabulate gender and age-related fatality ratios among deaths due to COVID-19 related complications RESULTS: The drivers for COVID-19 spread were mass gatherings secondary to the country's political landscape and repatriation of citizens from high-risk areas coupled with minimum use of public health interventions. The prevalence was higher in people aged 50-59 years, males, and in urban areas. Men had an increased risk of COVID-19 related deaths (Case Fatality Ratio: 1.58 (95 % Confidence Interval 1.11 - 2.22) compared to women. Furthermore, men and women ≥40 years old were 16.1 times and 7.1 times more likely to die of COVID related complications respectively. Men ≥40 years had a 62% increased risk of deaths compared to women of the same age group. CONCLUSION Mass political gatherings and cross-border immigration from high-risk areas were drivers for infection. Males, older age and urban residence were associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. To control the spread of COVID-19, there is a need to regulate mass gathering, repatriation of citizens, and strengthen use of preventive health interventions. Men, the older age groups and urban area should be prioritized with COVID-19 prevention strategies.","Nyasulu, Juliet Charity Yauka; Munthali, Richard Junganiko; Nyondo-Mipando, Alinane Linda; Pandya, Himani; Nyirenda, Laywell; Nyasulu, Peter; Manda, Samuel",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.03.055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33771674/,397
99208,Educational pamphlets for improving uptake of cancer screening: a systematic review.,2019-09-01,"Diosgenin (DSG) has attracted attention recently as a potential anticancer therapeutic agent due to its profound antitumor activity. To better utilize DSG as an antitumor compound, two series of DSG-amino acid ester derivatives (3a-3g and 7a-7g) were designed and synthesized, and their cytotoxic activities against six human cancer cell lines (K562, T24, MNK45, HepG2, A549, and MCF-7) were evaluated. The results obtained showed that a majority of derivatives exhibited cytotoxic activities against these six human tumor cells. Structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that the introduction of l-tryptophan to the C-3 position of DSG and the C-26 position of derivative 5 was the preferred option for these compounds to display significant cytotoxic activities. Among them, compound 7g exhibited significant cytotoxicity against the K562 cell line (IC50 = 4.41 μM) and was 6.8-fold more potent than diosgenin (IC50 = 30.04 μM). Further cellular mechanism studies in K562 cells elucidated that compound 7g triggered mitochondrial-related apoptosis by increasing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which was associated with upregulation of the gene and protein expression levels of Bax, downregulation of the gene and protein expression levels of Bcl-2 and activation of the caspase cascade. The above results suggested that compound 7g might be considered a promising scaffold for further modification of more potent anticancer agents.","Ma, Liwei; Zhang, Jinling; Wang, Xuemei; Yang, Jifang; Guo, Lina; Wang, Xiaoli; Song, Bo; Dong, Wei; Wang, Wenbao",European journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2021.113361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740546/,397

These programmes aim to expand access to resources and clinical expertise not readily available in the requesting patients' home country. However, they exist within the US healthcare system where domestic healthcare needs are unmet for many children. Focusing our analysis on US children's hospitals that have a societal mandate to provide medical care to a defined geographic population while simultaneously offering highly specialised healthcare services for the general population, we assume that, given their mandate, priority will be given to patients within their catchment area over other patients. We argue that beyond prioritising patients within their region and addressing inequities within US healthcare, US institutions should also provide care to children from countries where access to vital medical services is unavailable or deficient. In the paper, we raise and attempt to answer the following: (1) Do paediatric healthcare institutions have a duty to care for all children in need irrespective of their place of residence, including international patients? (2) If there is such a duty, how should this general duty be balanced against the special duty to serve children within a defined geographical area to which an institution is committed, when resources are strained? (3) Finally, how are institutional obligations manifest in paradigm cases involving international patients? We start with cases, evaluating clinical and contextual features as they inform the strength of ethical claim and priority for access. We then proceed to develop a general prioritisation framework based on them.","Berkman, Emily; Clark, Jonna; Diekema, Douglas; Jecker, Nancy S",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33753472/,397

There are several reports of gender differences related to infection and death due to COVID-19. This raises important questions such as ""Whether there are differences based on gender in risk and severity of infection or mortality rate?"" and ""What are the biological explanation and mechanisms underlying these differences?"" Emerging evidences have proposed sex-based immunological, genetic, and hormonal differences to explain this ambiguity. Besides biological differences, women have also faced social inequities and economic hardships due to this pandemic. Several recent studies have shown that independent of age males are at higher risk for severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Although susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 was found to be similar across both genders in several disease cohorts, a disproportionate death ratio in men can be partly explained by the higher burden of pre-existing diseases and occupational exposures among men. At immunological point of view, females can engage a more active immune response, which may protect them and counter infectious diseases as compared to men. This attribute of better immune responses towards pathogens is thought to be due to high estrogen levels in females. Here we review the current knowledge about sex differences in susceptibility, the severity of infection and mortality, host immune responses, and the role of sex hormones in COVID-19 disease.","Patil, Ashlesh; Tripathy, Jaya Prasad; Deshmukh, Vishwajit; Sontakke, Bharat; Tripathi, Satyendra C",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32945643/,397

Hospitals, mental health facilities, and other clinics face the challenge of providing continued care to a population that is under severe stress, while minimizing in-person visits that risk spreading the virus. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest integrated health care system in the United States, providing care at 1,286 sites. VHA ensured the continuity of mental health services after the COVID-19 outbreak by rapidly expanding its use of telemental health methods in the first weeks after the U.S. pandemic outbreak. VHA provided nearly 1.2 million telephone and video encounters to veterans in April 2020 and reduced in-person visits by approximately 80% when compared with the October 2019 to February 2020 period before the pandemic. By June 2020, VHA had an 11-fold increase in encounters using direct-to-home video and a fivefold increase in telephone contacts relative to before the pandemic. This article discusses research on the effectiveness of telemental health, VHA policies before COVID-19 that facilitated the use of telemental health systemwide, and VHA's actions that rapidly scaled use of telemental health during the first months of the outbreak. Key challenges and lessons learned from VHA's experience and implications for providers and health care systems regarding the use of telemental health to meet patients' mental health care needs during the pandemic are also discussed.

100718,"Anxiety, depression and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from a cross-sectional survey.",2021-02-28,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) has a number of well-established acute and chronic issues that can require revisional surgical procedures. There is no existing data to evaluate conversion of band patients with body mass index (BMI)<35 kg/m(2) from LAGB to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This study aims to report on the indications for and the safety profile of conversion of the LAGB to RYGB in patients with BMI<35 kg/m(2). METHODS A review of data from 200 consecutive conversions of LAGB to RYGB was conducted. Fifty-two patients whose BMI was<35 kg/m(2) were included in this analysis. Indications for conversion, technical details, early morbidity, length of hospital stay, and weight loss data were assessed. RESULTS Laparoscopic conversion to RYGB was performed in 100% of patients. The median BMI pre-RYGB was 32.8 kg/m(2). The most common indication for surgery was weight regain after removal of LAGB (28.8%). There was no mortality. Early morbidity was seen in 25% of patients; the most common complication was stricture of the gastrojejunal anastomosis (9 patients). CONCLUSION Morbidity resulting from conversion of LAGB to RYGB in patients with BMI <35 kg/m(2) is similar to that seen in the BMI>35 kg/m(2) population. The procedure is technically challenging and morbidity rates are higher than those reported for surgically 'naïve' patients. It is recommended that this procedure be undertaken by appropriately trained surgeons in high-volume bariatric centers to optimize safety and outcomes.","Walker, Daniel M; Hii, Michael W; Skinner, Christine E; Hopkins, George H",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2014.03.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986461/,397

102268,"Beyond the COVID Pandemic, Telemedicine, and Health Care.",2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND A clinical assay was implemented to perform next-generation sequencing (NGS) of genes commonly mutated in multiple cancer types. This report describes the feasibility and diagnostic yield of this assay in 381 consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS Clinical targeted sequencing of 23 genes was performed with DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue. The assay used Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture followed by Illumina HiSeq 2000, MiSeq, or HiSeq 2500 sequencing in a College of American Pathologists-accredited, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory. Single-nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion events were reported. This assay was performed before methods were developed to detect rearrangements by NGS. RESULTS Two hundred nine of all requisitioned samples (55%) were successfully sequenced. The most common reason for not performing the sequencing was an insufficient quantity of tissue available in the blocks (29%). Excisional, endoscopic, and core biopsy specimens were sufficient for testing in 95%, 66%, and 40% of the cases, respectively. The median turnaround time (TAT) in the pathology laboratory was 21 days, and there was a trend of an improved TAT with more rapid sequencing platforms. Sequencing yielded a mean coverage of 1318×. Potentially actionable mutations (ie, predictive or prognostic) were identified in 46% of 209 samples and were most commonly found in KRAS (28%), epidermal growth factor receptor (14%), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (4%), phosphatase and tensin homolog (1%), and BRAF (1%). Five percent of the samples had multiple actionable mutations. A targeted therapy was instituted on the basis of NGS in 11% of the sequenced patients or in 6% of all patients. CONCLUSIONS NGS-based diagnostics are feasible in NSCLC and provide clinically relevant information from readily available FFPE tissue.

Previously we reported that in many cancer types, upon ER stress, IRE1α binds to and triggers SRC activation resulting in KDEL receptor dispersion from the Golgi and suppression of retrograde transport. In this study, using a combination of molecular, biochemical, and imaging approaches, we discovered that in colon and lung cancer, upon ER stress, ER chaperones, such as GRP78 bypass the Golgi and unconventionally traffic to the cell surface via endosomal transport mediated by Rab GTPases (Rab4, 11 and 15). Such unconventional transport is driven by membrane fusion between ER-derived vesicles and endosomes requiring the v-SNARE BET1 and t-SNARE Syntaxin 13. Furthermore, GRP78 loading into ER-derived vesicles requires the co-chaperone DNAJC3 that is regulated by ER-stress induced PERK-AKT-mTOR signaling.","Van Krieken, Richard; Tsai, Yuan-Li; Carlos, Anthony J; Ha, Dat P; Lee, Amy S",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-021-03849-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974094/,397

MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed the records of 301 consecutive patients who underwent conventional partial nephrectomy between 2007 and 2010 with available data to meet inclusion criteria. Percent functional volume preservation was measured at a median of 1.4 years after surgery. Modification of diet in renal disease-2 estimated glomerular filtration rate was measured preoperatively and perioperatively, and a median of 1.2 years postoperatively. Statistical analysis was done to study associations. RESULTS Hypothermia or warm ischemia 25 minutes or less was applied in 75% of cases. Median percent functional volume preservation was 91% (range 38%-107%). Percent glomerular filtration rate preservation at nadir and late time points was 77% and 90% of preoperative glomerular filtration rate, respectively. On multivariate analysis percent functional volume preservation and warm ischemia time were associated with nadir glomerular filtration rate while only percent functional volume preservation was associated with late glomerular filtration rate (each p <0.001). Late percent glomerular filtration rate preservation and percent functional volume preservation were directly associated (p <0.001). Recovery of function to 90% or greater of percent functional volume preservation predicted levels was observed in 86% of patients. In patients with de novo postoperative stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease, percent functional volume preservation and Charlson score were associated with late percent glomerular filtration rate preservation. Warm ischemia time was not associated with late functional glomerular filtration rate decreases in patients considered high risk for ischemic injury. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort volume loss and not ischemia time was the primary determinant of ultimate renal function after partial nephrectomy. Technical modifications aimed at minimizing volume loss during partial nephrectomy while still achieving negative margins may result in improved functional outcomes.","Simmons, Matthew N; Hillyer, Shahab P; Lee, Byron H; Fergany, Amr F; Kaouk, Jihad; Campbell, Steven C",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2011.12.068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22425124/,397

106893,Considerations on the Implementation of the Telemedicine System Encountered with Stakeholders' Resistance in COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-09-18,"Background Horizontal care, in which clinicians assume roles outside of their usual responsibilities, is an important health care systems response to emergency situations. Allocating residents and fellows into skill-concordant clinical roles, however, is challenging. The most efficient method to accomplish graduate medical education (GME) assessment and deployment for horizontal care is not known. Objective We designed a categorization schema that can efficiently facilitate clinical and educational horizontal care delivery for trainees within a given institution. Methods In September 2019, as part of a general emergency response preparation, a 4-tiered system of trainee categorization was developed at one academic medical center. All residents and fellows were mapped to this system. This single institution model was disseminated to other institutions in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic began to affect hospitals nationally. In March 2020, a multi-institution collaborative launched the Trainee Pandemic Role Allocation Tool (TPRAT), which allows institutions to map institutional programs to COVID-19 roles within minutes. This was disseminated to other GME programs for use and refinement. Results The emergency response preparation plan was disseminated and selectively implemented with a positive response from the emergency preparedness team, program directors, and trainees. The TPRAT website was visited more than 100 times in the 2 weeks after its launch. Institutions suggested rapid refinements via webinars and e-mails, and we developed an online user's manual. Conclusions This tool to assess and deploy trainees horizontally during emergency situations appears feasible and scalable to other GME institutions.","Dennis, Bradley; Highet, Alexandra; Kendrick, Daniel; Mazer, Laura; Loiselle, Sean; Bandeh-Ahmadi, Hoda; Gupta, Tanvi; Abbott, Kenneth; Lea, Jarrett; Dang, Thu; Ramey, Mischon; George, Brian; Terhune, Kyla",Journal of graduate medical education,https://doi.org/10.4300/jgme-d-20-00290.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32595843/,397

STUDY DESIGN A 4-year retrospective review of cases of uvular injury and their resolution was conducted in adult patients who received general anesthesia at our institution. METHODS An extensive review was conducted of the quality assurance (QA) database maintained by the Department of Anesthesiology at our tertiary academic medical center. The database was searched for cases of uvular injury that occurred in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia that between January 2007 and December 2010. The medical records of identified patients were then obtained to evaluate the presentation, treatment and ultimate resolution of injury. RESULTS Ten cases of uvular injury were reported in the 28,788 general anesthetics conducted over a 3-year period in adult patients. This correlates to an incidence of 0.034%. Uvular injury occurred in mostly male patients (80%) during elective cases in the supine position. All cases were associated with endotracheal intubation. Additional objects, such as gastric tubes and esophageal temperature probes, were placed in the pharynx of 80% of these patients. Urologic procedures were associated with 50% of reported cases. Treatment ranged from observation to medical therapy. There were no permanent symptoms in any of the patients. CONCLUSION Uvular injury is a relatively rare complication that occurs in patients during the perioperative period who receive general anesthesia. While endotracheal intubation is closely associated with this type of injury, further study is required to elucidate the mechanism and other associated etiologic factors.","Pamnani, Anup; Faggiani, Susan L; Hood, Melanie; Kacker, Ashutosh; Gadalla, Farida",The Laryngoscope,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.23774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24150972/,397

OBJECTIVE The current study seeks to investigate the usage of RT in LGG and its effect on survival outcomes. METHODS Patients with diagnosis codes specific for LGG were queried from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) during the years 2004-2016. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank testing, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, and comparisons of estimated 3- and 7-year survival were performed to investigate the effect of RT on overall survival. RESULTS 19,382 patients with LGG were identified with histologically confirmed disease. Kaplan-Meier testing demonstrated RT impacted survival in patients undergoing biopsy or no surgery (p < 0.0001), no chemotherapy (p < 0.0001), and in regimens with early RT (p < 0.0001) and high-dose RT (p < 0.0001). Cox multivariate regression demonstrated RT and age less than 40 (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97, p = 0.001), no chemotherapy (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77-0.87, p < 0.001), and astrocytoma histology (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66-0.79, p < 0.001) were associated with improved survival. 3-year survival of RT versus non-RT groups showed increased survival rates for age less than 40 years (+ 5.7%, p < 0.0001), no surgery or biopsy (+ 8.1%, p < 0.0001), no chemotherapy (+ 10.3%, p < 0.0001), mixed glioma (+ 6.7%, p < 0.0001), astrocytoma (+ 7.1%, p < 0.0001), and in regimens with early RT (+ 7.6%, p < 0.0001) and high-dose RT (+ 4.7%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION This nationwide analysis of LGG patients found that RT was associated with improved survival outcomes in patients less than 40 years of age, with histology subtypes of astrocytoma and mixed glioma, undergoing biopsy or no surgery, and in regimens with early RT and high-dose RT.","Nunna, R S; Khalid, S; Ryoo, J S; Sethi, A; Byrne, R W; Mehta, A I",Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12094-020-02458-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691365/,397

For this period, a total of 175,705 procedures were submitted to the registry, 100,446 summarized as heart surgery procedures in a classical sense. The unadjusted in-hospital survival rate for the 34,224 isolated coronary artery bypass grafting procedures (relationship on-/off-pump 3.8:1) was 97.3%. For the 36,650 isolated heart valve procedures (16,625 transcatheter interventions included), it was 96.4%. Concerning short- and long-term circulatory support, a total of 2,716 extracorporeal life support/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation implantations, resp. 953 assist device implantations (L-/ R-/ BVAD, TAH) were registered. In 2019, the number of isolated heart transplantations increased to 333, a rise of 6.7% compared to the previous year. The isolated lung transplantations amounted to 311, a decrease of 8.5%. This annually updated registry of the GSTCVS represents voluntary public reporting by accumulating actual information for nearly all heart surgical procedures in Germany, constitutes advancements in heart medicine, and represents a basis for quality management for all participating institutions. In addition, the registry demonstrates that the provision of cardiac surgery in Germany is up to date, appropriate, and nationwide patient treatment is guaranteed all the time.","Beckmann, A; Meyer, R; Lewandowski, J; Markewitz, A; Gummert, J",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1710569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408357/,397
111521,Re-thinking patient stability for methadone in opioid treatment programs during a global pandemic: Provider perspectives.,2020-12-05,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Aminoglycoside antibiotics are positively charged molecules that are known to inhibit several ion channels. In this study, we have shown that aminoglycosides also inhibit the activity of Kir4.1 channels. Aminoglycosides inhibit Kir4.1 channels by a pore-blocking mechanism, plugging the central vestibule of the channel. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Patch-clamp recordings were made in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing Kir4.1 channels to analyze the effects of gentamicin, neomycin, and kanamycin. In silico modeling followed by mutagenesis were realized to identify the residues critical for aminoglycosides binding to Kir4.1. KEY RESULTS Aminoglycoside antibiotics block Kir4.1 channels in a concentration- and voltage-dependent manner, getting access to the protein from the intracellular side of the plasma membrane. Aminoglycosides block Ki4.1 with a rank order of potency as follows: gentamicin ˃ neomycin ˃ kanamycin. The residues T128 and principally E158, facing the central cavity of Kir4.1, are important structural determinants for aminoglycosides binding to the channel, as determined by our in silico modeling and confirmed by mutagenesis experiments. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Kir4.1 channels are also target of aminoglycoside antibiotics, which could affect potassium transport in several tissues.","Morán-Zendejas, Rita; Delgado-Ramírez, Mayra; Xu, Jie; Valdés-Abadía, Belkis; Aréchiga-Figueroa, Iván A; Cui, Meng; Rodríguez-Menchaca, Aldo A",British journal of pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726456/,397
111625,Authors' reply.,2019,"BACKGROUND A new dual resolution imaging x-ray detector system (Canon Medical Systems Corporation, Tochigi, Japan) has a standard resolution 194 µm pixel conventional flat-panel detector (FPD) mode and a high-resolution 76 µm high-definition (Hi-Def) mode in a single unit. The Hi-Def mode enhances the visualization of the intravascular devices. OBJECTIVE We report the clinical experience and physician evaluation of this new detector system with Hi-Def mode for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms using a Pipeline embolization device (PED). METHODS During intervention at our institute, under large field of view (FOV) regular resolution FPD mode imaging, the catheter systems and devices were first guided to the proximity of the treatment area. Final placement and deployment of the PED was performed under Hi-Def mode guidance. A post-procedure 9-question physician survey was conducted to qualitatively assess the impact of Hi-Def mode visualization on physicians' intraoperative decision-making. One-sample t-test was performed on the responses from the survey. Dose values reported by the x-ray unit were also recorded. RESULTS Twenty-five cases were included in our study. The survey results indicated that, for each of the nine questions, the physicians in all cases indicated that the Hi-Def mode improved visualization compared with the FPD mode. For the 25 cases, the mean cumulative entrance air kerma was 2.35 Gy, the mean dose area product (DAP) was 173.71 Gy.cm2, and the mean x-ray exposure time was 39.30 min. CONCLUSIONS The Hi-Def mode improves visualization of flow diverters and may help in achieving more accurate placement and deployment of devices.","Setlur Nagesh, Swetadri Vasan; Vakharia, Kunal; Waqas, Muhammad; Munich, Stephan A; Bednarek, Daniel R; Davies, Jason M; Snyder, Kenneth V; Mokin, Maxim; Rudin, Stephen; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-015551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32046993/,397
111684,Systemic Racism and Health Disparities: A Statement From Editors of Family Medicine Journals.,2021,"PURPOSE To conduct a retrospective evaluation of long-term survival after radiofrequency (RF) ablation for lung oligometastases from 5 types of primary lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study population consisted of 123 patients with lung oligometastases from colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small-cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal cancer, and renal-cell carcinoma treated with RF ablation. Lung oligometastases were defined as 1-5 metastases confined to the lung while the primary cancer and other metastases were eradicated. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were estimated for the overall study population and for patients with each type of primary lesion. The OS and RFS rates were compared with those of the patients with any of the other four primary lesion types. Finally, various variables were analyzed to determine what factors influenced OS and RFS. RESULTS The median follow-up was 45.7 months, and the 5-year OS and RFS rates for all 123 patients were 62% and 25%, respectively. The OS time for patients with metastases from CRC was significantly longer (P = .042); it was significantly shorter (P = .022) in patients with metastases from esophageal cancer. Longer disease-free interval was significantly (P = .015) associated with better OS. There was no variable significantly associated with OS and RFS on multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS Data from this single-center study appear promising in terms of long-term survival after RF ablation of lung oligometastases from 5 primary lesions.","Omae, Kenichi; Hiraki, Takao; Gobara, Hideo; Iguchi, Toshihiro; Fujiwara, Hiroyasu; Matsui, Yusuke; Toyooka, Shinichi; Nagasaka, Takeshi; Kanazawa, Susumu",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2016.05.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27461589/,397
111705,Clinical Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Attending Dermatologists.,2020-10-31,"PROBLEM The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) education. Medical schools and residency programs placed restrictions on bedside teaching and clinical scanning as part of risk mitigation. In response, POCUS faculty nationwide from 15 institutions collaborated on an alternative model of ultrasound education, A Distance-learning Approach to POCUS Training (ADAPT). APPROACH ADAPT was repeated monthly from April 1 through June 30, 2020. It accommodated 70 learners, who included 1- to 4-week rotators and asynchronous learners. The curriculum included assigned pre-work and learning objectives covering 20 core POCUS topics. A rotating group of 30 faculty and fellows delivered daily virtual teaching sessions that included gamification to increase learner engagement and hands-on instruction through teleguidance. After participation, faculty and learners completed anonymous surveys. OUTCOMES Educators reported a significant decrease in preparatory time (6.2 vs. 3.1 hours per week, P < .001) dedicated to ultrasound education after implementing ADAPT. The majority of 29 learners who completed surveys felt ""somewhat confident"" or ""very confident"" in their ability to acquire (n = 25, 86.2%) and interpret (n = 27, 93.1%) ultrasound images after the intervention; the majority of 22 educators completing surveys rated the program ""somewhat effective"" or ""very effective"" at contributing to learner's ability to acquire (n = 13, 59.1%) and interpret (n = 20, 90.9%) images. Most learners (n = 28, 96.6%) and all educators (n = 22, 100%) were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with ADAPT as a whole, and the large majority of educators were ""very likely"" (n = 18, 81.8%) to recommend continued use of this program. NEXT STEPS A virtual curriculum that pools the efforts of multiple institutions nationwide was implemented rapidly and effectively while satisfying educational expectations of both learners and faculty. This collaborative framework can be replicated and may be generalizable to other educational objectives.","Nix, Kahra; Liu, E Liang; Oh, Laura; Duanmu, Youyou; Fong, Tiffany; Ashenburg, Nicholas; Liu, Rachel B",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34524135/,397

In light of the spreading COVID-19 pandemic, the potential of face shields as a substitution for surgical masks was investigated. In order to determine the efficacy of the protective equipment we used a cough simulator. The protective equipment considered was placed on a manikin head that simulated human breathing. Concentration and size distribution of small particles that reached the manikin respiration pathways during the few tens of seconds following the cough event were monitored. Additionally, water sensitive papers were taped on the tested protective equipment and the manikin face. In the case of frontal exposure, for droplet diameter larger than 3 μm, the shield efficiency in blocking cough droplets was found to be comparable to that of regular surgical masks, with enhanced protection for portions of the face that the mask does not cover. Additionally, for finer particles, down to 0.3 µm diameter, a shield blocked about 10 times more fine particles than the surgical mask. When exposure from the side was considered, the performance of the shield was found to depend dramatically on its geometry. While a narrow shield allowed more droplets and aerosol to penetrate in comparison to a mask under the same configuration, a slightly wider shield significantly improved the performance. The source control potential of shields was also investigated. A shield, and alternatively, a surgical mask, were placed on the cough simulator, while the breathing simulator, situated 60 cm away in the jet direction, remained totally exposed. In both cases, no droplets or particles were found in the vicinity of the breathing simulator. Conducted experiments were limited to short time periods after expiratory events, and do not include longer time ranges associated with exposure to suspended aerosol. Thus, additional evidence regarding the risk posed by floating aerosol is needed to establish practical conclusions regarding actual transmittance reduction potential of face shields and surgical face masks.","Ronen, Ayala; Rotter, Hadar; Elisha, Shmuel; Sevilia, Sagi; Parizer, Batya; Hafif, Nir; Manor, Alon",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2020.1854459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315526/,397
114379,Usefulness of a Telemedicine Tool TELEA in the Management of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-06-04,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012 and is a highly pathogenic respiratory virus. There are no treatment options against MERS-CoV for humans or animals, and there are no large-scale clinical trials for therapies against MERS-CoV. To address this need, we developed an inactivated rabies virus (RABV) that contains the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein expressed on its surface. Our initial recombinant vaccine, BNSP333-S, expresses a full-length wild-type MERS-CoV S protein; however, it showed significantly reduced viral titers compared to those of the parental RABV strain and only low-level incorporation of full-length MERS-CoV S into RABV particles. Therefore, we developed a RABV-MERS vector that contained the MERS-CoV S1 domain of the MERS-CoV S protein fused to the RABV G protein C terminus (BNSP333-S1). BNSP333-S1 grew to titers similar to those of the parental vaccine vector BNSP333, and the RABV G-MERS-CoV S1 fusion protein was efficiently expressed and incorporated into RABV particles. When we vaccinated mice, chemically inactivated BNSP333-S1 induced high-titer neutralizing antibodies. Next, we challenged both vaccinated mice and control mice with MERS-CoV after adenovirus transduction of the human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) receptor and then analyzed the ability of mice to control MERS-CoV infection. Our results demonstrated that vaccinated mice were fully protected from the MERS-CoV challenge, as indicated by the significantly lower MERS-CoV titers and MERS-CoV and mRNA levels in challenged mice than those in unvaccinated controls. These data establish that an inactivated RABV-MERS S-based vaccine may be effective for use in animals and humans in areas where MERS-CoV is endemic. IMPORTANCE Rabies virus-based vectors have been proven to be efficient dual vaccines against rabies and emergent infectious diseases such as Ebola virus. Here we show that inactivated rabies virus particles containing the MERS-CoV S1 protein induce potent immune responses against MERS-CoV and RABV. This novel vaccine is easy to produce and may be useful to protect target animals, such as camels, as well as humans from deadly MERS-CoV and RABV infections. Our results indicate that this vaccine approach can prevent disease, and the RABV-based vaccine platform may be a valuable tool for timely vaccine development against emerging infectious diseases.","Wirblich, Christoph; Coleman, Christopher M; Kurup, Drishya; Abraham, Tara S; Bernbaum, John G; Jahrling, Peter B; Hensley, Lisa E; Johnson, Reed F; Frieman, Matthew B; Schnell, Matthias J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02040-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27807241/,397

115524,"Substance use disorder treatment, parenting, and COVID-19.",2020-12-01,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Renal impairment (RI) and renal drug-related problems (rDRP) often remain unrecognized in the community setting. A ""renal pharmacist consultant service"" (RPCS) at hospital admission can support patient safety by detecting rDRP. However, the efficient information sharing from pharmacists to physicians is still discussed. The aim of the study was to test the implementation of a RPCS and its effectiveness on prescription changes and to evaluate two ways of written information sharing with physicians. METHODS Urological patients with eGFRnon-indexed of 15-59 ml/min and ≥1 drug were reviewed for manifest and potential rDRP at admission by a pharmacist. Written recommendations for dose or drug adaptation were forwarded to physicians comparing two routes: July-September 2017 paper form in handwritten chart; November 2017-January 2018 digital PDF document in the electronic patient information system and e-mail alert. Prescription changes regarding manifest rDRP were evaluated and compared with a previous retrospective study without RPCS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The RPCS detected rDRP in 63 of 234 (26.9%) patients and prepared written recommendations (median 1 rDRP (1-5) per patient) concerning 110 of 538 (20.5%) drugs at admission. For manifest rDRP, acceptance rates of recommendations were 62.5% (paper) vs 42.9% (digital) (P = 0.16). Compared with the retrospective study without RPCS (prescription changes in 21/76 rDRP; 27.6%), correct prescribing concerning manifest rDRP significantly increased by 27.1%. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION A RPCS identifies patients at risk for rDRP and significantly increases appropriate prescribing by physicians. In our hospital (no electronic order entry, electronic chart or ward pharmacists), consultations in paper form seem to be superior to a digital PDF document.","Seiberth, Sarah; Bauer, Dominik; Schönermarck, Ulf; Mannell, Hanna; Stief, Christian; Hasford, Joerg; Strobach, Dorothea",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpt.13371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33609054/,397

METHODS MEPs were recorded in healthy participants using conventional EMG electrodes placed over the extensor carpi radialis muscle (ECR) and high-density surface EMG (HDsEMG). Fifty MEPs at 120% resting and active motor threshold were recorded. To determine the contribution of ECR to the MEPs, the amplitude distribution across HDsEMG channels was correlated with EMG activity recorded during a wrist extension task. RESULTS Whereas the conventional EMG identified MEPs from ECR in >90% of the stimulations, HDsEMG revealed that spatial amplitude distribution representative of ECR activation was observed less frequently at rest than while holding a contraction (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS MEPs recorded with conventional EMG may contain crosstalk from non-target muscles, especially when the stimulation is applied at rest.

Findings have suggested that gut microbiota play a major role in regulating brain functions through the gut-brain axis. A unique bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and maintenance of brain health could play a pivotal role in regulating incidences of neurodegenerative diseases. Contrarily, the present life style with changing food habits and disturbed circadian rhythm may contribute to gut homeostatic imbalance and dysbiosis leading to progression of several neurological disorders. Therefore, dysbiosis, as a primary factor behind intestinal disorders, may also augment inflammation, intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability through microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review primarily focuses on the gut-brain axis functions, specific gut microbial population, metabolites produced by gut microbiota, their role in regulating various metabolic processes and role of gut microbiota towards development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, several studies have reported a decrease in abundance of a specific gut microbial population and a corresponding increase in other microbial family, with few findings revealing some contradictions. Reports also showed that colonization of gut microbiota isolated from patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease leads to the development of enhance pathological outcomes in animal models.

In rare cases, the underlying pathology is a high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery. We report on a series of seven cases with occluded high-grade basilar artery stenosis who received endovascular therapy at our center. MATERIAL AND METHODS Our prospective database since October 2009 until September 2013 was screened for patients with acute basilar artery occlusion and underlying high-grade stenosis who underwent endovascular therapy. Case files were retrospectively reviewed for clinical, outcome, and technical data. RESULTS Seven patients were identified who suffered from an acute basilar artery occlusion based on a high-grade stenosis between October 2009 and September 2013. These patients were treated with an acute stenting of the basilar artery with or without a preceding mechanical thrombectomy. Median age was 75 (53-83) years; median prethrombectomy National Institute of Health Stroke scale score was 19 (7-28). A successful recanalization result defined as modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction grade 2b or higher was achieved in all cases. Two of the seven patients had a procedural complication consisting of a vessel dissection after angioplasty. A good clinical outcome according to the Solitaire flow restoration device versus the Merci Retriever in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (SWIFT) study criteria was achieved in three of the seven patients. One patient died during hospitalization in the acute phase. CONCLUSION Mechanical thrombectomy combined with acute stenting of the basilar artery is technically feasible and may be an effective therapeutic option in the rare case of an acutely occluded high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery in patients with an otherwise poor prognosis.","Behme, D; Weber, W; Mpotsaris, A",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-014-0303-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727890/,397
121458,Sleep and circadian rhythm characteristics in individuals from the general population during the French COVID-19 full lockdown.,2021-09-07,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus, which causes fatal severe diarrhea and leads to high mortality in newborn piglets. Inflammasomes are hub molecules that induce proinflammatory cytokine production and maturation to initiate innate immune defenses upon cellular infection. To date, the potential role of inflammasome in TGEV infection in porcine intestinal epithelial cells has not been elucidated. The present study aims to investigate the function of the inflammasome in response to TGEV infection in porcine intestinal epithelial cells. Our results revealed that TGEV infection induced the production of pro-interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β) and enhanced its processing and maturation in porcine intestinal epithelial cells through caspase-1 activation. In addition, TGEV infection in porcine intestinal epithelial cells induced pyroptosis, indicated by cell death and the production and cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD). Meanwhile, TGEV infection sufficiently activated the expression and assembly of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in porcine intestinal epithelial cells, and inhibition of NLRP3 blocked TGEV-induced IL-1β release. We also found that inhibition of NLRP3 enhanced the replication of TGEV without inducing cell death. In conclusion, these data demonstrated that activation of IL-1β release and pyroptosis is dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome, thus NLRP3 inflammasome may play a central role in the innate immune response to TGEV infection.","Wei, Guanghe; Luo, Shijin; Wu, Wanyan; Hu, Junye; Zhou, Rongqiong",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2020.0227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973805/,397

Insights from providers working in high STI-volume specialties.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Viral respiratory infections are associated with nearly 80% of asthma exacerbation episodes. These can have severe adverse outcomes in patients with established asthma. AIM The aim of the study was to identify the viral causes of acute respiratory infection that precipitate acute asthma exacerbation in Egyptian asthmatic children. PATIENTS AND METHODS The current prospective study was conducted in Cairo University Children's Hospitals from December 2010 to December 2011. All asthmatic children (n=130) aged 2-12 years admitted with asthma exacerbation due to severe lower respiratory tract infection were included. All cases were subjected to nasopharyngeal or throat swabs that were analyzed for common respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza B (Flu B), human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), influenza A (H1N1), and adenovirus (ADV) using the real-time PCR technique. All patients were followed up to record the outcome. RESULTS PCR analysis was positive for one respiratory virus in 54 asthmatic patients (41.5%) and was negative in 76 patients (58.5%), with a high predominance of RSV (51.9%) and hMPV (25.9%) especially in winter and early spring months. Hypoxia was detected in all patients with RSV infection; of these patients, 21.4% were admitted to the ICU, 14.3% required mechanical ventilation, and 14.3% died. In contrast, among those with hMPV infection, hypoxia was detected in 71.4%; none required ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS Viral etiology of lower respiratory tract infections constitutes an important cause of acute asthma exacerbation in asthmatic children admitted to children's hospitals in Cairo, supporting the need for large-scale multicentric studies on asthmatic patients over multiple years using a wider-panel PCR for detection of respiratory viruses.","Amin, Nadia M; El Basha, Noussa R; El Rifai, Nihal M; El Baz, Mohamed S; Draz, Iman H; El Kholy, Amani A; Sherif, May M",The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.epx.0000427636.90615.ad; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23528533/,397

Survival relies on intensive monitoring of hemostatic status. Thromboelastography (TEG) utilizes whole blood samples containing all the blood components of hemostasis and is therefore a sensitive indicator of the clinical status in the patient. This study was performed to assess the practicability of TEG in Asian elephants in a zoo environment. Citrated stabilized whole blood samples were obtained from 44 healthy Asian elephants. Kaolin-activated TEG was performed on whole blood at 60 min and 24 hr postsampling (to replicate shipment to an external laboratory) as well as on freeze-thawed plasma samples, 12-14 mo postsampling. Reference intervals were calculated for fresh whole blood and freeze-thawed plasma samples. In the 24-hr analysis, storage artifacts, likely due to cellular degeneration, resulted in a hypercoagulable thromboelastogram and thus reduced sensitivity for detecting coagulopathies. Therefore, delayed analysis of whole blood samples is not recommended.","Perrin, Kathryn L; Krogh, Anne K; Kjelgaard-Hansen, Mads; Howard, Lauren; Bochsen, Louise; Kiso, Wendy K; Schmitt, Dennis; Kristensen, Annemarie T; Bertelsen, Mads F",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2017-0179r.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29517458/,397

The distinct purpose of a given trial, advancing a novel treatment or examining routine clinical practice, determines the nature of essential data elements. Information gathering for an effective trial depends on ample data, adequate infrastructure, and properly planned statistical analyses. This review highlights the fact that successful future trials will require appropriate expertise that extends far beyond these basic considerations in order to move from identification of basic risk factors that are associated with outcomes to knowledge of pathophysiology and causation of outcomes. Efficient and productive data collection by local and central sites must be complemented by expert core lab adjudications. Source data archiving, including complete DICOM imaging datasets or biological specimens, are needed to maximize the potential for study interpretation and financial investment. Standard terminology, such as common data elements and definitions, enhance study comparisons. Screening logs attest to generalizability of a study. Real-time data transmission and core lab evaluation will be critical to guide adaptive trial design. Despite the overwhelming focus on the intervention in a particular treatment trial, individual pathophysiology must be considered.

Nonetheless, much remains unknown about their benefits and drawbacks. In order to understand their potential impact, we conducted a review of literature evaluating dyad leadership models in health systems. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH Our narrative review began with a search of PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and Scopus using key terms related to dyads and leadership. The search yielded 307 articles. We screened titles/abstracts according to these criteria: (1) focus on dyadic leadership model, i.e. physician-nurse or clinician-administrator, (2) set in health care environment and (3) peer-reviewed with an evaluative component of dyadic model. This yielded 22 articles for full evaluation, of which six were relevant for this review. FINDINGS These six articles contribute an assessment of (1) teamwork and communication perceptions and their changes through dyad implementation, (2) dyad model functionality within the health system, (3) lessons learned from dyad model implementation and (4) dyad model adoption and model fidelity. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS Research in this area remains nascent, and most articles focused on implementation over evaluation. It is possible that some articles were excluded due to our methodology, which excluded nonEnglish articles. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Findings provide guidance for health care organizations seeking to implement dyadic leadership models. Rigorous studies are needed to establish the impact of dyadic leadership models on quality and patient outcomes.

Decreased central nervous system [CNS] immune surveillance leading to this infection has been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis or Crohn's disease treated with anti-integrin antibody natalizumab. PF-00547659 is an investigational human monoclonal antibody for inflammatory bowel disease, targeted against α4β7-mucosal addressin cell-adhesion molecule-1 [the integrin ligand selectively expressed in the gut]. We hypothesised that this selective agent would not affect central nervous system immune surveillance. Methods Cerebrospinal fluid from five healthy volunteers, and from 10 patients with Crohn's disease previously treated with immunosuppressants, was evaluated to assess the feasibility of the study. Subsequently, 39 patients with active Crohn's disease and previous immunosuppression were evaluated over 12 weeks of PF-00547659-induction therapy. We measured total lymphocytes, T cell subsets in cerebrospinal fluid, and circulating β7+ memory cells. Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index. Results Patients treated with PF-00547659 had no reduction of cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytes, T-lymphocyte subsets, or CD4:CD8 ratio, whereas circulating β7+ memory cells increased significantly. A total of 28/35 [80%] patients had a clinical response and 27/34 [79%] had disease remission. Treatment-related adverse events, none serious, were reported in 23/49 [47%] patients. Conclusions In patients with active Crohn's disease, natalizumab therapy increases the risk for PML, and the increased risk is thought to be associated with iatrogenic leukopenia within the CNS. PML under PF-00547659 may be a lesser concern, as this agent did not reduce lymphocytes or T cell subsets in the cerebrospinal fluid.","D'Haens, Geert; Vermeire, Séverine; Vogelsang, Harald; Allez, Matthieu; Desreumaux, Pierre; Van Gossum, Andre; Sandborn, William J; Baumgart, Daniel C; Ransohoff, Richard M; Comer, Gail M; Ahmad, Alaa; Cataldi, Fabio; Cheng, John; Clare, Robert; Gorelick, Kenneth J; Kaminski, Annamarie; Pradhan, Vivek; Rivers, Sunday; Sikpi, Matthew O; Zhang, Yanhua; Hassan-Zahraee, Mina; Reinisch, Walter; Stuve, Olaf",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjx128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28961770/,397

Methods In a prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled design, 10 healthy female cats received each of the following treatments intramuscularly: hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg) and 0.9% saline (0.05 mL/kg) with a 1-week washout between treatments at 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Skin temperature and thermal thresholds (TTs) were recorded before and up to 12 hours after injection. Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures linear mixed model (α = 0.05). Results After saline treatment, TT was not significantly different from baseline at any time point for any age group. After hydromorphone treatment, TT was significantly higher than baseline at 6 months for up to 1 hour, and at 9 and 12 months for up to 4 hours. Peak TT at 6, 9, and 12 months were 50.4 ± 2.7, 50.9 ± 2.0, and 53.6 ± 2.0°C at 0.5, 1, and 1 hours, respectively. Mean TT was significantly higher after hydromorphone treatment when compared with saline treatment at 9 and 12 months for up to 4 hours but not at 6 months. Magnitude of antinociception was consistently larger at 12 months when compared with 6 months of age. Hydromorphone provided a shorter duration and smaller magnitude of antinociception at 6 months when compared with 9 and 12 months.

METHODS This proof-of-concept parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial included 99 patients. Following a 1-week washout, patients were randomized into three groups: OA group (fluoride toothpaste containing 0.1% OA and placebo mouthwash); negative control (fluoride toothpaste and placebo mouthwash); and CHX group (fluoride toothpaste and 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash). Patients were clinically assessed at inclusion, pre-washout visit, baseline, and after 4-days, 1-week, and 2-weeks of twice daily use of the products. Patients received a diary for documentation of bleeding on brushing and provided unstimulated saliva samples. RESULTS After two weeks, all groups showed significant reductions in all clinical parameters. The CHX group exhibited significantly greater reductions in gingival index and interproximal gingival index scores at week-2, as compared to patients in the negative control (p=0.04). In contrast, reductions in gingival index scores did not differ between CHX and OA groups and between OA and negative control groups at week-2. The CHX group had significantly greater reductions in plaque index scores at day-4, 1-week, and 2-week evaluations, as compared to the negative control and OA groups. The frequency of adverse events was similar among the groups. None of the groups reduced salivary transferrin levels. Finally, the OA group had the lowest percentage of self-reported bleeding events. CONCLUSION OA toothpaste failed to provide antiplaque and antigingivitis effects superior to those of a fluoride toothpaste after 2 weeks of use.","Ramírez, Gloria M; Villar, Cristina Cunha; Saraiva, Luciana; Benítez, Carlos G; Rubio, Carlos M; Malheiros, Zilson Magalhães; Stewart, Bernal; Kilpatrick, Latonya; Romito, Giuseppe A",International journal of dental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1111/idh.12526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046989/,397

METHODS This retrospective study included 144 patients undergoing CTC after incomplete colonoscopy from April 2006 to July 2008 at 2 separate medical centers. Each patient received 20 to 30 mL of diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution 2 hours before being scanned. RESULTS The distalmost extent of opacification was: stomach/small bowel, n = 13; cecum, n = 2; ascending colon, n = 7; transverse colon, n = 19; descending colon, n = 14; sigmoid colon, n = 24; rectum, n = 65. The mean attenuation of each opacified segment was: cecum, 449 Hounsfield units (HU); ascending colon, 474 HU; transverse colon, 468 HU; descending colon, 421 HU; sigmoid colon, 391 HU; and rectum, 382 HU. In 103 (71.5%) patients, oral contrast reached the distal colon (descending colon, sigmoid colon, or rectum). The oral contrast did not reach the colon in only 13 (9.0%) patients. CONCLUSIONS Oral administration of a small volume hyperosmolar oral contrast agent 2 hours before CTC results in satisfactory colonic opacification in the majority of patients. Adding same-day fluid tagging in incomplete colonoscopy patients presenting for completion CTC should result in adequate fluid opacification for most of the colon, especially proximal segments not visualized at the time of incomplete colonoscopy.","Chang, Kevin J; Rekhi, Satinder S; Anderson, Stephan W; Soto, Jorge A",Journal of computer assisted tomography,https://doi.org/10.1097/rct.0b013e3181f5a610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21160430/,397

In this article, we investigate the dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) of collective nature and the time-dependent Stokes shift (TDSS) of disputed nature. Our computational study of unconfined and confined water clearly demonstrates that the TDSS reflects local, non-collective dynamics. Surprisingly, we found that the reaction field continuum model (RFCM) used to estimate TDSS curves solely from collective DRS spectra correctly transforms collective dynamics to local ones even in cases when the relaxation time trends are quite different. This correct transformation is possible due to structural information available in the DRS amplitude in a Kivelsen-Madden like context.","Honegger, Philipp; Heid, Esther; Schröder, Christian; Steinhauser, Othmar",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp02840a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797139/,397

RESULTS The success rates of insertion through auscultation were 100% (32 of 32) for the right side and 88% (22 of 25) for the left side. Placement through auscultation was faster than that through bronchoscopy (mean 89.6 vs 141.1 s, P = 0.008) in the right-sided procedure but non-significant in the left-sided procedure (mean 138.5 vs 130 s, P = 0.795). Surgical grading of the operation field was not significantly different between both techniques (P = 0.502). Experienced anaesthesiologists took less time to position EBs (mean 91.0 vs 138.0 s, P = 0.015). Surgical grading was comparable between specialists and residents (P = 0.058). CONCLUSIONS Once an EB was correctly inserted and confirmed through auscultation, the corresponding surgical satisfaction was comparable to that through bronchoscopy. In the majority of cases, bronchoscopy is unnecessary for correct and efficient EB positioning. However, bronchoscopy is still mandatory in left-sided EB insertion and in patients with deviated tracheobronchial anatomy.

135696,Adolescent mental wellness: a systematic review protocol of instruments measuring general mental health and well-being.,2020-08-23,"INTRODUCTION Physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour are associated with numerous health problems and increasing risks of premature morbidity and mortality. Workplace health promotion with a focus on increasing physical activity (PA) and reducing sedentary behaviour is of growing interest. The concept of choice architecture with the use of nudges is a promising approach to influence decision making regarding health behaviours. It can help to understand why people often fail to act in their best interest, to follow well-informed preferences or to achieve their set goals. Nudges, the way the choice is presented, can help to overcome these challenges by using the same habits, biases or boundaries to alter our decision-making in favour of the more preferred behaviour. Aims of the scoping review will be to analyse (a) to what extent the concept of choice architecture is used in workplace health promotion to promote PA and/or to reduce sedentary behaviour and (b) which instruments (nudges) are used to archive that. METHODS AND ANALYSES Medline, PsychInfo, Web of Science and CINHAL will be searched from 2009 until June 2020. Applying a two-level screening process, title and abstracts will be screened according to a set of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included articles will be screened a second time to determine the extent to which choice architecture has been used. Analyses for publication year, location, setting and target group will be provided. Interventions will be analysed presenting the instruments used, number of studies per instrument, combinations of instruments and alteration of the environment. Outcome measures and results will be reported as they occur. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Due to the nature of the scoping review, ethical concerns are minimal. No patient data will be included. Results are published in peer-review journals.","Forberger, Sarah; Wichmann, Frauke; Comito, Chiara Nicoletta Nicoletta",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33444182/,397
137201,My strange but amazing year as president.,2020-05-06,"Emergence of insect-transmitted plant viruses over the past 10-20 years has been disproportionately driven by two so-called supervectors: the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, and the Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. High rates of reproduction and dispersal, extreme polyphagy, and development of insecticide resistance, together with human activities, have made these insects global pests. These supervectors transmit a diversity of plant viruses by different mechanisms and mediate virus emergence through local evolution, host shifts, mixed infections, and global spread. Associated virus evolution involves reassortment, recombination, and component capture. Emergence of B. tabaci-transmitted geminiviruses (begomoviruses), ipomoviruses, and torradoviruses has led to global disease outbreaks as well as multiple paradigm shifts. Similarly, F. occidentalis has mediated tospovirus host shifts and global dissemination and the emergence of pollen-transmitted ilarviruses. The plant virus-supervector interaction offers exciting opportunities for basic research and global implementation of generalized disease management strategies to reduce economic and environmental impacts.","Gilbertson, Robert L; Batuman, Ozgur; Webster, Craig G; Adkins, Scott",Annual review of virology,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-virology-031413-085410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26958907/,397

QLNC (1 mg/mL) presented 166 {plus minus} 39 nm, low polydispersity, and high encapsulation (93.0 {plus minus} 1.4%). Model building using experimental data from total and unbound plasma and unbound brain concentrations obtained by microdialysis after administration of single i.v. bolus dose of FQ or QLNC to naïve and SCZ-like rats. A two-compartment model was identifiable both in blood and in brain with a bi-directional drug transport across the blood-brain barrier (CLin and CLout). SCZ-like rats significant decrease in brain exposure with FQ (decrease in CLin) was reverted by QLNC showing that nanocarriers govern quetiapine tissue distribution. Model simulations allowed exploring the potential of LCN for brain delivery. Significance Statement A population approach was used to simultaneously model total and unbound plasma and unbound brain quetiapine concentrations allowing for quantification of the rate and extent of drug's brain distribution following administration of both free drug in solution or as nanoformulation to naïve and SCZ-like rats. The model-based approach is useful to better understand the possibilities and limitations of this nanoformulation for drug delivering to the brain, opening the opportunity to use this approach to improve SCZ-treatment limited response rates.","Carreño, Fernando; Helfer, Victória E; Staudt, Keli J; Olivo, Laura B; Paese, Karina; Meyer, Fabíola S; Herrmann, Ana P; Guterres, Sílvia S; Rates, Stela Maris Kuze; Trocóniz, Iñaki F; Dalla Costa, Teresa",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.120.000109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719070/,397
137578,Primary Care Is Dead. Long Live Primary Care.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Although the treatment window for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has been extended in recent years, it has been proven that recanalizing treatment must be administered as soon as possible. We present a new standard operating procedure (SOP) to reduce in-house delay, standardize periinterventional management and improve patient safety during MT. METHODS KEep Evaluating Protocol Simplification In Managing Periinterventional Light Sedation for Endovascular Stroke Treatment (KEEP SIMPLEST) was a prospective, single-center observational study aimed to compare aspects of periinterventional management in AIS patients treated according to our new SOP using a combination of esketamine and propofol with patients having been randomized into conscious sedation (CS) in the Sedation versus Intubation for Endovascular Stroke TreAtment (SIESTA) trial. Primary outcome was early neurological improvement at 24h using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and secondary outcomes were door-to-recanalization, recanalization grade, conversion rate and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months. RESULTS Door-to-recanalization time (128.6 ± 69.47 min vs. 156.8 ± 75.91 min; p = 0.02), mean duration of MT (92.01 ± 52 min vs. 131.9 ± 64.03 min; p < 0.001), door-to-first angiographic image (51.61 ± 31.7 min vs. 64.23 ± 21.53 min; p = 0.003) and computed tomography-to-first angiographic image time (31.61 ± 20.6 min vs. 44.61 ± 19.3 min; p < 0.001) were significantly shorter in the group treated under the new SOP. There were no differences in early neurological improvement, mRS at 3 months or other secondary outcomes between the groups. Conversion rates of CS to general anesthesia were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION An SOP using a novel sedation regimen and optimization of equipment and procedures directed at a leaner, more integrative and compact periinterventional management can reduce in-house treatment delays significantly in stroke patients receiving thrombectomy in light sedation and demonstrated the safety and feasibility of our improved approach.","Schönenberger, Silvia; Weber, Dorothea; Ungerer, Matthias N; Pfaff, Johannes; Schieber, Simon; Uhlmann, Lorenz; Heidenreich, Pia; Bendszus, Martin; Kieser, Meinhard; Wick, Wolfgang; Möhlenbruch, Markus A; Ringleb, Peter A; Bösel, Julian",Neurocritical care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-018-00667-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659468/,397
138681,The impact of video-mediated communication on closed wound assessments in post-operative consultations: a conversation analytical study of video-mediated and co-present consultations.,2020-04-08,"BACKGROUND Nivolumab, an anti-programmed death-1 agent, showed survival benefits in Asian patients, including Japanese, with gastric/gastro-esophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer. We report the analysis of the Japanese subpopulation from ATTRACTION-2 that evaluated nivolumab versus placebo in unresectable advanced or recurrent G/GEJ cancer after ≥ 2 chemotherapy regimens. METHODS Data from the Japanese subpopulation in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial were analyzed (data cutoff, February 25, 2017). Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS Among the overall study population of 493 patients, 226 (nivolumab 152; placebo 74) were enrolled from 28 sites in Japan. In the Japanese subset, median OS was longer with nivolumab versus placebo (5.4 months, 95% CI 4.6-7.4 versus 3.6 months, 95% CI 2.8-5.0). The risk of death was lower in the nivolumab versus placebo group (hazard ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.78; p = 0.0002). Incidences of serious adverse events were 23% (35/152) and 25% (18/72) in the nivolumab and placebo groups, respectively. In the Japanese ITT population, 22% of nivolumab-treated and 28% of placebo-treated patients received prior ramucirumab treatment. Overall, clinical activity of nivolumab was observed regardless of prior ramucirumab use. In the nivolumab group, ORR and PFS were numerically higher in patients with prior ramucirumab use than in those without. CONCLUSIONS In the Japanese subpopulation, patients receiving nivolumab had longer OS, similar to the overall population, with a manageable safety profile. The interaction between nivolumab and ramucirumab will be clarified in ongoing clinical trials.","Kato, Ken; Satoh, Taroh; Muro, Kei; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Tamura, Takao; Hamamoto, Yasuo; Chin, Keisho; Minashi, Keiko; Tsuda, Masahiro; Yamaguchi, Kensei; Machida, Nozomu; Esaki, Taito; Goto, Masahiro; Komatsu, Yoshito; Nakajima, Takako Eguchi; Sugimoto, Naotoshi; Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Oki, Eiji; Nishina, Tomohiro; Tsuji, Akihito; Fujii, Hirofumi; Kunieda, Kenji; Saitoh, Soh; Omuro, Yasushi; Azuma, Mizutomo; Iwamoto, Yasuo; Taku, Keisei; Fushida, Sachio; Chen, Li-Tzong; Kang, Yoon-Koo; Boku, Narikazu",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-018-0899-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30506519/,397

This study aimed to examine stress levels and causal stressors for perceived stress and generalized anxiety in the Indian population related to the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 300 adults were invited to participate in the online study via snowball and virtual snowball sampling. They were requested to complete electronic survey forms for assessing perceived stress and anxiety, and questions related to psychosocial stressors. Frequency and percentage were used for categorical variables. One-way ANOVA test was applied to compare responses based on gender, level of education, employment, and place of residence. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result: In total, 257 out of the 300 invited, responded and completed the survey. Men accounted for 58% (n=149) of the respondents. Overall, 84% (n=217) of participants had moderate to severe levels of perceived stress and 88% (n=228) had moderate to severe levels of anxiety. Women, as well as those not employed, reported significantly higher perceived stress and anxiety, urban residents reported higher perceived stress, while level of education had no difference in terms of perceived stress as well as anxiety. Fear of contracting COVID-19 was the highest stressor followed by difficulties in executing a routine exercise schedule and worry about the future. Conclusion: The psychosocial impact of the nationwide lockdown on the Indian population has been high. Vulnerable groups for increased stress and anxiety include women, younger ages, and the unemployed. The stressors recognized include fear of contracting COVID-19, inability to execute a routine exercise schedule and worry about the future.","Wakode, Naina; Wakode, Santosh; Santoshi, John",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.26371.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367620/,397

However, little is known about the impact of the severity of angiographic dissection on future restenosis. METHODS A total of 319 consecutive de novo femoropopliteal lesions were treated by balloon angioplasty alone. All of these lesions were divided into three groups: group A, no angiographic dissection; group B, mild dissection, the width of the dissection was less than one-third of the lumen; and group C, severe dissection, the width of the dissection was more than one-third of the lumen. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated the primary patency rate at 3 years between the groups. RESULTS The primary patency rates at 3 years were 66.0% in group A, 63.8% in group B, and 32.5% in group C (log-rank, P < .001). Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that a lesion length >100 mm (hazard ratio, 1.734; 95% confidence interval, 1.099-2.735; P = .018) and severe angiographic dissection (hazard ratio, 1.956; 95% confidence interval, 1.276-2.997; P = .002) were predictors of primary patency loss at 3 years. When the lesions were divided into two groups according to the lesion length >100 mm or not, angiographic dissection had a larger impact on restenosis in a long lesion >100 mm (≤100 mm: 65.5% in group A, 75.6% in group B, and 48.0% in group C [log-rank, P = .015]; >100 mm: 68.8% in group A, 42.5% in group B, and 24.2% in group C [log-rank, P = .017]). CONCLUSIONS Severe angiographic dissection was associated with future restenosis after balloon angioplasty for femoropopliteal lesions, but mild angiographic dissection was not. Angiographic dissection had more impact on future restenosis particularly in treated long lesions. Stents might not be necessary in short lesions with mild dissection.","Kobayashi, Norihiro; Hirano, Keisuke; Yamawaki, Masahiro; Araki, Motoharu; Sakai, Tsuyoshi; Sakamoto, Yasunari; Mori, Shinsuke; Tsutsumi, Masakazu; Honda, Yohsuke; Ito, Yoshiaki",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2017.08.092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29242063/,397
140588,Clinician Satisfaction with Rapid Adoption and Implementation of Telehealth Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-02-19,"INTRODUCTION Recently, mutations in the collagen gene COL6A3 have been reported in patients with autosomal-recessive, isolated dystonia (DYT27). Zebrafish models of COL6A3 mutations showed deficits in axonal targeting mechanisms. Therefore, COL6A3 mutations have been considered to contribute to irregular sensorimotor circuit formation. To test this hypothesis, we examined structural abnormalities in cerebral fiber tracts of dystonia patients with COL6A3 mutations using diffusion tensor imaging. METHODS We performed a voxel-wise statistical analysis to compare fractional anisotropy within whole-brain white matter in four of the previously reported dystonia patients with COL6A3 mutations and 12 healthy controls. Region of interests-based probabilistic tractography was performed as a post-hoc-analysis. RESULTS Dystonia patients with COL6A3 mutations showed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy bilaterally in midbrain, pons, cerebellar peduncles, thalamus, internal capsule and in frontal and parietal subcortical regions compared to healthy controls. Tractography revealed a decreased fractional anisotropy in patients with COL6A3-associated dystonia between bilateral dentate nucleus and thalamus. CONCLUSION Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrates an altered white matter structure especially in various parts of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network in dystonia patients with COL6A3 mutations. This suggests that COL6A3 mutations could contribute to abnormal circuit formation as potential basis of dystonia.","Jochim, Angela; Li, Yong; Zech, Michael; Lam, Daniel; Gross, Nadine; Koch, Kathrin; Zimmer, Claus; Winkelmann, Juliane; Haslinger, Bernhard",Parkinsonism & related disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parkreldis.2017.10.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29066004/,397

142637,The Telemedicine Takeover: Lessons Learned During an Emerging Pandemic.,2021-06-10,"PURPOSE Dexamethasone intravitreal implant (DEX implant, Ozurdex(®); Allergan, Inc.) is used to treat noninfectious posterior uveitis and macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion and diabetic retinopathy. Two recently published reports of DEX implant fragmentation shortly after injection have raised concerns about the potential for faster implant dissolution and elevated ocular dexamethasone concentrations. This study compared the in vivo release profile and pharmacokinetic behavior of intact and fragmented DEX implants. METHODS DEX implant was surgically implanted as a single unit or fragmented into 3 pieces in the posterior segment of opposing eyes of 36 New Zealand white rabbits. The release of dexamethasone over time from 1-piece and 3-piece fragmented implants dissolved in solution in vitro was compared with that from the 1-piece and 3-piece fragmented implants placed in the rabbit eyes. In addition, dexamethasone concentrations in the vitreous and aqueous humors of each eye were measured at 3 h and days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28. High-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used for assays. RESULTS Dexamethasone release from the 1-piece and 3-piece DEX implants in vivo was not different and was consistent with the in vitro release pattern. Moreover, the concentration profile of dexamethasone in the vitreous and aqueous humors was similar for the 1-piece and 3-piece DEX implants at each time point measured. CONCLUSIONS DEX implant fragmentation neither accelerated its dissolution nor increased the dexamethasone concentration delivered at a given time. Accordingly, DEX implant fragmentation is unlikely to have clinically significant effects in patients.","Bhagat, Rahul; Zhang, Jean; Farooq, Sidiq; Li, Xiao-Yan",Journal of ocular pharmacology and therapeutics : the official journal of the Association for Ocular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1089/jop.2014.0082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25411827/,397

Although it is common to ascertain frailty status utilizing claims-based surrogates (e.g. diagnosis and health service codes) selected according to clinical knowledge, the accuracy of this approach has not yet been examined. We evaluated the accuracy of claims-based surrogates against two clinical definitions of frailty. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted in a Health and Retirement Study subsample of 3097 participants, aged 65 years or older and with at least 12-months of continuous fee-for-service Medicare enrollment. We defined 18 previously utilized claims-based surrogates of frailty from Medicare data and evaluated each against clinical reference standards, ascertained from a direct examination: a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI) (range: 0-1) and frailty phenotype. We also compared the accuracy of the total count of 18 claims-based surrogates with that of a validated claims-based FI model, comprised of 93 claims-based variables. RESULTS 19% of participants met clinical criteria for the clinical frailty phenotype. The mean clinical FI for our sample was 0.20 (standard deviation 0.13). Hospital Beds and associated supplies was the claims-based surrogate associated with the highest clinical FI (mean FI 0.49). Claims-based surrogates had low sensitivity ranging from 0.01 (cachexia, adult failure to thrive, anorexia) to 0.38 (malaise and fatigue) and high specificity ranging from 0.79 (malaise and fatigue) to 0.99 (cachexia, adult failure to thrive, anorexia) in discriminating the clinical frailty phenotype. Compared with a validated claims-based FI, the total count of claims-based surrogates demonstrated lower Spearman correlation with the clinical FI (0.41 [95% CI 0.38-0.44] versus 0.59 [95% CI, 0.56-0.61]) and poorer discrimination of the frailty phenotype (C-statistics 0.68 [95% CI, 0.66-0.70] versus 0.75 [95% CI, 0.73-0.77]). CONCLUSIONS Claims-based surrogates, selected according to clinical knowledge, do not accurately capture frailty in Medicare claims data.

All three deadly CoVs originated from bats and transmitted to humans via various intermediate animal reservoirs. It remains highly possible that other global COVID pandemics will emerge in the coming years caused by yet another spillover of a bat-derived SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) into humans. Determining the Ag and the human B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitope landscapes that are conserved among human and animal coronaviruses should inform in the development of future pan-coronavirus vaccines. In the current study, using several immunoinformatics and sequence alignment approaches, we identified several human B cell and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes that are highly conserved in 1) greater than 81,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences identified in 190 countries on six continents; 2) six circulating CoVs that caused previous human outbreaks of the common cold; 3) nine SL-CoVs isolated from bats; 4) nine SL-CoV isolated from pangolins; 5) three SL-CoVs isolated from civet cats; and 6) four MERS strains isolated from camels. Furthermore, the identified epitopes: 1) recalled B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from both COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and 2) induced strong B cell and T cell responses in humanized HLA-DR1/HLA-A*02:01 double-transgenic mice.

Hurricane Irma made landfall in the Florida Keys (Monroe County) as a Category 4 hurricane on September 10, 2017. The hurricane caused substantial damage to 65% of homes and resulted in 40 persons injured and 17 deaths from hurricane-related causes.* During 2018, the county suicide rate increased to 34.9 per 100,000 population from the 5-year (2013-2017) average of 25.2 per 100,000 population (1). In May 2019, 20 months after the hurricane, the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) conducted a modified Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) to assess the community's mental, physical, and economic health and develop public health interventions to decrease the suicide rate. A consenting adult member from 231 households was interviewed, and a weighted cluster analysis was conducted to estimate the number and percentage of households throughout the Florida Keys with a particular response, as well as the number and percentage of persons at risk for suicide. During the 20 months since Hurricane Irma, 17% of households reported a need for a mental health care provider; 37.9% of these did not receive those services. A modified CASPER was used to calculate population estimates of suicide risk in an area of high landfall for hurricanes; estimated population suicide risk was 7.3%. Respondents reported worsening of respiratory conditions (17.7%), anxiety (17.0%), and depression (11.3%). Emergency preparedness plans should consider strengthening mental health service delivery after a hurricane, particularly during the long-term recovery phase.","Torres-Mendoza, Yaritbel; Kerr, Alison; Schnall, Amy Helene; Blackmore, Carina; Hartley, Summer D",MMWR.

145656,Primary care physician-led health reform--reply.,2014,"Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infectious diarrhoea. However, it is increasingly appreciated that healthcare-associated infections derive from both community and healthcare environments, and that the primary sites of C. difficile transmission may be strain-dependent. We conducted a multisite genomic epidemiology study to assess differential genomic evidence of healthcare vs community spread for two of the most common C. difficile strains in the USA: sequence type (ST) 1 (associated with ribotype 027) and ST2 (associated with ribotype 014/020). We performed whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses on 382 ST1 and ST2 C. difficile isolates recovered from stool specimens collected during standard clinical care at 3 geographically distinct US medical centres between 2010 and 2017. ST1 and ST2 isolates both displayed some evidence of phylogenetic clustering by study site, but clustering was stronger and more apparent in ST1, consistent with our healthcare-based study more comprehensively sampling local transmission of ST1 compared to ST2 strains. Analyses of pairwise single-nucleotide variant (SNV) distance distributions were also consistent with more evidence of healthcare transmission of ST1 compared to ST2, with 44 % of ST1 isolates being within two SNVs of another isolate from the same geographical collection site compared to 5.5 % of ST2 isolates (P-value=<0.001). Conversely, ST2 isolates were more likely to have close genetic neighbours across disparate geographical sites compared to ST1 isolates, further supporting non-healthcare routes of spread for ST2 and highlighting the potential for misattributing genomic similarity among ST2 isolates to recent healthcare transmission. Finally, we estimated a lower evolutionary rate for the ST2 lineage compared to the ST1 lineage using Bayesian timed phylogenomic analyses, and hypothesize that this may contribute to observed differences in geographical concordance among closely related isolates. Together, these findings suggest that ST1 and ST2, while both common causes of C. difficile infection in hospitals, show differential reliance on community and hospital spread. This conclusion supports the need for strain-specific criteria for interpreting genomic linkages and emphasizes the importance of considering differences in the epidemiology of circulating strains when devising interventions to reduce the burden of C. difficile infections.","Miles-Jay, Arianna; Young, Vincent B; Pamer, Eric G; Savidge, Tor C; Kamboj, Mini; Garey, Kevin W; Snitkin, Evan S",Microbial genomics,https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180789/,397

However, understanding the connectivity of these regions and the critical principles underlying these self-functions are lacking. Because brain activity linked to self-related processes are intrinsic, the resting-state method has received substantial attention in the field. Here, we focused on resting-state functional connectivity matrices based on brain asymmetry as indexed by the differential partition of the connectivity located in mirrored positions of the two hemispheres, hemispheric specialization measured using the intra-hemispheric (left or right) connectivity, brain communication via inter-hemispheric interactions, and global connectivity as the sum of the two intra-hemispheric Combining machine learning techniques with hypothesis-driven network mapping approaches, we demonstrated that orientations of independence and interdependence were best predicted by the asymmetric matrix compared to brain communication, hemispheric specialization, and global connectivity matrices. The network results revealed that there were distinct asymmetric connections between the default mode network, the salience network and the executive control network for orientations of independence and interdependence. These analyses shed light on the importance of brain asymmetry in understanding how complex self-functions are optimally represented in the brain networks.","Shi, Gen; Li, Xuesong; Zhu, Yifan; Shang, Ruihong; Sun, Yang; Guo, Hua; Sui, Jie",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34252524/,397

No effective pharmacologic therapies exist, and the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. We aimed to explore the mechanisms of bile duct repair after targeted BEC injury. Injection of intermedilysin into BEC-specific human CD59 (hCD59) transgenic mice induced acute and specific BEC death, representing a model to study the early signals that drive bile duct repair. Acute BEC injury induced cholestasis followed by CCR2+ monocyte recruitment and BEC proliferation. By using microdissection and next generation RNA sequencing, we identified five genes that were most upregulated in proliferating BECs after acute injury including Mapk8ip2, Cdkn1a, Itgb6, Rgs4, and Ccl2. Immunohistochemistry analyses confirmed robust upregulation of integrin αvβ6 (ITGβ6) expression in this BEC injury model, after bile duct ligation, and in patients with chronic cholangiopathies. Deletion of Itgb6 gene attenuated BEC proliferation post-acute bile duct injury. Macrophage depletion or Ccr2-deficiency impaired ITGβ6 expression and BEC proliferation. In vitro experiments revealed that bile-acid activated monocytes promoted BEC proliferation through ITGβ6. Our data suggest that BEC injury induces cholestasis, monocyte recruitment, and induction of ITGβ6, which work together to promote BEC proliferation, and that therefore represent potential therapeutic targets for cholangiopathies.","Guillot, Adrien; Guerri, Lucia; Feng, Dechun; Kim, Seung-Jin; Ait Ahmed, Yeni; Paloczi, Janos; He, Yong; Schuebel, Kornel; Dai, Shen; Liu, Fengming; Pacher, Pal; Kisseleva, Tatiana; Qin, Xuebin; Goldman, David; Tacke, Frank; Gao, Bin",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci132305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33724957/,397

To evaluate the more effective modality of laparoscopic gastrectomy in obese patients, we compared the early surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted and totally laparoscopic gastrectomy. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed early surgical outcomes in 1,480 consecutive patients who underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer between April 2004 and July 2010. To compare surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with those of totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) in 76 obese patients (LADG, n = 39; TLDG, n=37), the patients were classified as either obese or nonobese. The obesity was defined using the WHO classification BMI cutoff of 30 kg/m2. RESULTS In the analysis of surgical outcomes of the LADG group, there were significant differences between the obese and nonobese groups with respect to operative time (P=0.004, obese, 171.8 min; nonobese, 141.0 min), time to first flatus (P=0.027, obese, 3.3 days; nonobese, 3.1 days), commencement of soft diet (P=0.040, obese, 4.6 days; nonobese, 4.0 days), postoperative complication rate (P=0.045, obese, 15.4%; nonobese, 6.5%), and postoperative hospital stay (P=0.014, obese, 8.9 days; nonobese, 7.2 days). In TLDG group, on the other hand, there were no significant differences in surgical outcomes between the groups. CONCLUSION Based on these findings, early surgical outcomes of LADG were strongly influenced by the obesity. TLDG without minilaparotomy, however, was unaffected by the obesity. These findings strongly suggest that TLDG could be a safe procedure to avoid the impact of obesity.","Kim, Min Gyu; Kim, Kap Choong; Kim, Beom Su; Kim, Tae Hwan; Kim, Hee Sung; Yook, Jeong Hwan; Kim, Byung Sik",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-011-1034-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21424875/,397

Unlike nucleotide sequences, the estimation of the recombination rate in protein sequences has been little explored, neither implemented in evolutionary frameworks, despite protein sequencing methods are largely used. RESULTS In order to accommodate this need, here I present a computational framework, called ProteinEvolverABC, to jointly estimate recombination and substitution rates from alignments of protein sequences. The framework implements the approximate Bayesian computation approach, with and without regression adjustments, and includes a variety of substitution models of protein evolution, demographics and longitudinal sampling. It also implements several nuisance parameters such as heterogeneous amino acid frequencies and rate of change among sites and, proportion of invariable sites. The framework produces accurate coestimation of recombination and substitution rates under diverse evolutionary scenarios. As illustrative examples of usage, I applied it to several viral protein families, including coronaviruses, showing heterogeneous substitution and recombination rates. AVAILABILITY ProteinEvolverABC is freely available from https://github.com/miguelarenas/proteinevolverabc, includes a graphical user interface for helping the specification of the input settings, extensive documentation and ready-to-use examples.

Therefore a series of prevention measures target the avoidance of microaspiration. However, although some of these can minimize microaspiration, benefits in terms of VAP prevention are not always obvious. Polyurethane-cuffed endotracheal tubes successfully reduce microaspiration but high quality data demonstrating VAP rate reduction are lacking. An analogous conclusion can be made regarding taper-shaped cuffs compared with classic barrel-shaped cuffs. More clinical data regarding these endotracheal tube designs are needed to demonstrate clinical value in addition to in vitro-based evidence. The clinical usefulness of endotracheal tubes developed for subglottic secretions drainage is established in multiple studies and confirmed by meta-analysis. Any change in cuff design will fail to prevent microaspiration if the cuff is insufficiently inflated. At least one well-designed trial demonstrated that continuous cuff pressure monitoring and control decrease the risk of VAP. Gel lubrication of the cuff prior to intubation temporarily hampers microaspiration through sludging the channels formed by folds in high volume-low pressure cuffs. As the beneficial effect of gel lubrication is temporarily, its potential to reduce VAP risk is probably nonsignificant. A minimum positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 5 cmH2O can be recommended as it reduces the risk of microaspiration in vitro and in vivo. One randomized controlled study demonstrated a reduced risk of VAP in patients ventilated with PEEP (5-8 cmH2O). Regarding head-of-bed elevation, it can be recommended to avoid supine positioning. Whether a 45° head-of-bed elevation is to be preferred above 25-30° head-of-bed elevation remains unproven. Finally, the routine monitoring of gastric residual volumes in mechanically ventilated patients receiving enteral nutrition cannot be recommended.","Blot, Stijn I; Poelaert, Jan; Kollef, Marin",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25430629/,397

METHODS A retrospective study was performed by enrolling 49 patients (26 men and 23 women) with transverse fractures of the C2 axis body who were treated at four national trauma centers of tertiary university hospitals from January 2000 to December 2017. The mean age of the patients was 60.8 years (ranging from 21 to 90 years). We classified 49 transverse fractures of the C2 body into three types based on fracture trajectories involving superior articular facet (SAF) and lateral cortex (LC) of the C2 body on coronal CT as follows: Type 1, involvement of C2 SAF on both sides; Type 2, unilateral involvement of C2 SAF on one side and LC on the other side; Type 3, involvement of LC on both sides. The characteristics, treatment methods, and results of 49 transverse fractures of the C2 body were analyzed. Mean follow-up was 12.6 months (ranging from 12 to 26 months). RESULTS Twenty-six (53.1%) patients were Type 1, 21 (42.9%) were Type 2, and 2 (4.0%) were Type 3. Correlation coefficients for intra-observer and inter-observer reliabilities of classification were 0.723 and 0.598 (both, P < 0.001), respectively. About 40.8% (7 Type 1 and 13 Type 2) of the patients had fracture displacement >3 mm; Incidence of fracture displacement >3 mm was higher in Type 2 than Type 1 (61.9% vs 26.9%, P < 0.05). About 79.6% (20 Type 1, 17 Type 2 and 2 Type 3) of the patients were treated conservatively, and 20.4% (6 Type 1 and 4 Type 2) underwent surgery. At last follow-up, 47 out of 49 patients achieved fusion; overall fusion rate was 95.9%. All conservatively treated Type 1 and Type 3 patients achieved fusion. Out of 17 conservatively treated Type 2 patients, 15 achieved fusion but two developed nonunion; however, two nonunion patients opted not to undergo surgery. Subgroup analysis showed that Philadelphia brace caused nonunion significantly in fracture displacement >3 mm compared to Minerva brace/Halovest (100% vs 0%, P < 0.05). All surgically treated Type 1 and 2 patients achieved fusion. In terms of clinical outcomes, neck pain visual analog scale and neck disability index were significantly improved (both, P < 0.01). According to Odom's criteria, 93.9% (46/49) of the patients achieved satisfactory outcomes. No major complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS The majority of transverse fractures of C2 body can be treated conservatively. However, surgery or rigid Minerva brace/Halovest should be considered for Type 2 transverse fractures of the C2 body with fracture displacement >3 mm.","Kim, Sung-Kyu; Ko, Jong-Hyun; Park, Jong-Beom; Seo, Hyoung-Yeon; Chang, Dong-Gune; Chang, Kibong",Orthopaedic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/os.13013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047054/,397

Seven years after the full implementation of the animal testing ban for cosmetic ingredients in the EU, there are still no alternative methods available capable of fully replacing oral repeated dose toxicity testing. Until this issue is resolved, the development of new cosmetic ingredients remains seriously hampered. The present paper describes a thorough screening of the oral repeated dose toxicity data included in safety evaluation reports of cosmetic ingredients addressed in the Annexes of the Cosmetics Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, issued by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety between 2009 and 2019. The liver and the haematological system were identified as the potentially most frequently affected organs upon oral administration of cosmetic ingredients to animals. Evaluation of altered biochemical, morphological, and histopathological parameters related to hepatotoxicity indicated that the most recurrent events are liver weight changes, elevated liver enzymes, and alterations in serum cholesterol and bilirubin levels. Combined listing of affected parameters associated with steatosis and cholestasis indicated the possible occurrence of cholestasis, provoked by a limited number of cosmetic ingredients. The most frequently affected parameters related to the haematological system were indicative of anaemia. An in-depth analysis allowed characterisation of both regenerative and non-regenerative anaemia, pointing to direct and indirect haematotoxicity, respectively. The results presented in this study call for prioritisation of research targeted towards the development of new approach methodologies fit for animal-free repeated dose toxicity evaluation of cosmetic ingredients.","Gustafson, Emma; Debruyne, Christophe; De Troyer, Olga; Rogiers, Vera; Vinken, Mathieu; Vanhaecke, Tamara",Archives of toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-020-02868-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839844/,397

METHODS A total of 124 patients after anterior compartment mesh repair without simultaneous suburethral sling placement operated on in the period 2005-2012 were enrolled in this retrospective observational study. Patients with previous anti-incontinence surgery with normal urodynamics were not excluded; 30 patients with incomplete data, severe perioperative complications, and urinary retention before and after the surgery were excluded. Urinary retention was defined as post-void residual over 150 ml more than 48 h after permanent catheter removal. The rate of urinary retention after anterior compartment repair by mesh anchored to the SSL from an anterior approach (SSLS group) was compared to that following transobturator mesh repair often combined with SSL fixation from the posterior approach (TOT group). RESULTS Of the 94 patients considered for statistical analysis, 62 were from the SLSS group and 32 from the TOT group. The groups were comparable in age (mean 65.5 vs 66.3), body mass index (24.8 vs 25.9), and parity (2.4 vs 2.9). Patients from the SSLS group had higher rates of prior vaginal reconstructive (27 vs 19 %) and anti-incontinence surgery (26 vs 19 %). Postoperative urinary retention was statistically significantly more frequent in the SSLS group compared to the TOT group [(17 (27 %) vs 2 (6.25 %), odds ratio 5.7, 95 % confidence interval 1.2-26.3, p = 0.027]. Hospital discharge with self-catheterization was statistically insignificantly more frequent in the SSLS group [8 % (5) vs 3 % (1)]. CONCLUSIONS Extensive dissection needed for SSL suspension from an anterior approach may lead to more frequent postoperative voiding difficulties. This phenomenon could be explained by more considerable injury to pelvic splanchnic nerves during the dissection. A large prospective study is needed for validation of our results.","Rusavy, Z; Rivaux, G; Fatton, B; Cayrac, M; Boileau, L; de Tayrac, R",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-012-2030-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23306772/,397

To compare the epidemic prevention ability of COVID-19 of each province in China and to evaluate the existing prevention and control capacity of each province.Methods. We established a quasi-Poisson linear mixed-effects model using the case data in cities outside Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. We adapted this model to estimate the number of potential cases in Wuhan and obtained epidemiological parameters. We estimated the initial number of cases in each province by using passenger flowrate data and constructed the extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to predict the future disease transmission trends.Results. The estimated potential cases in Wuhan were about 3 times the reported cases. The basic reproductive number was 3.30 during the initial outbreak. Provinces with more estimated imported cases than reported cases were those in the surrounding provinces of Hubei, including Henan and Shaanxi. The regions where the number of reported cases was closer to the predicted value were most the developed areas, including Beijing and Shanghai.Conclusions. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan was underestimated in the initial period of the outbreak. Provincial surveillance and emergency response capabilities vary across the country.

When coupled with next-generation sequencing and omic technologies, genotype-to-phenotype relationships and the molecular mechanisms underlying desired complex phenotypes can now be uncovered using ALE. However, in order for ALE to be effective in generating strains with increased productivity, the product-of-interest needs to be coupled with cellular growth or survival. Advances in computational metabolic modeling can now identify metabolic engineering strategies to force the coupling of desired product formation with growth for a wide range of different compounds. Such strategies can potentially be coupled with ALE to further enhance productivity of microbial hosts. In addition to metabolic strategies, if the compound of interest is known to impart beneficial traits to the host, such as stress tolerance, then an environment can be designed to allow product formation to be coupled with growth or survival.

As charged by the American Urological Association (AUA) Laparoscopy, Robotic, and New Surgical Technology Committee, we sought to develop and validate a urology-specific FLS, referred to as the Basic Laparoscopic Urologic Surgery (BLUS(©)) skills curriculum. The psychomotor component consists of three existing FLS tasks and one new clip-applying task. MATERIALS AND METHODS An animate renal artery model was designed for a clip-applying skills task. We assessed the acceptability and construct validity of using BLUS for basic laparoscopic skills assessment for urologists. A cohort of practicing urologists, fellows, residents, and medical students completed the tasks at the AUA Annual Meetings in 2010 and 2011. RESULTS All exercises were acceptable and demonstrated excellent face and content validity (>4.5/5 on a five-point Likert scale). Practicing clinical urologists (N=81) outperformed residents and medical students (N=35) in time to completion of circle cut (P<0.01) and in keeping scissor tips toward the center of the circle (P<0.01). Practicing urologists who reported >3 laparoscopic procedures per week were faster at the peg-transfer exercise (P<0.05) and the cutting exercise (P<0.01) than those reporting one to two procedures. More errors were committed for clip-applying among practicing urologists who perform one to two laparoscopic procedures (1.24) vs. those who perform >3 procedures (0.57) per week (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS All exercises including the novel clip-applying model demonstrated good acceptability and evidence of construct validity (face, content, concurrent and convergent validity) for assessment of basic laparoscopic skill for urologic surgeons.","Sweet, Robert M; Beach, Rebekah; Sainfort, Francois; Gupta, Priyanka; Reihsen, Troy; Poniatowski, Lauren H; McDougall, Elspeth M",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2011.0414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22050489/,397
158868,The persistent pandemic of violence against health care workers.,2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVE To explore the correlation between early inflammation indicators and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wenzhou Central Hospital from January 17 to February 14, 2020 were enrolled. The general information, chest CT before admission, the first laboratory parameters and chest CT within 24 hours after admission were collected. Patients were followed up for 30 days after the first onset of dyspnea or pulmonary imaging showed that the lesions progressed more than 50% within 24 to 48 hours (according to the criteria for severe cases) as the study endpoint. According to the endpoint, the patients were divided into two groups: mild type/common type group and severe/critical group, and the differences in general information and inflammation index of the two groups were compared. Logistic regression was used to analyze the inflammation index and the severity of COVID-19. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was draw to evaluate the predictive value of early inflammation indicators for severe/critical in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 140 patients with COVID-19 were included, 74 males and 66 females; the average age was (45±14) years old; 6 cases (4.3%) of mild type, 107 cases (76.4%) of common type, and 22 cases (15.7%) of severe type, 5 cases (3.6%) were critical. There were significantly differences in ages (years old: 43±13 vs. 57±13), the proportion of patients with one chronic disease (17.7% vs. 55.6%), C-reactive protein [CRP (mg/L): 7.3 (2.3, 21.0) vs. 40.1 (18.8, 62.6)], lymphocyte count [LYM (×109/L): 1.3 (1.0, 1.8) vs. 0.8 (0.7, 1.1)], the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio [NLR: 2.1 (1.6, 3.0) vs. 3.1 (2.2, 8.8)] and multilobularinltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hyper-tension and age [MuLBSTA score: 5.0 (3.0, 5.0) vs. 5.0 (5.0, 7.0)] between mild/common group and severe/critical group (all P < 0.05). Univariate Logistic regression analysis showed that CRP, NLR, MuLBSTA score, age, and whether chronic diseases were associated with the severity of COVID-19 [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were 1.037 (1.020-1.055), 1.374 (1.123-1.680), 1.574 (1.296-1.911), 1.082 (1.042-1.125), 6.393 (2.551-16.023), respectively, all P < 0.01]. Further multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that CRP and MuLBSTA score were risk factors for the development of COVID-19 to severe/critical cases [OR and 95%CI were 1.024 (1.002-1.048) and 1.321 (1.027-1.699) respectively, both P < 0.05]. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve for CRP and MuLBSTA score to predict severe/critical cases were both 0.818, and the best cut-off points were 27.4 mg/L and 6.0 points, respectively. CONCLUSIONS CRP and MuLBSTA score are related to the severity of COVID-19, and may have good independent predictive ability for the development of severe/critical illness.","Li, Yong; Lin, Suhan; Zhou, Yueying; Pan, Jingye; Chen, Yuxi",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200515-00387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729130/,397

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of conditions; in immunocompromised hosts, SSTIs can be caused by diverse microorganisms-most commonly bacteria, but also fungi, viruses, mycobacteria, and protozoa. The diagnosis of SSTIs is difficult because they may commonly masquerade as other clinical syndromes or can be a manifestation of systemic disease. In immunocompromised hosts, SSTI poses a major diagnostic challenge, and clinical dermatological assessment should be initially performed; to better identify the pathogen and to lead to appropriate treatment, etiology should include cultures of lesions and blood, biopsy with histology, specific microbiological analysis with special stains, molecular techniques, and antigen-detection methodologies. Here, we reviewed the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic techniques, including molecular biological techniques, used for SSTIs, with a focus on the immunocompromised host, such as patients with cellular immunodeficiency, HIV, and diabetic foot infection.","Moffarah, Anne Spichler; Al Mohajer, Mayar; Hurwitz, Bonnie L; Armstrong, David G",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/microbiolspec.dmih2-0014-2015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27726817/,397

Such effects reflect the tendency of humans to take the orthogonal rather than the vertical distance between two curves as their distance. In SineStream, we connect the readability of streamgraphs with minimizing sine illusions and by doing so provide a perceptual foundation for their design. As the geometry of a streamgraph is controlled by its baseline (the bottom-most curve) and the ordering of the layers, we re-interpret baseline computation and layer ordering algorithms in terms of reducing sine illusion effects. For baseline computation, we improve previous methods by introducing a Gaussian weight to penalize layers with large thickness changes. For layer ordering, three design requirements are proposed and implemented through a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Quantitative experiments and user studies demonstrate that SineStream improves the readability and aesthetics of streamgraphs compared to state-of-the-art methods.","Bu, Chuan; Zhang, Quanjie; Wang, Qianwen; Zhang, Jian; Sedlmair, Michael; Deussen, Oliver; Wang, Yunhai",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33048718/,397

Firstly, the findings indicate that social distancing measures do make pedestrians keep a greater distance, but there are social distance violations. When the density is greater than 0.23 m(-1), pedestrians have more violations under the measure of 2 m than that of 1 m at the same density. Although the typical stop-and-go wave is still observed in social distancing experiments, the increase in social distancing causes pedestrian stopping behavior to occur at lower density, and shortens the density range of the transition from free flow to jammed flow. Moreover, the headway-speed relation under social distancing measures is not a simple horizontal displacement of that under normal conditions. Although their free speeds are similar, the increase in social distancing makes pedestrians need longer adaption time and more space to transform the motion state. Finally, fundamental diagrams are obtained, and the maximum specific flows for social distancing of 1 m and 2 m is 0.62 s(-1) and 0.53 s(-1), respectively. Apart from the comparison with normal conditions, the comparison with the two-dimensional social distancing experiments shows that pedestrians are more able to comply with the prescribed social distance and stop less in single-file movement. These enrichments offer empirical data of pedestrian movement under different social distancing measures and benefit pedestrian modeling during pandemics.","Lu, T. T.; Zhao, Y. X.; Wu, P.; Zhu, P.

From the action-entropy concept, the specificity of the infodemic-pandemic systems is that each project forms a certain contribution to the formation and dynamics of action entropy. According to this concept, infodemic-pandemic is considered as a system that exchanges biological resources, action and information with the environment, which determines the presence of informational (structural) entropy and action entropy. Moreover, the latter is the result of the existing order in the organization which is determined by the structure and implementation of business processes. The action-entropy concept operates with such categories as action, entropy, free action, dissipation and allows using action-entropy to assess the state and dynamics of the infodemic-pandemic systems. This study presents the universal formalization of action entropy for various organizations and its expression for project-oriented organizations. The action entropy of organizations is determined by information entropy, total action and the ratio of the achieved level of action efficiency to the ideal level. The relationship between action entropy and informational (structural) entropy of project-oriented organizations is established. It is determined that when adding a new project to the current totality, the organization must ensure a balance between the growth of uncertainty (information entropy) and action efficiency. The method of decomposition of the total action entropy of the infodemic-pandemic systems is presented in the form of the sum of local action entropy for projects and programs. The effect of adding a new project to the structure of the infodemic-pandemic systems on its integrated action entropy is investigated. The presented results form a new look at the qualitative assessment of both an individual project and the entire set of projects of the infodemi-cpandemic systems. © 2021 IEEE.","Bushuyev, S.; Bushuiev, D.; Bushuieva, V.","2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Information Systems and Technologies, SIST 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/sist50301.2021.9465942,397

Economic restrictions, notably strict border controls and lockdowns, have led many workers to lose their jobs and forced many migrants to return to their homes or change their migration plans. While adverse effects on labor mobility are expected, variations in the prevalence of COVID-19 and governmental responses to the pandemic across countries are likely to influence workers’ intentions to migrate in different ways. To understand the effects of pandemics on the international labor supply, we explore the impact of COVID-19 and the various economic restriction policies on job search behavior by considering cases from Southeast Asian countries using the difference-in-differences (DID) approach with data from Google Trends Index (GTI). We find that the search volume of queries related to the labor market dramatically increased over time following the outbreak of COVID-19. However, we do not observe any positive impact on the search volume related to emigration, regardless of the infection control measures in the host countries. Our results imply that the job insecurity increases after the imposition of lockdown in the respective countries. On the other hand, the expectation to migrate outside of the country, which requires preparation time and incurs high costs, does not seem to have increased in developing countries.","Nakamura, Nobuyuki Suzuki Aya",Journal of Asian Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asieco.2021.101348,397

Those wishing to assess life impact face several challenges: First, various measurement instruments are available, including of global functioning, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and well-being. Existing reviews have tended to focus on one of these domains; consequently, a comprehensive overview is lacking. Second, the extent to which such instruments truly capture distinct concepts is unclear. Third, many available scales conflate symptoms and their impact, thus undermining much needed analyses of associations between the two. Methods and analysis: A scoping umbrella review will examine existing reviews of life impact measures for use with 6-24-year-olds in the context of mental health and well-being research. We will systematically search five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science), and conduct systematic record screening, data extraction and charting based on methodological guidance by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Data synthesis will involve the tabulation of scale characteristics, feasibility, and measurement properties, and the use of summary statistics to synthesize how these instruments operationalize life impact. Ethics and dissemination: This study will provide a comprehensive road map for researchers and clinicians seeking to assess life impact in youth mental health, providing guidance in navigating available measurement options.

This paper shows the mathematical model and a proposal for its calibration. Specific results are shown for Spain. Four phases were considered: non-controlled evolution;total lock-down;partial easing of the lock-down;and a phased lock-down easing. For no control the model predicted the infection of a 25% of the Spanish population, 1 million would need intensive care and 700,000 direct deaths. For total lock-down the model predicted 194,000 symptomatic infected, 85,700 hospitalized, 8600 patients needing an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 19,500 deaths. The peak was predicted between the 29 March/3 April. For the third phase, with a daily rate r=1.03, the model predicted 400,000 infections and 46,000 +/- 15,000 deaths. The real r was below 1%, and a revision with updated parameters provided a prediction of 250,000 infected and 29,000 +/- 15,000 deaths. The reported values by the end of May were 282,870 infected and 28,552 deaths. After easing of the lock-down the model predicted that the health system would not saturate if r was kept below 1.02.

172702,Opium addiction: Practical issues in icu,2021,"Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic emphasises the need for antiviral materials that can reduce airborne and surface-based virus transmission. This study aims to propose the use of additive manufacturing (AM) and surrogate modelling for the rapid development and deployment of novel copper-tungsten-silver (Cu-W-Ag) microporous architecture that shows strong antiviral behaviour against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Design/methodology/approach The research combines selective laser melting (SLM), in-situ alloying and surrogate modelling to conceive the antiviral Cu-W-Ag architecture. The approach is shown to be suitable for redistributed manufacturing by representing the pore morphology through a surrogate model that parametrically manipulates the SLM process parameters: hatch distance (h_d), scan speed (S_s) and laser power (L_p). The method drastically simplifies the three-dimensional (3D) printing of microporous materials by requiring only global geometrical dimensions solving current bottlenecks associated with high computed aided design data transfer required for the AM of porous materials. Findings The surrogate model developed in this study achieved an optimum parametric combination that resulted in microporous Cu-W-Ag with average pore sizes of 80 mu m. Subsequent antiviral evaluation of the optimum architecture showed 100% viral inactivation within 5 h against a biosafe enveloped ribonucleic acid viral model of SARS-CoV-2. Research limitations/implications The Cu-W-Ag architecture is suitable for redistributed manufacturing and can help reduce surface contamination of SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, further optimisation may improve the virus inactivation time. Practical implications The study was extended to demonstrate an open-source 3D printed Cu-W-Ag antiviral mask filter prototype. Social implications The evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic brings new and unpredictable challenges where redistributed manufacturing of 3D printed antiviral materials can achieve rapid solutions.

Surveillance of medically-attended laboratory-confirmed influenza (MAI) occurred in five primary care clinics in and adjoining OSD. Poisson general additive log linear regression models of daily counts of absenteeism and MAI were compared using correlation analysis. Findings: Influenza was detected in 723 of 2,378 visited students, and in 1,327 of 4,903 MAI patients. Over six influenza seasons, a-ILI was significantly correlated with MAI in the community (r = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.53-0.63) with a one-day lead time and a-I was significantly correlated with MAI in the community (r = 0.49; 0.44-0.54) with a 10-day lead time, while a-TOT performed poorly (r = 0.27; 0.21-0.33), following MAI by six days. Discussion: Surveillance using cause-specific absenteeism was feasible and performed well over a study period marked by diverse presentations of seasonal influenza. Monitoring a-I and a-ILI can provide early warning of seasonal influenza in time for community mitigation efforts.","Temte, J.

174082,A Cross-Sectional Study of Psychological Distress and Fear of COVID-19 in the General Population of India during Lockdown,2020,"One avenue to combat multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria is the co-administration of multiple drugs (combination therapy), which can be particularly promising if drugs synergize. The identification of synergistic drug combinations, however, is challenging. Detailed understanding of antibiotic mechanisms can address this issue by facilitating the rational design of improved combination therapies. Here, using diverse biochemical and genetic assays, we reveal the molecular mechanisms of niclosamide, a clinically-approved salicylanilide compound, and demonstrate its potential for Gram-negative combination therapies. We discovered that Gram-negative bacteria possess two innate resistance mechanisms that reduce their niclosamide susceptibility: a primary mechanism mediated by multidrug efflux pumps and a secondary mechanism of nitroreduction. When efflux was compromised, niclosamide became a potent antibiotic, dissipating the proton motive force (PMF), increasing oxidative stress and reducing ATP production to cause cell death. These insights guided the identification of diverse compounds that synergized with salicylanilides when co-administered (efflux inhibitors, membrane permeabilizers, and antibiotics that are expelled by PMF-dependent efflux), thus suggesting that salicylanilide compounds may have broad utility in combination therapies. We validate these findings in vivo using a murine abscess model, where we show that niclosamide synergizes with the membrane permeabilizing antibiotic colistin against high-density infections of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates. We further demonstrate that enhanced nitroreductase activity is a potential route to adaptive niclosamide resistance but show that this causes collateral susceptibility to clinical nitro-prodrug antibiotics. Thus, we highlight how mechanistic understanding of mode of action, innate/adaptive resistance, and synergy can rationally guide the discovery, development and stewardship of novel combination therapies. Importance There is a critical need for more effective treatments to combat multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. Combination therapies are a promising strategy, especially when these enable existing clinical drugs to be repurposed as antibiotics. We reveal the mechanisms of action and basis of innate Gram-negative resistance for the anthelmintic drug niclosamide, and subsequently exploit this information to demonstrate that niclosamide and analogs kill Gram-negative bacteria when combined with antibiotics that inhibit drug efflux or permeabilize membranes. We confirm the synergistic potential of niclosamide in vitro against a diverse range of recalcitrant Gram-negative clinical isolates, and in vivo in a mouse abscess model. We also demonstrate that nitroreductases can confer resistance to niclosamide, but show that evolution of these enzymes for enhanced niclosamide resistance confers a collateral sensitivity to other clinical antibiotics. Our results highlight how detailed mechanistic understanding can accelerate the evaluation and implementation of new combination therapies.","Copp, Janine N.; Pletzer, Daniel; Brown, Alistair S.; Van der Heijden, Joris; Miton, Charlotte M.; Edgar, Rebecca J.; Rich, Michelle H.; Little, Rory F; Williams, Elsie M.; Hancock, Robert E.W.; Tokuriki, Nobuhiko; Ackerley, David F.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.058875,397

175436,Levels of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic: At what degree are health care workers affected in Tunisia,2021,"Network data is increasingly being used in quantitative, data-driven public policy research. These are typically very rich datasets that contain complex correlations and inter-dependencies. This richness both promises to be quite useful for policy research, while at the same time posing a challenge for the useful extraction of information from these datasets - a challenge which calls for new data analysis methods. In this report, we formulate a research agenda of key methodological problems whose solutions would enable new advances across many areas of policy research. We then review recent advances in applying deep learning to network data, and show how these methods may be used to address many of the methodological problems we identified. We particularly emphasize deep generative methods, which can be used to generate realistic synthetic networks useful for microsimulation and agent-based models capable of informing key public policy questions. We extend these recent advances by developing a new generative framework which applies to large social contact networks commonly used in epidemiological modeling. For context, we also compare and contrast these recent neural network-based approaches with the more traditional Exponential Random Graph Models. Lastly, we discuss some open problems where more progress is needed.","Hartnett, Gavin S.; Vardavas, Raffaele; Baker, Lawrence; Chaykowsky, Michael; Gibson, C.

175899,Challenges of COVID-19 and Tuberculosis - Urgent Need to Tackle the Dual Burden,2021,"Objectives Assays using ELISA measurements on serially diluted serum samples have been heavily used to measure serum reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and are widely used in virology and elsewhere in biology. We test a method to reduce the workload of these assays, and measure reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV antigens to human serum samples collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We apply Bayesian hierarchical modelling to ELISA measurements of human serum samples against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV antigens. Results Inflection titers for SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein (S1S2), spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleoprotein (N) inferred from three spread-out dilutions correlated with those inferred from eight consecutive dilutions with an R2 value of 0.97 or higher. We confirm existing findings showing a small proportion of pre-pandemic human serum samples contain cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 and N, and that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases serum reactivity to the beta-HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 S1S2. Conclusions In serial dilution assays, large savings in resources and/or increases in throughput can be achieved by reducing the number of dilutions measured and using Bayesian hierarchical modelling to infer inflection or endpoint titers. We have released software for conducting these types of analysis.","Pattinson, D.; Jester, P.; Guan, L.; Yamayoshi, S.; Chiba, S.; Presler, R.; Rao, H.; Iwatsuki-Horimoto, K.; Hagihara, M.; Ikeda, N.; Uchida, T.; Mitamura, K.; Halfmann, P.; Neumann, G.; Kawaoka, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.13.21263523v1?rss=1,397
177303,Correlation between atopy and Covid-19: A cross sectional study,2021,"Purpose This paper aims to provide evidence that online well-designed educational tasks can provide more relevant and richer active learning environment for business English learners. The benefits of online tasks, as an education tool, became more apparent and gained more importance during the events related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The task design is based on task-based interactions and in a sequence of tasks with the support of an online learning management system (LMS). The findings suggest that online task-based learning (and would-be blended learning in the future) enables meaningful and authentic activities promoting interactions and communicative competences to prepare for learners of business English to enter the workplace. Design/methodology/approach The overarching aim of the study is to explore how task-design-utilizing online LMS could contribute to enhancing the learning process and to the development of the learner's communicative competences. The study included two aspects, namely: (1) the design of online tasks and (2) pilot evaluation. The task design involved tasks that required interactions between the learners. The pilot evaluation relied on data collection via questionnaires. Findings Two aspects relating to the findings: (1) a description of the teaching initiatives which was designed to see how blended learning and online tasks can enhance learning and develop the skills of the learners: with questioning techniques targeting communication skills, simulated workplace situations and timely feedback and peer influence;(2) the findings of the pilot study evaluation to see the actual implementation of online tasks. The students' responses corroborate the teachers' comments. The findings of this research showed that LMS tasks, which were designed for this study, helped the learners to enhance their competence in business English. Such competences included communicative skills needed for learners to enter the workplace such as interpersonal skills, presentation skills and negotiation skills in contexts. These findings lead to significant recommendations regarding the way forward for developing active blended learning. Research limitations/implications Firstly, teachers need to be trained and involved in designing such online tasks and materials to be used in active blended learning. More training in language teaching methodologies should be investigated to adapt the transition from a traditional to a computer-assisted language learning teacher. This helps teachers to design and implement online simulated workplace tasks. Secondly, time for the use of online tasks should be allocated satisfactorily. This can be achieved by building online learning sessions into class schedule or developing active blended courses. The time for the use of online simulated tasks should be allocated satisfactorily with lab or simulation room, in which students would be shown how to access the online tasks designed on the university LMS and the way to practice with different kinds of tasks. Originality/value In this study context, the online tasks design can initiate at activity-level blending to support face-to-face (F2F) activities, for example, online activities to support tasks for the topic Make a request or Offer for help. This can be extended to course-level blending when more online activities are designed to use with F2F activities such as online comparing and contrasting tasks to develop skills in connections with the awareness of cultures. The findings of the research suggest to develop and to implement online tasks alongside with classroom learning and teaching to enable the objectives of business English programme at university for preparing learners to enter the workplace. The recent pandemic highlighted the need for effective methodologies for active blended learning. It is now required that professionals in higher education to collect evidence base to inform future practice of such methodologies. Further significant research efforts should be directed towards collecting such evidence of the effectiveness and improvements of such methods. The support of higher education management professionals in securing funding for such research will be essential.","Vo, T. H.

177745,Early career psychiatrists in europe during the COVID-19 outbreak: Results of the EPA ECPC-EFPT cross-sectional survey,2021,"The Amazonas was one of the most heavily affected Brazilian states by the COVID-19 epidemic. Despite a large number of infected people, particularly during the second wave associated with the spread of the Variant of Concern (VOC) Gamma (lineage P.1), SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate in the Amazonas. To understand how SARS-CoV-2 persisted in a human population with a high immunity barrier, we generated 1,188 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences from individuals diagnosed in the Amazonas state from 1st January to 6th July 2021, of which 38 were vaccine breakthrough infections. Our study reveals a sharp increase in the relative prevalence of Gamma plus (P.1+) variants, designated as Pango Lineages P.1.3 to P.1.6, harboring two types of additional Spike changes: deletions in the N-terminal (NTD) domain (particularly {Delta}144 or {Delta}141-144) associated with resistance to anti-NTD neutralizing antibodies or mutations at the S1/S2 junction (N679K or P681H) that probably enhance the binding affinity to the furin cleavage site, as suggested by our molecular dynamics simulations. As lineages P.1.4 (S:N679K) and P.1.6 (S:P681H) expanded (Re > 1) from March to July 2021, the lineage P.1 declined (Re < 1) and the median Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Amazonas significantly decreases. Still, we found no overrepresentation of P.1+ variants among breakthrough cases of fully vaccinated patients (71%) in comparison to unvaccinated individuals (93%). This evidence supports that the ongoing endemic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Amazonas is driven by the spread of new local Gamma/P.1 sub-lineages that are more transmissible, although not more efficient to evade vaccine-elicited immunity than the parental VOC. Finally, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in human populations with a declining density of susceptible hosts, the risk of selecting new variants with higher infectivity are expected to increase.","Naveca, F.

179631,Troubling Silences: Reflecting on Findings from an Integrative Review on Access to PrEP,2021,"The negative impact of continued school closures during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic warrants the establishment of new cost-effective strategies for surveillance and screening to safely reopen and monitor for potential in-school transmission. Here, we present a novel approach to increase the availability of repetitive and routine Covid-19 testing that may ultimately reduce the overall viral burden in the community. We describe implementation of a testing program that included students, faculty and staff from K-12 schools and universities participating in the SalivaClear pooled surveillance method (Mirimus Clinical Labs, Brooklyn, NY). Over 400,000 saliva specimens were self-collected from students, faculty and staff from 93 K-12 schools and 18 universities and tested in pools of up to 24 samples over a 20-week period during this pandemic. Peaks of positive cases were seen in the days following the Halloween, Thanksgiving and New Year holidays. Pooled testing did not significantly alter the sensitivity of the molecular assay in terms of both qualitative (100% detection rate on both pooled and individual samples) and quantitative (comparable cycle threshold (CT) values between pooled and individual samples) measures. Pooling samples substantially reduced the costs associated with PCR testing and allowed schools to rapidly assess transmission and adjust prevention protocols as necessary. By establishing low-cost, weekly testing of students and faculty, pooled saliva analysis enabled schools to determine whether transmission had occurred, make data-driven decisions, and adjust safety protocols. Pooled testing is a fundamental component to the reopening of schools, minimizing transmission among students and faculty.","Bi, C.; Mendoza, R.; Cheng, H.-T.; Pagapas, G.; Gabutan, E.; Khan, N.; Hoxie, H.; Holmes, K.; Gao, N.; Lewis, R.; Wang, H.; Neumann, D.; Chan, A.; Takizawa, M.; Lowe, J.; Chen, X.; Kelly, B.; Asif, A.; Barnes, K.; May, B.; Wright, M.; Chowdhury, T.; Pollonini, G.; Gouda, N.; Guy, C.; Gordon, C.; Ayoluwa, N.; Colon, E.; Miller-Medzon, N.; Jones, S.; Hossain, R.; Dodson, A.; Wang, M.; McGaskey, M.; Vasileva, A.; Seibel, S.; Connolly, J.; Esposito, M.; Kim, J.; Lincoln, A.

179767,COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers in India: Results from a cross-sectional survey,2021-08-11,"Inclusion bodies (IBs) are characteristic biomolecular condensates organized by mononegaviruses. Here, we characterize the IBs of Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), a unique mononegavirus that forms IBs in the nucleus, in terms of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The BoDV-1 phosphoprotein (P) alone induces LLPS and the nucleoprotein (N) is incorporated into the P droplet in vitro. In contrast, co-expression of N and P is required for the formation of IB-like structure in cells. Furthermore, while BoDV-1 P binds to RNA, an excess amount of RNA dissolves the liquid droplets formed by N and P. Notably, the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of BoDV-1 P is essential to drive LLPS and bind to RNA, suggesting that both abilities could compete with one another. These features are unique among mononegaviruses, and thus this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of LLPS-driven organization and RNA-mediated regulation of biomolecular condensates.","Hirai, Yuya; Tomonaga, Keizo; Horie, Masayuki",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.24.445377,397

The applications of metagenomics to monitor and identify the prevalence/endemicity and emergence of these pathogenic agents from different sources were examined. Methods Articles published in English language up to October 2020 were searched for on PubMed. Qualitative and quantitative data extracted from the included articles were translated into charts and maps. GraphPad Prism 9.0.2 was used to undertake statistical analysis using descriptive and column statistics, Chi-square, ANOVA, Wilcoxon’s signed-rank, and one-sample t-test. Results In all, 143 articles from 39 countries from Europe, America, Asia, and Africa were quantitatively analysed. Metagenomes from sewage/wastewater, surface water samples (ocean, sea, river lake, stream and tap water), WWTP, effluents and sludge samples contained pathogenic bacteria (Aeromonas, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii), viruses (Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Hepatovirus, Mamastrovirus and Rotavirus) and parasites (Acanthamoeba, Giardia, Entamoeba, Blastocystis and Naegleria). Integrons, plasmids, transposons, insertion sequences, prophages and integrative and conjugative elements were identified. ARGs mediating resistance to important antibiotics, including β-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracycline, and virulence factors such as secretion system, adherence, antiphagocytosis, capsule, invasion, iron uptake, hemolysin, and flagella. Conclusion Clinically important pathogens, ARGs, and MGEs were identified in diverse clinical, environmental, and animal sources through metagenomics, which can be used to determine the prevalence and emergence of known and unknown pathogens and ARGs. Importance/significance Global metagenomic analyses of drinking water, effluents, influents, un/-treated sewage, WWTPs, sludge, rivers, lakes, soil, sediments, biosolid, air and plants. showed the global distribution of diverse clinically important ARGs on mobile genetic elements, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) and pathogens, metal resistance genes, and virulence genes in almost all environments. These depict the importance of shot-gun metagenomics as a surveillance tool for AMR and infectious disease control to safeguard water & food quality as well as public health from water- and food-borne outbreaks of pathogenic and ARB infections. More concerning was the identification of ARGs to last-resort antibiotics i.e., carbapenems, colistin, & tigecycline.","Sekyere, John Osei; Faife, Sara Lino",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.30.450418,397

Today, technological knowledge is crucial for every profession and sector, especially in this era of the COVID‐19 pandemic.The aim of this study was to review and synthesise key literature on how technologically mediated therapy (TMT) can be used to address the challenges around mental health and well‐being within low‐ and middle‐income countries like Ghana.This is a narrative literature review that analysed literature pertaining to mental health and well‐being in Ghana. Two hundred and twenty‐three (223) articles were consulted. Of these, 70 articles were retained to respond to the aim of the review. The selection and extraction of data were based on the following criteria—the quality of reportage, the robustness of study design and the reliability and validity of data collected.Research shows that TMT offers an effective alternative approach in dealing with mental health and well‐being challenges. Instead of the traditional face‐to‐face intervention, TMT has the capacity to reach a greater proportion of a population, ensure the dissemination of large amounts of health information and support the mental health workforce. These were chosen as key themes and discussed in line with key literature that addresses the review's objective.In summary, TMT has the capacity to meet Ghana's mental health needs.

Machine learning models designed to predict hospitalizations, for example, can contribute to better targeting hospital resources. However, as the excess of information, often irrelevant or redundant, can impair the performance of predictive models, we propose in this work a hybrid approach to attribute selection. This method aims to find an optimal attribute subset through a genetic algorithm, which considers the results of a classification model in its evaluation function to improve the hospitalization need prediction of COVID-19 patients. We evaluated this approach in a database of more than 200 thousand COVID-19 patients from the State Health Secretariat of Rio Grande do Sul. We provided an increase of 18% in the classification precision for patients with hospitalization necessities. In a real-time application, this would also mean greater precision in targeting resources, as well as, consequently and mainly, improved service to the infected population. © 2021 ACM.","Colpo, M.

Design/methodology/approach This co-constructed autoethnography is produced from reflexive, dyadic interviews and text ""conversations"" with an SiM doing ""global talent identity work"" and uses narrative analysis to investigate how liminal competence is developed across the life cycle. Findings This study shows how talent identity work is rooted in the lived, meaningful experiences of individual talent, from childhood to adult life in a pandemic. The authors add to knowledge about COVID-19 experiences of SiMs, uncover poignant examples of the role of migrant ethnic and knowledge discrimination and identify lessons for managerial practice in engendering liminality competence by combining global talent management and knowledge management. Practical implications Lessons are drawn for global talent management strategies that appreciate and support individual talent ethnic and knowledge inclusion of underappreciated migrant talent. Originality/value Examining the connection between talent identity work and liminality competence, the authors show how an individual's talent might be wasted through different forms of discrimination and highlight how ethnic discrimination during a pandemic points the way to positive changes in talent knowledge management initiatives.

We discuss the question of whether the location of chemical receptors on cilia provides an advantage in terms of sensitivity. Using a simple advection-diffusion model, we compute the capture rates of diffusive molecules on a cilium. Because of its geometry, a non-motile cilium in a quiescent fluid has a capture rate equivalent to a circular absorbing region with ~ 4× its surface area. When the cilium is exposed to an external shear flow, the equivalent surface area increases to ~ 10×. Alternatively, if the cilium beats in a non-reciprocal way, its capture rate increases with the beating frequency to the power of 1/3. Altogether, our results show that the protruding geometry of a cilium could be one of the reasons why so many receptors are located on cilia. They also point to the advantage of combining motility with chemical reception.","Hickey, David; Vilfan, Andrej; Golestanian, Ramin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.425992,397

Objective assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness is costly, labour intensive and not widely available. Although patient-reported outcome measures estimate cardiorespiratory fitness more cost-efficiently, the current questionnaires lack accuracy. The aim of this study is to develop and validate the FitMax(C)-questionnaire, a self-reported questionnaire to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness in healthcare. Methods: We developed the FitMax(C)-questionnaire, consisting of three questions assessing walking, stair climbing, and cycling capacity. A comparison on estimating VO2peak was made with the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing as the gold standard. A total of 716 patients and athletes (520 men, 196 women) aged 18-91 performed a CPET in our hospital. We randomly selected 70% of the subjects to fit a linear regression model to estimate VO2peak based on the FitMax(C) scores. The remaining 30% of participants was used for validation of this model. Results: The VO2peak estimated by the FitMax(C) strongly correlates with the VO2peak measured objectively with CPET; r=0.95 (0.93-0.96) SEE=3.94 ml*kg-1*min-1. Bias between predicted and measured VO2peak was 0.32 ml{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}min-1 and the 95% limits of agreement were -8.11 - 9.40 ml*kg-1*min-1. In our sample, the FitMax(C) scored superiorly on correlation and SEE compared with those from the DASI and VSAQ, r=0.80 (0.73-0.86) SEE=4.22 ml*kg-1*min-1 and r=0.88 (0.84-0.91) SEE=6.61 ml*kg-1*min-1, respectively.

The pressure of urbanization has led to a mismatch between production and consumption in space and pattern. The current status and trends in urban food system planning illustrated that sustainable consumption and production were closely related to their spatial layout. The paper took a simulated sustainable food system in urban community as an example. It formulated a rational spatial planning strategy based on urban agriculture of different scales, technologies, and efficiencies, quantified productive community metrics to accommodate different scales of urban space, and wrote algorithms to develop a spatial model of a meta-cellular automaton that coupled consumer housing with productive surfaces. Finally, by comparing and optimizing the spatial patterns of multiple solutions, urban agriculture-oriented urban community planning was developed. The model was only a preliminary attempt at food system planning, but it explored the distribution patterns of housing and agriculture within a given territory in three steps: theoretical strategy-morphological simulation-planning design while meeting urban and productivity indicators. It demonstrated the feasibility of productive spaces and explored a planning strategy for urban communities that supports sustainable consumption and production.","Yang, Yuanchuan Huang Si",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208735,397

There were 629 overdose deaths, half of which had an opioid analgesic prescription active on the day of death. Of 2,182,374 patients prescribed opioids, 478 overdose deaths were reported (0.022% per year). Mortality rates increased gradually across the range of average daily milligrams of morphine equivalents. 80.0% of opioid analgesic patients also received benzodiazepines. Rates of overdose death among those co-dispensed benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics were ten times higher (7.0 per 10,000 person-years, 95 percent CI: 6.3, 7.8) than opioid analgesics alone (0.7 per 10,000 person years, 95 percent CI: 0.6, 0.9). CONCLUSIONS Dose-dependent opioid overdose risk among patients increased gradually and did not show evidence of a distinct risk threshold. There is urgent need for guidance about combined classes of medicines to facilitate a better balance between pain relief and overdose risk.","Dasgupta, Nabarun; Funk, Michele Jonsson; Proescholdbell, Scott; Hirsch, Annie; Ribisl, Kurt M; Marshall, Steve",Pain medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26333030/,397

Proactive patient safety work must continue even under conditions such as a pandemic. Methods are needed that assess and support patient safety as the work is carried out. Patient safety in real time appears to be such a useful method in which patient record review to identify patient harm is combined with interviews with patients and healthcare staff. The method was used in wards and intensive care units (ICU) for covid-19 patients in Region Jönköping County. Patient harm was found in ICU care. Patients were overall satisfied with the care, and in the interviews with healthcare staff areas for improvement were identified. Valid indicators for patient record review to evaluate patient harm in covid-19 need to be developed. To judge if patient harm in care of a Covid-19 is avoidable or not is difficult since the level of knowledge and treatment principles in the disease develops very fast.","Fröding, Elin; Edvinsson, Joakim; Mellqvist, Joanna; Ros, Axel",Lakartidningen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242337/,397

The results were stored in a computer data base and compared with epidemiologic data and clinical findings. All 3 infections were significantly more prevalent in sick than healthy cats: FIV was found in 0.7% of healthy and 3.4% of sick cats. For FeLV the prevalence was 3.0% and 13.0% and for coronavirus 21% and 36.2%, respectively. FIV-infected cats were mostly male (73%); no sex predilection was observed in FeLV- and coronavirus infection. In sick cats FIV-infection was significantly more prevalent in cats greater than 2 years of age; no age-dependence was found in FeLV- and coronavirus infections. The prevalence of FIV-infection increased significantly with the number of animals per household. In contrast, the frequency of FeLV infection decreased with the number of animals per household. Prevalence of coronavirus infection did not vary with group size or living conditions. The following clinical symptoms were associated with infection: FIV: general depression, diseases of the urinary tract; FeLV: general depression, fever, rough hair coat, lymphadenopathy, impaired functions of heart and circulation and muscle atrophy; coronavirus: lymphadenopathy and alterations in the abdomen. It was concluded that based on the clinical symptoms alone FIV-infection could not be diagnosed nor differentiated from the other 2 infections.","Lutz, H; Lehmann, R; Winkler, G; Kottwitz, B; Dittmer, A; Wolfensberger, C; Arnold, P",Schweizer Archiv fur Tierheilkunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2167513/,397

195844,"High prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases among men who have sex with men in Jiangsu Province, China.",2006,"INTRODUCTION Knowledge and adequate practice of preventive measures among health care workers (HCWs) are important to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted among doctors and nurses in the medical department in Pusat Perubatan Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia between November 18, 2020 and December 18, 2020 during the third wave of COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia. We studied the knowledge and practice of preventive measures of COVID-19 among doctors and nurses in the COVID-19 or sudden acute respiratory infection (SARI) wards and general medical wards. Data was collected using a validated self-designed google form online-questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 407 subjects completed the study and 80.8% were females; 55.8% were aged between 30-39 years; 46.4% were medical doctors. The main source of COVID-19 knowledge was the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH) website (35.1%). Majority (97%) had sufficient knowledge and 82% practiced proper preventive measures. Doctors had a higher mean knowledge score compared to nurses (p < 0.001). HCWs working in COVID-19 or SARI wards scored higher in knowledge questions compared to those in the general medical wards (p = 0.020). Nurses practiced better preventive measures (p < 0.001). Good knowledge could not be predicted based on professions (OR: 0.222, 95% CI: 0.048 - 1.028, p = 0.054). Majority were unable to recall the proper steps of donning (85.8%) and doffing (98.5%). CONCLUSIONS Although majority had good knowledge and practiced proper preventive measures, there was a poor recall in donning and doffing steps regardless of place of practice. The MOH website is a useful platform for tailored continuous medical education and regular updates on COVID-19. Regular training and retraining on donning and doffing of PPE is needed to bridge this gap.","Ng, B H; Low, H J; Nik Nuratiqah, N A; Faisal, A H; Soo, C I; Periyasamy, P; Ban, A Y L",The Medical journal of Malaysia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305104/,397
196328,Social accountability in theory and practice.,2006,"The spike (S) glycoprotein of the Miller strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was recently cloned and expressed in baculovirus. The recombinant S protein was used as the coating antigen in a competition (blocking) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in combination with monoclonal antibodies to the S protein epitope A (conserved on TGEV and porcine respiratory coronavirus [PRCV]) or epitope D (present on TGEV only) to differentiate PRCV- from TGEV-induced antibodies. One set (set A) of 125 serum samples were collected at different times after inoculation of caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived (n = 52) and conventional young pigs (n = 73) with 1 of the 2 porcine coronaviruses or uninoculated negative controls (TGEV/PRCV/negative = 75/30/20). A second set (set B) of 63 serum samples originated from adult sows inoculated with PRCV and the recombinant TGEV S protein or with mock-protein control and then exposed to virulent TGEV after challenge of their litters. Sera from set A were used to assess the accuracy indicators (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) of the fixed-cell blocking ELISA, which uses swine testicular cells infected with the M6 strain of TGEV as the antigen source (ELISA 1) and the newly developed ELISA based on the recombinant S protein as antigen (ELISA 2). The sera from set B (adults) were tested for comparison. The plaque reduction virus neutralization test was used as a confirmatory test for the presence of antibodies to TGEV/PRCV in the test sera. The accuracy indicators for both ELISAs suggest that differential diagnosis can be of practical use at least 3 weeks after inoculation by testing the dual (acute/convalescent) samples from each individual in conjunction with another confirmatory (virus neutralization) antibody assay to provide valid and complete differentiation information. Moreover, whereas ELISA 1 had 10-20% false positive results to epitope D for PRCV-infected pigs (set A samples), no false-positive results to epitope D occurred using ELISA 2, indicating its greater specificity. The progression of seroresponses to the TGEV S protein epitopes A or D, as measured by the 2 ELISAs, was similar for both sets (A and B) of samples. Differentiation between TGEV and PRCV antibodies (based on seroresponses to epitope D) was consistently measured after the third week of inoculation.","Sestak, K; Zhou, Z; Shoup, D I; Saif, L J","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10353350/,397

In addition, we detected three minor species: two glycoproteins, GP90 and GP59, and one non-glycosylated protein, P14. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping showed that GP36, GP31, GP28, and P23 comprise a group of closely related proteins which we have designated the ""P23 family,"" but that the other proteins are distinct. Analysis by partial proteolytic digestion of P23 family, but that the other proteins are distinct. Analysis by partial proteolytic digestion of the P23 family labeled biosynthetically with [35S] methionine, and P23, labeled with [35S] formyl-methionine by in vitro translation of RNA from infected cells, revealed that the proteins of the P23 family differ in their amino-terminal domains. Similar analysis of GP31 and Gp36 labeled with [3H] mannose showed that the partial proteolytic fragments unique to these proteins were glycosylated. This suggests that differences in glycosylation in the amino-terminal domains contributes to the marked polymorphism os the P23 family. The results are discussed with respect to possible models for synthesis of the virion proteins.","Stern, D F; Burgess, L; Sefton, B M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6283141/,397

The primary treatment goals are to prolong survival while maintaining the best quality of life. The recommended standard-of-care treatments in the first-line setting consist of combination chemotherapy regimens, given with or without biologic agents. Most patients will receive different lines of therapy for the rest of their life. In the context of lifelong therapy, incorporating chemo-free intervals is one strategy to help achieve these treatment goals. A principle of management is to ensure that all potentially active agents are available to patients. Third-line options for patients with an inadequate response to first-line and second-line therapy include regorafenib and trifluridine/tipiracil. These treatments should be initiated before the patient's performance status deteriorates. Patient characteristics should guide selection. The management plan now incorporates new lessons learned during the current global COVID-19 pandemic. One of the primary guiding principles underlying these recommendations is to avoid unnecessary clinic and hospital exposure. Telemedicine permits the remote management of patients who are receiving oral therapies. Many of these strategies will likely remain in place after the pandemic ends.","Grothey, Axel; Ciardiello, Fortunato; Marshall, John L",Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843848/,397

The understanding of evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is of paramount importance for the COVID-19 control, combating, and prevention. Due to the rapid growth of both the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and the number of unique mutations, the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates faces an emergent large-data challenge. We introduce a dimension-reduced $k$-means clustering strategy to tackle this challenge. We examine the performance and effectiveness of three dimension-reduction algorithms: principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). By using four benchmark datasets, we found that UMAP is the best-suited technique due to its stable, reliable, and efficient performance, its ability to improve clustering accuracy, especially for large Jaccard distanced-based datasets, and its superior clustering visualization. The UMAP-assisted $k$-means clustering enables us to shed light on increasingly large datasets from SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates.","Hozumi, Yuta; Wang, Rui; Yin, Changchuan; Wei, Guo-Wei",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398244/,397

We excluded case reports and searched all-language articles for review and repeated until the final drafting. The search protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database. Thirty studies with urinary sampling for viral shedding were included. A total number of 1,271 patients were enrolled initially, among which 569 patients had undergone urinary testing. Nine studies observed urinary viral shedding in urine from 41 patients. The total incidence of urinary SARS-CoV-2 shedding was 8%, compared to 21.3% and 39.5 % for blood and stool, respectively. The summarized risk ratio (RR) estimates for urine positive rates compared to the pharyngeal rate was 0.08. The pertaining RR urine compared to blood and stool positive rates were 0.20 and 0.33, respectively.

In order to deliver effective personalized interventions to those suffer from chronic conditions social determinants of health must be considered. Therefore, psychosocial phenotyping holds strong promise as a tool for tailoring interventions based on precision health principles. PURPOSE To define psychosocial phenotyping and develop a research agenda that promotes its integration into chronic disease management as a tool for precision self-management interventions. METHODS Since psychosocial phenotyping is not yet used in interventions for self-management support, we conducted a literature review to identify potential phenotypes for chronic disease self-management. We also reviewed policy intervention case reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to examine factors related to social determinants of health in people with chronic illnesses. Finally, we reviewed methodological approaches for identifying patient profiles or phenotypes. RESULTS The literature review revealed areas within which to collect data for psychosocial phenotyping that can inform personalized interventions. The findings of our exemplar cases revealed that several environmental or key SDOH such as factors realted with economic stability and neighborhood environment have been closely linked with the success of chronic disease management interventions. We elucidated theory, definitions, and pragmatic conceptual boundaries related to psychosocial phenotyping for precision health. CONCLUSIONS Our literature review with case example analysis demonstrates the potential usefulness of psychosocial phenotyping as a tool to enhance personalized self-management interventions for people with chronic diseases, with implications for future research.","Kim, Miyong T; Radhakrishnan, Kavita; Heitkemper, Elizabeth M; Choi, Eunju; Burgermaster, Marissa",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841684/,397

Sudden, unexplained deaths also occur among children aged >/=1 year; however, the number of these deaths is not well documented. Certain cases of SIDS and sudden unexplained death beyond infancy might be attributable to complications of unrecognized metabolic diseases. Tandem mass spectrometry (tandem MS) can be used to screen for several of these disorders. Despite the low prevalence of these diseases, newborn screening for these disorders has been found to compare favorably with the cost of other screening programs. However, the contribution of these diseases to early childhood deaths is not well understood. To determine the proportion of sudden, unexpected early childhood deaths associated with selected metabolic diseases, CDC, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (ME) in Virginia, and a private laboratory conducted a population- based study. This report summarizes the results of the study, which indicate that 1% of children had a positive postmortem metabolic screen using tandem MS. Of the eight children with positive screening tests, seven might have had improved outcomes had they been identified and treated during the newborn period.

Information and communication technologies, such as websites and email, have emerged as popular tools for the dissemination of evidence to health professionals. OBJECTIVE The objective of this systematic review was to identify research on health professionals' perceived usability and practice behavior change of information and communication technologies for the dissemination of clinical practice guidelines. METHODS We used a systematic approach to retrieve and extract data about relevant studies. We identified 2248 citations, of which 21 studies met criteria for inclusion; 20 studies were randomized controlled trials, and 1 was a controlled clinical trial. The following information and communication technologies were evaluated: websites (5 studies), computer software (3 studies), Web-based workshops (2 studies), computerized decision support systems (2 studies), electronic educational game (1 study), email (2 studies), and multifaceted interventions that consisted of at least one information and communication technology component (6 studies). RESULTS Website studies demonstrated significant improvements in perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, but not for knowledge, reducing barriers, and intention to use clinical practice guidelines. Computer software studies demonstrated significant improvements in perceived usefulness, but not for knowledge and skills. Web-based workshop and email studies demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge, perceived usefulness, and skills. An electronic educational game intervention demonstrated a significant improvement from baseline in knowledge after 12 and 24 weeks. Computerized decision support system studies demonstrated variable findings for improvement in skills. Multifaceted interventions demonstrated significant improvements in beliefs about capabilities, perceived usefulness, and intention to use clinical practice guidelines, but variable findings for improvements in skills. Most multifaceted studies demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that health professionals' perceived usability and practice behavior change vary by type of information and communication technology.

The BCoV S protein plays a fundamental role in viral attachment and entry into the host cell, and is cleaved into two subunits termed S1 (amino terminal) and S2 (carboxy terminal). The present study describes a strategy for the sequencing of the BCoV S1 gene directly from fecal diarrheic specimens that were previously identified as BCoV positive by RT-PCR assay for N gene detection. A consensus sequence of 2681 nucleotides was obtained through direct sequencing of seven overlapping PCR fragments of the S gene. The samples did not undergo cell culture passage prior to PCR amplification and sequencing. The structural analysis was based on the genomic differences between Brazilian strains and other known BCoV from different geographical regions. The phylogenetic analysis of the entire S1 gene showed that the BCoV Brazilian strains were more distant from the Mebus strain (97.8% identity for nucleotides and 96.8% identity for amino acids) and more similar to the BCoV-ENT strain (98.7% for nucleotides and 98.7% for amino acids). Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit, these strains clustered with the American (BCoV-ENT, 182NS) and Canadian (BCQ20, BCQ2070, BCQ9, BCQ571, BCQ1523) calf diarrhea and the Canadian winter dysentery (BCQ7373, BCQ2590) strains, but clustered on a separate branch of the Korean and respiratory BCoV strains. The BCoV strains of the present study were not clustered in the same branch of previously published Brazilian strains (AY606193, AY606194).

There were 62,970 COVID-19 tests conducted with 1435 people testing positive for a positivity rate of 2.28%. A total of 1670 COVID-19 cases were identified with 235 self-reports. The mean number of tests per week was 3500 with approximately 80 of these positive (11/d). More than 60 student tracers were trained with over 120 personnel available to contact trace, at a ratio of 1 per 400 university members. The successes and lessons learned provide a framework and pathway for similar institutions to mitigate the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 and sustain operations during a global pandemic.","Ryan, Benjamin J; Muehlenbein, Michael P; Allen, Jon; Been, Joshua; Boyd, Kenneth; Brickhouse, Mark; Brooks, Bryan W; Burchett, Matthew; Chambliss, C Kevin; Cook, Jason D; Ecklund, Adam; Fogleman, Lori; Granick, Peter; Hynes, Sharra; Hudson, Tonya; Huse, Michelle; Lamb, Micah; Lowe, Tiffany; Marsh, Jim; Nixon, Niesha; Nolan, Dennis; Nuñez, George; Matthews, Walter Sparky; Stern, Sharon; Wheelis, Meaghann; Brickhouse, Nancy",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,397

212384,Virtual House Calls: Telemedicine and Reforming the Health Care Delivery Model with Strategies Implemented in a Novel Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"The non-specific beneficial effects of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination suggest that this vaccine might play a role in protecting individuals against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several studies propose that BCG vaccination may increase the body's immunity, thereby preventing respiratory infections caused by other respiratory pathogens. As the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is increasing rapidly and there is no specific treatment available to date, scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of already approved drugs as therapies against COVID-19, and the results were found to vary widely: from no significant effect being observed to a reduction in the time taken for clinical improvement. This study thus aims to evaluate whether it is worth performing clinical trials to examine the effects of the BCG vaccine on COVID-19. We herein emphasize the need to conduct phase III randomized controlled trials with adequate sample size and quality to investigate the effects of the BCG vaccine on COVID-19. In the event that BCG vaccination provides non-specific protection against COVID-19, administering it could be helpful in controlling the transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases during future pandemics.","Aziz, Asma Binte; Dembinski, Jennifer L; Jahan, Yasmin",,,397

213751,Psychological effect of COVID-19 on medical health-care workers,2020,"BACKGROUND: The median duration of hospital stays due to COVID-19 has been reported in several studies on China as 10-13 days. Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study. The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020. METHOD: We used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay. RESULTS: There were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions. Eighty-two (61.7%) patients were discharged after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 51 were still in the hospital at the end of the study period and none died. The median duration of stay in a hospital was 21 (IQR: 16-34) days. The multivariable Cox regression model showed that age, residence and sources of contamination were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: A close look at how long COVID-19 patients stayed in the hospital could provide an overview of their treatment process in Vietnam, and support the country's National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control in the efficient allocation of resources over the next stages of the COVID-19 prevention period.","Thai, Pham Quang; Toan, Do Thi Thanh; Son, Dinh Thai; Van, Hoang Thi Hai; Minh, Luu Ngoc; Hung, Le Xuan; Toan, Ngo Van; Hoat, Luu Ngoc; Luong, Duong Huy; Khue, Luong Ngoc; Khoa, Nguyen Trong; Huong, Le Thi",Epidemiol Infect,,397

214785,Hand Hygiene Habits and Prevalence of Hand Eczema During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The world is currently in the grips of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has mutated to allow human-to-human spread. Infection can cause fever, dry cough, fatigue, severe pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome and in some instances death. COVID-19 affects the immune system by producing a systemic inflammatory response, or cytokine release syndrome. Patients with COVID-19 have shown a high level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. There are currently no effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral drugs or vaccines. COVID-19 disproportionately affects the elderly, both directly, and through a number of significant age-related comorbidities. Undoubtedly, nutrition is a key determinant of maintaining good health. Key dietary components such as vitamins C, D, E, zinc, selenium and the omega 3 fatty acids have well-established immunomodulatory effects, with benefits in infectious disease. Some of these nutrients have also been shown to have a potential role in the management of COVID-19. In this paper, evidence surrounding the role of these dietary components in immunity as well as their specific effect in COVID-19 patients are discussed. In addition, how supplementation of these nutrients may be used as therapeutic modalities potentially to decrease the morbidity and mortality rates of patients with COVID-19 is discussed.","Shakoor, Hira; Feehan, Jack; Al Dhaheri, Ayesha S.; Ali, Habiba I.; Platat, Carine; Ismail, Leila Cheikh; Apostolopoulos, Vasso; Stojanovska, Lily",Maturitas,,397

215242,Hospital-Based Health Care Worker Perceptions of Personal Risk Related to COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Age and disease prevalence are the two biggest risk factors for COVID-19 symptom severity and death. We therefore hypothesized that increased biological age, beyond chronological age, may be driving disease-related trends in COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Using the UK Biobank England data, we tested whether a biological age estimate (PhenoAge) measured more than a decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was predictive of two COVID-19 severity outcomes (inpatient test positivity and COVID-19 related mortality with inpatient test-confirmed COVID-19). Logistic regression models were used with adjustment for age at the pandemic, sex, ethnicity, baseline assessment centers, and pre-existing diseases/conditions. RESULTS: 613 participants tested positive at inpatient settings between March 16 and April 27, 2020, 154 of whom succumbed to COVID-19. PhenoAge was associated with increased risks of inpatient test positivity and COVID-19 related mortality (ORMortality=1.63 per 5 years, 95% CI: 1.43-1.86, p=4.7×10 -13) adjusting for demographics including age at the pandemic. Further adjustment for pre-existing disease s/conditions at baseline (ORM=1.50, 95% CI: 1.30-1.73 per 5 years, p=3.1×10 -8) and at the early pandemic (ORM=1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40 per 5 years, p=0.011) decreased the association. CONCLUSIONS: PhenoAge measured in 2006-2010 was associated with COVID-19 severity outcomes more than 10 years later. These associations were partly accounted for by prevalent chronic diseases proximate to COVID-19 infection. Overall, our results suggest that aging biomarkers, like PhenoAge may capture long-term vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, even before the accumulation of age-related comorbid conditions.","Kuo, Chia-Ling; Pilling, Luke C; Atkins, Janice L; Masoli, Jane A H; Delgado, João; Tignanelli, Christopher; Kuchel, George A; Melzer, David; Beckman, Kenneth B; Levine, Morgan E","J. gerontol.

220468,The effectiveness of COVID-related message framing on public beliefs and behaviors related to plant-based diets,2021,"In this research note, we examine Finnboat, a traditional Finnish family firm, from the interrelated perspectives of crisis behavior and innovation. The firm under study has endured three major crises: the economic recession of the 1990s, the 2008–2009 financial crisis, and the coronavirus pandemic. Our study shows that Finnboat has undertaken only very modest, if any, innovations during stable periods but has conducted a series of radical business-model and technology innovations, triggered by the different crises. This finding implies that during crises, a risk-averse family firm can productively engage into risk-taking and innovative behavior, effectively engaging in a “preference reversal.” We also find evidence of a deliberate accumulation of slack resources during periods of calm, which are mobilized to back up innovation and renewal efforts when a crisis hits. Our findings highlight family firms’ potential to endure crises by adopting a temporal separation logic to the risk-aversion vs. risk-taking paradox, and relatedly, by strategically managing the resource portfolio. Based on the case study, we suggest several research directions, approaches, and methodologies for studying family firm behavior and change during and in-between crises.","Leppäaho, Tanja Ritala Paavo",Journal of Family Business Strategy,,397

The tremendous number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the United States has resulted in a large population of survivors with prolonged post-infectious symptoms. The creation of multidisciplinary post-COVID-19 clinics to address both persistent symptoms and potential long-term complications requires an understanding of the acute disease and the emerging data regarding COVID-19 outcomes. Experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, post-acute respiratory distress syndrome complications, and post-intensive care syndrome also informs anticipated sequelae and clinical program design. Post-COVID-19 clinical programs should be prepared to care for individuals previously hospitalized with COVID-19 (including those who required critical care support), non-hospitalized individuals with persistent respiratory symptoms following COVID-19 infection, and individuals with pre-existing lung disease complicated by COVID-19. Effective multidisciplinary collaboration models leverage lessons learned during the early phases of the pandemic to overcome the unique logistical challenges posed by pandemic circumstances. Collaboration between clinicians and researchers across disciplines will provide insight into survivorship that may shape the treatment of both acute disease and chronic complications.

In attempts to control the pandemic, a range of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) has been implemented worldwide. However, the effect of synchronized NPIs for the control of COVID-19 at temporal and spatial scales has not been well studied. Therefore, a meta-population model that incorporates essential nonlinear processes was constructed to uncover the transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and then assess the effectiveness of synchronized NPIs on COVID-19 dynamics in China. Regional synchronization of NPIs was observed in China, and it was found that a combination of synchronized NPIs (the travel restrictions, the social distancing and the infection isolation) prevented 93.7% of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The use of synchronized NPIs at the time of the Wuhan lockdown may have prevented as much as 38% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, compared with the unsynchronized scenario. The interconnectivity of the epicenter, the implementation time of synchronized NPIs, and the number of regions considered all affected the performance of synchronized NPIs. The results highlight the importance of using synchronized NPIs in high-risk regions for the control of COVID-19 and shed light on effective strategies for future pandemic responses.

225263,Systematic review of registered trials of Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis for COVID-19 health-care workers at the first third of 2020,2020,"The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a highly infectious acute respiratory disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (Prec Clin Med 2020;3:9-13, Lancet 2020;395:497-506, N. Engl J Med 2020a;382:1199-207, Nature 2020;579:270-3). SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is essential to controlling widespread transmission. However, there are several challenges associated with the diagnostic of the COVID-19 during the current outbreak (Liu and Li (2019), Nature 2020;579:265-9, N. Engl J Med 2020;382:727-33). Firstly, the high number of cases overwhelms diagnostic test capacity and proposes the need for a rapid solution for sample processing (Science 2018;360:444-8). Secondly, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other important coronavirus species and subspecies, so detection assays can give false-positive results if they are not efficiently specific to SARS-CoV-2. Thirdly, patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection sometimes have a different respiratory viral infection or co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses (MedRxiv 2020a;1-18). Confirmation of the COVID-19 is performed mainly by virus isolation followed by RT-PCR and sequencing (N. Engl J Med 2020;382:727-33, MedRxiv 2020a, Turkish J Biol 2020;44:192-202). The emergence and outbreak of the novel coronavirus highlighted the urgent need for new therapeutic technologies that are fast, precise, stable, easy to manufacture, and target-specific for surveillance and treatment. Molecular biology tools that include gene-editing approaches such as CRISPR-Cas12/13-based SHERLOCK, DETECTR, CARVER and PAC-MAN, antisense oligonucleotides, antisense peptide nucleic acids, ribozymes, aptamers, and RNAi silencing approaches produced with cutting-edge scientific advances compared to conventional diagnostic or treatment methods could be vital in COVID-19 and other future outbreaks.

One of the information channels that is widely used and referenced by the public is social media. Dissemination of information about the expanse of the coronavirus on social media is arranged by various individuals. This study will explain the disemination of information relating to COVID-19 in terms of the social class of the reader. In this study, we use critical discourse analysis as a method for analyzing data. This study finding is that the information circulation about coronavirus in social media is class bias. General information is conducted through formal language by middle-class groups. On the other hand, many people present alternative information in the form of memes, jokes, and funny content that contains information about spreading the coronavirus. This phenomenon can be categorized as a lower social class attempt to understanding and spreading information about the coronavirus (Cinelli, et al., 2020)outbreak. The media used to disseminate this information contains text, images/photos, or videos that contain memes, organizes, and funny content.

227705,Infant sleep during COVID-19: longitudinal analysis of infants of US mothers in home confinement vs working as usual,2020,"This essay challenges generalizations since the late enlightenment about the effects of epidemics and pandemics on collective mentalities: that from antiquity to the present, epidemics, regardless of the disease, have sparked distrust, social violence, and the blaming of others. By contrast, the pandemic that killed the greatest numbers in world history-the Influenza of 1918-20 - was a pandemic of compassion. No one has yet to uncover this pandemic sparking collective violence or blaming any minorities for spreading the disease anywhere in the globe. The essay then explores the variety of charitable reactions and abnegation that cut across social divisions in communities from theatres of war in Europe to nations thousands of miles from the direct military encounters. Most remarkable, however, was the overflowing volunteerism of women, especially in the US, Canada, and Australia. To explain this widespread charitable reaction, the essay investigates the milieu of the First World War, showing how that context in domestic war settings was not conducive to risking life to aid total strangers, especially when those strangers came from different foreign countries classes, races, or religious faiths. I end with a reflection on the unfolding socio-psychological reactions to Covid-19 from the perspective of 1918-20.","Cohn, Samuel Kline",Med Confl Surviv,,397

228476,A Novel Educational Prescription Web-Based Application to Support Education for Caregivers of People Living With Dementia: Development and Usability Study With Clinicians,2020,"BACKGROUND: In almost all lower and lower middle-income countries, the healthcare system is structured in the customary model of in-person or face to face model of care. With the current global COVID-19 pandemics, the usual health care service has been significantly altered in many aspects. Given the fragile health system and high number of immunocompromised populations in lower and lower-middle income countries, the economic impacts of COVID-19 are anticipated to be worse. In such scenarios, technological solutions like, Telemedicine which is defined as the delivery of healthcare service remotely using telecommunication technologies for exchange of medical information, diagnosis, consultation and treatment is critical. The aim of this study was to assess healthcare providers' acceptance and preferred modality of telemedicine and factors thereof among health professionals working in Ethiopia. METHODS: A multi-centric online survey was conducted via social media platforms such as telegram channels, Facebook groups/pages and email during Jul 1- Sep 21, 2020. The questionnaire was adopted from previously validated model in low income setting. Internal consistency of items was assessed using Cronbach alpha (&#945;), composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) to evaluate both discriminant and convergent validity of constructs. The extent of relationship among variables were evaluated by Structural equation modeling (SEM) using SPSS Amos version 23. RESULTS: From the expected 423 responses, 319 (75.4%) participants responded to the survey questionnaire during the data collection period. The majority of participants were male (78.1%), age <30 (76.8%) and had less than five years of work experience (78.1%). The structural model result confirmed the hypothesis ""self-efficacy has a significant positive effect on effort expectancy"" with a standardized coefficient estimate (ß) of 0.76 and p-value <0.001. The result also indicated that self-efficacy, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence have a significant direct effect on user's attitude toward using telemedicine. User's behavioral intention to use telemedicine was also influenced by effort expectancy and attitude. The model also ruled out that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence does not directly influence user's intention to use telemedicine. The squared multiple correlations (r2) value indicated that 57.1% of the variance in attitude toward using telemedicine and 63.6% of the variance in behavioral intention to use telemedicine is explained by the current structural model. CONCLUSION: This study found that effort expectancy and attitude were significantly predictors of healthcare professionals' acceptance of telemedicine. Attitude toward using telemedicine systems was also highly influenced by performance expectancy, self-efficacy and facilitating conditions. effort expectancy and attitude were also significant mediators in predicting users' acceptance of telemedicine. In addition, mHealth approach was the most preferred modality of telemedicine and this opens an opportunity to integrate telemedicine systems in the health system during and post pandemic health services in low-income countries.","Shiferaw, Kirubel Biruk; Mengiste, Shegaw Anagaw; Gullslett, Monika Knudsen; Zeleke, Atinkut Alamirrew; Tilahun, Binyam; Tebeje, Tsion; Wondimu, Robel; Desalegn, Surafel; Mehari, Eden Abetu",PLoS One,,397

This study aimed to build and validate a simple tool that can quickly predict the deterioration and survival of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 351 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Yichang between 9 January to 25 March 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were randomly grouped into training (n = 246) or a validation (n = 105) dataset. Risk factors associated with deterioration were identified using univariate logistic regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The factors were then incorporated into the nomogram. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the survival of patients between the low- and high-risk groups divided by the cut-off point. RESULTS: The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to construct the nomogram via four parameters (white blood cells, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte&#8805;0.8 × 109/L, and lactate dehydrogenase &#8805;400 U/L). The nomogram showed good discriminative performance with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.945 (95% confidence interval: 0.91-0.98), and good calibration (P = 0.539). Besides, the nomogram showed good discrimination performance and good calibration in the validation and total cohorts (AUROC = 0.979 and AUROC = 0.954, respectively). Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the model had clinical application value. Kaplan-Meier analysis illustrated that low-risk patients had a significantly higher 8-week survival rate than those in the high-risk group (100% vs 71.41% and P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: A simple-to-use nomogram with excellent performance in predicting deterioration risk and survival of COVID-19 patients was developed and validated. However, it is necessary to verify this nomogram using a large-scale multicenter study.","Zeng, Zhiyong; Wu, Chaohui; Lin, Zhenlv; Ye, Yong; Feng, Shaodan; Fang, Yingying; Huang, Yanmei; Li, Minhua; Du, Debing; Chen, Gongping; Kang, Dezhi",BMC Infect Dis,,397

Given the potential for subsequent deterioration and growing appreciation of complications relating to COVID-19 infection, this follow up study was instigated to provide clinical reassurance that discharged patients had followed a safe clinical course. 199 patients discharged from the ED of our central London hospital were identified over a 20-day period at the height of the pandemic in April 2020. 44 had already reattended ED and 12 had been admitted. At 2-week telephone follow-up, 14 patients were identified who required urgent recall for assessment. At 4-week telephone follow-up, 87 patients were identified with persistent symptoms requiring face to face review. A COVID-19 follow-up clinic was therefore established to provide multi-professional review and diagnostics. 65 patients attended for this assessment.

231385,Sleep quality in times of Covid-19 pandemic,2020,"The development of a tractable small animal model faithfully reproducing human COVID-19 pathogenesis would arguably meet a pressing need in biomedical research. Thus far, most investigators have used transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 in epithelial cells (K18-hACE2 transgenic mice) that are intranasally instilled with a liquid SARS-CoV-2 suspension under deep anesthesia. Unfortunately, this experimental approach results in disproportionate high CNS infection leading to fatal encephalitis, which is rarely observed in humans and severely limits this models usefulness. Here, we describe the use of an inhalation tower system that allows exposure of unanesthetized mice to aerosolized virus under controlled conditions. Aerosol exposure of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice to SARS-CoV-2 resulted in robust viral replication in the respiratory tract, anosmia, and airway obstruction, but did not lead to fatal viral neuroinvasion. When compared to intranasal inoculation, aerosol infection resulted in a more pronounced lung pathology including increased immune infiltration, fibrin deposition and a transcriptional signature comparable to that observed in SARS-CoV-2- infected patients. This model may prove useful for studies of viral transmission, disease pathogenesis (including long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection) and therapeutic interventions.","Fumagalli, Valeria; Rava, Micol; Marotta, Davide; Lucia, Pietro Di; Laura, Chiara; Sala, Eleonora; Grillo, Marta; Bono, Elisa; Giustini, Leonardo; Perucchini, Chiara; Mainetti, Marta; Sessa, Alessandro; Garcia-Manteiga, Jose; Donnici, Lorena; Manganaro, Lara; Delbue, Serena; Broccoli, Vania; Francesco, Raffaele De; Kuka, Mirela; Guidotti, Luca; Iannacone, Matteo",,,397

To reduce this gap, we introduce a generic wavelet shrinkage function for denoising which is adaptive to both the wavelet scales as well as the noise standard deviation. It is inferred from trained results of a tightly parametrised function which is inherited from nonlinear diffusion. Our proposed shrinkage function is smooth and compact while only using two parameters. In contrast to many existing shrinkage functions, it is able to enhance image structures by amplifying wavelet coefficients. Experiments show that it outperforms classical shrinkage functions by a significant margin.","Alt, Tobias; Weickert, Joachim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.09234v3.pdf,397

In this study, we quantified the endogenous melatonin levels in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The melatonin concentrations in root, stem, and leaf were 150.60, 37.92, and 40.58 ng g fresh weight- 1, respectively. The effects of exogenous melatonin (1 µM) on plant growth, photosynthesis, antioxidant enzyme activity, and ion homeostasis in upland cotton seedlings exposed to 100 mM NaCl treatment were determined. Pretreatment (prior to exposure to salt stress) of seedlings with exogenous melatonin significantly alleviated plant growth inhibition by salt stress and maintained an improved photosynthetic capacity. The application of melatonin also significantly reduced the salt-induced oxidative damage, possibly through the accumulation of osmotic regulatory substances and the activation of antioxidant enzymes. We also showed that exogenous melatonin regulated the expression of stress-responsive and ion-channel genes under salinity, which could contribute to improved salt tolerance in cotton. Taken together, our study provides evidence that cotton contains endogenous melatonin, and it may have unraveled crucial evidence of the role of melatonin in cotton against salt stress.","Shen, Jian; Chen, Dongdong; Zhang, Xiaopei; Song, Lirong; Dong, Jie; Xu, Qingjiang; Hu, Mengjiao; Cheng, Yingying; Shen, Fafu; Wang, Wei",,,397

Here, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) analysis mapped antibody epitopes in the plasma of COVID-19 patients (n = 86) experiencing a wide range of disease states. The experiments identified antibodies to a 21-residue epitope from nucleocapsid (termed Ep9) associated with severe disease, including admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), requirement for ventilators, or death. Importantly, anti-Ep9 antibodies can be detected within 6 days post-symptom onset and sometimes within 1 day. Furthermore, anti-Ep9 antibodies correlate with various comorbidities and hallmarks of immune hyperactivity. We introduce a simple-to-calculate, disease risk factor score to quantitate each patient's comorbidities and age. For patients with anti-Ep9 antibodies, scores above 3.0 predict more severe disease outcomes with a 13.42 likelihood ratio (96.7% specificity). The results lay the groundwork for a new type of COVID-19 prognostic to allow early identification and triage of high-risk patients. Such information could guide more effective therapeutic intervention.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over two million deaths worldwide. Despite efforts to fight the virus, the disease continues to overwhelm hospitals with severely ill patients. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is readily accomplished through a multitude of reliable testing platforms; however, prognostic prediction remains elusive. To this end, we identified a short epitope from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and also a disease risk factor score based upon comorbidities and age. The presence of antibodies specifically binding to this epitope plus a score cutoff can predict severe COVID-19 outcomes with 96.7% specificity.","Sen, Sanjana R; Sanders, Emily C; Gabriel, Kristin N; Miller, Brian M; Isoda, Hariny M; Salcedo, Gabriela S; Garrido, Jason E; Dyer, Rebekah P; Nakajima, Rie; Jain, Aarti; Caldaruse, Ana-Maria; Santos, Alicia M; Bhuvan, Keertna; Tifrea, Delia F; Ricks-Oddie, Joni L; Felgner, Philip L; Edwards, Robert A; Majumdar, Sudipta; Weiss, Gregory A",MSphere,,397

L’atteinte sévère concerne les patients oxygénoréquérants, et la forme sévère, les patients nécessitant un transfert en soins intensifs ou réanimation. De nombreuses études ont démontré l’efficacité de la corticothérapie chez les patients oxygénoréquérants, avec une diminution du taux de mortalité. On observe néanmoins des patients évoluant vers une atteinte critique, sans critère prédictif défini. La TDM thoracique joue désormais un rôle central dans le diagnostic et la prise en charge de la COVID-19, avec des atteintes spécifiques évoluant au cours de la maladie. L’objectif de cette étude était de définir l’utilité de la TDM thoracique au cours du traitement de la COVID-19, afin de rechercher un pattern radiologique prédictif de l’évolution clinique. Matériels et méthodes Nous avons inclus les patients admis pour une pneumonie à SARS-CoV-2 sévère ou critique, traités par corticothérapie, ayant bénéficiés d’une TDM thoracique avant la corticothérapie (TDM pré-CTC) puis sous corticothérapie (TDM per-CTC), dans le centre hospitalier universitaire de Nice. Les données cliniques, biologiques et radiologiques des patients répondant aux critères d’inclusions étaient recueillis à partir des dossiers médicaux informatisés, du 26 mars au 30 décembre 2020. Le critère de jugement principal était l’analyse de l’évolution des atteintes parenchymateuses entre la TDM pré- et per-CTC, mise en relation avec l’évolution clinique. L’évolution clinique était définie par la cinétique des besoins en oxygène dans les 48h suivant la TDM per-CTC. Les atteintes scanographiques étaient définies en pourcentage d’atteinte parenchymateuse de 4 patterns. L’analyse scanographique étaient réalisée de manière systématique en aveugle par deux radiologues. Résultats Au total, 29 patients répondaient à nos critères d’inclusion. La moyenne d’âge était de 65,5 ans, en majorité des hommes (83 %). Au total, 8 patients (28 %) s’aggravèrent sur le plan clinique avec une amélioration dans 75 % des cas des vaisseaux épaissis et du « crazy paving ». Parmi les 21 patients présentant une évolution clinique favorable, on constatait une aggravation dans 57 % des cas du verre dépoli et dans 52 % de la condensation. L’évolution de la pneumonie organisée (PO) était significativement corrélée à l’évolution clinique p=0,0089 (odds ratio : 0,0882, intervalle de confiance à 95 % [0,0064 ;0,7157]). En effet, 81 % des patients avec une évolution clinique favorable présentaient une diminution du pourcentage d’atteinte parenchymateuse de la PO. Tandis que 75 % des patients en aggravation clinique avaient, de manière concomitante, une aggravation du pourcentage d’atteinte parenchymateuse de la PO. Conclusion Notre étude montre une cohérence entre l’évolution clinique et l’évolution de la PO pouvant faire de la TDM thoracique un outil de monitorage. La présence ou l’aggravation de la PO, après 4 jours de corticothérapie, serait prédictive d’une hypoxémie nécessitant une intensification ou une prolongation de la corticothérapie.","Courdurié, A.; Juston, M.; Foglino, P.; Demonchy, E.",Infectious Diseases Now,,397

This study compares the performance of 18 machine learning algorithms for predicting ICU admission and mortality among COVID-19 patients. Using COVID-19 patient data from the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Healthcare database, we developed and internally validated models using patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) between March-April 2020 (n = 3597) and further validated them using temporally distinct individuals who presented to the ED between May-August 2020 (n = 1711). We show that ensemble-based models perform better than other model types at predicting both 5-day ICU admission and 28-day mortality from COVID-19. CRP, LDH, and O2 saturation were important for ICU admission models whereas eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, and neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages were the most important variables for predicting mortality. Implementing such models could help in clinical decision-making for future infectious disease outbreaks including COVID-19.","Subudhi, Sonu; Verma, Ashish; Patel, Ankit B; Hardin, C Corey; Khandekar, Melin J; Lee, Hang; McEvoy, Dustin; Stylianopoulos, Triantafyllos; Munn, Lance L; Dutta, Sayon; Jain, Rakesh K",NPJ Digit Med,,397

246345,Self-care of Frontline Health Care Workers: During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Quarantine plays a key role in controlling the pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study investigated (a) the associations between mandatory quarantine status and negative cognitions (perceived discrimination because of COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection)/mental health status (emotional distress because of COVID-19, probable depression, and self-harm/suicidal ideation), (b) the associations between the negative cognitions and mental health status, and (c) potential mediations between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 24,378 students of 26 universities in 16 Chinese cities (February 1-10, 2020). Correlation coefficients, odds ratios (OR), structural equation modeling, and other statistics were used for data analysis. Mandatory quarantined status was significantly and positively associated with perceived discrimination (Cohen's d = 0.62), perceived high/very high risk of infection (OR = 1.61), emotional distress (Cohen's d = 0.46), probable depression (OR = 2.54), and self-harm/suicidal ideation (OR = 4.98). Perceived discrimination was moderately and positively associated with emotional distress (Spearman correlation = 0.44). Associations between perceived risk of infection and mental health variables were significant but relatively weak. Cross-sectional mediation models showed good model fit, but the overall indirect paths via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress only accounted for 12-15% of the total effects between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation. In conclusion, quarantined participants were more likely than others to perceive discrimination and exhibit mental distress. It is important to integrate mental health care into the planning and implementation of quarantine measures. Future longitudinal studies to explore mechanisms underlying the mental health impact of quarantines are warranted.

247680,COVID-19 Vaccination Perception and Attitude among Healthcare Workers in Egypt,2021,"In the absence of neither an effective treatment or vaccine and with an incomplete understanding of the epidemiological cycle, Govt. has implemented a nationwide lockdown to reduce COVID-19 transmission in India. To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R 0). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R 0. Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number (R t) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those locations. Finally, combining our results, we provided an effective lockdown policy to reduce future COVID-19 transmission in India.","Sardar, Tridip; Nadim, Sk Shahid; Rana, Sourav; Chattopadhyay, Joydev",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,397

We (1) characterized and analyzed data collected from the first cohort of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, according to the symptomatic state, and (2) identified factors associated with the symptomatic state. The association between the symptomatic state and testing positive in three subsequent RT-PCR testing rounds was also quantified. Between February 28 and April 8, 2020, 1,249 cases were reported. Sociodemographic characteristics, working status, travel history, and chronic comorbidities of 791 cases were analyzed according to the symptomatic state (symptomatic or asymptomatic). After the first confirmatory test, the results of three subsequent tests were analyzed. The mean age of the 791 cases was 35.6 ± 12.7 years (range: 1-81). Nearly 57.0% of cases were symptomatic. The two most frequent symptoms were fever (58.0%) and cough (41.0%). Symptomatic cases (mean age 36.3 ± 12.6 years) were significantly older than asymptomatic cases (mean age 34.5 ± 12.7 years). Compared with nonworking populations, working in public places (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.76, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.11-2.80), healthcare settings (aOR, 2.09, 95% CI: 1.01-4.31), or in the aviation and tourism sectors (aOR, 2.24, 95% CI: 1.14-4.40) was independently associated with the symptomatic state. Reporting at least one chronic comorbidity was also associated with symptomatic cases (aOR, 1.76, 95% CI: 1.03-3.01). Compared with asymptomatic cases, symptomatic cases had a prolonged duration of viral shedding and consistent odds of &#8805;2 positive COVID-19 tests result out of the three subsequent testing rounds. A substantial proportion of the diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi were asymptomatic. Quarantining asymptomatic cases, implementing prevention measures, and raising awareness among populations working in high-risk settings are warranted.","Al-Rifai, Rami H; Acuna, Juan; Al Hossany, Farida Ismail; Aden, Bashir; Al Memari, Shamma Abdullah; Al Mazrouei, Shereena Khamis; Ahmed, Luai A",PLoS One,,397

Considerations include the infective risk of patients who are inherently immunosuppressed from their malignancy and therapies, long-term oncological outcomes from the treatment decisions undertaken during this extraordinary period, and diverted healthcare resources to support a coordinated whole-of-society outbreak response. In this review, we chronicle the repercussions of the COVID-19 outbreak on breast cancer management in Singapore and describe our approach to triaging and prioritising care of breast tumours. We further propose adaptations to established clinical processes and practices across the different specialties involved in breast oncology, with references to the relevant evidence base or expert consensus guidelines. These recommendations have been developed within the unique context of Singapore's public healthcare sector. They can serve as a resource to guide breast cancer management for future contingencies in this city-state, while certain elements therein may be extrapolatable to other medical systems during this global public health emergency.","Chan, Jack Junjie; Sim, Yirong; Ow, Samuel Guan Wei; Lim, Joline Si Jing; Kusumawidjaja, Grace; Zhuang, Qingyuan; Wong, Ru Xin; Wong, Fuh Yong; Tan, Veronique Kiak Mien; Tan, Tira Jing Ying",Endocr Relat Cancer,,397

252626,Differences in mental health and health-related quality of life between the Israeli and Italian population during a COVID-19 quarantine,2021,"Many diseases as well as acute conditions can lead to fatigue, which can be either temporary or chronic in nature. Acute fatigue develops frequently after physical exercise or after alcohol hangover, whereas microbial infections such as influenza or COVID-19 and chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis are often associated with chronic fatigue. Oxidative stress and a resulting disturbance of mitochondrial function are likely to be common denominators for many forms of fatigue, and antioxidant treatments have been shown to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of fatigue. In this study, we review the role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in fatigue and the antioxidant effects of the intake of molecular hydrogen. We propose that molecular hydrogen is well suited for the treatment of temporary and chronic forms of oxidative stress-associated fatigue.","Lucas, Kurt; Rosch, Moritz; Langguth, Peter",Arch Pharm (Weinheim),,397

From February 14 to May 31, 2020, 29 patients: 23 men and 6 women, with an average age (SD) of 66.4 years (±6,2) required tracheostomy. The average intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 36 days [31-56.5]. The average days on mechanical ventilation was 28,5 days (±9.7). Mean time to tracheostomy was 15.2 days (±9.5) with an average disconnection time after procedure of 11.3 days (±7.4). The average hospital stay was 55 days [39-79]. A directly proportional relation between the number of days of MV and the number of days from ICU admission until tracheostomy showed a significant value of p = 0.008. For each day of delay in tracheostomy, the days of mechanical ventilation were increased by 0.6 days. There was no relation between days to tracheostomy and days to disconnection (p = 0.092). PaO2 / FiO2 (PAFI) before tracheostomy and Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) at admission presented a statistical relation with mortality, with an OR of 1.683 (95%CI; 0.926-2.351; p = 0.078) and an OR of 1.312 (CI95%: 1.011-1.703; p = 0.034) respectively. The length of stay in the ICU until the tracheostomy was not related to the risk of death (p = 0.682). PEEP and PaO2/FiO2 (PAFI) at admission and before tracheostomy and APACHE II, SAPS III and SOFA at admission did not show influence over time on MV. We conclude that the delay in tracheostomy increase the days on mechanical ventilation but does not influence stay or mortality.","Mata-Castro, Nieves; Sanz-López, Lorena; Pinacho-Martínez, Paloma; Varillas-Delgado, David; Miró-Murillo, Miguel; Martín-Delgado, María Cruz",Am J Otolaryngol,,397

255409,Health-Related Quality of Life for People With Acute and Chronic Illnesses During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The severe inflammatory state secondary to COVID-19 leads to a severe derangement of hemostasis that has been recently described as a state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and consumption coagulopathy, defined as decreased platelet count, increased fibrin(ogen) degradation products such as D-dimer, as well as low fibrinogen. AIMS: Whole blood from 24 patients admitted at the intensive care unit because of COVID-19 was collected and evaluated with thromboelastography by the TEG point-of-care device on a single occasion and six underwent repeated measurements on two consecutive days for a total of 30 observations. Plasma was evaluated for the other parameters of hemostasis. RESULTS: TEG parameters are consistent with a state of hypercoagulability as shown by decreased values, and increased values of K angle and MA. Platelet count was normal or increased, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were near(normal). Fibrinogen was increased and D-dimer was dramatically increased. C-reactive protein was increased. Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (n = 11) were increased. Antithrombin (n = 11) was marginally decreased and protein C (n = 11) was increased. CONCLUSION: The results of this cohort of patients with COVID-19 are not consistent with acute DIC, rather they support hypercoagulability together with a severe inflammatory state. These findings may explain the events of venous thromboembolism observed in some of these patients and support antithrombotic prophylaxis/treatment. Clinical trials are urgently needed to establish the type of drug, dosage, and optimal duration of prophylaxis.","Panigada, Mauro; Bottino, Nicola; Tagliabue, Paola; Grasselli, Giacomo; Novembrino, Cristina; Chantarangkul, Veena; Pesenti, Antonio; Peyvandi, Flora; Tripodi, Armando",J Thromb Haemost,,397

METHODS: Data from post-session surveys were analyzed to assess participant satisfaction, knowledge gaps, change in knowledge, and anticipated changes in practice as a result of Project ECHO COVID-19. A content analysis was conducted of the 243 questions and concerns posted by over 2000 participants in the Question and Answer function of Zoom during the first 8 sessions (March 4-April 29, 2020). RESULTS: Of 5243 registrants, 49% attended at least one session. Respondents agreed or strongly agreed that didactic sessions (97%) and case presentations (96%) met their learning needs; 93% reported gaining new knowledge, and 88% would implement that knowledge. Only 32% and 53% of respondents anticipated changing workflows and adapting to telehealth, respectively, despite the need for both as the pandemic continued. The content analysis identified 3 categories: clinical operations (eg, testing, triage, telehealth, billing); patient care (diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, management of high-risk vulnerable populations); and epidemiology (viral spread, implications for public health). CONCLUSIONS: Care of vulnerable populations and clinical operations should be addressed when planning education and clinical interventions for public health crises. Adapting the Project ECHO model to be more scalable was an effective means of creating a community of practice among health professionals when evidence-based guidance was not available to manage the implications of a pandemic.","Thies, Kathleen M; Gonzalez, Melanie; Porto, Ariel; Ashley, Karen L; Korman, Stephanie; Lamb, Mandy",J Prim Care Community Health,,397

This study contributes by reporting and analysing data from a national survey conducted in line with UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommendations and standard methods, providing an internationally comparable pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) snapshot of food insecurity. METHODS: Data came from a nationally representative 2019 UK sample (N = 2000) surveyed by Ipsos-Mori. Prevalence of food insecurity was assessed using the UN FAO Food Insecurity Experience Scale. Logistic regression was used to model food insecurity in relation to geographic and socio-demographic variables. RESULTS: Severe food insecurity was reported by 3% of the sample, an increase of 66.7% over the last directly comparable UK analysis (Gallup World Poll data from 2016 to 2018). Indication of some degree of food insecurity was reported by 14.2% of the sample and tended to be higher amongst younger age groups, those on lower incomes, and home renters (as opposed to owners). No geographic variables were significantly associated with food insecurity prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that prevalence of severe food insecurity was already increasing before the COVID-19 pandemic, across all areas of the UK, is cause for concern. Our results provide an important benchmark for assessing the impact of COVID-19 on food insecurity.","Pool, Ursula; Dooris, Mark",J. public health (Oxf),,397

The rapid spreading of this pandemic, together with the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, has led governments around the world to take drastic actions, including limiting the free movement of citizens, establishing maximum capacities and enforcing social distancing measures, among others. Consequently, major medical congresses, meetings, conferences, and workshops have been either cancelled or delayed. This situation has forced rapid changes in how the medical and scientific communities interact, and they now mainly meet using online technology. While political leaders have closed the borders of their countries as a logical public health measure, we have witnessed medical societies, clinicians, and scientists breaking other barriers and creating a new reality of global technological collaboration unlike anything seen before. An immense variety of webinars, online conferences, podcasts, courses and many other forms of uploaded content can be seen from the comfort of one's own workplace or home at any time, and this has exponentially increased our reach; however, this great number of possibilities can be overwhelming, and it is more important than ever to separate wheat from chaff when deciding what online event to attend.

In the last decades, the endogenous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) has emerged as modulator of several biological functions and its deficiency has been associated with different disorders. Therefore, many H2 S-releasing agents have been developed as potential therapeutic tools for diseases related with impaired H2 S production and/or activity. Some of these compounds are in advanced clinical trials. Presently, the pivotal role of H2 S in modulating the inflammatory response and pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade is well recognized, and the usefulness of some H2 S-donors for the treatment of acute lung inflammation has been reported. Recent data is elucidating several mechanisms of action, which may account for antiviral effects of H2 S. Noteworthy, some preliminary clinical results suggest an inverse relationship between endogenous H2 S levels and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, repurposing of H2 S-releasing drugs may be a potential therapeutic opportunity for treatment of COVID-19.

The following viruses were used for comparative computer analysis: coronavirus (SARS-CoV), serotype C subgroup adenovirus C (adenoid 71 strain), measles virus (ICHINOSE-BA strain), rubella (Therien strain) and respiratory syncytial (B1 strain) virus. The search for homologous sequences in viral and human immune proteins was carried out by computer comparison of 12 amino acid fragments, which were assigned as homologous at identity in ≥ 8 positions. The data obtained showed that viral proteins contained homologous motifs in several host immune proteins involved in regulating both the inflammatory response and immune response. Mechanistically, all viruses studied were characterized by sequences homologous to host immune proteins such as complement system proteins, integrins, apoptosis inhibitory proteins, interleukins, and toll-like receptors. Such cellular proteins are actively involved in regulating host inflammatory process and immune response formation. Upon that, a set of host immune proteins, to which homologous fragments were found in viral proteins, was individual for each virus. Interestingly, the largest amount of homologous fragments (up to 20) was mainly concentrated in viral proteins with polymerase and protease activity suggesting that these proteins apart to their major role were involved in production of viral nucleic acids and might participate in regulating host immune system. Envelope, internal and non-structural viral proteins, homologous fragments were detected in much smaller quantities (from 1 to 4). In addition, two fragments homologous to various motifs of the same cellular protein were detected in some viral proteins. Thus, the data obtained further support our understanding that signs of immune system disorders in viral infections can result from multi-layered processes associated with modulation of host innate and adaptive immune system, and open up new approaches to study interaction of viruses with host immune system and identify new functions of viral proteins.","Zhilinskaya, Irina N.",Rus.

271438,The impact of having inadequate safety equipment on mental health,2020,"As it has been shown that lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have in vitro activity against coronaviruses, they were used to treat COVID-19 during the first wave of the epidemic in Lombardy, Italy. To compare the rate of clinical improvement between those who started LPV/ritonavir (LPV/r)+HCQ within 5 days of symptom onset (early treatment, ET) and those who started later (delayed treatment, DT). This was a retrospective intent-to-treat analysis of the hospitalized patients who started LPV/r + HCQ between 21 February and 20 March 2020. The association between the timing of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic models. The study involved 172 patients: 43 (25%) in the ET and 129 (75%) in the DT group. The rate of clinical improvement increased over time to 73.3% on day 30, without any significant difference between the two groups (Gray's test P = .213). After adjusting for potentially relevant clinical variables, there was no significant association between the timing of the start of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ET vs DT = 1.45, 95% confidence interval 0.50-4.19). Eight percent of the patients discontinued the treatment becausebecause of severe gastrointestinal disorders attributable to LPV/r. The timing of the start of LPV/r + HCQ treatment does not seem to affect the clinical course of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Together with the severe adverse events attributable to LPV/r, this raises concerns about the benefit of using this combination to treat COVID-19.","Giacomelli, Andrea; Pagani, Gabriele; Ridolfo, Anna L; Oreni, Letizia; Conti, Federico; Pezzati, Laura; Bradanini, Lucia; Casalini, Giacomo; Bassoli, Cinzia; Morena, Valentina; Passerini, Simone; Rizzardini, Giuliano; Cogliati, Chiara; Ceriani, Elisa; Colombo, Riccardo; Rusconi, Stefano; Gervasoni, Cristina; Cattaneo, Dario; Antinori, Spinello; Galli, Massimo",J. med. virol,,397

METHODS: Literature search was done using PubMed to find MEDLINE indexed articles relevant to this study. As of 25 November 2020, the search has been conducted by combining the MeSH words ""COVID-19"" and ""Influenza"". RESULTS: Eighteen articles were finally selected in adult patients. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients, while pulmonary diseases and immunocompromised conditions were significantly more common in influenza patients. The incidence rates of fever, vomiting, ocular and otorhinolaryngological symptoms were found to be significantly higher in influenza patients when compared with COVID-19 patients. However, neurologic symptoms and diarrhea were statistically more frequent in COVID-19 patients. The level of white cell count and procalcitonin was significantly higher in influenza patients, whereas thrombopenia and elevated transaminases were significantly more common in COVID-19 patients. Ground-grass opacities, interlobular septal thickening, and a peripheral distribution were more common in COVID-19 patients than in influenza patients where consolidations and linear opacities were described instead. COVID-19 patients were significantly more often transferred to intensive care unit with a higher rate of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This study estimated differences of COVID-19 and influenza patients which can help clinicians during the co-circulation of the two viruses.","Osman, Molka; Klopfenstein, Timothée; Belfeki, Nabil; Gendrin, Vincent; Zayet, Souheil",Viruses,,397

As the hydrophobicity of apoA-I is considered important for its lipid transport, novel AMPs were designed and synthesized in this study by gradually increasing the hydrophobicity of the parent peptide and their anti-atherosclerotic effects were tested. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Seventeen new AMPs (P1-P17) with incrementally increased hydrophobicity were designed and synthesized by replacing the amino acids 221-240 of apoA-I (VLESFKVSFLSALEEYTKKL). Their effects on cholesterol efflux were evaluated. Their cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity were also measured. The in vitro mechanism of the action of the new peptides were explored. Adult apolipoprotein E-/- mice were used to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic activity of the best candidate, and the mechanistic basis of its anti-atherosclerotic effects were explored. KEY RESULTS: Seventeen new AMPs (P1-P17) were synthesized and their cholesterol efflux activity and cytotoxicity were closely related to their hydrophobicity. P12 (FLEKLKELLEHLKELLTKLL), as the best candidate, most strongly promoted cholesterol efflux among the non-toxic peptides (P1-P12). With its phospholipid affinity, P12 can effortlessly facilitate cholesterol transport through ATP-binding cassette transporter A1. In vivo, P12 exhibited prominent anti-atherosclerotic activity via coupling with HDL. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: P12 featured proper hydrophobicity, which ensured its efficient binding with cytomembrane phospholipids, cholesterol, and HDL and provided a basis for its ability to reversely transport cholesterol and treat atherosclerosis.","Gou, Sanhu; Wang, Li; Zhong, Chao; Chen, Xinyue; Ouyang, Xu; Li, Beibei; Bao, Guangjun; Liu, Hui; Zhang, Yun; Ni, Jingman",Br. j. pharmacol,,397

Studies were conducted to evaluate the relation between OSA and Allergic rhinitis (AR). Non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) is a condition with a symptomatology apparently similar to AR. The aim of this study was to evaluate the different presence of OSA in patients suffering from NARES and AR. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients were enrolled and subdivided into NARES, AR and control groups. NARES and AR diagnosis were performed using ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) protocol. All patients were screened for OSA with home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) exam analyzing AHI (Apnea Hypopnea Index) values. Results: Results showed that 60% of patients affected by NARES presented OSA. On the contrary, altered AHI was found only in 35% of patients affected by AR and in 10% of patients belonging to the control group. Conclusions: In conclusion, data showed that there was an increased risk of OSA in NARES patients respect to AR patients and healthy patients.","Pace, Annalisa; Iannella, Giannicola; Rossetti, Valeria; Visconti, Irene Claudia; Gulotta, Giampiero; Cavaliere, Carlo; De Vito, Andrea; Maniaci, Antonino; Cocuzza, Salvatore; Magliulo, Giuseppe; Ciofalo, Andrea",Medicina (Kaunas),,397
277211,Narrative identity in borderline personality disorder,2021,"Prediction of COVID-19 spread plays a significant role in the epidemiology study and government battles against the epidemic. However, the existing studies on COVID-19 prediction are dominated by constant model parameters, unable to reflect the actual situation of COVID-19 spread. This paper presents a new method for dynamic prediction of COVID-19 spread by considering time-dependent model parameters. This method discretises the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-dead (SEIRD) epidemiological model in time domain to construct the nonlinear state-space equation for dynamic estimation of COVID-19 spread. A maximum likelihood estimation theory is established to online estimate time-dependent model parameters. Subsequently, an extended Kalman filter is developed to estimate dynamic COVID-19 spread based on the online estimated model parameters. The proposed method is applied to simulate and analyse the COVID-19 pandemics in China and the United States based on daily reported cases, demonstrating its efficacy in modelling and prediction of COVID-19 spread.","Song, Jialu; Xie, Hujin; Gao, Bingbing; Zhong, Yongmin; Gu, Chengfan; Choi, Kup-Sze",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,397

Existing methods use graph-theoretic centrality measures and expensive message-passing algorithms, requiring knowledge of the underlying dynamics and its parameters. In this paper, we revisit this problem using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn P0. We establish a theoretical limit for the identification of P0 in a class of epidemic models. We evaluate our method against different epidemic models on both synthetic and a real-world contact network considering a disease with history and characteristics of COVID-19. % We observe that GNNs can identify P0 close to the theoretical bound on accuracy, without explicit input of dynamics or its parameters. In addition, GNN is over 100 times faster than classic methods for inference on arbitrary graph topologies. Our theoretical bound also shows that the epidemic is like a ticking clock, emphasizing the importance of early contact-tracing. We find a maximum time after which accurate recovery of the source becomes impossible, regardless of the algorithm used.","Shah, Chintan; Dehmamy, Nima; Perra, Nicola; Chinazzi, Matteo; Barab'asi, Albert-L'aszl'o; Vespignani, Alessandro; Yu, Rose",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11913v2.pdf,397

METHODS: Twelve experts in gynecological cancer designed an electronic survey, according to recommendations from international societies, using an online platform. The survey included 22 questions on five topics: consultation care, preinvasive cervical pathology, and cervical, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. The questionnaire was distributed to 1052 specialists in 14 Latin American countries. A descriptive analysis was carried out using statistical software. RESULTS: A total of 610 responses were received, for an overall response rate of 58.0%. Respondents favored offering teleconsultation as triage for post-cancer treatment follow-up (94.6%), neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer (95.6%), and total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and defining adjuvant treatment with histopathological features in early stage endometrial cancer (85.4%). Other questions showed agreement rates of over 64%, except for review of pathology results in person and use of upfront concurrent chemoradiation for early stage cervical cancer (disagreement 56.4% and 58.9%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Latin American specialists accepted some alternative management strategies for gynecological cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may reflect the region's particularities. The COVID-19 pandemic led Latin American specialists to accept alternative management strategies for gynecological cancer care, especially regarding surgical decisions.","Rodriguez, Juliana; Fletcher, Angélica; Heredia, Fernando; Fernandez, Robinson; Ramírez Salazar, Heidy; Sanabria, Daniel; Burbano Luna, Javier; Guerrero, Eduardo; Pierre, Marc-Edy; Rendón, Gabriel J; Rosero, Indira; Trujillo, Lina María; Ribeiro, Reitan; Baiocchi, Glauco; Lopez Blanco, Aldo; Malca, Magaly; Hoegl, Jorge; Borges Garnica, Alfredo; Lasso de la Vega, Jorge; Scasso, Santiago; Laufer, Joel; Estrada, Erick Estuarto; Gutierrez Criado, Armando; Herbert Nuñez, Guillermo Sidney; Cantú-de Leon, David; Medina, Gonzalo; Pendola Gómez, Luis; Saadi, José; Noll, Florencia; Arévalo Sandoval, Danilo; Ferreira Oliveira, Alexandre; Pareja, Rene",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,,397

Many natural biomolecules (steroid hormones, fatty acids, vitamins) and ~60% of prescribed medications are processed by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The objective of this work was to determine the impact of infection and vaccines on drug metabolism. METHODS: The impact of an adenovirus-based vaccine expressing Ebola glycoprotein (AdEBO) and H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses on hepatic CYP 3A4 and associated nuclear receptors was evaluated in human hepatocytes (HC-04 cells) and in mice. RESULTS: CYP3A activity was suppressed by 55% in mice 24 h after administration of mouse-adapted H1N1, while Ë10% activity remained in HC-04 cells after infection with H1N1 and H3N2 due to global suppression of cellular translation capacity, indicated by reduction (70%, H1N1, 56%, H3N2) of phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (eIF4E). AdEBO suppressed CYP3A activity in vivo (44%) and in vitro (26%) 24 hours after infection. CONCLUSION: As the clinical evaluation of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and other global pathogens rise, studies to evaluate the impact of new vaccines and emerging pathogens on CYP3A4 and other metabolic enzymes are warranted to avoid therapeutic failures that could further compromise the public health during infectious disease emergencies.","Jonsson-Schmunk, Kristina; Ghose, Romi; Croyle, Maria A",Expert Rev Vaccines,,397

Only emergency cases and teledermatology (TD) were allowed in outpatient settings. A standardized questionnaire was developed to compare the satisfaction level of patients and their treating physicians. Our main question was whether the patients would perceive TD as a valid alternative for direct physical face-to-face consultation. Eighty-two patients and their 4 treating dermatologists from one dermatology department participated in the study (43 females, 39 males) with a mean age of 46.6 years (SD ±23.9). The reason for TD was a chronic disease in the majority (87.8%), and mainly as a follow-up (96.3%). Regarding satisfaction, almost all categories rated around 9 on a 0-10 verbal analogue scale. The same level of global satisfaction could be seen between the patients and the physicians as well as for the quality of the patient-physician relation and whether all questions could be addressed during the TC. Physicians showed significantly higher scores than patients only for the category of ""length"" of the consultation. Gender, age, as well as distance between the clinic and home of the patient were not influencing factors for satisfaction. Regarding the technical parameters, the evaluation was mostly comparable for patients and physicians, but overall lower than the relational satisfaction parameters, especially for image quality. Patients were significantly more motivated to continue the TD after the lockdown than their treating dermatologists. We see an interest for implementing TD in specialized centers with chronic patients coming from remote places for regular follow-ups. TD cannot replace in-person patient-physician interaction, but was helpful during the lockdown. As a result, TD might become part of dermatology training to prepare for future lockdown situations.","Fluhr, Joachim W; Gueguen, Annie; Legoupil, Delphine; Brenaut, Emilie; Abasq, Claire; Araújo, Helena; Misery, Laurent",Dermatology,,397

286952,"S2 Vigorous exercise is protective against COVID-19: cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from 9,817 UK adults participating in the COVIDENCE UK study",2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus continually led to infect a large population worldwide. Currently, there is no specific viral protein-targeted therapeutics. The Nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is necessary for viral RNA replication and transcription. The C-terminal domain of N protein (CTD) involves in the self-assembly of N protein into a filament that is packaged into new virions. In this study, the CTD (PDB ID: 6WJI) was targeted for the identification of possible inhibitors of oligomerization of N protein. Herein, multiple computational approaches were employed to explore the potential mechanisms of binding and inhibitor activity of five antiviral drugs toward CTD. The five anti-N drugs studied in this work are 4E1RCat, Silmitasertib, TMCB, Sapanisertib, and Rapamycin. Among the five drugs, 4E1RCat displayed highest binding affinity (-10.95 kcal/mol), followed by rapamycin (-8.91 kcal/mol), silmitasertib (-7.89 kcal/mol), TMCB (-7.05 kcal/mol), and sapanisertib (-6.14 kcal/mol). Subsequently, stability and dynamics of the protein-drug complex were examined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Overall, drug binding increases the stability of the complex with maximum stability observed in the case of 4E1RCat. The CTD-drug complex systems behave differently in terms of the free energy landscape and showed differences in population distribution. Overall, the MD simulation parameters like RMSD, RMSF, Rg, hydrogen bonds analysis, PCA, FEL, and DCCM analysis indicated that 4E1RCat and TMCB complexes were more stable as compared to silmitasertib and sapanisertib and thus could act as effective drug compounds against CTD.

287476,Health care worker burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey study in Saudi Arabia,2021,"Background: The rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major health concern, in response to which widespread risk factor research is being carried out. Objective: To discover how physical activity and lifestyle affect the epidemic as well as the disease severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective cohort study included 203 adults infected with COVID-19 and 228 uninfected adults in three Chinese provinces, with 164 (80.7%) of the infected participants and 188 (82.5%) of the uninfected participants answering a doctor-administered telephone questionnaire on lifestyle. The binary logistic regression model and the ordinal logit model were used to observe relevance. Results: Comparing sick and non-sick patients, we found that irregular exercise (P=0.004), sedentary lifestyle (P=0.010), and overexertion (P<0.001) may be associated with the susceptibility to COVID-19. In symptomatic patients, using the recommended status as a reference, risk of severe infection increased with decreased sleep status, being 6.729 (95% CI=2.138-21.181) times higher for potentially appropriate sleep (P=0.001) and peaking at 8.612 (95% CI=1.913-38.760) times higher for lack of sleep (P=0.005). Reduction in average daily sleep time significantly increased the likely severity (P=0.002). Discussion: Through further examination of damage of external lung organs, we found that lack of sleep affected not only disease severity but also prognosis. Based on these findings, the public should prioritize a healthy lifestyle and get adequate sleep in response to the outbreak. The study of life habits may bring new ideas for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Huang, Baozhen; Niu, Yanlin; Zhao, Weiguo; Bao, Pengtao; Li, Diangeng",Nat Sci Sleep,,397
288469,Prisons need to be included in global and national vaccinations effort against COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has exacerbated income inequality, structural racism, and social isolation-issues that drive addiction and have previously manifested in the epidemic of opioid-associated overdose. The co-existence of these epidemics has necessitated care practice changes, including the use of telehealth-based encounters for the diagnosis and management of opioid use disorder (OUD). METHODS: We describe the development of the ""Addiction Telehealth Program"" (ATP), a telephone-based program to reduce treatment access barriers for people with substance use disorders staying at San Francisco's COVID-19 Isolation and Quarantine (I&Q) sites. Telehealth encounters were documented in the electronic medical record and an internal tracking system for the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) COVID-19 Containment Response. Descriptive statistics were collected on a case series of patients initiated on buprenorphine at I&Q sites and indicators of feasibility were measured. RESULTS: Between April 10 and May 25, 2020, ATP consulted on the management of opioid, alcohol, GHB, marijuana, and stimulant use for 59 I&Q site guests. Twelve patients were identified with untreated OUD and newly prescribed buprenorphine. Of these, all were marginally housed, 67% were Black, and 58% had never previously been prescribed medications for OUD. Four self-directed early discharge from I&Q-1 prior to and 3 after initiating buprenorphine. Of the remaining 8 patients, 7 reported continuing to take buprenorphine at the time of I&Q discharge and 1 discontinued. No patients started on buprenorphine sustained significant adverse effects, required emergency care, or experienced overdose. CONCLUSIONS: ATP demonstrates the feasibility of telephone-based management of OUD among a highly marginalized patient population in San Francisco and supports the implementation of similar programs in areas of the U.S. where access to addiction treatment is limited. Legal changes permitting the prescribing of buprenorphine via telehealth without the requirement of an in-person visit should persist beyond the COVID-19 public health emergency.","Mehtani, Nicky J; Ristau, Jessica T; Snyder, Hannah; Surlyn, Colleen; Eveland, Joanna; Smith-Bernardin, Shannon; Knight, Kelly R",Subst Abus,,397

289028,Health and social care professionals' experiences of providing end of life care during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the novel coronavirus emerged in late 2019, the scientific and public health community around the world have sought to better understand, surveil, treat, and prevent the disease, COVID-19. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), many countries responded aggressively and decisively with lockdown measures and border closures. Such actions may have helped prevent large outbreaks throughout much of the region, though there is substantial variation in caseloads and mortality between nations. Additionally, the health system infrastructure remains a concern throughout much of SSA, and the lockdown measures threaten to increase poverty and food insecurity for the subcontinent's poorest residents. The lack of sufficient testing, asymptomatic infections, and poor reporting practices in many countries limit our understanding of the virus's impact, creating a need for better and more accurate surveillance metrics that account for underreporting and data contamination. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to improve infectious disease surveillance by complementing standardized metrics with new and decomposable surveillance metrics of COVID-19 that overcome data limitations and contamination inherent in public health surveillance systems. In addition to prevalence of observed daily and cumulative testing, testing positivity rates, morbidity, and mortality, we derived COVID-19 transmission in terms of speed, acceleration or deceleration, change in acceleration or deceleration (jerk), and 7-day transmission rate persistence, which explains where and how rapidly COVID-19 is transmitting and quantifies shifts in the rate of acceleration or deceleration to inform policies to mitigate and prevent COVID-19 and food insecurity in SSA. METHODS: We extracted 60 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries and employed an empirical difference equation to measure daily case numbers in 47 sub-Saharan countries as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and South Africa have the most observed cases of COVID-19, and the Seychelles, Eritrea, Mauritius, Comoros, and Burundi have the fewest. In contrast, the speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence indicate rates of COVID-19 transmissions differ from observed cases. In September 2020, Cape Verde, Namibia, Eswatini, and South Africa had the highest speed of COVID-19 transmissions at 13.1, 7.1, 3.6, and 3 infections per 100,0000, respectively; Zimbabwe had an acceleration rate of transmission, while Zambia had the largest rate of deceleration this week compared to last week, referred to as a jerk. Finally, the 7-day persistence rate indicates the number of cases on September 15, 2020, which are a function of new infections from September 8, 2020, decreased in South Africa from 216.7 to 173.2 and Ethiopia from 136.7 to 106.3 per 100,000. The statistical approach was validated based on the regression results; they determined recent changes in the pattern of infection, and during the weeks of September 1-8 and September 9-15, there were substantial country differences in the evolution of the SSA pandemic. This change represents a decrease in the transmission model R value for that week and is consistent with a de-escalation in the pandemic for the sub-Saharan African continent in general. CONCLUSIONS: Standard surveillance metrics such as daily observed new COVID-19 cases or deaths are necessary but insufficient to mitigate and prevent COVID-19 transmission. Public health leaders also need to know where COVID-19 transmission rates are accelerating or decelerating, whether those rates increase or decrease over short time frames because the pandemic can quickly escalate, and how many cases today are a function of new infections 7 days ago. Even though SSA is home to some of the poorest countries in the world, development and population size are not necessarily predictive of COVID-19 transmission, meaning higher income countries like the United States can learn from African countries on how best to implement mitigation and prevention efforts.

However, the intrinsic low reversible conversion ability of lithium polysulï¬des to sulfur/Li2S during charging/discharging seriously hinder the sulfur utilization, resulting in poor cycling life of batteries. Herein we report an improvement of core-shell structured sulfur nanospheres@ultrathin Î´-MnO2 nanosheets electrode materials prepared by a simple precipitation reaction method, in which the ultrathin Î´-MnO2 nanosheets as a catalytic layer can promote the chemical adsorption of lithium polysulï¬des and their conversion rates to sulfur/Li2S. Using a combination of UV-visible adsorption spectra and ï¬rst-principles calculation, the results indicate that the Mn-O coordination center on the surface of MnO2 structure plays an efficient catalytic role in the conversion reaction of lithium polysulï¬des to insoluble S/Li2S. The sulfur nanospheres@ultrathin Î´-MnO2 nanosheets composite with a high S mass ratio of 82 wt % reveal a high speciï¬c capacity of 846 mAh g-1 at 1C rate and good cycling stability. Moreover, the areal capacity of the electrode with high sulfur loading mass of 10 mg cm-2 is 5.2 mAh cm-2 , approaching the practical application standard at a current density of 1 mA cm-2.","Li, Qing; Ma, Zhipeng; Li, Jiaojiao; Liu, Zhan; Fan, Lukai; Qin, Xiujuan; Shao, Guangjie",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,397

Non-urgent elective surgical cases have been cancelled, outpatient clinics have reduced and there has been a reduction in the number of patients presenting as an emergency. These factors will drastically affect the training opportunities of surgical trainees. The aim of this systematic review is to describe the impact of COVID-19 on surgical training globally. METHODS: The review was performed in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF). Medline, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. RESULTS: The searches identified 499 articles, 29 of which were included in the review. This contained data from more than 20 countries with 5260 trainees and 339 programme directors. Redeployment to non-surgical roles varied across studies from 6% to 35.1%. According to all of the studies, operative experience has been reduced. Knowledge learning had been switched to online platforms across 17 of the studies and 7 reported trainees had increased time to devote to educational/academic activities. All of the studies reporting on mental health report negative associations with increased stress, ranging from 54.9% to 91.6% of trainees. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 on surgical trainees has been experienced globally and across all specialities. Negative effects are not limited to operative and clinical experience, but also the mental health and wellbeing of trainees. Delivery of surgical training will need to move away from traditional models of learning to ensure trainees are competent and well supported.","Hope, C; Reilly, J-J; Griffiths, G; Lund, J; Humes, D",Tech. coloproctol,,397

Data comes from wave 7 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), carried out in 28 countries and representing over 170 million aged individuals in Europe. We start by designing two indicators in order to capture the risk of being unhealthy and economically vulnerable;next, we combine them with socio-demographic information and obtain the vulnerability profiles by means of the k-prototypes clustering algorithm. Subsequently, we design a shock similar to the COVID-19 pandemic and measure its effects on the vulnerability profiles. The results suggest that the average level of economic and health vulnerability is relatively low, although levels differ across European regions, with the most vulnerable being Eastern European countries. It was observed that the shock most affected countries with a greater proportion of individuals initially deemed vulnerable in terms of mental and physical health, as well as countries where tourism and retail sectors are the most vital for their economies. These findings led us to conclude that public policies should be differentiated by European regions, and Governments must establish action plans in order to better meet the physical and mental health needs of their citizens, as well as addressing monetary poverty and financial difficulties.","Grane, A.; Albarran, I.; Merchan, D.

It is a safe diagnostic tool with low adverse event rates. As with other endoscopic modalities, various colon capsule endoscopy scores allow the standardisation of reporting and reproducibility. As bowel cleanliness affects CCE’s diagnostic yield, a few operator-dependent scores (Leighton–Rex and CC-CLEAR scores) and a computer-dependent score (CAC score) have been developed to grade bowel cleanliness objectively. CCE can be used to monitor IBD mucosal disease activity through the UCEIS and the panenteric CECDAIic score for UC and CD, respectively. CCE may also have a role in CRC screening, given similar sensitivity and specificity rates to conventional colonoscopy to detect colonic polyps ≥ 10 mm and CRC. Given CCE’s diagnostic yield and reproducible clinical scores with high inter-observer agreements, CCE is fast becoming a suitable alternative to conventional colonoscopy in specific patient populations.","Tabone, T.; Koulaouzidis, A.; Ellul, P.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,397

However, the panicked world's population is asking when the COVID-19 will be over? This study considered machine learning approaches to predict the spread of the COVID-19 in many countries. The experimental results of the proposed model showed that the overall R2 is 0.99 from the perspective of confirmed cases. A machine learning model has been developed to predict the estimation of the spread of the COVID-19 infection in many countries and the expected period after which the virus can be stopped.

303801,Using implementation interventions and peer recovery support to improve opioid treatment outcomes in community supervision: Protocol,2021,"In March of 2020, many U.S. state governments encouraged or mandated restrictions on social interactions to slow the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that has spread to nearly 180 countries. Estimating the effectiveness of these social-distancing strategies is challenging because surveillance of COVID-19 has been limited, with tests generally being prioritized for high-risk or hospitalized cases according to temporally and regionally varying criteria. Here we show that reductions in mobility across U.S. counties with at least 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 led to reductions in fever incidences, as captured by smart thermometers, after a mean lag of 6.5 days ($90\%$ within 3--10 days) that is consistent with the incubation period of COVID-19. Furthermore, counties with larger decreases in mobility subsequently achieved greater reductions in fevers ($p<0.01$), with the notable exception of New York City and its immediate vicinity. These results indicate that social distancing has reduced the transmission of influenza like illnesses, including COVID 19, and support social distancing as an effective strategy for slowing the spread of COVID-19.","Liautaud, Parker; Huybers, Peter; Santillana, Mauricio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09911v1.pdf,397

The fight against this fatal virus demands the united force of healthcare workers, including nurse interns. Therefore, being unprepared for a crisis of this magnitude which never happened in a century, how do nurse interns perceive their quality of life being caught amidst the pandemic. Objectives: This study aimed to provide answers to the following 1) What is the demographic profile of the participants; 2) what are the responses of the participants in the Quality of Life for Nursing Internship Students Scale?; 3) What is the difference in the responses of the participants to the domains of the scale; 4) what is the relationship between each demographic profile of the participants to their responses to the domains of the scale? Methods: This study used a quantitative cross-sectional design through an electronic survey form in the collection of data. A total of 152 nurse interns in Saudi Arabia completed the survey. Results: Across the 22-item questionnaire, the nurse interns still feel safe being in the hospital, clinic, or other healthcare facilities with a mean of 3.32 while item 8, which is having abundant energy, had the lowest mean of 1.91. The overall mean is 2.61, interpreted as 'important.' Conclusion: This study found out despite being amid a pandemic, the quality of life of nurse interns is within fair and manageable boundaries. Further, it showed that their social and psychological preparedness are intact and resilient.","Rizal Angelo Grande, Rizal; Edward R Butcon, Vincent; Charito Laarni Indonto, Maria; Mendizabal Villacorte, Liza; Joseph E Berdida, Daniel",Int J Afr Nurs Sci,,397

The analyses of 30 kb RNA SARS-CoVs genome sequences, protein structures, and functions have provided us a perspective of how host-virus protein-protein complexes act to mediate virus infection. The open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b translation yields 16 non-structural (nsp1-16) and 6 accessory proteins (p6, p7a, p8ab, p9b) with multiple functional domains. Viral proteins recruit over 300 host partners forming hetero-oligomeric complexes enabling the viral RNA synthesis, packing, and virion release. Many cellular host factors and the innate immune cells through pattern-recognition receptors and intracellular RNA sensor molecules act to inhibit virus entry and intracellular replication. However, non-structural ORF proteins hijack them and suppress interferon synthesis and its antiviral effects. Pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines storm leads to dysfunctional inflammation, lung injury, and several clinical symptoms in patients. During the global pandemic, COVID-19 patients were identified with non-synonymous substitution of G614D in the spike protein, indicating virus co-evolution in host cells. We review findings that suggest that host RNA editing and DNA repair systems, while carrying on recombination, mutation, and repair of viral RNA intermediates, may facilitate virus evolution. Understanding how the host cell RNA replication process may be driven by SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome fitness will help the testing of vaccines effectiveness to multiple independent mutated coronavirus strains that will emerge.","Belizário, J.

306253,Emergency department visits for emergent conditions among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection has posed unprecedented threat to global public health. The virus-encoded non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) is a bi-functional enzyme consisting of an exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain and a methyltransferase (MTase) domain and plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Here, we report the structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-ExoN domain bound to its co-factor nsp10 and show that, compared to the SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp14-full-length complex, SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-ExoN retains an integral exoribonuclease fold and preserves an active configuration in the catalytic center. Analysis of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN interface reveals a footprint in nsp10 extensively overlapping with that observed in the nsp10/nsp16 structure. A marked difference in the co-factor when engaging nsp14 and nsp16 lies in helix-&#945;1', which is further experimentally ascertained to be involved in nsp14-binding but not in nsp16-engagement. Finally, we also show that nsp10/nsp14-ExoN is enzymatically active despite the absence of nsp14-MTase domain. These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN functions as an exoribonuclease with both structural and functional integrity.","Lin, Sheng; Chen, Hua; Chen, Zimin; Yang, Fanli; Ye, Fei; Zheng, Yue; Yang, Jing; Lin, Xi; Sun, Honglu; Wang, Lingling; Wen, Ao; Dong, Haohao; Xiao, Qingjie; Deng, Dong; Cao, Yu; Lu, Guangwen",Nucleic Acids Res,,397
306254,Emergency department visits for emergent conditions among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Objectives In December 2019, there was an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, and since then, the disease has been increasingly spread throughout the world. Unfortunately, the information about early prediction factors for disease progression is relatively limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the risk factors of developing severe disease. The objective of the study was to reveal the risk factors of developing severe disease by comparing the differences in the hemocyte count and dynamic profiles in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Methods In this retrospectively analyzed cohort, 141 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17, 2020 to February 26, 2020. Clinical characteristics and hemocyte counts of severe and non-severe COVID patients were collected. The differences in the hemocyte counts and dynamic profiles in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 were compared. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers for predicting disease progression. A concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy. Results The data showed that the white blood cell count, neutrophil count and platelet count were normal on the day of hospital admission in most COVID-19 patients (87.9%, 85.1% and 88.7%, respectively). A total of 82.8% of severe patients had lymphopenia after the onset of symptoms, and as the disease progressed, there was marked lymphopenia. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the neutrophil count (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.441, 95% CI = 1.954-10.090, p = 0.000), lymphocyte count (HR = 0.255, 95% CI = 0.097-0.669, p = 0.006) and platelet count (HR = 0.244, 95% CI = 0.111-0.537, p = 0.000) were independent risk factors for disease progression. The C-index (0.821 [95% CI, 0.746-0.896]), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve showed that the nomogram can be used to predict the disease progression in COVID-19 patients accurately. In addition, the data involving the neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and platelet count (NLP score) have something to do with improving risk stratification and management of COVID-19 patients. Conclusions We designed a clinically predictive tool which is easy to use for assessing the progression risk of COVID-19, and the NLP score could be used to facilitate patient stratification management.","Zheng, Yufen; Zhang, Ying; Chi, Hongbo; Chen, Shiyong; Peng, Minfei; Luo, Lifei; Chen, Linping; Li, Jun; Shen, Bo; Wang, Donglian",Clin Chem Lab Med,,397

In response, the authors formed a ""virtual"" case-based conference series directed at delivering spine education to health care providers around the world. We herein share the technical logistics, early participant feedback, and future direction of this initiative. METHODS: The Virtual Global Spine Conference (VGSC) was created in April 2020 by a multiinstitutional team of spinal neurosurgeons and a neuroradiologist. Biweekly virtual meetings were established wherein invited national and international spine care providers would deliver case-based presentations on spine and spine surgery-related conditions via teleconferencing. Promotion was coordinated through social media platforms such as Twitter. RESULTS: VGSC recruited more than 1000 surgeons, trainees, and other specialists, with 50-100 new registrants per week thereafter. An early survey to the participants, with 168 responders, indicated that 92% viewed the content as highly valuable to their practice and 94% would continue participating post COVID-19. Participants from the United States (29%), Middle East (16%), and Europe (12%) comprised the majority of the audience. Approximately 52% were neurosurgeons, 18% orthopedic surgeons, and 6% neuroradiologists. A majority of participants were physicians (55%) and residents/fellows (21%). CONCLUSIONS: The early success of the VGSC reflects a strong interest in spine education despite the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing guidelines. There is widespread opinion, backed by our own survey results, that many clinicians and trainees want to see ""virtual"" education continue post COVID-19.","Rasouli, Jonathan J; Shin, John H; Than, Khoi D; Gibbs, Wende N; Baum, Griffin R; Baaj, Ali A",World Neurosurg,,397

Part I explores the inherent difficulty of defining ESG, the problematic nature of quantifying and measuring ESG factors, and the tools currently being used by market-leading ratings firms and investment vehicles. In particular, this part addresses the inconsistencies of ESG self-reporting, the influence of this practice on the ensuing ratings, and the potential for investors to be misled as a result. Part II of the Note explores the possible consequences of a system of mandatory ESG disclosure, weighing the main arguments in favor and against the establishment of a regulation that mandates ESG disclosures. Drawing from a 2018 SEC submission by the law professors Cynthia A. Williams and Jill E. Fisch, Part II explores the arguments around general market efficiency, U.S. capital markets competitiveness, and the ultimate goal of giving investors access to better, more consistent, and fairly comparable information, while keeping the costs of increased reporting outweighed by the benefits of it. Part III closes by describing current proposals in favor of mandating ESG disclosures. In particular, the Note presents the proposal by Professor Fisch, under which the SEC may mandate a discussion on ESG, while allowing companies the flexibility to decide what factors to address and how to address them in view of materiality considerations for their specific industries.","El-Hage, Javier",Fordham Journal of Corporate & Financial Law,,397

Clinical data on patients co-infected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are still scarce. METHODS: This multicentre cohort study evaluated risk factors for morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in people living with HIV (PLWH), infected with SARS-CoV-2 in three countries in different clinical settings. COVID-19 was clinically classified as to be mild-to-moderate or severe. RESULTS: Of 175 patients, 49 (28%) had severe COVID-19 and 7 (4%) patients died. Almost all patients were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and in 94%, HIV RNA was below 50 copies/mL prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. In the univariate analysis, an age 50 years or older, a CD4+ T cell nadir of < 200/µl, current CD4+ T cells < 350/µl and the presence of at least one comorbidity were significantly associated with severity of COVID-19. No significant association was found for gender, ethnicity, obesity, a detectable HIV RNA, a prior AIDS-defining illness, or tenofovir (which was mainly given as alafenamide) or protease inhibitor use in the current ART. In a multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with risk for severe COVID-19 was a current CD4+ T cell count of < 350/µl (adjusted odds ratio 2.85, 95% confidence interval 1.26-6.44, p=0.01). The only factor associated with mortality was a low CD4 T cell nadir. CONCLUSIONS: In PLWH, immune deficiency is a possible risk factor for severe COVID-19, even in the setting of virological suppression. There is no evidence for a protective effect of PIs or tenofovir alafenamide.","Hoffmann, Christian; Casado, José L; Härter, Georg; Vizcarra, Pilar; Moreno, Ana; Cattaneo, Dario; Meraviglia, Paola; Spinner, Christoph D; Schabaz, Farhad; Grunwald, Stephan; Gervasoni, Cristina",HIV med,,397

Comment on ""Online Antenatal Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Opportunities and Challenges""",2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has resulted in the death of over 1 million people to date. Following government-implemented regulations, there has been concern over the apparent decline in emergency department (ED) attendances and the resultant health legacy. Therefore, we aimed to characterise the attendances to an Irish tertiary hospital ED following the implementation of these regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study investigated all attendances to the Cork University Hospital ED from 15 February to 11 April in 2020 and 2017-2019. Attendances were stratified into four periods: Before COVID (BC) (15 February to 5 March), After COVID (AC) (6 March to 12 March), Educational Closure (EC) (13 March to 27 March) and Stay Home (SH) (28 March to 11 April), as per government regulations. Triage presentations of abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, headache and trauma were examined. Data were analysed by independent t-tests and &#967;2 analysis. RESULTS: There were 8261 attendances to the ED in the 2020 time period compared with a mean of 10 389 attendances during the corresponding periods in 2017-2019. There was a significant decrease in daily attendances in 2020 compared with 2017-2019 in the AC (142 vs 188, p=0.02), EC (122 vs 184, p<0.001) and SH (121 vs 181, p<0.001) periods, including significant decreases in abdominal pain (AC: 9 vs 22, EC: 10 vs 19, SH: 11 vs 18, p<0.001), chest pain (AC: 9 vs 15, EC: 8 vs 15, SH: 9 vs 15, p<0.01), headache (AC: 5 vs 11, EC: 4 vs 9, SH: 4 vs 9, p<0.01) and trauma (AC: 3 vs 5, EC: 2 vs 6, SH: 3 vs 5, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the combination of government-imposed restrictions and perceived risk of attending an ED during a pandemic may contribute to reduced attendances. Public confidence in EDs is necessary to reduce collateral damage caused by failure to seek medical attention during a pandemic; adequate infrastructure to allow social distancing and isolation capacity in EDs is a necessity.","Sless, Ryan Taylor; Hayward, Nathaniel Edward; Ryan, Paul MacDaragh; Deasy, Conor; Dasari, Kantikiran",Emerg Med J,,397

322415,Using the Clinical Frailty Scale in Allocating Scarce Health Care Resources,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the mental health system by surprise, with the state of lockdown forcing businesses to close their doors, including many mental health services. This has driven many psychotherapists and other mental health professionals towards telepsychotherapy, relying on online consultations to provide continuity of care. However, the adoption of telepsychotherapy required major adaptations from both mental health professionals and patients. This study set out to explore the predictors of the use of online consultations and the perceived level of comfort using telepsychotherapy in a sample of 73 Lebanese mental health professionals. Data was collected via online dissemination of a survey. Results show that 82% of participants made use of online consultations in the past few days, reflecting the adaptation of Lebanese mental health professionals to the atypical newly imposed situation triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequent lockdown. Having previous experience in the use of online consultations and perceived level of telepresence were significant predictors of the level of comfort of mental health professionals in the execution online consultations. We suggest that more awareness and trainings are required around the practice of telepsychotherapy outside the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tohme, Pia; De Witte, Nele A J; Van Daele, Tom; Abi-Habib, Rudy",J Contemp Psychother,,397

Numerous studies have assessed the influence of demographic and socioeconomic factors on child immunization around the world. There are few such studies in Afghanistan, however. Therefore, this study aimed to identify factors influencing vaccination status among children age 12-23 months in Afghanistan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nationally representative data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey were used for this study. A sample of 5,708 children age 12-23 months with a vaccine card and immunization history was analyzed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify significant relationships between cofactors and vaccination status. RESULTS: In the study, 51% the subjects were boys, 48% were born at home, and 76% were residents of rural areas. Background characteristics positively associated with vaccination status included delivery in a health facility (RRR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.9-3.3), maternal age of 30-39 years (RRR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-4.1), attending at least four visits for antenatal care (RRR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.7-4.5), health facility visit in the past 12 months (RRR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4-2.5), paternal professional occupation (RRR = 4.9, 95% CI = 2.0-12.3), family with richer wealth index (RRR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.4-4.1), and living in the northeast region (RRR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-3.9)were positively associated with vaccination status. Living in the southern region (RRR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.2-0.5) was negatively associated with vaccination status. CONCLUSION: This study identified maternal age, ANC visits, place of delivery, health facility visits in past 12 months, paternal occupation, wealth quintile, and geographic region as the factors influencing child's vaccination status in Afghanistan.","Aalemi, Ahmad Khalid; Shahpar, Karimullah; Mubarak, Mohammad Yousuf",PLoS One,,397

326287,Monitoring approaches for health-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which is caused by SARS-COV2 has become a pandemic. This disease is highly infectious and potentially fatal, causing a global public health concern. To contain the spread of COVID-19, governments are adopting nationwide interventions, like lockdown, containment and quarantine, restrictions on travel, cancelling social events and extensive testing. To understand the effects of these measures on the control of the epidemic in a data-driven manner, we propose a probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) based modified SEIQR model. The transitions associated with the model is driven by data available on chronology, symptoms, pathogenesis and transmissivity of the virus. By arguing that the lattice-based model captures the features of the dynamics along with the existing fluctuations, we perform rigorous computational analyses of the model to take into account of the spatial dynamics of social distancing measures imposed on the people. Considering the probabilistic behavioural aspects associated with mitigation strategies, we study the model considering factors like population density and testing efficiency. Using the model, we focus on the variability of epidemic dynamics data for different countries and point out the reasons behind these contrasting observations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to model COVID-19 spread using PCA that gives us both spatial and temporal variations of the infection spread with the insight about the contributions of different infection parameters.","Ghosh, Sayantari; Bhattacharya, Saumik",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11270v1.pdf,397

In this work we use the SEIR model to discuss the spreading of COVID-19 pandemic for countries with the most confirmed cases up to the end of 2020, i.e. the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Brazil, and India. The simulation considers the susceptible, exposed, infective, and the recovered cases of the disease.Method: We employ the order Runge–Kutta method to solve the SIER model equations-for modelling and forecasting the spread of the new coronavirus disease. The parameters used in this work are based on the confirmed cases from the real data available for the countries reporting most cases up to December 29, 2020.Results: We extracted the coefficients of the exposed, infected, recovered and mortality rate of the SEIR model by fitting the collected real data of the new coronavirus disease up to December 29, 2020 in the countries with the most cases. We predict the dates of the peak of the infection and the basic reproduction number for the countries studied here. We foresee COVID-19 peaks in January-February 2021 in Brazil and the United Kingdom, and in February-March 2021 in France, Russia, and India, and in March-April 2021 in the United States. Also, we find that the average value of the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number is 2.1460.Conclusion: We find that the predicted peak infection of COVID-19 will happen in the first half of 2021 in the six considered countries.

Nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN recruit nsp10/nsp14 into the Cap(0)-RTC, forming the N7-CCC to yield cap(0) (7MeGpppA) at 5' end of pre-mRNA. A dimeric form of Cap(0)-RTC observed by cryo-EM suggests an in trans backtracking mechanism for nsp14 ExoN to facilitate proofreading of the RNA in concert with polymerase nsp12.

338062,Global Spread of Coronavirus: Preparing Health Care Workers,2020,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire population with the most deleterious effects in elders. Elders, especially those with diabetes, are at the highest risk of COVID-19 related adverse outcomes and mortality. This is usually linked to the comorbidities that accumulate with age, diabetes-related chronic inflammation, and the pandemic's psychosocial effects.Areas covered: We present some approaches to manage these complicated elderly patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the inpatient setting, we suggest similar (pre-pandemic) glycemic targets and emphasize the importance of using IV insulin and possible use of continuous glucose monitoring to reduce exposure and PPE utilization. Outside the hospital, we recommend optimal glycemic control within the limits imposed by considerations of safety. We also describe the advantages and challenges of using various technological platforms in clinical care.Expert opinion: The COVID-19 pandemic has lifted the veil off serious deficiencies in the infrastructures for care at both the individual level and the population level and also highlighted some of the strengths, all of which affect individuals with diabetes and COVID-19. We anticipate that things will not return to 'normal' after the COVID-19 pandemic has run its course, but rather they will be superseded by 'New Normal.'","Rajpal, Aman; Sayyed Kassem, Laure; Aron, David C",Expert Rev Endocrinol Metab,,397
339182,Virtual Care in an Outpatient Subspecialty Substance Use Disorder Treatment Program,2021,"Modeling human mobility has a wide range of applications from urban planning to simulations of disease spread. It is well known that humans spend 80% of their time indoors but modeling indoor human mobility is challenging due to three main reasons: (i) the absence of easily acquirable, reliable, low-cost indoor mobility datasets, (ii) high prediction space in modeling the frequent indoor mobility, and (iii) multi-scalar periodicity and correlations in mobility. To deal with all these challenges, we propose WiFiMod, a Transformer-based, data-driven approach that models indoor human mobility at multiple spatial scales using WiFi system logs. WiFiMod takes as input enterprise WiFi system logs to extract human mobility trajectories from smartphone digital traces. Next, for each extracted trajectory, we identify the mobility features at multiple spatial scales, macro, and micro, to design a multi-modal embedding Transformer that predicts user mobility for several hours to an entire day across multiple spatial granularities. Multi-modal embedding captures the mobility periodicity and correlations across various scales while Transformers capture long-term mobility dependencies boosting model prediction performance. This approach significantly reduces the prediction space by first predicting macro mobility, then modeling indoor scale mobility, micro-mobility, conditioned on the estimated macro mobility distribution, thereby using the topological constraint of the macro-scale. Experimental results show that WiFiMod achieves a prediction accuracy of at least 10% points higher than the current state-of-art models. Additionally, we present 3 real-world applications of WiFiMod - (i) predict high-density hot pockets for policy-making decisions for COVID19 or ILI, (ii) generate a realistic simulation of indoor mobility, (iii) design personal assistants.","Trivedi, Amee; Silverstein, Kate; Strubell, Emma; Iyyer, Mohit; Shenoy, Prashant",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09835v3.pdf,397

RESULTS: Data from 803 HCWs (50.7% male; mean age: 27.3 [SD = 6.9]; age range: 18-58 years) were included in the final analysis. The Bangla HADS was psychometrically sound, and demonstrated good internal consistency and reliability (&#945; = 0.83), and excellent construct validity. Prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression were 69.5%, and 39.5%, respectively, for less severe symptomology (at least borderline abnormal), and 41.2% and 15.7% for more severe (at least abnormal) symptomology. Regression analyses with the total HADS score as a dependent variable revealed significant (p < 0.05) associations with female gender, moderate and poor health status, infrequent physical exercising, smoking, having had regrets about one's profession because of the pandemic and associated experiences, not updating on the latest COVID-19-related research, experiencing discrimination in the workplace, and facing social problems due to working in a lab or hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of anxiety and depression are prevalent among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The findings suggest a need for screening for mental health concerns, and employing early intervention to help these individuals.","Tasnim, Rafia; Sujan, Md Safaet Hossain; Islam, Md Saiful; Ritu, Asmaul Husna; Siddique, Md Abid Bin; Toma, Tanziha Yeasmin; Nowshin, Rifat; Hasan, Abid; Hossain, Sahadat; Nahar, Shamsun; Islam, Salequl; Islam, Muhammad Sougatul; Potenza, Marc N; van Os, Jim",BMC Psychiatry,,397

However, there is no particular designed drug for COVID-19 up to this point. Thus, there exist three strategies for COVID-19 drug design;drug repurposing option, herbal medicine development, and transcriptomics-based drug lead. As the most underutilized option, transcriptomics-based drug lead could be leveraged to deal with SARS-CoV-2 infection. One of the main methods to block the SARS-CoV-2 infection is to inhibit the RNA polymerase enzyme that is responsible to the viral replication. In this regard, the objective of the strategy is to design the anti-sense siRNA drug and lead to inhibit the mRNA of the RNA Polymerase Enzyme (RdRp) gene that encodes the viral RNA Polymerase of the SARS-CoV-2. The Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD)-based method was leveraged with sequence retrieval of 24 RdRp gene sequences, multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree reconstruction, 2D/3D RNA structure predictions, and RNA-RNA docking. Both the RNAalifold conserved structure from the RdRp genes and the RNAfold structure of the siRNA for blocking the conserved structure are negative or less than 0 kcal/mol. The predicted RNA docking occurred with the best RMSD score of 22.53 �, which is beyond the accepted threshold of 10-20 �. Based on the findings, the 2D/3D structures of both the siRNA and mRNA could be elucidated, and the docking between them is feasible. However, this finding should be elucidated in the wet laboratory setting for the final lead validation.�","Parikesit, Arli Aditya; Nurdiansyah, Rizky",Berita Biologi,,397
341153,Assessment of Workplace Safety Climate among Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Low and Middle Income Countries: A Case Study of Nigeria,2021,"The present study aimed to test a model of relations to ascertain the determinants of distress caused by lockdown for COVID-19. It was hypothesized that the exposure to the COVID-19 increased distress directly and through the mediation of worry, health-related information seeking, and perception of the utility of the lockdown. It was also expected that higher levels of ambiguity intolerance corresponded to higher distress directly and through the mediation of worry, health information seeking behaviors, and perceived utility of the lockdown. Finally, it was expected that risk aversion positively influenced distress directly and through the increasing of worry, health-related information seeking behavior, and more positive perception of the utility of the lockdown The study was conducted in Italy during the mandatory lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic on 240 individuals (age range 18-76). Data recruitment was conducted via snowball sampling. COVID-19 exposure was positively associated with worry and health-related information seeking. Risk-aversion was positively associated with health-related information seeking and perceived utility of the lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. Worry and health-related information seeking were positively associated with distress, whereas the perceived utility of the lockdown was negatively associated with distress. Intolerance for the ambiguity was directly linked to distress with a positive sign. Findings suggest that risk aversion represents both a risk factor and a protective factor, based on what kind of variable mediates the relationship with distress, and that the intolerance to the ambiguity is a risk factor that busters distress.","Petrocchi, S; Iannello, P; Ongaro, G; Antonietti, A; Pravettoni, G",Curr Psychol,,397

All current members of the family Coronaviridae have arisen by a combination of incremental adaptive mutations, against the backdrop of many recombinational events throughout the past, rendering each a unique mosaic of RNA sequences from diverse sources. The consensus among virologists is that the base sequence of the novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, was derived from a common ancestor of a bat coronavirus, represented by the strain RaTG13, isolated in Yunnan province in 2013. Into that ancestral genetic background, several recombination events have since occurred from other divergent bat-derived coronaviruses, resulting in localized discordance between the two. One such event left SARS-CoV-2 with a receptor binding domain (RBD) capable of binding the human ACE-2 receptor lacking in RaTG13, and a second event uniquely added to SARS-CoV-2 a site specific for furin, capable of efficient endoproteolytic cleavage and activation of the spike glycoprotein responsible for virus entry and cell fusion. This paper demonstrates by bioinformatic analysis that such recombinational events are facilitated by short oligonucleotide ""breakpoint sequences"", similar to CAGAC, that direct recombination naturally to certain positions in the genome at the boundaries between blocks of RNA code and potentially RNA structure. This ""breakpoint sequence hypothesis"" provides a natural explanation for the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 over time and in the wild.","Gallaher, William R",Arch Virol,,397

For planning of treatment capacities, it is of major importance to obtain reliable information on infection and fatality rates of the novel coronavirus. A German community study, the so-called Heinsberg study, found a 5-fold higher infection rate (and thus a remarkably lower fatality rate) than the officially reported cases suggest. We were interested to examine the SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody status among clinic staff of a large neurological center in Northern Germany. Blood samples and questionnaires (demographic data, medical history) were collected pseudonymously. In total, 406 out of 525 (77.3%) of our employees participated in the study. The infection rate among the staff was as high as 2.7%. Including drop-outs (missing questionnaire but test result available), the infection rate was even higher (2.9%). Only 36% of the positively tested employees did suffer from flu-like symptoms in 2020. None of the nurses-having closest and longest contact to patients-were found to be positive. Despite the fact that the infection rate among clinic staff may not be directly compared to the situation in the surrounding county (due to different testing procedures), one might hypothesize that the infection rate could be more than 30-fold higher than the number of officially reported cases for the county of Hameln-Pyrmont. The high rate of IgG-positive, asymptomatic healthcare workers might help to overcome fears in daily work.","Schmidt, Simone B; Grüter, Ludwig; Boltzmann, Melanie; Rollnik, Jens D",PLoS One,,397

This study aimed to assess the impacts of the pandemic on orthodontists and orthodontic residents in Nigeria. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among consenting orthodontists and orthodontic residents. The respondents were contacted through the WhatsApp group of the Nigerian Association of Orthodontists to fill the self-administered online questionnaires (Google forms). The questionnaire had two sections: A, Sociodemographics; B, Perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to compute mean and standard deviation and chi-square for association. Level of significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: This study population comprised 98 people; however, only 73 participants responded, which represented a response rate of 74.5%. Approximately 60% (44) of the respondents thought that the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to a reduction in the number of orthodontic patients in the future, whereas almost all the respondents reported that it would affect their future practice of orthodontics. Most of the respondents (63.0%) reported that the pandemic had recorded a moderate to severe negative economic impact on them. Significant gender differences were recorded, in the social life of respondents, in addition to economic and psychosocial effects. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all respondents reported that they would change their future practice of orthodontics, particularly with respect to placing a greater emphasis on infection control.

343165,"Creating Practical Primary Care Supports for Parent-Child Relationships-Language, Literacy, and Love",2021,"RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm often disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport to preferentially translate their own transcripts and prevent host antiviral responses. The Sarbecovirus accessory protein ORF6 has previously been shown to be a major inhibitor of interferon production in both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we show SARS-CoV-2-infected cells display an elevated level of nuclear mRNA accumulation compared to mock-infected cells. We demonstrate that ORF6 is responsible for this nuclear imprisonment of host mRNA, and using a cotransfected reporter assay, we show this nuclear retention of mRNA blocks expression of newly transcribed mRNAs. ORF6's nuclear entrapment of host mRNA is associated with its ability to copurify with the mRNA export factors, Rae1 and Nup98. These protein-protein interactions map to the C terminus of ORF6 and can be abolished by a single amino acid mutation in Met58. Overexpression of Rae1 restores reporter expression in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. SARS-CoV ORF6 also interacts with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly copurifies with Rae1 and Nup98 and results in significantly reduced expression of reporter proteins compared to SARS-CoV ORF6, a potential mechanism for the delayed symptom onset and presymptomatic transmission uniquely associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also show that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 block nuclear import of a broad range of host proteins. Together, these data support a model in which ORF6 clogs the nuclear pore through its interactions with Rae1 and Nup98 to prevent both nuclear import and export, rendering host cells incapable of responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an RNA virus with a large genome that encodes multiple accessory proteins. While these accessory proteins are not required for growth in vitro, they can contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells accumulate poly(A) mRNA in the nucleus, which is attributed to the accessory protein ORF6. Nuclear entrapment of mRNA and reduced expression of newly transcribed reporter proteins are associated with ORF6's interactions with the mRNA export proteins Rae1 and Nup98. SARS-CoV ORF6 also shows the same interactions with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly represses reporter expression and copurifies with Rae1 and Nup98 compared to SARS-CoV ORF6. Both SARS-CoV ORF6 and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 block nuclear import of a wide range of host factors through interactions with Rae1 and Nup98. Together, our results suggest ORF6's disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport prevents infected cells from responding to the invading virus.","Addetia, Amin; Lieberman, Nicole A P; Phung, Quynh; Hsiang, Tien-Ying; Xie, Hong; Roychoudhury, Pavitra; Shrestha, Lasata; Loprieno, Michelle A; Huang, Meei-Li; Gale, Michael; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L",mBio (Online),,397

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an online experiment with 371 participants who viewed a COVID-19 screening session between a hotline agent (chatbot or human) and a user with mild or severe symptoms. RESULTS: The primary factor driving user response to screening hotlines (human or chatbot) is perceptions of the agent's ability. When ability is the same, users view chatbots no differently or more positively than human agents. The primary factor driving perceptions of ability is the user's trust in the hotline provider, with a slight negative bias against chatbots' ability. Asian individuals perceived higher ability and benevolence than did White individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring that COVID-19 screening chatbots provide high-quality service is critical but not sufficient for widespread adoption.

When the donning process has moisture introduced, however, complications can arise, which consumes vital time. Most commonly, gloves undergo a chlorination treatment to reduce glove tack, allowing easier donning. To assess the effects of different chlorination strengths and glove thicknesses on donning, acrylonitrile butadiene gloves were manufactured at two different thicknesses (0.05 and 0.10 mm) with 4 different chlorination treatments: 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm. Six participants were used to assess the time taken to don each of the glove sets with dry and wet hands (16 tests in total). Overall, the thicker gloves took longer to don, due to differences in the material stiffness hindering the donning process. The quickest performance from the chlorinated gloves was noted in the 1000 and 2000 ppm concentrations. Wet conditions also showed significant increases in the donning time.Practitioners Summary: The study was conducted based on the gaps identified in previous literature reviews which revealed the requirement for a greater understanding of glove donning process.

Small islands are known to face a number of challenges but in the quest to curb the viral spread, with the absence of land boarders and small population size, these factors should have played to their advantage to minimize the spread. The aim of this article was to compare and contrast the COVID-19 situation, restrictions, preparedness, management and the healthcare systems between the small population island states of Cyprus, Iceland and Malta. METHOD: Data were obtained from Ministry of Health websites and COVID dashboards of the three respective Island states in Europe. Comparisons were made between the reported cases, deaths, swabbing rates, restrictions and mitigation measures and healthcare system structures. RESULTS: Malta contained the COVID-19 spread better than Cyprus and Iceland during the first wave. However, a significantly higher viral spread was observed in Malta during the second wave. Similar healthcare preparedness and services, restrictions and relaxation measures were implemented across the three islands with some exceptions such as the maximum number of people permitted in one gathering, free movement restrictions and airport regulations. CONCLUSION: The small population size and island status proved to be an asset during the first wave of COVID-19 but different governance approaches led to a different COVID-19 outcome during the transition phases and the onset of the second wave.","Cuschieri, Sarah; Pallari, Elena; Hatziyianni, Amalia; Sigurvinsdottir, Rannveig; Sigfusdottir, Inga Dora; Sigurðardóttir, Árún Kristín",Early Hum Dev,,397

The effects of this lockdown on the psychological and mental health of both the affected and unaffected Chinese are largely unknown currently. We utilized one of the largest crowdsourced databases (Sleep as Android) that consisted of 15,681 sleep records from 563 users in China to estimate the change in the sleep pattern of Chinese users during the span of 30 December 2019 to 8 March 2020 with reference to 64,378 sleep records of 1,628 users for the same calendar period of years 2011-2019. The sleep pattern in China changed drastically after 23 January 2020 when the law of quarantine and suspension of Wuhan became effective. The two major findings are: (1) Chinese people increased their sleep duration by an average of 20 min and delayed their sleep onset by an average of 30 min at weekdays, while they maintained a similar sleep duration at weekends, and (2) larger changes were found in several subgroups, including those in Wuhan (80 sleep records from 3 users), female subjects, and those aged &#8804; 24 years.

A group of 19 energy experts cast scores on a scale of 1 to 10 using 12 quality criteria, based around the pillars of sustainability (society, environment and economy), with the aim of quantifying each criterion for each technology. The total mean score is employed as a holistic measure of system quality. The top three technologies to emerge in rank order are nuclear, combined cycle gas and hydroelectric. The bottom three are solar PV, biomass and tidal lagoon. All seven new renewable technologies fared badly, perceived to be expensive, unreliable, and not as environmentally friendly as is often assumed. We validate our approach by 1) comparing scores for pairs of criteria where we expect a correlation to exist; 2) comparing our qualitative scores with quantitative data; and; 3) comparing our qualitative scores with NEEDS project baseline costs. In many cases, R2>0.8 suggests that the structured hierarchy of our approach has led to scores that may be used in a semi-quantitative way.

356559,"COVID-19: Notes From the Front Line, Singapore's Primary Health Care Perspective",2020,"There is an urgent need for an accurate antibody test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have developed 3 ELISA methods, trimer spike IgA, trimer spike IgG, and nucleocapsid IgG, for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We evaluated their performance along with four commercial ELISAs, EDI&#8482; Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG and IgA, and one lateral flow assay, DPP® COVID-19 IgM/IgG System (Chembio). Both sensitivity and specificity were evaluated and the probable causes of false-positive reactions were determined. The assays were evaluated using 300 pre-epidemic samples and 100 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples. The sensitivities and specificities of the assays were as follows: 90%/100% (in-house trimer spike IgA), 90%/99.3% (in-house trimer spike IgG), 89%/98.3% (in-house nucleocapsid IgG), 73.7%/100% (EDI nucleocapsid IgM), 84.5%/95.1% (EDI nucleocapsid IgG), 95%/93.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgA), 82.8%/99.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgG), 82.0%/91.7% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgM), 92%/93.3% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgG). The presumed causes of false positive results from pre-epidemic samples in commercial and in-house assays were mixed. In some cases, assays lacked reproducibility. In other cases, reactivity was abrogated by competitive inhibition (spiking the sample with the same antigen that was used for coating ELISAs prior to performing the assay), suggesting positive reaction could be attributed to the presence of antibodies against these antigens. In other cases, reactivity was consistently detected but not abrogated by the spiking, suggesting positive reaction was not attributed to the presence of antibodies against these antigens. Overall, there was wide variability in assay performance using our samples, with in-house tests exhibiting the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. The causes of ""false positivity"" in pre-epidemic samples may be due to plasma antibodies apparently reacting with the corresponding antigen, or spurious reactivity may be directed against non-specific components in the assay system. Identification of these targets will be essential to improving assay performance.","Rikhtegaran Tehrani, Zahra; Saadat, Saman; Saleh, Ebtehal; Ouyang, Xin; Constantine, Niel; DeVico, Anthony L; Harris, Anthony D; Lewis, George K; Kottilil, Shyam; Sajadi, Mohammad M",PLoS One,,397

361185,A cross-sectional survey of COVID-19 preparedness in governmental hospitals of North-West Ethiopia,2021,"People with HIV (PWH) might have a higher risk of adverse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. Several scores were developed to predict COVID-19 progression to critical disease and are often used among PWH. We assessed the performance of two commonly used risk equations among PWH and COVID-19. Participants were identified from a multicenter cohort of 6,361 PWH on regular follow-up at 2 university hospitals. Of 99 HIV-infected individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 63 had complete data and were included in this analysis. CALL and COVID-GRAM scores were calculated and participants were stratified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups for each. Discrimination was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Calibration was evaluated using observed versus expected (O:E) ratios and the Hosmer-Lemeshow &#967;2 goodness-of-fit statistic. Scores were adjusted by increasing one category level in individuals with nadir CD4 lymphocyte count <200/µL. Participants had a median nadir and current CD4 counts of 207 [interquartile range (IQR) 119-345] and 440 (IQR 280-719) cells/µL. Ten (15.9%) individuals progressed to critical disease and 4 (6.3%) died. Assessed scores showed acceptable discrimination (area under the curve 0.701-0.771) and were overall calibrated (O:E ratio 1.01). However, both overestimated the risk of progression among individuals in the low- and high-risk categories, whereas they underestimated the risk in the intermediate category (O:E 1.20-1.21). Thus, 50% of critically ill individuals were not identified as high risk. Assigning PWH with low nadir CD4 counts a higher risk of progression reduced the proportion of individuals not identified to 20%. COVID-19 risk scores had lower performance in PWH compared with that described in the general population and failed to adequately identify individuals who progressed to critical disease. Adjustment for nadir CD4 partially improved their accuracy. Risk equations incorporating HIV-related factors are needed.","Vizcarra, Pilar; Cabello, Alfonso; Moreno, Ana; Vivancos, María J; López-Botet, Javier; Zamarro, Belén; Górgolas, Miguel; Casado, José L",AIDS res. hum. retroviruses,,397

A Large Cross-Sectional Survey,2020,"There is a rapidly evolving need for e-health to support chronic disease self-management and connect patients with their healthcare teams. Patients with cirrhosis have a high symptom burden, significant comorbidities, and a range of psychological and cognitive issues. Patients with cirrhosis were assessed for their readiness and interest in e-health. Adults attending one of two outpatient cirrhosis clinics in Alberta were recruited. Eligible participants were not required to own or have experience with digital technologies or the Internet. Medical history, socioeconomic status, and attitudes regarding e-health, the Computer Proficiency Questionnaire, and the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire were used to describe participants' knowledge and skills. Of the 117 recruited patients, 68.4% owned a computer and 84.6% owned a mobile device. Patients had mean proficiency scores of 72.8% (SD 25.9%) and 69.3% (SD 26.4%) for these devices, respectively. In multiple regression analyses, significant predictors of device proficiency were age, education, and household income. Most patients (78.7%) were confident they could participate in videoconferencing after training and most (61.5%) were interested in an online personalized health management program. This diverse group of patients with cirrhosis had technology ownership, proficiency, and online behaviours similar to the general population. Moreover, the patients were very receptive to e-health if training was provided. This promising data is timely given the unique demands of COVID-19 and its influence on self-management and healthcare delivery to a vulnerable population.","Ismond, Kathleen P; Eslamparast, Tannaz; Farhat, Kamal; Stickland, Michael; Spence, John C; Bailey, Robert J; Abraldes, Juan G; Spiers, Jude A; Tandon, Puneeta",J Med Syst,,397

However, there is no evidence for the expression of nAChRs in synaptic vesicles, which deliver neurotransmitter to synaptic cleft. The aim of this paper was to investigate the presence of nAChRs in synaptic vesicles purified from the rat brain and to study their possible involvement in vesicles life cycle. According to dynamic light scattering analysis, the antibody against extracellular domain (1-208) of &#945;7 nAChR subunit inhibited synaptic vesicles clustering. Sandwich ELISA with nAChR subunit-specific antibodies demonstrated the presence of &#945;4ß2, &#945;7 and &#945;7ß2nAChR subtypes in synaptic vesicles and showed that &#945;7 and ß2 nAChR subunits are co-localized with synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). Pre-incubation with either &#945;7-selective agonist PNU282987 or nicotine did not affect synaptic vesicles clustering but delayed their Ca2+-dependent fusion with the plasma membranes. In contrast, nicotine but not PNU282987 stimulated acidification of isolated synaptic vesicles, indicating that &#945;4ß2 but not &#945;7-containing nAChRs are involved in regulation of proton influx and neurotransmitter refilling. Treatment of rats with levetiracetam, a specific modulator of SV2A, increased the content of &#945;7 nAChRs in synaptic vesicles accompanied by increased clustering but decreased Ca2+-dependent fusion. These data for the first time demonstrate the presence of nAChRs in synaptic vesicles and suggest an active involvement of cholinergic regulation in neurotransmitter release. Synaptic vesicles may be an additional target of nicotine inhaled upon smoking and of &#945;7-specific drugs widely discussed as anti-inflammatory and pro-cognitive tools.","Trikash, Irene; Kasatkina, Ludmila; Lykhmus, Olena; Skok, Maryna",Neurochem Int,,397

But people admitted to the hospital for non-COVID reasons are tested at very high rates, even though they do not appear to be at elevated risk of infection. This sub-population may provide valuable evidence on prevalence in the general population. We estimate upper and lower bounds on the prevalence of the virus in the general population and the population of non-COVID hospital patients under weak assumptions on who gets tested, using Indiana data on hospital inpatient records linked to SARS-CoV-2 virological tests. The non-COVID hospital population is tested fifty times as often as the general population. By mid-June, we estimate that prevalence was between 0.01 and 4.1 percent in the general population and between 0.6 to 2.6 percent in the non-COVID hospital population. We provide and test conditions under which this non-COVID hospitalization bound is valid for the general population. The combination of clinical testing data and hospital records may contain much more information about the state of the epidemic than has been previously appreciated. The bounds we calculate for Indiana could be constructed at relatively low cost in many other states.","Sacks, Daniel W.; Menachemi, Nir; Embi, Peter; Wing, Coady",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00298v1.pdf,397

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 268 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors and 162 COVID-19 inpatients (total 430 subjects, confirmed by RT-PCR) and 2,212 healthy volunteer first-time blood donors as a control group. These were further divided into two groups: those with anti-A (blood types O and B) and those without it (types A and AB). Titres of nucleoproteins, and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibody were measured in the convalescent plasma donors and inpatients. Multivariate logistic regression and non-parametric tests were applied. RESULTS: Persons having types O or B showed less infection prevalence than those of types A or AB (OR = 0·62, 95% CI 0·50-0·78; P < 0·001), but there was no difference when COVID-19 inpatients were analysed.

However, several studies document that this distinction is too simple. The aim of the present study is to give an overview of counting methods in the bibliometric literature and to provide insight into their properties and use. A mix of methods is used. In the preliminary results, a literature review covering 1970-2018 identified 29 original counting methods. Seventeen were introduced in the period 2010-2018. Twenty-one of the 29 counting methods are rank-dependent and fractionalized meaning that the authors of a publications share 1 credit but do not receive equal shares, for example harmonic counting. The internal and external validation of the counting methods are assessed. Three criteria for well-constructed bibliometric indicators - adequacy, sensitivity, and homogeneity - are used to assess the internal validity. Regarding the external validation of the counting methods, it is investigated whether the intentions in the studies that introduced the 29 counting methods comply with the subsequent use of the counting methods. This study has the potential to give a solid foundation for the use of and discussion about counting methods.","Gauffriau, Marianne",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10786v1.pdf,397

However, no study to date has examined such climatic extensions for the growth or otherwise of the novel coronavirus in Africa. Africa, with a mostly relatively warmer temperature differs from other regions of the world and in addition, has recorded far fewer cases compared to Asian, Europeans and the Americans (North and South). It then becomes imperative to examine the influence of meteorological indices in the growth or otherwise of coronavirus diseases in Africa to establish whether findings on the climatic conditions-COVID-19 growth are regionally specific. In this study, we examined the influence of meteorological factors for aiding or abating the spread of the aerosolised pathogen of COVID-19 in Africa. We rely on the generalised additive model (GAM) and found wind speed to positively relate to COVID-19 growth while mean temperature and relative humidity to inversely relates to COVID-19 growth curve in Africa.

This cross-sectional and retrospective cohort study induced 203 patients who completed a questionnaire regarding stress levels and lifestyles. Data regarding stress levels, sleep time, exercise, and total diet, snack, and prepared food intake were obtained from the questionnaires. The changes in the body weight or HbA1c levels were determined by comparing the values at the time the questionnaire was administered to those noted 3 months ago. Increased levels of stress and decreased exercise levels were reported in approximately 40% and >50%. During the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a negative correlation between stress and exercise (r = -0.285, p < 0.001) and a positive correlation between stress and prepared food intake (r = 0.193, p = 0.009). Decreased exercise levels (r = -0.33, p < 0.001) and increased snack consumption (r = 0.24, p = 0.002) were associated with increased body weight. Furthermore, increased total diet intake (r = 0.16, p = 0.031) was associated with increased HbA1c levels. These relationships remained significant for patients aged <65 years and patients who did not engage in regular exercise. Many patients experienced stress and lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and these changes were associated with increased body weight and HbA1c levels.","Munekawa, Chihiro; Hosomi, Yukako; Hashimoto, Yoshitaka; Okamura, Takuro; Takahashi, Fuyuko; Kawano, Rena; Nakajima, Hanako; Osaka, Takafumi; Okada, Hiroshi; Majima, Saori; Senmaru, Takafumi; Nakanishi, Naoko; Ushigome, Emi; Hamaguchi, Masahide; Yamazaki, Masahiro; Fukui, Michiaki",Endocr. j,,397

In this paper, we explore how governments can fulfill an important need as suppliers of liquidity. Building on the financing advantage view of state ownership, we theorize how state-owned enterprises (SOEs) may provide capital by offering trade credit to customer firms. The data indicate a positive relation between the level of state ownership and the provision of trade credit. Using an institution-focused framework, we further determine that the nation's institutional environment systematically affects the opportunities and motivations for SOEs to grant trade credit. Specifically, we find that SOEs grant more trade credit in countries with less developed financial markets, weaker legal protection of creditors, less comprehensive information-sharing mechanisms, more collectivist societies, left-wing governments, and higher levels of unemployment. Firm-level factors also influence the credit-granting decisions of SOEs, with SOEs with lower levels of state ownership and higher extents of internationalization offering lower amounts of trade credit. Overall, our study offers novel insights regarding the important role of state-owned firms as providers of liquidity.","Chen, Ruiyuan; El Ghoul, Sadok; Guedhami, Omrane; Kwok, Chuck C Y; Nash, Robert",J Int Bus Stud,,397

In this paper, we develop a novel knowledge distillation and model interpretation framework for medical image classification that jointly solves the above two issues. Specifically, to address the data-hungry issue, we propose to learn a small student model with less data by distilling knowledge only from a cumbersome pretrained teacher model. To interpret the teacher model as well as assisting the learning of the student, an explainer module is introduced to highlight the regions of an input medical image that are important for the predictions of the teacher model. Furthermore, the joint framework is trained by a principled way derived from the information-theoretic perspective. Our framework performance is demonstrated by the comprehensive experiments on the knowledge distillation and model interpretation tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods on a fundus disease dataset.","Nguyen-Duc, Thanh; Zhao, He; Cai, Jianfei; Phung, Dinh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02593v1.pdf,397

Here we studied the effect of pheromones in a different context as we investigated their capacity to induce persistent modulations of associative learning and memory. We used honey bees, Apis mellifera, and combined olfactory conditioning and pheromone preexposure with disruption of neural activity and two-photon imaging of olfactory brain circuits, to characterize the effect of pheromones on olfactory learning and memory. Geraniol, an attractive pheromone component, and 2-heptanone, an aversive pheromone, improved and impaired, respectively, olfactory learning and memory via a durable modulation of appetitive motivation, which left odor processing unaffected. Consistently, interfering with aminergic circuits mediating appetitive motivation rescued or diminished the cognitive effects induced by pheromone components. We thus show that these chemical messengers act as important modulators of motivational processes and influence thereby animal cognition.","Baracchi, David; Cabirol, Amélie; Devaud, Jean-Marc; Haase, Albrecht; d039,; Ettorre, Patrizia; Giurfa, Martin",Commun Biol,,397

Immunocompromised patients, including IBD, were presumed to have higher risk. AIMS: We hypothesized patients with IBD would have higher-than-baseline anxiety, high perceived vulnerability and significant lifestyle impacts as a result of the pandemic. We sought to assess the impact of these changes on disease and management. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and IBD-unspecified was conducted. Patients were invited to participate by email in an IRB-approved brief, voluntary survey. Survey questions focused on disease characteristics, healthcare access and self-reported psychological well-being. RESULTS: Responses from 492 (CD = 337, UC = 141,IC = 14) patients were included in the analysis. The majority of patients with IBD had increased anxiety since the pandemic, which correlated with an increase in GI symptoms. This risk of symptoms was mitigated by communication with their provider. Many patients had lifestyle changes including requesting time off work due to perceived vulnerability and changes in eating habits. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support an increase in illness-associated anxiety and perceived vulnerability among patients with IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Open communication with providers is important to maintain adequate control of disease and reduce symptoms of flares triggered by ongoing stress.","Stone, Molly L; Feng, Minjun; Forster, Erin M",Dig. dis. sci,,397

382518,National trauma and substance use disorders: A slippery slope in Lebanon,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the social unrest pervading U.S. cities in response to the killings of George Floyd and other Black citizens at the hands of police are historically significant. These events exemplify dismaying truths about race and equality in the United States. Racial health disparities are an inexcusable lesion on the U.S. health care system. Many health disparities involve medications, including antidepressants, anticoagulants, diabetes medications, drugs for dementia, and statins, to name a few. Managed care pharmacy has a role in perpetuating racial disparities in medication use. For example, pharmacy benefit designs are increasingly shifting costs of expensive medications to patients, creating affordability crises for lower income workers, who are disproportionally persons of color. In addition, the quest to maximize rebates serves to inflate list prices paid by the uninsured, among which Black and Hispanic people are overrepresented. While medication cost is a foremost barrier for many patients, other factors also propagate racial disparities in medication use. Even when cost sharing is minimal or zero, medication adherence rates have been documented to be lower among Blacks as compared with Whites. Deeper understandings are needed about how racial disparities in medication use are influenced by factors such as culture, provider bias, and patient trust in medical advice. Managed care pharmacy can address racial disparities in medication use in several ways. First, it should be acknowledged that racial disparities in medication use are pervasive and must be resolved urgently. We must not believe that entrenched health system, societal, and political structures are impermeable to change. Second, the voices of community members and their advocates must be amplified. Coverage policies, program designs, and quality initiatives should be developed in consultation with those directly affected by racial disparities. Third, the industry should commit to dramatically reducing patient cost sharing for essential medication therapies. Federal and state efforts to limit annual out-of-pocket pharmacy spending should be supported, even though increased premiums may be an undesirable (yet more equitable) consequence. Finally, information about race should be incorporated into all internal and external reporting and quality improvement activities.

Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was carried out through an online survey directed at medical staff in several cities in Colombia. The percentage of physicians who have a positive perception to be vaccinated and the associated factors that determine that decision were determined. A binomial regression analysis adjusted for age and sex was carried out, taking as a dependent variable the acceptance of free vaccination with an effectiveness of 60 and 80%. The most significant factors were determined in the non-acceptance of vaccination. Results: Between 77.0% and 90.7% of physicians in Colombia accept COVID-19 vaccination, according to the scenario evaluated where the vaccine's effectiveness was 60 or 80%, respectively. Medical specialty, having never paid for a vaccine, recommending the administration of the vaccine to their parents or people over 70 years, and dispensing the vaccine to their children, were the factors to consider to be vaccinated for free with an effectiveness of 60% and 80%. Conclusions: There is a high perception of the intention to vaccinate physicians in Colombia against COVID-19, and this is very similar to that of the general population.","Alvarado-Socarras, Jorge L; Vesga-Varela, Andrea Liliana; Quintero-Lesmes, Doris Cristina; Fama-Pereira, Marcela M; Serrano-Diaz, Norma C; Vasco, Mauricio; Carballo-Zarate, Virgil; Zambrano, Lysien I; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",,,397
387817,Examining the effects of modified recreational activities on the mental health of nursing home residents during COVID-19,2021,"Respiratory symptoms can be a caused by different underlying conditions, and are often caused by viral infections, such as Influenza-like illnesses or other emerging viruses like the Coronavirus. These respiratory viruses, often, have common symptoms, including coughing, high temperature, congested nose, and difficulty breathing. However, early diagnosis of the type of the virus, can be crucial, especially in cases such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. One of the factors that contributed to the spread of the pandemic, was the late diagnosis or confusing it with regular flu-like symptoms. Science has proved that one of the possible differentiators of the underlying causes of these different respiratory diseases is coughing, which comes in different types and forms. Therefore, a reliable lab-free tool for early and more accurate diagnosis that can differentiate between different respiratory diseases is very much needed. This paper proposes an end-to-end portable system that can record data from patients with symptom, including coughs (voluntary or involuntary) and translate them into health data for diagnosis, and with the aid of machine learning, classify them into different respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. With the ongoing efforts to stop the spread of the COVID-19 disease everywhere today, and against similar diseases in the future, our proposed low cost and user-friendly solution can play an important part in the early diagnosis.","Belkacem, Abdelkader Nasreddine; Ouhbi, Sofia; Lakas, Abderrahmane; Benkhelifa, Elhadj; Chen, Chao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15469v1.pdf,397

390315,"Understanding varying COVID-19 mortality rates reported in Africa compared to Europe, Americas and Asia",2021,"PROBLEM: The COVID-19 pandemic restricted in-person gatherings, including residency conferences. The pressure to quickly reorganize educational conferences and convert content to a remote format overwhelmed many programs. This article describes the pilot event of a large-scale, interactive virtual educational conference model designed and implemented by Academic Life in Emergency Medicine (ALiEM), called ALiEM Connect. APPROACH: The pilot ALiEM Connect event was conceptualized and implemented within a 2-week period in March 2020. The pilot was livestreamed via a combination of Zoom and YouTube and was archived by YouTube. Slack was used as a backchannel to allow interaction with other participants and engagement with the speakers (via moderators who posed questions from the backchannel to the speakers live during the videoconference). OUTCOMES: The RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework was used for program evaluation, showing that 64 U.S. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited emergency medicine residency programs participated in the pilot event, with 1,178 unique users during the event (reach). For effectiveness, 93% (139/149) of trainees reported the pilot as enjoyable and 85% (126/149) reported it was equivalent to or better than their usual academic proceedings. Adoption for ALiEM Connect was fairly good with 64/237 (27%) of invited residency programs registering and participating in the pilot event. Implementation was demonstrated by nearly half of the livestream viewers (47%, 553/1,178) interacting in the backchannel discussion, sending a total of 4,128 messages in the first 4 hours. NEXT STEPS: The final component of the RE-AIM framework, maintenance, will take more time to evaluate. Further study is required to measure the educational impact of events like the ALiEM Connect pilot. The ALiEM Connect model could potentially be used to replace educational conferences that have been cancelled or to implement and/or augment a large-scale, shared curriculum among residency programs in the future.","Rose, Christian C; Haas, Mary Rose Calderone; Yilmaz, Yusuf; Alvarez, Al039; ai,; Mott, Sarah E; Landry, Adaira I; Gisondi, Michael A; Ankel, Felix; Lin, Michelle; Chan, Teresa M",Acad. med,,397

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, infects cells following recognition and attachment of the viral spike glycoprotein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 transmembrane protein, followed by spike protein cleavage and activation by cell surface transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). In prostate cancer cells, androgen acting on the androgen receptor increases TMPRSS2 expression, which has led to the hypothesis that androgen-dependent expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung may increase men's susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and that, accordingly, suppressing androgen production or action may mitigate COVID-19 severity by reducing SARS-CoV-2 amplification. Several ongoing clinical trials are testing the ability of androgen deprivation therapies or anti-androgens to mitigate COVID-19. This perspective discusses clinical and molecular advances on the rapidly evolving field of androgen receptor (AR) action on cell surface transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) expression and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and the potential effect of anti-androgens on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity in male patients.

METHODS: Patients in group A (aged < 65 years with homologous recombination deficiency, HRD, score &#8805; 42, or those at any age with germline BRCA mutation, gBRCAm) were randomized to 4 cycles of paclitaxel plus carboplatin (group A1) or eribulin plus carboplatin (group A2), followed by 4 cycles of anthracycline. Patients in group B (aged < 65 years with HRD score < 42, or aged &#8805; 65 years without gBRCAm) were randomized to 6 cycles of eribulin plus cyclophosphamide (group B1) or eribulin plus capecitabine (group B2); non-responders to the first 4 cycles of the eribulin-based therapy received anthracycline. Primary endpoint was pCR rate (ypT0-is, ypN0; centrally confirmed). Main secondary endpoint was safety. RESULTS: The full analysis set comprised 99 patients. The pCR rate was 65% (90% CI, 46%-81%) and 45% (27%-65%) in groups A1 and A2, respectively, and 19% (8%-35%) in both groups B1 and B2. No major difference was seen in secondary endpoints, but peripheral neuropathy incidence was 74% in group A1, whereas it was 32%, 22%, and 26% in groups A2, B1, and B2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients aged < 65 years with high HRD score or gBRCAm, weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin and eribulin plus carboplatin followed by anthracycline resulted in a pCR rate of > 60% and > 40%, respectively, suggesting potential usefulness of patient stratification using HRD; pCR tended to be low in patients with HRD-negative tumors.

All lesions were histopathologically confirmed as Bowen disease. Lesions were classified by anatomical site and treatment modality and their dimensions were measured. Punch biopsy was reperformed when a treated lesion was considered to have possibly recurred. Recurrence rates were then compared. Preoperative and intraoperative photos and follow-up images were also taken.The most common site of Bowen disease was the head and neck region. Wide excision was found to provide good outcomes with minimal tumor recurrence. Recurrence after cryotherapy occurred relatively quickly (mean 0.2 years, median 0.2 years) while recurrence after wide excision occurred at a mean 2.5 years. Treatment modality was significantly associated with recurrence (Pâ<â.05).The optimal treatment for Bowen disease has not been determined.

397055,Addressing racial & socioeconomic disparities in access to medications for opioid use disorder amid COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Bedside teaching (BST), a time-honoured tradition of clinical teaching which integrates theoretical knowledge and clinical practice, has declined steeply over the last decade. Moreover, many clinician teachers today are not specifically trained in and/or comfortable in delivering effective BST. Resucitating this valuable educational format may require a new approach to preparing teachers and setting the stage for effective BST. Framing BST as an entrustable professional activity (EPA) for teachers may be one strategy to enhance its application and quality. METHODS: We aimed to redefine, describe essential features and effective practices for high-quality BST, based on clinical teacher participant perspectives through a focus group discussion and open-ended questionnaires via e-mail, supplemented by insights from literature. RESULTS: Based on data collected, we generated a definition of BST and a list of suggested strategies to optimise BST, for example, preparation, safe learning environment, flexible teaching and patient's benefits. A structured EPA description was created based on this definition. CONCLUSION: Effective BST requires skilled clinical teachers who are comfortable and confident in this mode of teaching; framing BST as a teaching EPA could guide faculty development and clinical teacher certification.","van Dam, Marjel; Ramani, Subha; Ten Cate, Olle",Clin. teach,,397

Mandates such as distancing and variations to treatment services were implemented to slow transmission of the virus, but created new challenges for persons with Substance Use Disorder (SUD). To better understand this phenomenon, we surveyed healthcare professionals on how they believe COVID-19 has impacted persons with SUD and what needs to occur to effectively treat this vulnerable population. Methods: Attending physicians, residents, nurses, medical and nursing students, and other healthcare professionals were asked to respond to three open-ended questions related to the impact of COVID-19 on persons with SUD. Two independent coders reviewed the comments utilizing constant comparative analysis to develop themes. Results: Common themes of concern were found from the respective participants (n = 205) including: lack of access to treatment, feelings of isolation, negative impacts on mental health, and the possibility of relapse. Healthcare strategies to effectively treat and help persons with SUD included increasing access to treatment including telehealth, development of peer support groups, availability of mental health resources, development of enhanced communication channels between providers and patients, and systematic changes. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, overdose deaths have dramatically increased. As the short-term and long-term effects of the pandemic become more apparent, swift and comprehensive responses and policies must be enacted. This study provides insight from healthcare providers on the effects of the pandemic for persons with SUD. Many preexisting issues remain unresolved (e.g. stigma and healthcare disparities), and now the pandemic has presented new obstacles as noted by the providers. The findings from this study provide implications for important discussion regarding the development of strategies for substance use treatment and harm reduction.","Shreffler, Jacob; Shreffler, Megan; Murfree, Jessica R; Huecker, Martin",Subst Use Misuse,,397

STUDY DESIGN: Simulation series with fluorescent 3-dimensional (3D) printed sinonasal models and deidentified cadaveric heads. SETTINGS: Dedicated surgical laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cadaveric specimens irrigated with fluorescent tracer and fluorescent 3D-printed models were drilled. A cascade impactor was used to collect aerosols and small droplets of various aerodynamic diameters under 15 µm. Large droplet generation was measured by evaluating the field for fluorescent debris. Aerosol plumes through the nares were generated via nebulizer, and mitigation measures, including suction and SPIWay devices, nasal sheaths, were evaluated regarding reduction of aerosol escape from the nose. RESULTS: The drilling of cadaveric specimens without flexible suction generated aerosols &#8804;3.30 µm, and drilling of 3D sinonasal models consistently produced aerosols &#8804;14.1 µm. Mitigation with SPIWay or diameter-restricted SPIWay produced same results. There was minimal field contamination in the cadaveric models, 0% to 2.77% field tarp area, regardless of drill burr type or drilling location; cutting burr drilling without suction in the 3D model yielded the worst contamination field (36.1%), followed by coarse diamond drilling without suction (19.4%). The simple placement of a flexible suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx led to complete elimination of all aerosols &#8804;14.1 µm, as evaluated by a cascade impactor positioned immediately at the nares. CONCLUSION: Given the findings regarding aerosol risk reduction, we strongly recommend that physicians use a suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx during endonasal surgery in the COVID-19 era.","Dharmarajan, Harish; Freiser, Monika E; Sim, Edward; Boorgu, Devi Sai Sri Kavya; Corcoran, Timothy E; Wang, Eric W; Gardner, Paul A; Snyderman, Carl H",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,397

Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we have demonstrated the allosteric crosstalk within the RBD in the apo- and the ACE2 receptor-bound states, revealing the contribution of the dynamics-based correlated motions and the electrostatic energy perturbations to this crosstalk. While allostery, based on correlated motions, dominates inherent distal communication in the apo-RBD, the electrostatic energy perturbations determine favorable pairwise crosstalk within the RBD residues upon binding to ACE2. Interestingly, the allosteric path is composed of residues which are evolutionarily conserved within closely related coronaviruses, pointing toward the biological relevance of the communication and its potential as a target for drug development.","Bhattacharjee, Sayan; Bhattacharyya, Rajanya; Sengupta, Jayati",FEBS Lett,,397

Predictors were ranked using variable importance metrics. Models were assessed by C-indices, Brier scores and calibration plots in the test set. SETTING: Optum de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset including over 700 hospitals and 7000 clinics in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: 17 086 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 between 20 February 2020 and 5 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All-cause mortality while hospitalised. RESULTS: The full model that included information on demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, and vital signs had good discrimination (C-index=0.87) and was well calibrated, with some overpredictions for the most at-risk patients. Results were similar on the training and test sets, suggesting that there was little overfitting. Age was the most important risk factor. The performance of models that included all demographics and comorbidities (C-index=0.79) was only slightly better than a model that only included age (C-index=0.76). Across the study period, predicted mortality was 1.3% for patients aged 18 years old, 8.9% for 55 years old and 28.7% for 85 years old. Predicted mortality across all ages declined over the study period from 22.4% by March to 14.0% by May. CONCLUSION: Age was the most important predictor of all-cause mortality, although vital signs and laboratory results added considerable prognostic information, with oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, lactate dehydrogenase and white cell count being among the most important predictors. Demographic and comorbidity factors did not improve model performance appreciably. The full model had good discrimination and was reasonably well calibrated, suggesting that it may be useful for assessment of prognosis.","Incerti, Devin; Rizzo, Shemra; Li, Xiao; Lindsay, Lisa; Yau, Vincent; Keebler, Dan; Chia, Jenny; Tsai, Larry",BMJ Open,,397
410560,Mitigating lockdown challenges in response to COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa,2020,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) poses massive economic losses in the global poultry industry. Here, we firstly report the construction and immunogenicity comparison of virus-like particles (VLPs) carrying the S, M and E proteins (SME-VLPs); VLPs carrying the S and M proteins (SM-VLPs); and VLPs carrying the M and E proteins (ME-VLPs) from the dominant serotype representative strain GX-YL5 in China. The neutralizing antibody response induced by the SME-VLPs was similar to that induced by the inactivated oil vaccine (OEV) of GX-YL5, and higher than those induced by the SM-VLPs, ME-VLPs and commercial live vaccine H120. More importantly, the SME-VLPs elicited higher percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes than the SM-VLPs, ME-VLPs and OEV of GX-YL5. Compared with the OEV of GX-YL5, higher levels of IL-4 and IFN-Î³ were also induced by the SME-VLPs. Moreover, the mucosal immune response (sIgA) induced by the SME-VLPs in the tear and oral swabs was comparable to that induced by the H120 vaccine and higher than that induced by the OEV of GX-YL5. In the challenge experiment, the SME-VLPs resulted in significantly lower viral RNA levels in the trachea and higher protection scores than the OEV of GX-YL5 and H120 vaccines, and induced comparable viral RNA levels in the kidneys, and tear and oral swabs to the OEV of GX-YL5. In summary, among the three VLPs, the SME-VLPs carrying the S, M and E proteins of IBV could stimulate the strongest humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses and provide effective protection, indicating that it would be an attractive vaccine candidate for IB.","Zhang, Yu; Yuan, Yuan; Zhang, Li-Hua; Zhu, Dan; Wang, Lu; Wei, Lan-Ping; Fan, Wen-Sheng; Zhao, Chang-Run; Su, Yan-Jing; Liao, Jian-Qi; Yong, Lu; Wei, Tian-Chao; Wei, Ping; Mo, Mei-Lan",,,397

We first broadly search and investigate ~2,000 news publishers, from which 61 are identified with extreme [high or low] levels of credibility. By inheriting the credibility of the media on which they were published, a total of 2,029 news articles on coronavirus, published from January to May 2020, are collected in the repository, along with 140,820 tweets that reveal how these news articles are spread on the social network. The repository provides multimodal information of news articles on coronavirus, including textual, visual, temporal, and network information. The way that news credibility is obtained allows a trade-off between dataset scalability and label accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to present data statistics and distributions, as well as to provide baseline performances for predicting news credibility so that future methods can be directly compared.

415246,Attitudes and approaches to patient and public involvement across Europe: A systematic review,2020,"The current global COVID-19 pandemic has almost marked its one year of existence and influenced everyone either at an individual or community level. There are plenty of clinical recommendations and guidelines for the practitioners, and beyond doubt, the treating clinicians and other healthcare providers who have been in the frontline of this battle might have been significantly affected as a direct consequence of this pandemic. However, most of the clinical recommendations and guidelines are pivoted on intense research, and thus it is entirely reasonable to foretell that if dental research is impacted, the care-providers and consequently the patients will inevitably be affected. The present paper attempts to narratively summarize the potential disruptions on dental research due to the pandemic and endeavours to forewarn the dental researchers and scientific communities about the impact of COVID-19 on ongoing and ensuing dental research in the coming years. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected laboratory and clinical research globally and will probably change the course of individuals and organizations engaged in dental research for some time. Tailor-made contingency plans by the individuals and organizations and sustaining the momentum of dental research by maintaining the flexibility in administration and utilization of research grants, extensions of grants and funding deadlines, adaption of study designs and procedures, pause or delay enrolment of participants, innovation in research collaborations and scholarly communications across different fields are some of the suggested measures that can be utilized to minimize the disruption during this pandemic.","Sardana, Divesh; Yiu, Cynthia K Y; McGrath, Colman P",J Dent,,397

Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and hospitalized at Toyama University Hospital were included in the analysis. Nasopharyngeal viral load was measured when symptom-based criteria for discharge or end of isolation in the accommodations were met, and examined the relationship between viral load and days after onset or age. From the perspective of virus isolation limit, the amount of infectious viral load was defined at 50 copies/µL by nasopharyngeal sample. Thirty-three patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis, after excluding critical and fatal cases. Mean nasopharyngeal viral load at discharge or end of isolation was 1.90 log-copies/µL, and 64% of patients were discharged with over 50 copies/µL. No correlation was apparent between age and viral load at discharge, and viral load remained relatively high at discharge or end of isolation in all age groups. Although attempts at infectious virus isolation are necessary, infection control precautions even after discharge or discontinued isolation in accommodations may be needed, as the date of onset mostly depended on self-reporting by patients.","Fukui, Yasutaka; Kawasuji, Hitoshi; Taekgoshi, Yusuke; Kaneda, Makito; Murai, Yushi; Kimoto, Kou; Ueno, Akitoshi; Miyajima, Yuki; Kawago, Koyomi; Sakamaki, Ippei; Morinaga, Yoshitomo; Yamamoto, Yoshihiro",J Infect Chemother,,397

The virus rapidly spread, and the World Health Organization declared a pandemic by March 2020. With millions of confirmed cases world-wide, there is growing concern and considerable debate regarding the potential for coronavirus infection to contribute to an appreciable burden of chronic respiratory symptoms or fibrotic disease among recovered individuals. As the first case of Covid-19 was documented less than one year ago, data regarding long-term clinical outcomes are not yet available and predictions for long-term outcome are speculative at best. However, due to the staggering number of cases and the severity of disease in many individuals, there is a critical need to consider the potential long-term implications of Covid-19. This review examines current basic and clinical data regarding fibrogenic mechanisms of viral injury in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Several intersecting mechanisms between coronavirus infection and fibrotic pathways are discussed to highlight factors and processes that may be targetable to improve patient outcome. Reports of post-infection sequelae from previous coronavirus outbreaks are presented toward the goal of improved recognition of potential contributing risk factors for fibrotic disease.","McDonald, Lindsay T","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",,397

METHODS: We compared 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year medical students' online surgery clerkship assessment scores to the traditional written examinations. The percent of correct scores using online open-book examination was compared to the results of the traditional closed-book examination in the previous three rotations. Additional correlation between grade point average(GPA) and examination performance were reviewed. RESULTS: Compared with the traditional groups, medical students who took the online, open-book examination had a significantly higher mean score in both MCQ(85.21 vs. 77.36, 72.43, 83.00, p&lt;0.001) and essay examinations (187.36 vs. 158.77, 152.17, 152.29, p&lt;0.001), but a significantly lower mean score in short answer examination (60.09 vs. 66.79, 67.73, 64.82, p&lt;0.001).

Compared with the risk neutrals, the risk exaggerators with high preventive behaviors were more likely to obtain COVID-19 information from multiple sources, whereas the risk deniers with moderate preventive behaviors and risk deniers with low preventive behaviors were less likely to obtain COVID-19 information compared with the risk neutrals. Governments and health professions should take the variety of risk perception and adopted preventive behaviors into consideration when disseminating information on COVID-19 to the general public.","Wang, Peng-Wei; Chen, Yi-Lung; Chang, Yu-Ping; Wu, Chia-Fen; Lu, Wei-Hsin; Yen, Cheng-Fang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,397

While polymerase chain reaction-based assays are used for diagnosis, there is a need for high-throughput, rapid serologic methods. A Luminex binding assay was developed and used to assess simultaneously the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-specific antibodies in human serum and plasma. Clear differentiation was achieved between specimens from infected and uninfected subjects, and a wide range of serum/plasma antibody levels was delineated in infected subjects. All 25 specimens from 18 patients with COVID-19 were positive in the assays with both the trimeric spike and the receptor-binding domain proteins. None of the 13 specimens from uninfected subjects displayed antibodies to either antigen. There was a highly statistically significant difference between the antibody levels of COVID-19-infected and -uninfected specimens (Pâ <â .0001). This high-throughput antibody assay is accurate, requires only 2.5 hours, and uses 5 ng of antigen per test.","Weiss, Svenja; Klingler, Jéromine; Hioe, Catarina; Amanat, Fatima; Baine, Ian; Arinsburg, Suzanne; Kojic, Erna Milunka; Stoever, Jonathan; Liu, Sean T H; Jurczyszak, Denise; Bermudez-Gonzalez, Maria; Simon, Viviana; Krammer, Florian; Zolla-Pazner, Susan",J Infect Dis,,397

These include supportive techniques that may be particularly important at a time of rising anxiety, loneliness, helplessness, and depression. The present paper provides detailed guidelines for therapists on how supportive techniques developed in traditional face-to-face treatment can be effectively used in telepsychotherapy to resolve alliance ruptures. To this end, we used the conceptual framework of the core conflictual relationship theme (CCRT) formulation, making adjustments for identifying and resolving ruptures in the therapeutic alliance in telepsychotherapy. We demonstrated the proposed techniques for identifying and repairing ruptures with a case study of a patient participating in an ongoing RCT, whose treatment shifted in mid-therapy to telepsychotherapy because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The techniques presented and illustrated in this article may be used in the transition to remote therapy for a range of reasons, including patient or therapist relocation and more.","Dolev-Amit, Tohar; Leibovich, Liat; Zilcha-Mano, Sigal",Couns.

Bacterial resistance pattern was evaluated in 50 patients. A spectrophotometer device equipped with UV and electrophoresis of the extracted samples on agarose gel for antibiogram test were used. PCR test 15 minutes after tooth extraction showed that bacterial strains were extracted from 16 patients. Lactobacillus, Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis), Streptococcus salivarius (S. salivarius), and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) were extracted from 5, 4, 4, 4, and 6 patients. 100% of Lactobacillus, E. faecalis, S. sanguinis, S. salivarius, and S. mutans were sensitive to tigecycline. Most of the Lactobacillus antibiotic resistance was against tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. Antibiotic resistance in S. salivarius was observed in 75% of the cases against piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, and cefotaxime, while in S. mutans was 84% of the cases against ceftriaxone. The results of the current study showed that tooth extraction causes bacteremia before, during, and after tooth extraction. Generally, the highest antibiotic resistance occurred against tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and ampicillin-sulbactam. In most cases, the bacteria showed partial resistance to these antibiotics; however, tigecycline showed 100% efficacy on all types of bacteria. Streptococcus strains (salivarius, mutans, and sanguinis) were sensitive to most of the antibiotics while antibiotic sensitivity was less evident in Lactobacillus and E. faecalis. Antibiotic resistance has become a critical issue, since it leads to treatment failure when there is a need for antibiotic therapy.","Rezazadeh, Fahimeh; Azad, Azita; Khorami, Ali; Modaresi, Farzan; Rezaie, Zahra",Biomed Res Int,,397

434464,The experience of Australian general practice patients at high risk of poor health outcomes with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study,2021,"Many studies have shown that re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in recovered COVID-19 patients are very common. We aim to conduct this review to summarize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients and discuss the potential explanations for recurrences, the contagiousness of re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the management of COVID-19 patients after discharge from hospital. The proportion of re-positive tests in discharged COVID-19 patients varied from 2.4 to 69.2% and persisted from 1 to 38 days after discharge, depending on population size, age of patients, and type of specimens. Currently, several causes of re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 patients are suggested, including false-negative, false-positive RT-PCR tests; reactivation; and re-infection with SARS-CoV-2, but the mechanism leading to these re-positive cases is still unclear. The prevention of re-positive testing in discharged patients is a fundamental measure to control the spread of the pandemic. In order to reduce the percentage of false-negative tests prior to discharge, we recommend performing more than two tests, according to the standard sampling and microbiological assay protocol. In addition, specimens should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA before discharge. Further studies should be conducted to develop novel assays that target a crucial region of the RNA genome in order to improve its sensitivity and specificity.","Dao, Thi Loi; Hoang, Van Thuan; Gautret, Philippe",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,,397

437111,"Achieving Safe, Effective, and Compassionate Quarantine or Isolation of Older Adults With Dementia in Nursing Homes",2020,"BACKGROUND: CKD induces loss of muscle proteins partly by suppressing muscle protein synthesis. Muscles of mice with CKD have increased expression of nucleolar protein 66 (NO66), as do muscle biopsy specimens from patients with CKD or those undergoing hemodialysis. Inflammation stimulates NO66 expression and changes in NF-&#954;B mediate the response. METHODS: Subtotal nephrectomy created a mouse model of CKD with BUN >80 mg/dl. Crossing NO66flox/flox with MCK-Cre mice bred muscle-specific NO66 (MCK-NO66) knockout mice. Experiments assessed the effect of removing NO66. RESULTS: Muscle-specific NO66 knockout in mice blocks CKD-induced loss of muscle mass and improves protein synthesis. NO66 suppression of ribosomal biogenesis via demethylase activity is the mechanism behind these responses. In muscle cells, expression of NO66, but not of demethylase-dead mutant NO66, decreased H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and suppressed pre-rRNA expression. Knocking out NO66 increased the enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 on ribosomal DNA. In primary muscle cells and in muscles of mice without NO66, ribosomal RNA, pre-rRNA, and protein synthesis all increased. CONCLUSIONS: CKD suppresses muscle protein synthesis via epigenetic mechanisms that NO66 mediates. Blocking NO66 could suggest strategies that counter CKD-induced abnormal muscle protein catabolism.","Zhang, Liping; Chen, Qin; Chen, Zihong; Wang, Ying; Gamboa, Jorge L; Ikizler, Talat Alp; Garibotto, Giacomo; Mitch, William E",J.

National figures from the UK suggest that 8.75% of over 170,000 caesarean sections are performed under general anaesthetic. We explored whether general anaesthesia rates for caesarean section changed during the peak of the pandemic across six maternity units in the north-west of England. We analysed anaesthetic information for 2480 caesarean sections across six maternity units from 1 April to 1 July 2020 (during the pandemic) and compared this information with data from 2555 caesarean sections performed at the same hospitals over a similar period in 2019. Primary outcome was change in general anaesthesia rate for caesarean section. Secondary outcomes included overall caesarean section rates, obstetric indications for caesarean section and regional to general anaesthesia conversion rates. A significant reduction (7.7 to 3.7%, p < 0.0001) in general anaesthetic rates, risk ratio (95%CI) 0.50 (0.39-0.93), was noted across hospitals during the pandemic. Regional to general anaesthesia conversion rates reduced (1.7 to 0.8%, p = 0.012), risk ratio (95%CI) 0.50 (0.29-0.86). Obstetric indications for caesarean sections did not change (p = 0.17) while the overall caesarean section rate increased (28.3 to 29.7%), risk ratio (95%CI) 1.02 (1.00-1.04), p = 0.052. Our analysis shows that general anaesthesia rates for caesarean section declined during the peak of the pandemic. Anaesthetic decision-making, recommendations from anaesthetic guidelines and presence of an on-site anaesthetic consultant in the delivery suite seem to be the key factors that influenced this decline.","Bhatia, K; Columb, M; Bewlay, A; Eccles, J; Hulgur, M; Jayan, N; Lie, J; Verma, D; Parikh, R",Anaesthesia (Lond.),,397

439695,Integrating Telemedicine for Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder in Rural Primary Care: Beyond the COVID Pandemic,2020,"Urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the most prevalent infectious diseases and the most common cause of nosocomial infections, worldwide. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) are responsible for approximately 80% of all UTI, which most commonly affect the bladder. UPEC colonise the urinary tract by ascension of the urethra, followed by cell invasion, and proliferation inside and outside urothelial cells, thereby causing symptomatic infections and quiescent intracellular reservoirs that may lead to recurrence. Sugars or glycans are key molecules for host-pathogen interactions, and UTI are no exception. Surface glycans regulate many of the events associated with UPEC adhesion and infection, as well as induction of the host immune response. Whilst the bacterial protein FimH binds mannose-containing host glycoproteins to initiate infection and UPEC-secreted polysaccharides block immune mechanisms to favour intracellular replication, host glycans on the urothelial surface and on secreted glycoproteins prevent or limit infection by inhibiting UPEC adhesion. Given the importance of glycans during UTI, here we review the glycobiology of UPEC infection to highlight fundamental sugar-mediated processes of immunological interest for their potential clinical applications. Interdisciplinary approaches incorporating glycomics and infection biology may help to develop novel non-antibiotic based therapeutic strategies for bacterial infections as the spread of antimicrobial resistant uropathogens is currently threatening modern health care systems.","Lupo, Federico; Ingersoll, Molly A; Pineda, Miguel",Immunology,,397

The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers. METHODS: A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, India, from September to October 2020. Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Ivermectin prophylaxis was taken by 76 controls and 41 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (AOR 0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month. Those involved in physical activity (AOR 3.06 95% CI, 1.18-7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection. Type of household, COVID duty, single-dose ivermectin prophylaxis, vitamin-C prophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

It is notable that a substantial proportion of COVID-19 severe patients coexist diabetic conditions, indicating the progression and outcome of COVID-19 may relate to diabetes. However, it is still unclear that whether the diabetic treatment principles can be used for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a computational approach to screened all commonly used clinical oral hypoglycemic drugs to identify the potential inhibitors for the main protease (Mpro ) of SARS-CoV-2, which is one of the key drug targets for anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. RESULTS: Six antidiabetic drugs with docking scores higher than 8.0 (cutoff value), including repaglinide, canagliflozin, glipizide, gliquidone, glimepiride, and linagliptin, were predicted as the promising inhibitors of Mpro . Interestingly, repaglinide, one of the six antidiabetic drugs employed the highest docking score for Mpro , was similar to a previously predicted active molecule-nelfinavir, which is a potential anti-HIV and anti-COVID-19 drug. Moreover, we found repaglinide shared similar docking pose and pharmacophores with reported ligand (N3 inhibitor) and nelfinavir, demonstrating that repaglinide would interact with Mpro in a similar way. CONCLUSION: These results indicated an extra effect on anti-COVID-19 may offer by above 6 antidiabetic drugs, while further researches are necessary to confirm these findings.

Therefore, the research model extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with the task technology fit model, awareness and self-efficacy to determine user intention to adopt wireless sensor network application for medical assistance. A research survey was conducted towards Saudi citizens in voluntary setting. In response, 348 valid responses were retrieved. Sample size was computed with prior-power analysis using G-power software. The research model is empirically tested with latest statistical approach namely structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings of the structural model indicate that wireless sensor network application was jointly predicted by performance expectancy, social influence, effort expectancy, facilitating condition, task technology fit, awareness and self-efficacy and explained substantial variance R2 79.5% in individual behavior to adopt wireless sensor network application. The effect size analysis (f2) revealed that task technology fit and facilitating condition were the most important factors to determine user intention to adopt wireless sensor network application. The current study contributes to theory by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with task technology fit model, self-efficacy and awareness and enrich information system literature in the context of user intention to adopt wireless sensor network application. Practically, this study suggest that health consultant should focus on technology fitness including wireless devices and the number of facilities to operate wireless sensor network which in turn boost user confidence towards adoption of wireless sensor network application for health consultation. This study develops a unique research model that inspects user behavior towards adoption of wireless sensor network technology for better health care system. The findings of this study answer how to monitor COVID-19 while using of wireless sensor network applications. Moreover, this study is useful for clinical management through virtual environment and guides health advisors, software developers and physicians to design user friendly telemedicine application by using wireless sensor network technology.","Yamin, Mohammad Ali Yousef; Alyoubi, Bader A",J Infect Public Health,,397

In the following period, this infection spread all over the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the existence of a pandemic. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate skin diseases associated with COVID-19 under three main headings: Skin problems related to personal protective equipment and personal hygiene measures, skin findings observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and finally skin findings due to COVID- 19 treatment agents. Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itch, pressure urticaria, exacerbation of pre-existing skin diseases and new skin lesion occurence / new skin disease occurence may be due to personal protective equipment. Skin problems related to personal hygiene measures could cause itch, dryness and contact dermatitis. Skin findings could also be observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The incidence of skin lesions because of COVID-19 was reported between 0.2% and 29%. Many skin lesions such as maculopapular, urticarial, vesicular, chilblain- like, thrombotic / ischemic etc. could be observed in COVID-19. Some authors state that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection specific skin finding is absent. But, especially in asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic COVID-19 patients, skin lesions can lead to the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition skin lesions could occur due to COVID-19 treatment agents. As a result, many skin lesions could appear because of COVID-19. Even if there were no COVID-19 diagnosis, skin findings should be evaluated carrefully in this pandemic period.

The study was based on the Q-sort methodology. Among other conclusions, our research reveals that the best performance we elicited pertained to the technical role, followed by the managerial role and the support received through informal channels. Worryingly, the worst performance pertained to promoting life skills. This finding is especially alarming considering both the UNESCO humanistic vision of universities as promoters of university community development and wellbeing and SDG 4.7 of Agenda 2030, which states that education should ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development through education on sustainable development and lifestyles.

Objective: Our aim is to describe and analyze the Swedish approach in combating the pandemic. Methods: We present and discuss data collated from various sources - published scientific studies, pre-print material, agency reports, media communication, public surveys, etc. - with specific focus on the approach itself, Covid-19 trends, healthcare system response, policy and measures overview, and implications. Results: The main intervention to manage the curve has been the general recommendations to adhere to good hand hygiene, beware of physical distance to others, to refrain from large gatherings and restrain from non-essential travel. Persons with suspected Covid-19 infection were recommended to stay at home and avoid social contacts. Additionally, visits to the elderly care homes and meetings with more than 50 people were forbidden. As a result, the healthcare system in the country has so far, never been overwhelmed. However, the relatively high mortality among the elderly, together with the vulnerability of some migrants, points out the drawbacks. Conclusions: Many countries have both marvelled and criticized the Swedish strategy that is formed in a close partnership between the government and the society based on a mutual trust giving the responsibility to individuals. It already highlights how much can be achieved with voluntary measures (recommendations) - something that was noticed and proposed as a future model by the World Health Organization.","Kavaliunas, Andrius; Ocaya, Pauline; Mumper, Jim; Lindfeldt, Isis; Kyhlstedt, Mattias",,,397

463424,Primary Care Is Dead. Long Live Primary Care,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which has affected over 100 countries in a short while, progresses more mortally in elderly patients with comorbidities. In this study, we examined the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the patients aged 60 and over who had been infected with COVID-19. METHODS: The data of the patients admitted to the hospital within 1 month from May 8, 2020 onwards and hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia were obtained from the hospital medical records, and the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters of the patients during the admission to the emergency department were examined. Patients were divided into 2 groups regarding the criteria of having in-hospital mortality (mortality group) and being discharged with full recovery (survivor group). The factors, which could have an impact on the mortality, were investigated using a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 113 patients aged 60 years and older, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The mean age of the patients was 70.7 ± 7.9, and 64.6% (n = 73) of them were male. The mortality rate was 19.4% (n = 22). Among the comorbid illnesses, only renal failure was significant in the mortality group (p = 0.04). A CURB-65score &#8805;3 or pneumonia severity index (PSI) class &#8805;4 manifested a remarkable discrimination ability to predict 30-day mortality (p < 0.001). When the laboratory parameters were considered, the value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significant in predicting mortality in univariate and multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.03-1.21; p = 0.006, and OR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11-2.39; p = 0.044, respectively). CONCLUSION: In our study, NLR was determined to be an independent marker to predict in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19. PSI and CURB-65 revealed a considerably precise prognostic accuracy for the patients with COVID-19 in our study as well. Moreover, thanks to that NLR results in a very short time, it can enable the clinician to predict mortality before the scoring systems are calculated and hasten the management of the patients in the chaotic environment of the emergency room.","Genc Yavuz, Burcu; Colak, Sahin; Guven, Ramazan; Altundag, Ibrahim; Seyhan, Avni Uygar; Gunay Inanc, Rumeysa",Gerontology,,397

While $R_0$ is widely known to scientists, policymakers, and the general public, it has received comparatively little attention in the controls community. This note provides two novel characterizations of $R_0$: a stability characterization and a geometric program characterization. The geometric program characterization allows us to write $R_0$-constrained and budget-constrained optimal resource allocation problems as geometric programs, which are easily transformed into convex optimization problems. We apply these programs to a case study of allocating vaccines and antidotes, finding that targeting $R_0$ instead of the spectral abscissa of the Jacobian matrix (a common target in the controls literature) leads to qualitatively different solutions.","Smith, Kevin D.; Bullo, Francesco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07643v1.pdf,397

Here, we generated a dual-color pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 virus using a human immunodeficiency virus-1 pseudovirus production system and the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, of which the membrane was labeled with a lipophilic dye (DiO) and the genomic RNA-related viral protein R (Vpr) of the viral core was fused with mCherry. With this dual-color labeling strategy, not only the movement of the whole virus but also the fate of the labeled components can be traced. The pseudovirions were applied to track the viral entry at a single-particle level in four types of the human respiratory cells: nasal epithelial cells (HNEpC), pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC), bronchial epithelial cells (BEP-2D), and oral epithelial cells (HOEC). Pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 entered into the host cell and released the viral core into the cytoplasm, which clearly indicates that the host entry mainly occurred through endocytosis. The infection efficiency was found to be correlated with the expression of the known receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting 2 (ACE2) on the host cell surface. We believe that the dual-color fluorescently labeled pseudovirus system created in this study can be applied as a useful tool for many purposes in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.","Ma, Yingxin; Mao, Guobin; Wu, Guoqiang; Chen, Minghai; Qin, Fujun; Zheng, Luping; Zhang, Xian-En",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,397

Since its origin in China in December 2019, there is compelling evidence that novel SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible virus, and it is associated to a broad clinical spectrum going from subclinical presentation to severe respiratory distress and multiorgan failure. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a cellular receptor that allows it to infect different host cells and likely disrupts renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system homeostasis. Particularly, a considerable incidence of many renal abnormalities associated to COVID-19 has been reported, including proteinuria, hematuria, and acute kidney injury. Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect podocytes and tubular epithelial cells, which could contribute to the development of the aforementioned renal abnormalities. In this review, we discuss the biological aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, how understanding current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection may partly explain the involvement of the kidneys in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and what questions have arisen and remain to be explored.","Martinez-Rojas, Miguel Angel; Vega-Vega, Olynka; Bobadilla, Norma A",Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,,397
467035,48 hours public response to Corona epidemic status in Indonesia. Perceived risk and panic buying,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patient age is one of the most salient clinical indicators of risk from COVID-19. Age-specific distributions of known SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related deaths are available for many regions. Less attention has been given to the age distributions of serious medical interventions administered to COVID-19 patients, which could reveal sources of potential pressure on the healthcare system should SARS-CoV-2 prevalence increase, and could inform mass vaccination strategies. The aim of this study is to quantify the relationship between COVID-19 patient age and serious outcomes of the disease, beyond fatalities alone. METHODS: We analysed 277,555 known SARS-CoV-2 infection records for Ontario, Canada, from 23 January 2020 to 16 February 2021 and estimated the age distributions of hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, intubations, and ventilations. We quantified the probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection, and of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization. RESULTS: The distribution of hospitalizations peaks with a wide plateau covering ages 60-90, whereas deaths are concentrated in ages 80+. The estimated probability of hospitalization given known infection reaches a maximum of 27.8% at age 80 (95% CI 26.0%-29.7%). The probability of survival given hospitalization is nearly 100% for adults younger than 40, but declines substantially after this age; for example, a hospitalized 54-year-old patient has a 91.7% chance of surviving COVID-19 (95% CI 88.3%-94.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a significant need for hospitalization in middle-aged individuals and young seniors. This need is not captured by the distribution of deaths, which is heavily concentrated in very old ages. The probability of survival given hospitalization for COVID-19 is lower than is generally perceived for patients over 40. If acute care capacity is exceeded due to an increase in COVID-19 prevalence, the distribution of deaths could expand toward younger ages. These results suggest that vaccine programs should aim to prevent infection not only in old seniors, but also in young seniors and middle-aged individuals, to protect them from serious illness and to limit stress on the healthcare system.","Papst, Irena; Li, Michael; Champredon, David; Bolker, Benjamin M; Dushoff, Jonathan; D Earn, David J",BMC Public Health,,397

SARS-CoV-2 has been found in cardiac tissue, and myocardial dysfunction post-COVID-19 may occur. However, the association between SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and cardiovascular biomarkers remains unknown. Methods and Results COVID MECH was a prospective, observational study enrolling consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms of COVID-19. Biobank plasma samples used to measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA and cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers were collected in 123 patients at baseline, and in 96 (78%) at day 3. Patients were aged 60±15 years, 71 (58%) male, 68 (55%) Caucasian and 31 (25%) received mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in plasma from 48 (39%) patients at baseline. Patients with viremia were more frequently male, had more diabetes mellitus and lower oxygen saturation. Patients with viremia had higher concentrations of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and ferritin (all <0.001), but comparable levels of cardiac troponin T (cTnT; p=0.09), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; p=0.27) and D-dimer (p=0.67) to patients without viremia. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in plasma at either baseline or day 3 in 50 (52%) patients, and these patients experienced increase from baseline to day 3 in NT-proBNP and D-dimer concentrations, while there was no change in cTnT. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 viremia was associated with increased concentrations of inflammatory, but not cardiovascular biomarkers. NT-proBNP and D-dimer, but not cTnT, increased from baseline to day 3 in patients with viremia.","Myhre, Peder L; Prebensen, Christian; Monceyron Jonassen, Christine; Erik Berdal, Jan; Omland, Torbjørn",J Am Heart Assoc,,397

Methods: Data of reported COVID-19 cases and Baidu Migration Index of 21 cities in Guangdong province and other provinces of China as of February 25, 2020 were collected. The imported risk index of each city in Guangdong province were calculated, and then correlation analysis was performed between reported cases and the imported risk index to identify lag time. Finally, we classified the early warming levels of epidemic by imported risk index. Results: A total of 1 347 confirmed cases were reported in Guangdong province, and 90.0% of the cases were clustered in the Pearl River Delta region. The average daily imported risk index of Guangdong was 44.03. Among the imported risk sources of each city, the highest risk of almost all cities came from Hubei province, except for Zhanjiang from Hainan province. In addition, the neighboring provinces of Guangdong province also had a greater impact. The correlation between the imported risk index with a lag of 4 days and the daily reported cases was the strongest (correlation coefficient: 0.73). The early warning base on cumulative 4-day risk of each city showed that Dongguan, Shenzhen, Zhongshan, Guangzhou, Foshan and Huizhou have high imported risks in the next 4 days, with imported risk indexes of 38.85, 21.59, 11.67, 11.25, 6.19 and 5.92, and the highest risk still comes from Hubei province.

474050,Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care workers,2020,"BACKGROUND Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to be a pandemic infection, important severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) non-structural proteins (nsp) have been analysed as promising targets in virtual screening approaches. Among these proteins, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), also named main protease, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), have been identified as fundamental targets due to its importance in the viral replication stages. OBJECTIVES To investigate, in silico, two of the most abundant flavonoid glycosides from Dysphania ambrosioides; a medicinal plant found in many regions of the world, along with some of the putative derivatives of these flavonoid glycosides in the human organism as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp. METHODS Using a molecular docking approach, the interactions and the binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp were predicted for quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (nicotiflorin) and some of their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. FINDINGS Docking analysis, based on the crystal structure of 3CLpro and RdRp, indicated rutin, nicotiflorin, and their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives as potential inhibitors for both proteins. Also, the importance of the hydrogen bond and &#960;-based interactions was evidenced for the presumed active sites. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Overall, these results suggest that both flavonoid glycosides and their putative human metabolites can play a key role as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp. Obviously, further researches, mainly in vitro and in vivo experiments, are necessary to certify the docking results reported here, as well as the adequate application of these substances. Furthermore, it is necessary to investigate the risks of D. ambrosioides as a phytomedicine for use against COVID-19.","da Silva, Felipe Moura A; da Silva, Katia Pacheco A; de Oliveira, Luiz Paulo M; Costa, Emmanoel V; Koolen, Hector HF; Pinheiro, Maria Lúcia B; de Souza, Antonia Queiroz L; de Souza, Afonso Duarte L",Mem.

Like other health behaviors, COVID-19 related behaviors may be related to risk representations. Risk representations are the cognitive responses a person holds about illness risk such as, identity (i.e., label/characteristics of risk), cause (i.e., factors causing condition), timeline (i.e., onset/duration of risk), consequences (i.e., intrapersonal/interpersonal outcomes), behavioral efficacy (i.e., if and how the condition can be controlled/treated), and illness risk coherence (i.e., extent to which representations, behaviors, and beliefs are congruent). The current study applies the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM-SR) to evaluate how risk representations may relate to COVID-19 protective and risk behaviors. METHODS: Participants include 400 workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk aged &#8805; 18 years and US residents. Participants completed an online survey measuring risk representations (B-IPQ) and COVID-19 related behaviors, specifically, physical distancing, hand washing, and shopping frequency. RESULTS: Risk coherence, consequences, timeline, emotional representation, and behavioral efficacy were related to risk and protective behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Risk representations vary in their relationship to COVID-19 risk and protective behaviors. Implications include the importance of coherent, targeted, consistent health communication, and effective health policy in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.","Alegria, Katie E; Fleszar-Pavlovic, Sara E; Ngo, Dalena D; Beam, Aislinn; Halliday, Deanna M; Hinojosa, Bianca M; Hua, Jacqueline; Johnson, Angela E; McAnally, Kaylyn; McKinley, Lauren E; Temourian, Allison A; Song, Anna V",Int. j. behav. med,,397

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients presenting with cardiovascular emergencies to four tertiary regional emergency departments in western India during the government implementation of complete lockdown. RESULTS: 25.0% of patients during the lockdown period and 17.4% of patients during the pre-lockdown period presented outside the window period (presentation after 12 hours of symptom onset) compared with only 6% during the pre-COVID period. In the pre-COVID period, 46.9% of patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction underwent emergent catheterisation, while in the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, these values were 26.1% and 18.8%, respectively. The proportion of patients treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy increased from 18.4% in the pre-COVID period to 32.3% in the post-lockdown period. Inhospital mortality for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) increased from 2.69% in the pre-COVID period to 7.27% in the post-lockdown period. There was also a significant decline in emergency admissions for non-ACS conditions, such as acute decompensated heart failure and high degree or complete atrioventricular block.

Such drugs might increase the expression of the fundamental receptor of this new infectious agent: the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Preclinical observations indicate that the increase of ACE2 expression or the activity by ACEis and ARBs leads to a greater transformation of angiotensin (Ang)-II to Ang-(1-7), which is associated with positive effects on cardiovascular and pulmonary pathophysiology. This association has been demonstrated in observational studies in patients with cardiovascular pathology and pneumonia. It has not been possible to confirm whether users of ACEis or ARBs are more infected by the new coronavirus, due to methodological issues in studies with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the use of such antihypertensive treatments in both children and adults might reduce the virulence of infection. Therefore, changes in the antihypertensive therapy of patients at risk of contracting COVID-19 are not recommended.","Vázquez-Cornejo, Edmundo",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,397
481257,The coping styles to stress of Italian emergency health-care professionals after the first peak of COVID 19 pandemic outbreak,2020,"Alpha/beta interferon (IFN-&#945;/ß) signaling through the IFN-&#945;/ß receptor (IFNAR) is essential to limit virus dissemination throughout the central nervous system (CNS) following many neurotropic virus infections. However, the distinct expression patterns of factors associated with the IFN-&#945;/ß pathway in different CNS resident cell populations implicate complex cooperative pathways in IFN-&#945;/ß induction and responsiveness. Here we show that mice devoid of IFNAR1 signaling in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKII&#945;) expressing neurons (CaMKIIcre:IFNARfl/fl mice) infected with a mildly pathogenic neurotropic coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus A59 strain [MHV-A59]) developed severe encephalomyelitis with hind-limb paralysis and succumbed within 7 days. Increased virus spread in CaMKIIcre:IFNARfl/fl mice compared to IFNARfl/fl mice affected neurons not only in the forebrain but also in the mid-hind brain and spinal cords but excluded the cerebellum. Infection was also increased in glia. The lack of viral control in CaMKIIcre:IFNARfl/fl relative to control mice coincided with sustained Cxcl1 and Ccl2 mRNAs but a decrease in mRNA levels of IFN&#945;/ß pathway genes as well as Il6, Tnf, and Il1ß between days 4 and 6 postinfection (p.i.). T cell accumulation and IFN-Î³ production, an essential component of virus control, were not altered. However, IFN-Î³ responsiveness was impaired in microglia/macrophages irrespective of similar pSTAT1 nuclear translocation as in infected controls. The results reveal how perturbation of IFN-&#945;/ß signaling in neurons can worsen disease course and disrupt complex interactions between the IFN-&#945;/ß and IFN-Î³ pathways in achieving optimal antiviral responses.IMPORTANCE IFN-&#945;/ß induction limits CNS viral spread by establishing an antiviral state, but also promotes blood brain barrier integrity, adaptive immunity, and activation of microglia/macrophages. However, the extent to which glial or neuronal signaling contributes to these diverse IFN-&#945;/ß functions is poorly understood. Using a neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus encephalomyelitis model, this study demonstrated an essential role of IFN-&#945;/ß receptor 1 (IFNAR1) specifically in neurons to control virus spread, regulate IFN-Î³ signaling, and prevent acute mortality. The results support the notion that effective neuronal IFNAR1 signaling compensates for their low basal expression of genes in the IFN-&#945;/ß pathway compared to glia. The data further highlight the importance of tightly regulated communication between the IFN-&#945;/ß and IFN-Î³ signaling pathways to optimize antiviral IFN-Î³ activity.","Hwang, Mihyun; Bergmann, Cornelia C",J. virol,,397

Information on the number of people involved in Wuhan is still inadequate. This study aimed to describe the screening results of 61,437 community members in Wuchang District, Wuhan. METHODS: In mid-May 2020, Wuhan launched a population-scale city-wide SARS-CoV-2 testing campaign, which aimed to perform nucleic acid and viral antibody testing for citizens in Wuhan. Here we show the screening results of cluster sampled 61,437 residents in Wuchang District, Wuhan, China. RESULTS: A total of 1470 (2.39%, 95% CI: 2.27-2.52) individuals were detected positive for at least one antiviral antibody. Among the positive individuals, 324 (0.53%, 95% CI: 0.47-0.59) and 1200 (1.95%, 95% CI: 1.85-2.07) were positive for immunoglobulin IgM and IgG, respectively, and 54 (0.08%, 95% CI: 0.07-0.12) were positive for both antibodies. The positive rate of female carriers of antibodies were higher than those of male counterparts (male-to-female ratio of 0.75), especially in elderly citizens (ratio of 0.18 in 90+ age subgroup), indicating a sexual discrepancy in seroprevalence. In addition, viral nucleic acid detection using real-time PCR had showed 8 (0.013%, 95% CI: 0.006-0.026) asymptomatic virus carriers. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan was low.

Their behavior pattern is typically transformed from demand-oriented to security-oriented. This is directly manifested as a differentiation in the population distribution. This study based on a typical area of high-density urban area in central Tianjin, China. We used Baidu heat map (BHM) data to calculate full-day and daytime/nighttime state population aggregation and employed a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and Moran's I to analyze pre-epidemic/epidemic population aggregation patterns and pre-epidemic/epidemic population flow features. We found that during the COVID-19 epidemic, the population distribution of the study area tended to be homogenous clearly and the density decreased obviously. Compared with the pre-epidemic period: residents' demand for indoor activities increased (average correlation coefficient of the floor area ratio increased by 40.060%); traffic demand decreased (average correlation coefficient of the distance to a main road decreased by 272%); the intensity of the day-and-night population flow declined significantly (its extreme difference decreased by 53.608%); and the large-living-circle pattern of population distribution transformed to multiple small-living circles.

Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on individuals and societies have altered perceptions and practices of sustainability through envisaging previously unimaginable global environmental restoration, and experiencing personal, professional and collective changes. Our study shows that the perceived restorative effects on the environment of the pandemic lifted the education community spirits and enhanced a willingness to change by leveraging the social network around the education community to promote collective action.","Beasy, Kim Gonzalez Laura Ripoll",Journal of Education for Sustainable Development,,397

Oral health services were limited to only essential services. Non-urgent treatments were postponed. This study described the management of urgent dental care in northern Italy during the lockdown, with a particular focus on the Province of Brescia. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to Italian dentists at the end of the lockdown (May 3, 2020). A total of 1,407 dentists answered the survey. RESULTS: A total of 1,205 dentists were included. Most of the respondents were dental owners (73.6%). About 79.7% of the dentists handled urgencies during the lockdown. The number of urgencies treated weekly was lower than that generally handled before the COVID-19 outbreak (p < 0.001). Many dentists (81.2%) provided telephone consultations to evaluate symptoms. Pulpitis and abscesses were the most common urgencies (44.7% and 40.2%, respectively). Furthermore, 95% of dentists wore masks, protective eyewear, and surgical gloves while delivering non-postponable treatments. The FFP2 mask was used by 41.8% and 41.7% of owners and dental assistants respectively. Financial concerns, risk of contagion, and PPE supply were indicated as the main current concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey showed that Italian dentists took protective measures during the lockdown, thus minimizing risk of contagion for dental healthcare personnel and patients. Many precautionary guidelines are now available, but a high uncertainty persists about dental health delivery during the pandemic.","Salgarello, Stefano; Salvadori, Matteo; Mazzoleni, Francesco; Salvalai, Viviana; Francinelli, Jacopo; Bertoletti, Paolo; Lorenzi, Daniele; Audino, Elisabetta; Garo, Maria Luisa",J. endod,,397

501704,Is the COVID-19 Pandemic a High-Risk Period for College Student Alcohol Use? A Comparison of Three Spring Semesters,2021,"Background: Certain riboviruses can cause severe pulmonary complications leading to death in some infected patients. We propose that DNA damage induced-apoptosis accelerates viral release, triggered by depletion of host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) from nuclear RNA bound to replicating viral sequences. Methods: Information theory-based analysis of interactions between RBPs and individual sequences in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Influenza A (H3N1), HIV-1, and Dengue genomes identifies strong RBP binding sites in these viral genomes. Replication and expression of viral sequences is expected to increasingly sequester RBPs - SRSF1 and RNPS1. Ordinarily, RBPs bound to nascent host transcripts prevents their annealing to complementary DNA. Their depletion induces destabilizing R-loops. Chromosomal breakage occurs when an excess of unresolved R-loops collide with incoming replication forks, overwhelming the DNA repair machinery. We estimated stoichiometry of inhibition of RBPs in host nuclear RNA by counting competing binding sites in replicating viral genomes and host RNA. Results: Host RBP binding sites are frequent and conserved among different strains of RNA viral genomes. Similar binding motifs of SRSF1 and RNPS1 explain why DNA damage resulting from SRSF1 depletion is complemented by expression of RNPS1. Clustering of strong RBP binding sites coincides with the distribution of RNA-DNA hybridization sites across the genome. SARS-CoV-2 replication is estimated to require 32.5-41.8 hours to effectively compete for binding of an equal proportion of SRSF1 binding sites in host encoded nuclear RNAs. Significant changes in expression of transcripts encoding DNA repair and apoptotic proteins were found in an analysis of influenza A and Dengue-infected cells in some individuals. Conclusions: R-loop-induced apoptosis indirectly resulting from viral replication could release significant quantities of membrane-associated virions into neighboring alveoli. These could infect adjacent pneumocytes and other tissues, rapidly compromising lung function, causing multiorgan system failure and other described symptoms.","Rogan, Peter K; Mucaki, Eliseos J; Shirley, Ben C",F1000Res,,397

Hence a rapid drug repositioning and lead identification strategy are required to mitigate these outbreaks. We report a pharmacophore and molecular dynamics-based approach for drug repositioning and lead identification against dual targets (3CLp and PLp) of SARS-CoV-2. The pharmacophore model of 3CLp inhibitors was apolar with two aromatic and two H-bond acceptors, whereas that of PLp was relatively polar, bearing one aromatic and three H-bond acceptors. Pharmacophore-based virtual screening yielded six existing FDA-approved drugs and twelve natural products with both the pharmacophoric features. Among them are nelfinavir, tipranavir and licochalcone-D, which has shown better binding characteristics with both the proteases compared to lopinavir. The molecular dynamics revealed that the connecting loop (residues 176-199) of 3CLp is highly flexible, and hence, inhibitors should avoid high-affinity interactions with it. Lopinavir, due to its high affinity with the loop region, exhibited unstable binding. Further, the van der Waals size of the 3CLp inhibitors positively correlated with their binding affinity with 3CLp. However, the van der Waals size of a ligand should not cross a threshold of 572Å3, beyond which the ligands are likely to make high-affinity interaction with the loop and suffer unstable binding as observed in the case of lopinavir. Similarly, the total polar surface area of the ligands were found to be negatively correlated with their binding affinity with PLp.","Mitra, Kartik; Ghanta, Prasanth; Acharya, Sushank; Chakrapani, Gayathri; Ramaiah, Basavaraju; Doble, Mukesh",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,397

503420,The psychological impact of COVID-19 on health care workers working in a unique environment under the umbrella of Qatar Red Crescent Society,2021,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) comprise different fibrotic lung disorders characterized by cellular proliferation, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis. The JAK/STAT molecular pathway is activated under the interaction of a broad number of profibrotic/pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-11, and IL-13, among others, which are increased in different ILDs. Similarly, several growth factors over-expressed in ILDs, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor ß1 (TGF-ß1), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) activate JAK/STAT by canonical or non-canonical pathways, which indicates a predominant role of JAK/STAT in ILDs. Between the different JAK/STAT isoforms, it appears that JAK2/STAT3 are predominant, initiating cellular changes observed in ILDs. This review analyzes the expression and distribution of different JAK/STAT isoforms in ILDs lung tissue and different cell types related to ILDs, such as lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial type II cells and analyzes JAK/STAT activation. The effect of JAK/STAT phosphorylation on cellular fibrotic processes, such as proliferation, senescence, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, or epithelial/fibroblast to mesenchymal transition will be described. The small molecules directed to inhibit JAK/STAT activation were assayed in vitro and in in vivo models of pulmonary fibrosis, and different JAK inhibitors are currently approved for myeloproliferative disorders. Recent evidence indicates that JAK inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies directed to block IL-6 are used as compassionate use to attenuate the excessive inflammation and lung fibrosis related to SARS-CoV-2 virus. These altogether indicate that JAK/STAT pathway is an attractive target to be proven in future clinical trials of lung fibrotic disorders.","Montero, Paula; Milara, Javier; Roger, Inés; Cortijo, Julio",Int. j. mol. sci.

506560,Development and validation of a parent-proxy health-related quality of life survey for Australian First Nations children,2021,"Supply shortages of N95 respirators during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have motivated institutions to develop feasible and effective N95 respirator reuse strategies. In particular, heat decontamination is a treatment method that scales well and can be implemented in settings with variable or limited resources. Prior studies using multiple inactivation methods, however, have often focused on a single virus under narrowly defined conditions, making it difficult to develop guiding principles for inactivating emerging or difficult-to-culture viruses. We systematically explored how temperature, humidity, and virus deposition solutions impact the inactivation of viruses deposited and dried on N95 respirator coupons. We exposed four virus surrogates across a range of structures and phylogenies, including two bacteriophages (MS2 and phi6), a mouse coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus [MHV]), and a recombinant human influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (IAV), to heat treatment for 30 min in multiple deposition solutions across several temperatures and relative humidities (RHs). We observed that elevated RH was essential for effective heat inactivation of all four viruses tested. For heat treatments between 72°C and 82°C, RHs greater than 50% resulted in a >6-log10 inactivation of bacteriophages, and RHs greater than 25% resulted in a >3.5-log10 inactivation of MHV and IAV. Furthermore, deposition of viruses in host cell culture media greatly enhanced virus inactivation by heat and humidity compared to other deposition solutions, such as phosphate-buffered saline, phosphate-buffered saline with bovine serum albumin, and human saliva. Past and future heat treatment methods must therefore explicitly account for deposition solutions as a factor that will strongly influence observed virus inactivation rates. Overall, our data set can inform the design and validation of effective heat-based decontamination strategies for N95 respirators and other porous surfaces, especially for emerging viruses that may be of immediate and future public health concern.IMPORTANCE Shortages of personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators, during the coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have highlighted the need to develop effective decontamination strategies for their reuse. This is particularly important in health care settings for reducing exposure to respiratory viruses, like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Although several treatment methods are available, a widely accessible strategy will be necessary to combat shortages on a global scale. We demonstrate that the combination of heat and humidity inactivates a range of RNA viruses, including both viral pathogens and common viral pathogen surrogates, after deposition on N95 respirators and achieves the necessary virus inactivation detailed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines to validate N95 respirator decontamination technologies. We further demonstrate that depositing viruses onto surfaces when suspended in culture media can greatly enhance observed inactivation, adding caution to how heat and humidity treatment methods are validated.","Rockey, Nicole; Arts, Peter J; Li, Lucinda; Harrison, Katherine R; Langenfeld, Kathryn; Fitzsimmons, William J; Lauring, Adam S; Love, Nancy G; Kaye, Keith S; Raskin, Lutgarde; Roberts, William W; Hegarty, Bridget; Wigginton, Krista R",MSphere,,397

Method We conducted a Rapid Synthesis and Translation Process of lessons learned from an international panel of experts, collecting on the ground experiences of the pandemic as it evolved in real time. Digital conferencing and individual interviews were used to rapidly acquire knowledge on the COVID-19 outbreak across 16 locations in Australia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, and the USA. Results COVID-19 has had massive impacts on mental health care internationally. Most systems were under-resourced and under-prepared, struggling to manage both existing and new clients. There were significant differences between sites, depending on the explosivity the pandemic and the readiness of the mental health system. Integrated, community mental health systems exhibited greater adaptability in contrast to services which depended on face-to-face and hospital-based care. COVID-19 has demonstrated the need for a new approach to rapid response to crisis in mental health. New decision support system tools are necessary to ensure local decision-makers can effectively respond to the enormous practical challenges posed in these circumstances. Conclusions The process we have undertaken has generated clear lessons for mental health policymakers worldwide, beyond pandemic planning and response to guide next steps in systemic mental health reform.

Major congenital malformations were diagnosed in 37 out of 866 (4.27%) infants exposed to TDF and 38 out of 1,020 (3.73%) infants exposed to ART other than TDF; the adjusted RR was 1.21 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.90). Estimates for specific malformations were imprecise. The pooled RR from the meta-analysis with six prior studies was 0.88 (0.75 to 1.03).

Sequencing data showed multiple independent viral introductions into the UAE from Europe, Iran and Asia (29 January-18 March), and these early strains seeded significant clustering consistent with almost exclusive community-based transmission between April and June 2020. Majority of sequenced strains (N = 60, 52%) were from the European cluster consistent with the higher infectivity rates associated with the D614G mutation carried by most strains in this cluster. A total of 986 mutations were identified in 115 genomes, 272 were unique (majority were missense, n = 134) and 20/272 mutations were novel. A missense (Q271R) and synonymous (R41R) mutation in the S and N proteins, respectively, were identified in 2/27 patients with severe COVID-19 but not in patients with mild or moderate disease (0/86; p = .05, Fisher's Exact Test). Both patients were women (51-64 years) with no significant underlying health conditions. The same two mutations were identified in a healthy 37-year-old Indian man who was hospitalized in India due to COVID-19. Our findings provide evidence for continued community-based transmission of the European strains in the Dubai population and highlight new mutations that might be associated with severe disease in otherwise healthy adults.","Loney, Tom; Khansaheb, Hamda; Ramaswamy, Sathishkumar; Harilal, Divinlal; Deesi, Zulfa Omar; Varghese, Rupa Murthy; Belal Al Ali, Aydah; Khadeeja, Anees; Al Suwaidi, Hanan; Alkhajeh, Abdulmajeed; Mohamed AlDabal, Laila; Uddin, Mohammed; Al Faresi, Mubarak; Joshi, Madhvi; Senok, Abiola; Nowotny, Norbert; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi; Abou Tayoun, Ahmad",Transbound. emerg. dis.

It aims to develop a complete data-driven framework for modeling such unknown dynamics. To achieve this, we characterize Koopman eigenfrequencies as generating frequencies of the quasiperiodic driver of the system. We compute true eigenfrequencies of Koopman operators by applying the theory of Reproducing Kernel Hibert Space (RKHS) and results from ergodic theory. We also demonstrate the decomposition of quasiperiodically driven dynamics into two components, i) the quasiperiodic driving source with generating frequencies and ii) the driven nonlinear dynamics. A unique aspect of the proposed framework is that it applies to the analysis of systems where the periodic component is either non-dominant or even absent. As a case study, we analyze a system of nine traffic signalized intersections. The proposed framework accurately reconstructs the measured queue lengths of the signalized intersections and makes stable long-term predictions.","Das, Suddhasattwa; Mustavee, Shakib; Agarwal, Shaurya",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08623v1.pdf,397

The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and respiratory tract inflammation, with some severe patients developing an acute and chronic lung injury, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF). It has already claimed approximately 300 thousand human lives and the number is still on the rise; the only way to prevent the infection is to be safe till vaccines and reliable treatments develop. In previous studies, the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in clinical trials had been proven to be effective in immune modulation and tissue repair promotion; however, their efficacy in treating COVID-19 remains underestimated. Here, we report the findings from past experiences of SARS and MSCs, and how SARS could also induce PF.

Due to the pandemic, most countries affected have therefore imposed periods of full or partial lockdowns to restrict community transmission. This has had the welcome but unexpected side effect that existing levels of atmospheric pollutants, particularly in cities, have temporarily declined. As found by several authors, air quality can inherently exacerbate the risks linked to respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. In this study, we explore patterns of air pollution for ten of the most affected countries in the world, in the context of the 2020 development of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the concentrations of some of the principal atmospheric pollutants were temporarily reduced during the extensive lockdowns in the spring. Secondly, we show that the seasonality of the atmospheric pollutants is not significantly affected by these temporary changes, indicating that observed variations in COVID-19 conditions are likely to be linked to air quality. On this background, we confirm that air pollution may be a good predictor for the local and national severity of COVID-19 infections.","Singh, Ram Kumar; Drews, Martin; De la Sen, Manuel; Srivastava, Prashant Kumar; Trisasongko, Bambang H; Kumar, Manoj; Pandey, Manish Kumar; Anand, Akash; Singh, S S; Pandey, A K; Dobriyal, Manmohan; Rani, Meenu; Kumar, Pavan",Sci Rep,,397
517748,Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection among children with primary nephrotic syndrome: a cross-sectional study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a distressing psychiatric disorder. Traumas may trigger or aggravate OCD symptoms. COVID-19 pandemic has coursed a global crisis and has been associated with onset of psychiatric disorders in adults. Little is known about children/adolescents with OCD. The present study aimed to examine how children/adolescents with OCD react towards COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to two separate groups of children/adolescents. One group was a clinical group newly diagnosed at a specialized OCD clinic. All the children/adolescents had a current close contact to a therapist or doctor. The other group was a survey group identified through the Danish OCD Association. Most of these children/adolescents were diagnosed years ago, and their primary treatment was completed. For the clinical group, data from patient files was available. RESULTS: In both groups, but most pronounced in the survey group, participants experienced a worsening of their OCD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The aggravation of OCD correlated with the worsening of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and the extent of avoidance behavior. For both groups, OCD aggressive symptoms predicted a significant worsening. Poor baseline insight showed a trend to predict a symptom worsening. The worsening was most pronounced in children with early age of onset and a family history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies examining the effect of COVID-19 in children/adolescents with OCD. The effect was examined in two separate populations strengthening the findings. The study points towards an influence of the OCD phenotype, baseline insight suggesting a continued vulnerability, and a family history of psychiatric disorders. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (1-16-02-147-20) registered 1st of April 2020. Oral and written information was given to parents and patients and written consent from patients over 15 years and parents were received.","Nissen, J B; Højgaard, D R M A; Thomsen, P H",BMC Psychiatry,,397

The major roles of the protein include virulence, infectivity, ion channel activity, morphogenesis, and virus release. The coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is mutating rapidly, therefore, critical study of mutations in ORF3a is certainly important from the pathogenic perspective. Here, a sum of 175 non-synonymous mutations in the ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 were identified from 7194 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 available from NCBI database. Effects of these mutations on structural stability, and functions of ORF3a were also studied. Broadly, three different classes of mutations, such as neutral, disease, and mixed (neutral and disease) types of mutations were observed. Consecutive phenomena of mutations in ORF3a protein were studied based on the timeline of detection of the mutations. Considering the amino acid compositions of the ORF3a protein, twenty clusters were detected using the K-means clustering method. The present findings on 175 novel mutations of ORF3a proteins will extend our knowledge on ORF3a, a vital accessory protein in SARS-CoV-2, to enlighten the pathogenicity of this life-threatening virus.","Hassan, Sk Sarif; Attrish, Diksha; Ghosh, Shinjini; Choudhury, Pabitra Pal; Roy, Bidyut",Virus Res,,397

The aim of this study was to examine factors associated with the quality of perceived patient-physician communication and whether this variable was associated with increased odds of vaccination. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study conducted from October 2016 to January 2017. The participants were 22,253 physically and cognitively independent individuals aged 65 or older living in 39 municipalities in Japan. Multilevel logit models were used to estimate the odds of vaccination. RESULTS: Among the participants, 40.0% and 58.8% had received pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations as per the recommended schedule, respectively. People with low educational levels were more likely to have a family physician but rate their experience in asking questions lower than those with higher educational levels. Having a family physician and high rating for physicians' listening attitude were positively associated with increased odds of pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations. High rating for patients' questioning attitude and shared decision-making, compared to an ambiguous attitude toward medical decision-making, were positively associated with increased odds of pneumococcal vaccination. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that promotion of having a family physician, better patient-physician communication, and shared decision-making may encourage older adults to undergo recommended vaccinations.","Sato, Koryu; Kondo, Naoki; Murata, Chiyoe; Shobugawa, Yugo; Saito, Kousuke; Kondo, Katsunori",J. epidemiol,,397

Although several studies have discussed the role of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in viral infections, such as influenzae and SARS, it remains unexplored in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. 5-LOX acts on free arachidonic acid (AA) to form proinflammatory leukotrienes (LTs). Of note, numerous cells involved with COVID-19 (e.g., inflammatory and smooth muscle cells, platelets, and vascular endothelium) widely express leukotriene receptors. Moreover, 5-LOX metabolites induce the release of cytokines (e.g., tumour necrosis factor-&#945; [TNF-&#945;], interleukin-1&#945; [IL-1&#945;], and interleukin-1ß [IL-1ß]) and express tissue factor on cell membranes and activate plasmin. Since macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils can express lipoxygenases, activation of 5-LOX and the subsequent release of LTs may contribute to the severity of COVID-19. This review sheds light on the potential implications of 5-LOX in SARS-CoV-2-mediated infection and the anticipated therapeutic role of 5-LOX inhibitors.","Ayola-Serrano, Nohora Cristina; Roy, Namrata; Fathah, Zareena; Anwar, Mohammed Moustapha; Singh, Bivek; Ammar, Nour; Sah, Ranjit; Elba, Areej; Utt, Rawan Sobhi; Pecho-Silva, Samuel; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Dhama, Kuldeep; Quraishi, Sadeq",Inflamm Res,,397

In mid-March, medical schools suspended all clinical rotations for the remainder of the 2019–2020 academic year. As such, third-year medical students may not be able to complete sufficient clinical experiences to make important career choices before they have to submit their residency applications. While the decision to suspend clinical rotations was necessary to protect students, specialty organizations and residency programs must mitigate the deficits in students’ clinical education caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this Perspective, the authors identify potential challenges for third-year medical students and advocate for solutions to improve the residency application process for students and programs. First, they propose delaying the date that programs can access applicant data through the Electronic Residency Application Service, thereby affording students more time to complete clinical experiences, solidify their specialty decision, and strengthen their residency application. Second, the authors recommend a restriction on the number of visiting rotations that students are expected to complete to allow for a more equitable distribution of these important experiences. Third, they suggest that program directors from each specialty agree on a maximum number of applications per applicant (based on historical data) to curb an upsurge in applications that may stem from the unique circumstances created by COVID-19 without causing applicants undue stress. Lastly, the authors advocate that residency programs develop infrastructure to conduct video-based interviews and engage students through virtual networking events. Amidst the unique environment created by COVID-19, the authors urge governing bodies, specialty organizations, and residency programs to consider these recommendations to improve the efficiency and reduce the stress surrounding the 2021 Match.","Gabrielson, Andrew T.; Kohn, Jaden R.; Sparks, Hayley T.; Clifton, Marisa M.; Kohn, Taylor P.",Acad Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32459675/; https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003520,397

While the use of anti-coagulants does reduce the incidence of pulmonary emboli, it does not help with survival. This suggests that the coagulopathy is more likely to be platelet-driven rather than thrombin-driven. There is significant evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virions directly interact with platelets to trigger activation leading to thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. I propose a model of multiple interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and platelets that has many similarities to that with Staphylococcus aureus and Dengue virus. As platelet activation and thrombosis are major factors in poor prognosis, therapeutics that target the platelet-SARS-CoV-2 interaction have potential in treating COVID-19 and other virus infections.","Cox, Dermot",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34290613/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.708665,397

In this study, the sample comprised 35 male runners, enrolled in the “InTrack” project. Information regarding variables related to runners’ training was obtained via an online questionnaire, while anthropometric and body composition variables, as well as physical fitness components (muscular power, isometric strength, local muscular endurance, agility, and aerobic capacity) were measured, and a global physical fitness score (based on physical fitness components measured) was computed. The Weltman test (3200 m) was used to estimate runners’ pace and their stride frequency. Linear regression was used, taking the running pace as dependent variable. The final model, comprising biological, physical fitness, spatiotemporal, and training variables, explained 86% of the running performance variance. Muscular power (β = −1.02; 95% CI = (−1.69)–(−0.35)), abdominal muscle endurance (β = −4.81; 95% CI = (−7.52)–(−2.10)), isometric strength (β = −422.95; 95% CI = (−689.65)–(−156.25)), global physical fitness (β = 27.14; 95% CI = 9.52–45.03), and stride frequency (β = −2.99; 95% CI = (−4.29)–(−1.69)) were significantly associated with performance, meaning that better results in tests and increasing the stride frequency leads to better performance.

596180,Balancing Protection from COVID‐19 and the Need for Human Touch in Nursing Homes,2020-10-01,"SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious coronavirus causing the ongoing pandemic. Very recently its genomic RNA of ∼30 kb was decoded to be packaged with nucleocapsid (N) protein into phase separated condensates. Interestingly, viruses have no ability to generate ATP but host cells have very high ATP concentrations of 2–12 mM. A key question thus arises whether ATP modulates liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the N protein. Here we discovered that ATP not only biphasically modulates LLPS of the viral N protein as we previously found on human FUS and TDP-43, but also dissolves the droplets induced by oligonucleic acid. Residue-specific NMR characterization showed ATP specifically binds the RNA-binding domain (RBD) of the N protein with the average Kd of 3.3 ± 0.4 mM. The ATP-RBD complex structure was constructed by NMR-derived constraints, in which ATP occupies a pocket within the positive-charged surface utilized for binding nucleic acids. Our study suggests that ATP appears to be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to prompt its life cycle by facilitating the uncoating, localizing and packing of its genomic RNA. Therefore the interactions of ATP with the viral RNA and N protein might represent promising targets for design of drugs and vaccines to terminate the pandemic.","Dang, Mei; Li, Yifan; Song, Jianxing",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X21000528?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33477032/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X21000528; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.01.018,397

METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study involving 142 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and moderate inflammation divided into three treatment groups (pulses of methylprednisolone alone [group I], tocilizumab alone [group II] and methylprednisolone plus tocilizumab [group III]). The aim was to assess intergroups differences in the clinical course with a 60-day follow-up and related analytical factors. RESULTS: 14 patients (9,8%) died: 8 (10%) in group I and 6 (9,5%) in groups II and III. 15 (10,6%) were admitted to ICU: 2 (2,5%) from group I, 4 (28,5%) from group II and 9 (18,4%) from group III. The mean hospital stay was longer in group II and clinical outcome was not associated with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab seems to be not associated with better clinical outcomes and should be reserved for clinical trial scenario, since its widespread use may result in higher rate of ICU admission and longer mean hospital stay without differences in mortality rate and potentially adverse events.","Aomar-Millán, Ismael Francisco; Salvatierra, Juan; Torres-Parejo, Úrsula; Nuñez-Nuñez, María; Hernández-Quero, José; Anguita-Santos, Francisco",Med Clin (Engl Ed),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2387020621002461; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2387020621002461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34056111/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcle.2021.01.004,397

We selected those that provided the highest levels of evidence regarding risk in different aspects: screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of prostate cancer. Results: We developed a classification system based on priorities, at different stages of the disease (screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up) to which the type of care given, in-person or telephone visits, was adapted. We established 4 options, as follows: in priority A or low, care will be given by telephone in all cases; in priority B or intermediate, if patients are considered subsidiary of an in-person visit after telephone consultation, they will be scheduled within 3 months; in priority C or high, patients will be seen in person within a margin from 1 to 3 months and in priority D or very high, patients must always be seen in person within a margin of up to 48 hours and considered very preferential. Conclusions: Telematic care in prostate cancer offers an opportunity to develop new performance and follow-up protocols, which should be thoroughly analyzed in future studies, in order to create a safe environment and guarantee oncologic outcomes for patients.","García Rodríguez, J; de León, C González Ruiz; Sacristán González, R; Méndez Ramírez, S; Modrego Ulecia, L; Fernández-Gómez, J M",Actas Urol Esp,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acuro.2021.04.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210480621000875; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210480621000875?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994612/,397

This issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of honey bees throughout North America (so called, ‘Colony Collapse Disorder’); yet, we still have little understanding of the cause(s) of bee declines. Wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen ‘spillover’ from commercially reared bumble bees, which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops, is a possible cause. We constructed a spatially explicit model of pathogen spillover in bumble bees and, using laboratory experiments and the literature, estimated parameter values for the spillover of Crithidia bombi, a destructive pathogen commonly found in commercial Bombus. We also monitored wild bumble bee populations near greenhouses for evidence of pathogen spillover, and compared the fit of our model to patterns of C. bombi infection observed in the field. Our model predicts that, during the first three months of spillover, transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20% of wild bumble bees within 2 km of the greenhouse. However, a travelling wave of disease is predicted to form suddenly, infecting up to 35–100% of wild Bombus, and spread away from the greenhouse at a rate of 2 km/wk. In the field, although we did not observe a large epizootic wave of infection, the prevalences of C. bombi near greenhouses were consistent with our model. Indeed, we found that spillover has allowed C. bombi to invade several wild bumble bee species near greenhouses. Given the available evidence, it is likely that pathogen spillover from commercial bees is contributing to the ongoing decline of wild Bombus in North America. Improved management of domestic bees, for example by reducing their parasite loads and their overlap with wild congeners, could diminish or even eliminate pathogen spillover.","Otterstatter, Michael C.; Thomson, James D.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18648661/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002771,397

Control of gene expression is a vital element of virus replication. Coordinate expression of groups of virus genes results in successive phases of gene expression. Immediate–early genes encode activator proteins, early genes encode further regulatory proteins, and late genes encode virus structural proteins. Viruses make use of the biochemical apparatus of their host cells to express their genetic information as proteins and, consequently, utilize the appropriate biochemical language recognized by the cell. Thus viruses of prokaryotes produce polycistronic mRNAs, while viruses with eukaryotic hosts produce more monocistronic mRNAs. Some viruses of eukaryotes do produce polycistronic mRNA to assist with the coordinate regulation of multiple genes. Viruses rely on specific cis- and trans-acting mechanisms to manipulate the biology of their host cells, and to enhance and coordinate the expression of their genetic information. The chapter discusses control of prokaryote gene expression, expression in bacteriophage λ, eukaryote gene expression, and also discusses genome coding strategies. The chapter ends with a discussion of the transcription and post-transcriptional methods of control of gene expression.","Cann, Alan J.",Principles of Molecular Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123849397100055; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123849397100055,397

Syria protracted conflict has strained its health systems and caused fragmentation. In this study, we focus on northwest (NW) Syria, where recent violence has driven almost one million civilians (of the 4.17 million in the area) from their homes between December 2019 and March 2020. The area is challenged by overcrowding, inadequate WASH, shelter and insufficient healthcare services. Internationally promoted measures (social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine, lockdown) are not impossible. We model outcomes, according to three scenarios, should there be a COVD-19 outbreak. We aim to: 1. Predict the numbers of cases, including severe and critical ones, and deaths. 2. Identify critical time points when the health system capacity is overwhelmed due to COVID-19. Methodology: using the WHO COVD-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool (COVID-ESFT) and data from the Health Information System Unit on population and health facility capacity and utilization in northwest Syria, we generate predicted numbers of cases, deaths and health care needs according to three scenarios. Scenario One assumes a medium doubling rate (every 4 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20% of the population). Scenario Two assumes a fast doubling rate (every 3.2 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20% of the population). Camp-population Scenario assumes a very fast doubling rate (every 2.3 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20% of the population). Scenarios One and Two apply to the total population of 4.17 million and for 8 weeks from the first case while Camp-population Scenario applies only to the 1.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps and tented settlements and for 6 weeks from the first case. For each scenario, we identify critical time-points when the health system capacity is overwhelmed assuming a highly conservative estimate that 50% of regular hospital (ward) and ICU beds can be occupied by COVID-19 patients. Results: Scenario One predicts 16,384 cases (0.4% of the total population), of which 2,458 are severe and 819 are critical, and 978 deaths in the first 8 weeks. Scenario Two predicts 185,364 cases (4.4% of the population), of which 27805 are severe and 9268 are critical, and 11,066 deaths in the first 8 weeks. Camp-population Scenario predicts 240,000 cases (20% of the IDP population) of which 36,000 are severe and 12,000 are critical and 14,328 deaths in the first 6 weeks. With only 2,429 inpatient beds and 240 ICU beds (98 with adult ventilators, 62 with paediatric ventilators) in northwest Syria, ward and ICU bed capacities will be overwhelmed within 4-7 weeks. The Camp-population Scenario will see the earliest critical time-points. Conclusion and recommendations: Should a COVID-19 outbreak occur in NW Syria, projected cases and deaths will be particularly severe among IDPs. Health system capacity will be overwhelmed within a short period after the first case in camp settings. There is need for further research to account for additional variables that can impact projections. However, it is urgent for international community to mobilize efforts and resources to support community-based measures, increase testing, strengthen health system capacity.","Hariri, M.; Rihawi, H.; Safadi, S.; McGlasson, M.

However, the resulting problem of packaging waste, particularly from overpackaging, poses serious challenges to environmental sustainability and human health. Existing research has proposed many solutions from various perspectives, but very few have considered the acceptability and consumer preference for these proposals. Using the value co-creation (VCC) theory, we established a research model to explore consumer preferences for e-commerce overpackaging solutions. A survey of 632 online consumers in Guangzhou and Shenzhen was conducted, and data were analyzed using the SmartPLS software. The results show that establishing a recycling system, government policy, and consumers’ environmental awareness have a significant positive impact on consumer preference, while combined packaging has a significant negative impact. We also found that government policy plays an intermediary role in establishing a recycling system and consumer preference. Based on these findings, we recommend that enterprises establish and improve their packaging recycling systems and that e-commerce platforms provide alternative options to combined packaging. Also, the government should play a guiding and coordinating role for enterprises and consumers, and environmental awareness among consumers should actively be promoted.","Xie, Guojie; Huang, Lijuan; Apostolidis, Chrysostomos; Huang, Zuqing; Cai, Weiwei; Li, Guokai",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360244/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157951,397

The disparities of COVID-19 and police brutality have highlighted the pervasiveness of systemic racism in health outcomes. Whether racial bias impacts patient access to advanced HF therapies is unclear. RECENT FINDINGS: As documented in other settings, racial bias appears to operate in HF providers’ consideration of patients for advanced therapy. Multiple medical and psychosocial elements of the evaluation process are particularly vulnerable to bias. SUMMARY: Reducing gaps in access to advanced therapies will require commitments at multiple levels to reduce barriers to healthcare access, standardize clinical operations, research the determinants of patient success and increase diversity among providers and researchers.

Of them, 17.3% claimed to live alone, 39.5% with their partner, and 43.1% with their partner and children. The results show that people in general experienced a lower level of happiness and mental health and higher levels of loneliness compared to normative sample. The lockdown and pandemic condition due to COVID-19 seems to have canceled the gender differences in the perception of happiness and mental health, while it seems to have increased the perception of loneliness experienced by males compared to the pre-pandemic condition. In addition, those who lived alone perceived a greater level of loneliness than those who lived with their partner or partner and children. Unexpectedly, no significant differences emerged regarding the level of happiness and mental health between those who had direct contact with the virus and those who did not. These data should make political decision-makers reflect on the need to pay more attention to the implications that such drastic measures as a lockdown can have on people’s psychological well-being.","Rania, Nadia; Coppola, Ilaria",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.567470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796039/,397

Their use, however, remains limited, particularly in disadvantaged populations. Methods: Electronic health records were reviewed from SARS-CoV-2 patients at a single medical center in the United States that initiated mAb infusions in January 2021 with the support of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' National Disaster Medical System. Patients who received mAbs were compared to untreated patients from the time period before mAb availability who met eligibility criteria for mAb treatment. We used logistic regression to measure the effect of mAb treatment on the risk of hospitalization or emergency department (E.D.) visit within 30 days of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Results: Of 598 COVID-19 patients, 270 (45%) received bamlanivimab and 328 (55%) were untreated. Two hundred and thirty-one patients (39%) were Hispanic. Among treated patients, 5/270 (1.9%) presented to the E.D. or required hospitalization within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, compared to 39/328 (12%) untreated patients (p<0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities, the risk of E.D. visit or hospitalization was 82% lower in mAb-treated patients compared to untreated patients (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66%-94%). Conclusions: In this diverse, real-world COVID-19 patient population, mAb treatment significantly decreased the risk of subsequent E.D. visit or hospitalization. Broader treatment with mAbs, including in disadvantaged patient populations, can decrease the burden on hospitals and should be facilitated in all populations in the United States to ensure health equity.","Rainwater-Lovett, K.; Redd, J.

604807,"Biological outcome measurement through mail-based testing for HIV, STIS, and substance use among adolescents",2021,"Zoonotic infectious diseases are spread from animals to humans. It is estimated that over 60% of human infectious diseases are zoonotic and 75% of them are emerging zoonoses. The majority of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases are caused by viruses including avian influenza, rabies, Ebola, coronaviruses and orthohantaviruses. Spillover of infection from animals to humans depends on a complex transmission pathway, which is influenced by epidemiological and environmental processes. In this investigation, the focus is on direct transmission between animals and humans and the effects of seasonal variations on the transmission and recovery rates. Fluctuations in transmission and recovery, besides being influenced by physiological processes and behaviors of pathogen and host, are driven by seasonal variations in temperature, humidity or rainfall. A new time-nonhomogeneous stochastic process is formulated for infectious disease spread from animals to humans when transmission and recovery rates are time-periodic. A branching process approximation is applied near the disease-free state to predict the probability of the first spillover event from animals to humans. This probability is a periodic function of the time when infection is introduced into the animal population. It is shown that the highest risk of a spillover depends on a combination of animal to human transmission, animal to animal transmission and animal recovery. The results are applied to a stochastic model for avian influenza with spillover from domestic poultry to humans.","Nandi, Aadrita; Allen, Linda J.S.",Infect Dis Model,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2021.01.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688600/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042721000208?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042721000208,397
605267,Cancer symptom experience and help-seeking behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a cross-sectional population survey,2021-09-16,"Novel mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have been authorized for emergency use and are currently being administered to millions of individuals worldwide. Despite their efficacy in clinical trials, there is limited data on vaccine-induced immune responses in individuals with a prior SARS-CoV2 infection compared to SARS-CoV2 naïve subjects. Moreover, how mRNA vaccines impact the development of antibodies as well as memory B cells in COVID-19 experienced versus COVID-19 naïve subjects remains poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated antibody responses and antigen-specific memory B cell responses over time in 33 SARS-CoV2 naïve and 11 SARS-CoV2 recovered subjects. mRNA vaccination induced significant antibody and memory B cell responses against full-length SARS-CoV2 spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals benefitted from both doses of mRNA vaccine with additional increases in antibodies and memory B cells following booster immunization. In contrast, SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals had a significant immune response after the first dose with no increase in circulating antibodies or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. Moreover, the magnitude of the memory B cell response induced by vaccination was lower in older individuals, revealing an age-dependence to mRNA vaccine-induced B cell memory. Side effects also tended to associate with post-boost antibody levels, but not with post-boost memory B cells, suggesting that side effect severity may be a surrogate of short-term antibody responses. The frequency of pre-vaccine antigen-specific memory B cells in SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals strongly correlated with post-vaccine antibody levels, supporting a key role for memory B cells in humoral recall responses to SARS-CoV2. This observation may have relevance for future booster vaccines and for responses to viral variants that partially escape pre-existing antibodies and require new humoral responses to be generated from memory B cells. Finally, post-boost antibody levels were not correlated with post-boost memory responses in SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals, indicating that short-term antibody levels and memory B cells are complementary immunological endpoints that should be examined in tandem when evaluating vaccine response. Together, our data provide evidence of both serological response and immunological memory following mRNA vaccination that is distinct based on prior SARS-CoV2 exposure. These findings may inform vaccine distribution in a resource-limited setting.","Goel, Rishi R.; Apostolidis, Sokratis A.; Painter, Mark M.; Mathew, Divij; Pattekar, Ajinkya; Kuthuru, Oliva; Gouma, Sigrid; Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia; Meng, Wenzhao; Adamski, Sharon; Baxter, Amy E.; Giles, Josephine R.; Weirick, Madison E.; McAllister, Christopher M.; Hicks, Amanda; Korte, Scott; Dougherty, Jeanette; Long, Sherea; D’Andrea, Kurt; Hamilton, Jacob T.; Prak, Eline T Luning; Betts, Michael R.; Bates, Paul; Hensley, Scott E.; Greenplate, Allison R.; Wherry, E.

An understanding of the antibody responses to the viral components is very important for diagnosis and vaccine development. Objective: The spectrum of SARS-specific antibody profiles in SARS patients was investigated from 7 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms. Study design: Serial serum samples from 14 SARS patients were isolated from 7 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms, and were tested for anti-viral IgG and IgM by indirect immunofluorescence tests (IFA), anti-nucleocaspid antibody by ELISA tests and viral neutralization. Results: Anti-viral (IgG) and anti-nucleocaspid antibodies were observed in 13 of 14 patients at 14 days after the onset of symptoms, and in all 14 patients at 30–210 days thereafter. Anti-viral antibody (IgM) was detected maximally at 30 days, later than that for the IgG class. IgM antibody declined and became undetectable between 60 to 180 days after the onset of the symptoms. Neutralizing viral antibodies were demonstrated in the sera from all of the patients with SARS symptoms. Conclusions: Anti-viral IgG, IgM, and anti-nucleocaspid antibodies were detected 7–30 days in patients after the onset of SARS symptoms. Anti-viral IgM antibodies disappeared earlier than IgG.

Here, we put forward a strategy that can potentially contribute to this goal. Human body fluids and biological materials collected before the COVID-19 pandemic may serve as archives for retrospective testing of early human infections before the recent outbreaks. These have been routinely donated, collected, and archived, creating biorepositories or “biobanks” for clinical or research purposes. SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials and its antibodies have been confirmed in various types of biological samples from COVID-19 patients, including blood, sperm, umbilical cord blood, lung, heart, kidney and so on, making these biological archives as candidates for detecting early COVID-19 infections. Unlike sewage-based epidemiology which only provides information on the geographical aspect, viruses identified in archived human biological samples provide direct links to individuals, from whom a wealth of personal information including their profession, hobbies and activities, travel history, and previous exposure to wildlife can all be retrieved. By analyzing the patterns and links in the behavior of those early infected individuals, it is possible to trace the origin of the virus, for instance, in certain wild animals or local environments.","He, Shanshan; Han, Jie",Environ Pollut,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116525; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749121001032?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33516955/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0269749121001032,397

It describes the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious person through time. To date, Re estimates are based on clinical data such as observed cases, hospitalizations, and/or deaths. Here we show that the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater can be used to estimate Re in near real-time, independent of clinical data and without associated biases stemming from clinical testing and reporting strategies. The method to estimate Re from wastewater is robust and applicable to data from different countries and wastewater matrices. The resulting estimates are as similar to the Re estimates from case report data as Re estimates based on observed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are among each other. We further provide details on the effect of sampling frequency and the shedding load distribution on the ability to infer Re. To our knowledge, this is the first time Re has been estimated from wastewater. This method provides a low cost, rapid, and independent way to inform SARS-CoV-2 monitoring during the ongoing pandemic and is applicable to future wastewater-based epidemiology targeting other pathogens.","Huisman, J.

However, only little is known about the humoral immune response against these viruses. Our aim was to establish virus-specific serological assays and to determine the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against these three viruses in the general population. METHODS: The capsid proteins VP1 of WUPyV and KIPyV and VP2 of HBoV were cloned into baculovirus vectors and expressed in Sf9 insect cells. IgG antibodies against WUPyV VP1, KIPyV VP1, and HBoV VP2 were determined by immunofluorescence assays in 100 plasma samples of blood donors. RESULTS: The median age of the blood donors was 31 years (range 20 - 66 yrs), 52% were male. 89% of the samples were positive for WUPyV IgG (median age 31 yrs, 49.4% male), 67% were positive for KIPyV IgG (median age 32 yrs, 46.3% male), and 76% were positive for HBoV IgG (median age 32 yrs, 51.3% male). For WUPyV and HBoV, there were no significant differences of the seropositivity rates with respect to age groups or gender. For KIPyV, the seropositivity rate increased significantly from 59% in the age group 20 - 29 years to 100% in the age group > 50 years. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalences of antibodies against WUPyV, KIPyV, and HBoV were found in plasma samples of healthy adults. The results indicate that primary infection with these viruses occurs during childhood or youth. For KIPyV, the seropositivity appears to increase further during adulthood.","Neske, Florian; Prifert, Christiane; Scheiner, Barbara; Ewald, Moritz; Schubert, Jörg; Opitz, Andreas; Weissbrich, Benedikt",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20646318/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-215,397
608071,B95: A new respirator for health care personnel,2013-05-29,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to assess an innovative risk score for common dental procedures, based on the most recent contaminant SARS-CoV-2. After scoring the level of infection risk, safety procedures, advice and personal protective equipment (PPE) are recommended for the dental team in each dental practice. METHODS: The authors of this research analysed 42 common dental procedures on the basis of known transmission risks. In increasing order, many consider the parameters leading to different risk scores for the dental team and patients for each procedure to be: direct contact with saliva (score 1), direct contact with blood (score 2), production of low levels of spray/aerosol via air–water syringes (score 3), the production of high levels of spray/aerosol from rotating, ultrasound and piezoelectric tools (score 4); and the duration of the procedure, which may increase the risk of procedures producing droplets and aerosols. RESULTS: Using this innovative risk-scoring system, the authors classified the different dental procedures according to low, medium or high risk: low (1–3), medium (4–5), high (≥ 6). A safety protocol for each procedure was thereafter matched with the calculated risk level. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative risk-scoring system presented in this research permits the reclassification of dental procedures according to the infection risk level. Consequently, specific procedures, previously considered as entry level, will now merit revision.

Design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: Academic safety-net medical center in central Massachusetts, United States. Methods: We examined electronic medical records (EMRs) to discern goals-of-care (GOC) conversations with COVID-19 patients seen at some point by palliative care during their hospitalization, and all clinicians' use of a structured note template during the peak incidence of COVID-19 from March to May 2020. Patients were grouped based on comorbidities and preadmission living situation. GOC discussions were categorized into three types: code status decisions, other treatment decisions, and no treatment decisions. Results: Nearly all (97%) patients had GOC documentation within 48 hours of admission. Forty-four percent of first GOC conversations incorporated the template. Patients with dementia living in nursing facilities had GOC documentation within hours of hospital admission, whereas healthier patients had their first GOC conversation at one week of hospitalization. Decisions about code status predominated in the first (83%) and second (49%) discussions, followed by a focus on other treatment decisions in subsequent discussions (44%-57%). Many did not require a treatment decision (19%-27%) but focused on quality-of-life definitions. Nearly all survivors were discharged to a facility and only four patients returned home.

609281,Differences in Utilization of Nonvideo Telemedicine Visits for Dermatologic Concerns in Underserved Populations During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-07-12,"ABSTRACT: IMPORTANCE: Identifying potential Covid-19 patients in the general population is a huge challenge at the moment. Given the low availability of infected Covid-19 patients clinical data, it is challenging to understand and comprehend similar and complex patterns in these symptomatic patients. Laboratory testing for Covid19 antigen with RT-PCR | (Reverse Transcriptase) is not possible or economical for whole populations. OBJECTIVE: To develop a Covid risk stratifier model that classifies people into different risk cohorts, based on their symptoms and validate the same. DESIGN: Analysis of Covid cases across Wuhan and New York were done to identify the course of these cases prior to being symptomatic and being hospitalised for the infection. A dataset based on these statistics were generated and was then fed into an unsupervised learning algorithm to reveal patterns and identify similar groups of people in the population. Each of these cohorts were then classified and identified into three risk levels that were validated against the real world cases and studies. SETTING: The study is based on general population. PARTICIPANTS: The adult population were considered for the analysis, development and validation of the model RESULTS: Of 1 million observations generated, 20% of them exhibited Covid symptoms and patterns, and 80% of them belonged to the asymptomatic and non-infected group of people. Upon clustering, three clinically obvious clusters were obtained, out of which the Cluster A had 20% of the symptomatic cases that were classified into one cohort, the other two cohorts, Cluster B had people with no symptoms but with high number of comorbidities and Cluster C had people with few leading indicators for the infection with few comorbidities. This was then validated against 300 participants whose data we collected as a part of a research study through our Covid-research tool and about 92% of them were classified correctly. CONCLUSION: A model was developed and validated that classifies people into Covid risk categories based on their symptoms. This can be used to monitor and track cases that rapidly transition into being symptomatic which eventually get tested positive for the infection in order to initiate early medical interventions.

609310,The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) in the Russian language - a systematic review of validation efforts and application challenges,2021-10-07,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been one of the most serious global health crises in world history. During the pandemic, health care systems require accurate forecasts for key resources to guide preparation for patient surges. Forecasting the COVID-19 hospital census is among the most important planning decisions to ensure adequate staffing, number of beds, intensive care units, and vital equipment. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to explore the potential utility of local COVID-19 infection incidence data in developing a forecasting model for the COVID-19 hospital census. METHODS: The study data comprised aggregated daily COVID-19 hospital census data across 11 Atrium Health hospitals plus a virtual hospital in the greater Charlotte metropolitan area of North Carolina, as well as the total daily infection incidence across the same region during the May 15 to December 5, 2020, period. Cross-correlations between hospital census and local infection incidence lagging up to 21 days were computed. A multivariate time-series framework, called the vector error correction model (VECM), was used to simultaneously incorporate both time series and account for their possible long-run relationship. Hypothesis tests and model diagnostics were performed to test for the long-run relationship and examine model goodness of fit. The 7-days-ahead forecast performance was measured by mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), with time-series cross-validation. The forecast performance was also compared with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model in the same cross-validation time frame. Based on different scenarios of the pandemic, the fitted model was leveraged to produce 60-days-ahead forecasts. RESULTS: The cross-correlations were uniformly high, falling between 0.7 and 0.8. There was sufficient evidence that the two time series have a stable long-run relationship at the .01 significance level. The model had very good fit to the data. The out-of-sample MAPE had a median of 5.9% and a 95th percentile of 13.4%. In comparison, the MAPE of the ARIMA had a median of 6.6% and a 95th percentile of 14.3%. Scenario-based 60-days-ahead forecasts exhibited concave trajectories with peaks lagging 2 to 3 weeks later than the peak infection incidence. In the worst-case scenario, the COVID-19 hospital census can reach a peak over 3 times greater than the peak observed during the second wave. CONCLUSIONS: When used in the VECM framework, the local COVID-19 infection incidence can be an effective leading indicator to predict the COVID-19 hospital census. The VECM model had a very good 7-days-ahead forecast performance and outperformed the traditional ARIMA model. Leveraging the relationship between the two time series, the model can produce realistic 60-days-ahead scenario-based projections, which can inform health care systems about the peak timing and volume of the hospital census for long-term planning purposes.","Nguyen, Hieu M; Turk, Philip J; McWilliams, Andrew D",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346897/; https://doi.org/10.2196/28195,397

The study examined the short-term trend in premature mortality burden from common causes of death in a suburban region between 1998 and 2003. METHODS: Years of life lost (YLL) per 1000 population and mortality rate per 100,000 population were calculated from medical death certificates, and broken down by cause of death, sex and year without age weighting but with a discounting rate of 3%. RESULTS: Non-communicable diseases contributed over 80% of all causes of YLL, with a slightly increasing trend. The combined rate for communicable, maternal, prenatal and nutritional deficiencies declined from 4.7 to 2.4 per 1000 population. Remarkably, declining trends in YLL were also seen for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, drug use and road traffic accidents, whereas increasing trends were seen for ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and liver cancer (males). The YLL rate for stroke, self-inflicted injuries, lung cancer and stomach cancer fluctuated over time.

610314,Mental Health and Burnout Syndrome Among Postgraduate Students in Medical and Multidisciplinary Residencies During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil: Protocol for a Prospective Cohort Study,2021-01-19,"In this discussion piece, eight scholars in geography, urban planning, and agri-food studies from the United States (US) and France engage in a bi-national comparison to deepen our collective understanding of food and land justice. We specifically contextualize land justice as a critical component of food justice in both the US and France in three key areas: access to land for cultivation, urban agriculture, and non-agricultural forms of food provisioning. The US and France are interesting cases to compare, considering the differences and similarities in their colonial and agricultural histories, persistent and systemic race and class-based inequities in land access, and the roles of public bodies and social movements. In this paper, we synthesize literature, share reflections, and offer directions for future scholarship, including a broader comparative research agenda. An important difference we found is in the degree of scholarly attention to race and how it mediates access to land. We also observe that few scholars articulate a clear definition of justice in their work, nor do they share a common justice framework. We hope that this paper contributes to a more robust food and land justice framework for the use of scholars, practitioners and activists.","Horst, Megan; McClintock, Nathan; Baysse-Lainé, Adrien; Darly, Ségolène; Paddeu, Flaminia; Perrin, Coline; Reynolds, Kristin; Soulard, Christophe-Toussaint",Agric Human Values,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716399/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-021-10202-4,397

DESIGN: Comparative utilization analysis. METHODS: We reviewed the eye care utilization patterns of a stratified random sample of 1,720 patients who were seen at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 30 to May 25, 2020). The odds of having a video, phone or in-person visit compared to having a deferred visit. Associations between independent variables and visit type were determined using a multinomial logistic regression model. RESULTS: Older patients had lower odds of having a video visit (p=0.007) and higher odds of having an in-person visit (p=0.023) compared to being deferred, and in the non-retina clinic sample, older patients still had a lower odds of a video visit (p-0.02). Non-white patients had lower odds of having an in-person visit (p<0.02) in the overall sample compared to being deferred, with a similar trend seen in the retina clinic. The mean neighborhood median household income was $76,200 (±$33,500) and varied significantly (p<0.0001) by race with Blacks having the lowest estimated mean income. CONCLUSION: Disparities exist in how patients accessed eye care during the COVID-19 pandemic with older patients – those for whom COVID 19 poses a higher risk of mortality – being more likely to be seen for in-person care. In our affluent participant sample, there was a trend towards non-white patients being less likely to access care. Reimbursing telemedicine solely through broadband internet connection may further exacerbate disparities in eye care.","Elam, Angela R.; Sidhom, David; Ugoh, Peter; Andrews, Chris A.; De Lott, Lindsey B.; Woodward, Maria A.; Lee, Paul P.; Newman-Casey, Paula Anne",Am J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34324852/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002939421003913; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002939421003913?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2021.07.024,397

Despite recent development of vaccines there is still many severe cases of COVID-19. Unfortunately there is still no standardised therapies and treatment of severe cases is very challenging. The aim of this study is to indicate if herbs administered alone or as a complementary therapy could be used as prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Over 85% of patients with COVID-19 in China used Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and a most common herb is Glycyrrhiza glabra, which in vitro inhibits replication of different enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses. Glycyrrhizin in vitro connects and changes conformation of ACE2 receptors, which are vital for SARS-CoV-2 penetration into host cells. Pelargonium sidoides show immunomodulatory and antiviral properties in clinical and in vitro studies, and it inhibits replication of HCo-229E coronavirus. Glycyrrhiza glabra in combination with standard therapies significantly reduces the hospitalization rate and occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms. As complementary therapies lianhuaqingwen capsules and jinhua qinggan granules reduces hospitalization rates, time to symptoms recovery and improve patient psychological comfort. In view of SARS-CoV-2 other herbs are not effective, e.g. maxingshigan–yinqiaosan, or therapeutic concentration would be impossible to achieve, e.g. ephedra herb, or there is simply no proper data. Therefore, Liquorice and Pelargonium sidoides are effective against coronaviruses and could be possibly used as prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19, while lianhuaqingwen capsules and jinhua qinggan granules can be useful as a complementary therapy to conventional treatment.","Gajewski, Aleksander; Kośmider, Anna; Nowacka, Aleksandra; Puk, Oskar; Wiciński, Michał",Biomed Pharmacother,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34507112/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221009343?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332221009343,397

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, and stress) in Bangladesh and the factors associated with these symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From 1 to 30 April 2020, we used a validated self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional study on 10,609 participants through an online survey platform. We assessed mental health status using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The total depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores were divided into normal, mild, moderate, severe, and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. FINDINGS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15%, 34%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 59% for severe anxiety symptoms, 14% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 14% for mild anxiety symptoms, while the prevalence for stress levels were 16% for severe stress level, 22% for moderate stress level, and 13% for mild stress level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild, moderate, and severe of the three mental health subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) were respondents who lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division, females, those who self-quarantined in the previous seven days before the survey, and those respondents who experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that about 64%, 87%, and 61% of the respondents in Bangladesh reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. There is a need for mental health support targeting women and those who self-quarantined or lived in Dhaka and Rangpur during the pandemic.","Abir, Tanvir; Kalimullah, Nazmul Ahsan; Osuagwu, Uchechukwu Levi; Nur–A Yazdani, Dewan Muhammad; Husain, Taha; Goson, Piwuna Christopher; Basak, Palash; Rahman, Md Adnan; Al Mamun, Abdullah; Permarupan, P.

L’atteinte du système endocrinien n’est pas encore bien élucidée. Nous présentons le cas d’une patiente qui a eu une insuffisance surrénalienne aiguë lors d’une infection au SARS-Cov2. Présentation clinique Une femme de 55 ans, diabétique type 2, hypertendue, dyslipidémique et coronarienne stentée, était admise à notre service pour une pneumonie modérée au SARS-Cov2. Elle n’avait pas d’histoire de malaise ni des vomissements ou des douleurs abdominales dans les derniers jours. L’examen physique révélait une fièvre chiffrée à 38,5°C et une polypnée.

612491,Chronic diseases in the geriatric population: morbidity and use of primary care services according to risk level,2021-04-26,"BACKGROUND: The results of studies on the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 have been conflicting and therefore further studies are needed. We aimed to examine the incidence of COVID-19 among patients at one of the largest oncology departments in Sweden, and to evaluate and identify risk factors for poor outcomes, hospital care and death, associated with COVID-19 among cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included cancer patients at a single center who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR either in hospital, primary health care center or commercial laboratory between 1 March and 14 August 2020. Clinical and demographic data were collected from the medical records. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables that associated the primary outcomes of need for hospital care and death within 30 days of positive test. RESULTS: Of 10,774 patients from the Department of Oncology at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 135 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (1.3%). Twenty-eight patients were excluded from further the data collection since they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Altogether, 107 cancer patients were included and the case fatality rate (CFR) was 12% (13) within 30 days of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR. Increasing years of age (OR 1.10; CI 95% 1.03-1.18), palliative treatment intent (OR 15.7; CI 95% 1.8-135.8), and transition to end-of-life care (OR 52.0; CI 95% 3.7-735.6) were associated with increased odds of death within 30 days. Male sex was associated with needing hospital care (OR 3.7; CI 95% 1.50-9.1). CONCLUSION: As in the general population, male sex was found to be at greater risk of needing hospital care for COVID-19, with terminal cancer disease, and older age increasing the odds of fatality. Compared to the general population, slightly more cancer patients had COVID-19. The CFR was within the lower range of others reported in cancer patients.","Bondeson, Lisa; Thulin, Anna; Ny, Lars; Levin, Max; Svensson, Johanna; Lindh, Magnus; Zhao, Zhiyuan",Acta Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34530692/; https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186x.2021.1973679,397

612715,COVID-19 Vaccination Perception and Attitude among Healthcare Workers in Egypt,2021-04-29,"Background Hospital healthcare workers (HCW), in particular those involved in the clinical care of COVID-19 cases, are presumably exposed to a higher risk of acquiring the disease than the general population. Methods Between April 16 and 30, 2020 we conducted a prospective, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study in HCWs in Southern Switzerland. Participants were hospital personnel with varying COVID-19 exposure risk depending on job function and working site. They provided personal information (including age, sex, occupation, and medical history) and self-reported COVID-19 symptoms. Odds ratio (OR) of seropositivity to IgG antibodies was estimated by univariate and multivariate logistic regressions. Findings Among 4726 participants, IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 9.6% of the HCWs. Seropositivity was higher among HCWs working on COVID-19 wards (14.1% (11.9–16.5)) compared to other hospital areas at medium (10.7% (7.6–14.6)) or low risk exposure (7.3% (6.4–8.3)). OR for high vs. medium wards risk exposure was 1.42 (0.91–2.22), P = 0.119, and 1.98 (1.55–2.53), P<0.001 for high vs. low wards risk exposure. The same was for true for doctors and nurses (10.1% (9.0–11.3)) compared to other employees at medium (7.1% (4.8–10.0)) or low risk exposure (6.6% (5.0–8.4)). OR for high vs. medium profession risk exposure was 1.37 (0.89–2.11), P = 0.149, and 1.75 (1.28–2.40), P = 0.001 for high vs. low profession risk exposure. Moreover, seropositivity was higher among HCWs who had household exposure to COVID-19 cases compared to those without (18.7% (15.3–22.5) vs. 7.7% (6.9–8.6), OR 2.80 (2.14–3.67), P<0.001). Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are detectable in up to 10% of HCWs from acute care hospitals in a region with high incidence of COVID-19 in the weeks preceding the study. HCWs with exposure to COVID-19 patients have only a slightly higher absolute risk of seropositivity compared to those without, suggesting that the use of PPE and other measures aiming at reducing nosocomial viral transmission are effective. Household contact with known COVID-19 cases represents the highest risk of seropositivity.

To detect most feline coronavirus field strains, the test was designed to amplify subgenomic mRNA of the highly conserved M gene. The test was applied to 1075 feline blood samples (424 from healthy, 651 from sick cats suspected of FIP) and returned 46% of the diseased cats as positive for feline coronavirus mRNA in their peripheral blood cells; of the healthy cats, 5% tested positive. Of a group of 81 animals in which FIP had been confirmed by post-mortem examination, 75 (93%) tested positive, whereas 17 cats with different pathologies (non-FIP cases) all tested negative.

This study examines whether neighborhood characteristics mediate AI/AN versus White-non-Hispanic Veteran COVID-19 infection disparities, and whether mediation differs based on proximity to reservations. METHODS: Using Veteran Health Administration’s (VHA) national database of VHA users evaluated for COVID-19 infection (3/1/2020–8/25/2020), we examined whether census tract neighborhood characteristics (percent households overcrowded, without complete plumbing, without kitchen plumbing, and neighborhood socioeconomic status [n-SES]) mediated racial disparities in COVID-19 infection, using inverse odds-weighted logistic models controlling for individual-level characteristics. Using moderated mediation analyses, we assessed whether neighborhood mediating effects on disparities differed for those residing in counties containing/near federally recognized tribal lands (i.e., Contract Health Service Delivery Area [CHSDA] counties) versus not. RESULTS: The percent of households without complete plumbing, percent without kitchen plumbing, and n-SES partially mediated AI/AN-White-non-Hispanic COVID-19 infection disparities (accounting for 17–35% of disparity) to a similar extent in CHSDA and non-CHSDA counties. The percent of households without kitchen plumbing had stronger mediating effects for CHSDA than non-CHSDA residents. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood-level social determinants of health may contribute to the disproportionate COVID-19 infection burden on AI/ANs; differences are exacerbated among AI/ANs living near reservations.","Wong, Michelle S.; Upchurch, Dawn M.; Steers, W.

However, in order to distinguish the difference between the measurement matrices, the CS imaging system needs to have a higher signal sampling accuracy. At the same time, affected by the noise of the light path and the circuit, the measurements finally obtained are noisy, which directly affects the imaging quality. We propose a dual-optical imaging system that uses the bidirectional reflection characteristics of digital micromirror devices (DMD) to simultaneously acquire CS measurements and images under the same viewing angle. Since deep neural networks have powerful modeling capabilities, we trained the filter network and the reconstruction network separately. The filter network is used to filter the noise in the measurements, and the reconstruction network is used to reconstruct the CS image. Experiments have proved that the method we proposed can filter the noise in the sampling process of the CS system, and can significantly improve the quality of image reconstruction under a variety of algorithms.","Li, Hongliang; Lu, Ke; Xue, Jian; Dai, Feng; Zhang, Yongdong",Sensors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577406/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186200,397

We conducted a population-based nationwide cross-sectional computer-assisted telephone survey of 1000 Polish adults (response rate 42%). The self-reported use of all recommended clinical preventive services was assessed, including mammography, colonoscopy, blood glucose screening, vaccination, blood pressure screening, and preventive counselling. The results showed that only 6.4% of adults had received all recommended preventive screening, whereas only 4.3% had received appropriate counselling. General practitioner (GP) visits, blood pressure screening, blood glucose screening, and cervical smear were among the most commonly provisioned interventions, while flu vaccination, PSA assessment, and preventive counselling were among the least prevalent services. Despite the low uptake of preventive interventions, over 75% is interested in remote access to preventive services using telemedicine platforms and e-consultations. Our findings suggest that there are significant gaps in the receipt of preventive interventions.

In this study we analyzed the occurrence of cholestatic liver injury and SSC, including clinical, serological, radiological and histopathological findings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single‐center analysis of all consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to severe COVID‐19 at the University Hospital Zurich to describe cholestatic injury in these patients. The findings were compared to a retrospective cohort of patients with severe influenza A RESULTS: 34 patients with severe COVID‐19 admitted to the ICU were included. 14 patients (41%) had no cholestasis (group 0), 11 patients (32%, group 1) developed mild and 9 patients (27%, group 2) severe cholestasis. Patients in group 2 had a more complicated disease course indicated by significantly longer ICU stay (median 51 days IQR 25‐86.5) than the other groups (group 0 median 9.5 days IQR 3.8‐18.3 p=0.001 and group 1 median 16 days IQR 8‐30 p< 0.05 respectively). Four patients in group 2 developed SSC compared to none in the influenza A cohort. The available histopathological findings suggest an ischemic damage to the perihilar bile ducts.

More than 10 million people have, at this writing, been infected by SAR-CoV-2 globally, and more than 500,000 have died of Covid-19. As our science progresses, it is becoming possible to apply the principles of population health science to help us better understand the pandemic. What does a formal approach to population health science teach us about Covid-19? Building on our previously published work about the foundations of population health, we offer a few observations—a first draft of population health science thinking—as it intersects with the Covid-19 pandemic. Of note, our collective understanding of the pathology and causes of Covid-19 are rapidly changing by the day, and thus we fully expect that this work will evolve and improve as science progresses.","Galea, Sandro; Keyes, Katherine",Am J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaa142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32666083/,397

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.","Saber-Ayad, Maha; Saleh, Mohamed A.; Abu-Gharbieh, Eman",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ph13050096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32423024/,397

METHODS: Complete postmortem examination was performed according to standard procedures in a regular autopsy suite using personal protective equipment including N95 masks, goggles and disposable gowns. The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: A 47-year-old man with a medical history of well controlled hypertension and dyslipidaemia died after long hours of transportation for medical care in a hospital in Lagos. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on ante- and postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs. Autopsy revealed pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and hypovolaemic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Autopsy can be performed on decedents who died from or with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a low resource environment such as ours. A standard autopsy room was used while deploying recommended infection prevention control and regular decontamination. The clinical details, autopsy findings such as diffuse alveolar damage and airway inflammation were consistent with a COVID-19 related pathology.

623458,"Physical activity and sedentary behaviors (screen time and homework) among overweight or obese adolescents: a cross-sectional observational study in Yazd, Iran",2021-09-23,"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been emerged as a rapidly spreading pandemic. The disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the acinar airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the acinar airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid to how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated droplets and aerosol particles. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Particle size distribution, breathing parameters supposing normal breathing through the nose, and viral loads were taken from the literature. We found that the probability of direct infection of the acinar airways due to inhalation of particles emitted by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of viruses deposited in the extrathoracic airways is about 7 times higher than in the acinar airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less dangerous. The period between the onset of initial symptoms and the potential clinical deterioration could provide an opportunity for prevention of pneumonia by blocking or significantly reducing the transport of viruses towards the acinar airways. Therefore, even non-specific treatment forms like disinfection of the throat and nasal and oral mucosa may effectively keep the viral load of the upper airways low enough to avoid or prolong the progression of the disease. In addition, using a tissue or cloth in order to absorb droplets and aerosol particles emitted by own coughs of infected patients before re-inhalation is highly recommended even if they are alone in quarantine.","Madas, Balázs G.; Füri, Péter; Farkas, Árpád; Nagy, Attila; Czitrovszky, Aladár; Balásházy, Imre; Schay, Gusztáv G.; Horváth, Alpár",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79985-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33384436/,397

The analyses described the time and geographical trends of nationwide admission rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular diseases, retinopathy, cataract, and diabetic foot amputation. METHODS AND FINDINGS The database of T2DM patients aged 15-100 years who were admitted between 2009 and 2016 under the UCS and that of the UCS population were retrieved for the analyses. The admitted cases of T2DM were extracted from the database using disease codes of principal and secondary diagnoses defined by the International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th Revisions. The T2DM admission rates in 2009-2016 were the number of admissions divided by the number of the UCS population. The standardized admission rates (SARs)were further estimated in contrast to the expected number of admissions considering age and sex composition of the UCS population in each region. A linearly increased trend was found in T2DM admission rates from 2009 to 2016. Female admission rates were persistently higher than that of males. In 2016, an increase in the T2DM admission rates was observed among the older ages relative to that in 2009. Although the SARs of T2DM were generally higher in Bangkok and central regions in 2009, except that with CKD and foot amputation which had higher trends in northeastern regions, the geographical inequalities were fairly reduced by 2016. CONCLUSION Admission rates of T2DM and its major complications increased in Thailand from 2009 to 2016. Although the overall geographical inequalities in the SARs of T2DM were reduced in the country, further efforts are required to improve the health system and policies focusing on risk factors and regions to manage the increasing T2DM.","Laowahutanon, Tanapat; Nakamura, Haruyo; Tachimori, Hisateru; Nomura, Shuhei; Liabsuetrakul, Tippawan; Lim, Apiradee; Rawdaree, Petch; Suchonwanich, Netnapis; Yamamoto, Hiroyuki; Ishizuka, Aya; Shibuya, Kenji; Miyata, Hiroaki; Chongsuvivatwong, Virasakdi",PloS one,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34197492/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253434,397

Indeed, this type of regulation is bidirectional between the virus and the host. While viral replication and gene expression are significantly impacted by histone modifications on the viral chromatin,(3) studies have shown that some viral pathogens dynamically manipulate cellular epigenetic factors to enhance their own survival and pathogenesis, as well as escape the immune system defense lines.(4) In this dynamic, histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) appear to play fundamental roles in the regulation of chromatin structure and recruitment of other factors.(5) Genuinely, those PTMs play a vital role in lytic infection, latency reinforcement, or, conversely, viral reactivation.(6) In this chapter, we will examine and review the involvement of histone modifications as well as their potential manipulation to control infections during various viral life cycle stages, highlighting their prospective implications in the clinical management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and other viral diseases. Targeting histone modifications is critical in setting the treatment of chronic viral infections with both lytic and latent stages (HIV, HCMV, HSV, RSV), virus-induced cancers (HBV, HCV, EBV, KSHV, HPV), and epidemic/emerging viruses (e.g. influenza virus, arboviruses).","Nehme, Zeina; Pasquereau, Sébastien; Herbein, Georges",Histone Modifications in Therapy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128164228000118; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128164228000118,397

However, specific diagnostic or therapeutic algorithms for CAC have not been established. In the current study, we analyzed coagulation abnormalities with point-of-care testing (POCT) and their relation to hemostatic complications in patients suffering from COVID-19 induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Our hypothesis was that specific diagnostic patterns can be identified in patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS at risk of thromboembolic complications utilizing POCT. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective observational study. Longitudinal data from 247 rotational thromboelastometries (Rotem®) and 165 impedance aggregometries (Multiplate®) were analysed in 18 patients consecutively admitted to the ICU with a COVID-19 induced ARDS between March 12th to June 30th, 2020. RESULTS: Median age was 61 years (IQR: 51–69). Median PaO(2)/FiO(2) on admission was 122 mmHg (IQR: 87–189), indicating moderate to severe ARDS. Any form of hemostatic complication occurred in 78 % of the patients with deep vein/arm thrombosis in 39 %, pulmonary embolism in 22 %, and major bleeding in 17 %. In Rotem® elevated A10 and maximum clot firmness (MCF) indicated higher clot strength. The delta between EXTEM A10 minus FIBTEM A10 (ΔA10) > 30 mm, depicting the sole platelet-part of clot firmness, was associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic events (OD: 3.7; 95 %CI 1.3–10.3; p = 0.02). Multiplate® aggregometry showed hypoactive platelet function. There was no correlation between single Rotem® and Multiplate® parameters at intensive care unit (ICU) admission and thromboembolic or bleeding complications.

Recent history involving SARS-like coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) have demonstrated the significant role of intermediate and reservoir hosts in viral maintenance and transmission cycles. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 natural infection and experimental infections of a wide variety of animal species has been demonstrated, and in silico and in vitro studies have indicated that deer are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are amongst the most abundant, densely populated, and geographically widespread wild ruminant species in the United States. Human interaction with white-tailed deer has resulted in the occurrence of disease in human populations in the past. Recently, white-tailed deer fawns were shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we investigated the susceptibility and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in adult white-tailed deer. In addition, we examined the competition of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates, representatives of the ancestral lineage A (SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA1/2020) and the alpha variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 (SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CA_CDC_5574/2020), through co-infection of white-tailed deer. Next-generation sequencing was used to determine the presence and transmission of each strain in the co-infected and contact sentinel animals. Our results demonstrate that adult white-tailed deer are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can transmit the virus through direct contact as well as vertically from doe to fetus. Additionally, we determined that the alpha VOC B.1.1.7 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 outcompetes the ancestral lineage A isolate in white-tailed deer, as demonstrated by the genome of the virus shed from nasal and oral cavities from principal infected and contact animals, and from virus present in tissues of principal infected deer, fetuses and contact animals.","Cool, Konner; Gaudreault, Natasha N.; Morozov, Igor; Trujillo, Jessie D.; Meekins, David A.; McDowell, Chester; Carossino, Mariano; Bold, Dashzeveg; Kwon, Taeyong; Balaraman, Velmurugan; Madden, Daniel W.; Artiaga, Bianca Libanori; Pogranichniy, Roman M.; Sosa, Gleyder Roman; Henningson, Jamie; Wilson, William C.; Balasuriya, Udeni B.

While we must be vigilant about preventing unnecessary deaths caused by coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes, some deaths of our elders are inevitable. Thus, it is essential that advanced care planning occurs in a way that upholds the familial and relational aspects of elders’ lives that often matter to them the most. We invoke concepts from feminist ethicists like Hilde Lindemann and Eva Kittay and introduce Avery Weisman and Thomas Hackett’s concept of “appropriate death” to suggest better ways of planning for those deaths of our elderly that cannot be avoided.

633060,The mental health crises of the families of COVID-19 victims: a qualitative study,2021-05-15,"COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It has become a global pandemic and its frequent mutations may pose new challenges for vaccine design. During viral infection, the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds the human host cell receptor ACE2, enabling the virus to enter the host cell. Both the Spike and ACE2 are densely glycosylated, and it is unclear how distinctive glycan types may modulate the interaction of RBD and ACE2. Detailed understanding of these determinants is key for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. To this end, we perform extensive all-atom simulations of the (i) RBD-ACE2 complex without glycans, (ii) RBD-ACE2 with oligomannose MAN9 glycans in ACE2, and (iii) RBD-ACE2 with complex FA2 glycans in ACE2. These simulations identify the key residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface that form contacts with higher probabilities, thus providing a quantitative evaluation that complements recent structural studies. Notably, we find that this RBD-ACE2 contact signature is not altered by the presence of different glycoforms, suggesting that RBD-ACE2 interaction is robust. Applying our simulated results, we illustrate how the recently prevalent N501Y mutation may alter specific interactions with host ACE2 that facilitate the virus-host binding. Furthermore, our simulations reveal how the glycan on Asn90 of ACE2 can play a distinct role in the binding and unbinding of RBD. Finally, an energetics analysis shows that MAN9 glycans on ACE2 decrease RBD-ACE2 affinity, while FA2 glycans lead to enhanced binding of the complex. Together, our results provide a more comprehensive picture of the detailed interplay between virus and human receptor, which is much needed for the discovery of effective treatments that aim at modulating the physical-chemical properties of this virus.","Nguyen, Kien; Chakraborty, Srirupa; Mansbach, Rachael A.; Korber, Bette; Gnanakaran, Sandrasegaram",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067878/,397

These data include elevated D-dimers observed among many COVID-19 patients. We present a retrospective analysis of admission D-dimer, and D-dimer trends, among 1065 adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients, across 6 New York Hospitals. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were intubation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Three-hundred-thirteen patients (29.4%) died, 319 (30.0%) required intubation, and 30 (2.8%) had diagnosed VTE. Using Cox proportional-hazard modeling, each 1 μg/ml increase in admission D-dimer level was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.06 (95%CI 1.04–1.08, p < 0.0001) for death, 1.08 (95%CI 1.06–1.10, p < 0.0001) for intubation, and 1.08 (95%CI 1.03–1.13, p = 0.0087) for VTE.

Design: Cross-sectional web-based survey. Setting: Responses were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic between April 27th and July 13th. Participants: 398 LGBTQ+ respondents forming an analytical sample of 310 in the main models. Methods: We used a combined measure of gender identity or expression and sexual orientation as the main explanatory variable. We assessed mental health with the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10). We measured experiences of discrimination with a battery of questions that asked respondents whether they had experienced a set of discriminatory experiences because of their LGBTQ+ identity during the coronavirus pandemic. Experiences of discrimination was considered a mediating factor and examined both as an outcome as well as an explanatory variable. Models were adjusted for a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. Results: The prevalence of depression and stress were both high, with the majority of the sample exhibiting significant depressive symptomology (69%). Around one-in-six respondents reported some form of discrimination since the start of the pandemic because they were LGBTQ+ (16.7%). In regression models, the average score for perceived stress increased by 1.44 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.517-2.354) for those who had experienced an instance of homophobic or transphobic harassment, compared to respondents who had not. Similarly, the odds of exhibiting significant depressive symptomology (CES-D-10 scores of 10 or more) increased three-fold among those who had experienced harassment based on their gender or sexuality compared to those who had not (OR: 3.251; 95% CI: 1.168-9.052). These marked associations remained after adjustment for a number of socioeconomic and demographic covariates. Cis-female respondents who identify as gay or lesbian had the lowest scores for perceived social or depressive symptoms; conversely transgender and gender diverse individuals had the highest scores. Conclusions: We found high levels of stress and depressive symptoms, particularly among younger and transgender and gender diverse respondents. These associations were partially explained by experiences of discrimination which had a large, consistent and pernicious impact on stress and mental health.","Kneale, Dylan; Becares, Laia",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.03.20167403v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167403,397

METHOD: Country selection was based on the poor AFP performance indicators i.e. Non polio AFP rate and stool adequacy. It was recommended that any country not meeting the required indicators should consider environmental surveillance activity as an additional tool to support AFP surveillance. The sites selection considered proximity to the target population, the size of the population to be sampled and the sensitivity of the sampling site. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty three sites have been established in Africa since 2011. In 2011, Nigeria was first country to introduce environmental surveillance and currently with of 59 validated sites, followed by Kenya in 2013 validating and sampling 9 sites and Angola 4 active sites in 2014. In 2014, Cameroon introduced ES and 31 sites followed by Niger with 9 sites and Madagascar with 23 sites. Later in the same year, Chad introduced ES activity and 4 active sites were selected. In 2015 Senegal introduced 3 sites, Guinea and Burkina Faso introduced 4 sites each., and. In 2016, a total of 179 Sabins, 36 Sabin 2s, 196 non polio enteroviruses (NPEV) and 1 vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV) were reported in Nigeria. Cameroon and Chad isolated 14 and 4 Sabins and 72 and 40 NPEV respectively. In Madagascar a total of 39 Sabins, 11 Sabin 2s and 277 NPEV were isolated. In other countries a majority of NPEV were isolated (data not shown).

The present study explores the prevalence of insomnia and Internet addiction amidst the pandemic while staying at home. METHODOLOGY: Data have been collected from 585 individuals of both sexes online through social media using a structured questionnaire that consists of insomnia severity and Internet addiction. Chi square and logistic regression analysis were done to associate the insomnia severity with Internet use behavior and addiction. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of insomnia and subthreshold (mild) insomnia are 12.13% and 31.97%, respectively, with females had insomnia more than males. Internet addiction correlates with insomnia as staying online more than initially intended increases insomnia significantly. CONCLUSION: COVID 19 pandemic lockdown affects sleep health as sleep-related disorders are on the rise, which could correlate to mental health. The study further seeks attention from researchers, health experts, and related stakeholders to develop a more holistic approach to uncover the problems and promote sleeping awareness.","Meitei, Sanjenbam Yaiphaba; Pao, P.

Brazil is now the second most affected country globally. Faced with this scenario, various public health measures and changes in the daily routines of hospitals were implemented to stop the pandemic. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 as they present with two major diseases: cancer and concomitant chronic liver disease. The COVID-19 pandemic can significantly impact the management of HCC patients from diagnosis to treatment strategies. These patients need special attention and assistance at this time, especially since treatment for tumors cannot be delayed in most cases. The aim of this guideline was to standardize the management of HCC patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

635481,Epilepsy care and COVID‐19: A cross‐sectional online survey from Lithuania,2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic occurred and rapidly spread around the world. Some online dashboards have included essential features on a world map. However, only transforming data into visualizations for countries/regions is insufficient for the public need. This study aims to (1) develop an algorithm for classifying countries/regions into four quadrants inn GSM and (2) design an app for a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation. METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19 outbreak numbers daily from the Github website, including 189 countries/regions. A four-quadrant diagram was applied to present the classification of each country/region using Google Maps run on dashboards. A novel presentation scheme was used to identify the most struck entities by observing (1) the multiply infection rate (MIR) and (2) the growth trend in the recent 7 days. Four clusters of the COVID-19 outbreak were dynamically classified. An app based on a dashboard aimed at public understanding of the outbreak types and visualizing of the COVID-19 pandemic with Google Maps run on dashboards. The absolute advantage coefficient (AAC) was used to measure the damage hit by COVID-19 referred to the next two countries severely hit by COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that the two hypotheses were supported: India (i) is in the increasing status as of April 28, 2021; (ii) has a substantially higher ACC(= 0.81 > 0.70), and (iii) has a substantially higher ACC(= 0.66 < 0.70) as of May 17, 2021. CONCLUSION: Four clusters of the COVID-19 outbreak were dynamically classified online on an app making the public understand the outbreak types of COVID-19 pandemic shown on dashboards. The app with GSM and AAC is recommended for researchers in other disease outbreaks, not just limited to COVID-19.

635581,Impact of personal protective equipment use on health care workers physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-02-05,"Objectives: As of 11 Feb 2020, a total of 1,716 medical staff infected with laboratory-confirmed the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) in China had been reported. The predominant cause of the infection among medical staff remains unclear. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of infected medical staff. Methods: Medical staff who infected with SARS-Cov-2 and admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan to 25 Feb, 2020 were included in this single-centered, retrospective study. Data were compared by occupation and analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods. Results: A total of 101 medical staff (32 males and 69 females; median age: 33) were included in this study and 74.3% were nurses. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (3%) as well as patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in fever clinics (15%) and isolation wards (3%). 80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 33% had lymphocytopenia. Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (62%), septal/subpleural (77%) and groundglass opacities (48%). The major differences between doctors and nurses manifested in laboratory indicators. As of the last observed date, no patient was transferred to intensive care unit or died. Fever (HR=0.57; 95% CI 0.36-0.90) and IL-6 levels greater than 2.9 pg/ml (HR=0.50; 95% CI 0.30-0.86) were unfavorable factors for discharge. Conclusions: Our findings suggested that the infection of medical staff mainly occurred at the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Wuhan, and only a small proportion of infection had an exact mode. Meanwhile, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course than ordinary patients, which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. The potential risk factors of fever and IL-6 levels greater than 2.9 pg/ml could help to identify medical staff with poor prognosis at an early stage.","Liu, Jie; Ouyang, Liu; Yang, Dan; Han, Xiaoyu; Cao, Yukun; Alwalid, Osamah; Wu, Hanping; Shi, Heshui; Yang, Fan; Zheng, Chuansheng",Int J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33628107/; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.54257,397

The COVID-19 pandemic has laid these problems bare. This article examines the construction of the three main cross-national indicators of pandemic preparedness: a database with self-reported data by governments, external evaluations organised by the WHO and a global ranking known as the Global Health Security Index. Each of these presents a different model of collecting evidence and organising knowledge: the collation of self-reports by national authorities; the coordination of evaluation by an epistemic community authorised by an intergovernmental organisation and on the basis of a strict template; and the cobbling together of different sources into a common indicator by a transnational multi-stakeholder initiative. We posit that these models represent different ways of creating knowledge to inform policy choices, and each has different forms of potential bias. In turn, this shapes how policymakers understand what is ‘best practice’ and appropriate policy in pandemic preparedness.","Kentikelenis, Alexander; Seabrooke, Leonard",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429299/,397
637286,"Factors Associated With Burnout, Post-traumatic Stress and Anxio-Depressive Symptoms in Healthcare Workers 3 Months Into the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Observational Study",2021-07-08,"Background Social distancing measures, including school closures, are being used to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission in many countries. Once ""lockdown"" has driven incidence to low levels, selected activities are being permitted. Re-opening schools is a priority because of the welfare and educational impact of closures on children. However, the impact of school re-opening needs to be considered within the context of other measures. Methods We use social contact data from the UK to predict the impact of social distancing policies on the reproduction number. We calibrate our tool to the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK using publicly available death data and Google Community Mobility Reports. We focus on the impact of re-opening schools against a back-drop of wider social distancing easing. Results We demonstrate that pre-collected social contact data, combined with incidence data and Google Community Mobility Reports, is able to provide a time-varying estimate of the reproduction number (R). From an pre-control setting when R=2.7 (95%CI 2.5, 2.9), we estimate that the minimum reproduction number that can be achieved in the UK without limiting household contacts is 0.45 (95%CI:0.41-0.50); in the absence of other changes, preventing leisure contacts has a smaller impact (R=2.0,95%CI:1.8-2.4) than preventing work contacts (R=1.5,95%CI:1.4-1.7). We find that following lockdown (when R=0.7 (95% CI 0.6, 0.8)), opening primary schools in isolation has a modest impact on transmission R=0.83 (95%CI:0.77-0.90) but that high adherence to other measures is needed. Opening secondary schools as well as primary school is predicted to have a larger overall impact (R=0.95,95%CI:0.85-1.07), however transmission could still be controlled with effective contact tracing. Conclusions Our findings suggest that primary school children can return to school without compromising transmission, however other measures, such as social distancing and contract tracing, are required to control transmission if all age groups are to return to school. Our tool provides a mapping from policies to the reproduction number and can be used by policymakers to compare the impact of social-easing measures, dissect mitigation strategies and support careful localized control strategies.","Brooks-Pollock, E.; Read, J.

Here, we present the case of a 39-year-old otherwise healthy male who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) and developed severe SE and pneumomediastinum which resulted in a fatal outcome. Although the exact pathogenesis could not be determined, the extensive lung injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia along with possible barotrauma secondary to NIMV could have been the culprits in this case. Early detection through careful observation of these potentially fatal complications in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 is crucial.

Research focusing on the psychological aspect of human financial behavior and well-being is scarce, focusing more on the cognitive side such as financial literacy and numeracy. The aim of this research study is to find the role played by the non-cognitive factors such as self-esteem, self-control, optimism and deliberative thinking, in forming the financial behavior and financial well-being of the young adults. A sample of 429 university students from public and private sector was collected via an online and field survey using purposive sampling technique. The survey contained measures for demographics, self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking, self-control, general financial behavior and financial well-being. SPSS and PLS-SEM tools were used for the exploration of the relationships among dependent and independent variables. The results of PLS path analysis demonstrate that among the non-cognitive factors, self-control and deliberative thinking show a significant association with both financial behavior, and financial security. Self-esteem plays no significant role in forming the financial behavior of the young adults when all the variables are taken together but it exhibits a significant association with financial well-being (financial security and financial anxiety). Optimism on the other hand exhibits no significant association with both financial behavior and financial well-being (financial security and financial anxiety). The results of this study complement the previous studies and also put forth new outcomes. This research is unique as it is the first of its kind conducted in a consumption-oriented economy like Pakistan. In addition to the previous studies which have often established the link of self-esteem with general well-being, this study goes further by analyzing the association between self-esteem and financial well-being and by the identification of the role played by non-cognitive factors like self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking and self-control together on the financial behavior and financial well-being of the individuals using PLS-SEM approach.","Hashmi, Fatima; Aftab, Hira; Martins, José Moleiro; Nuno Mata, Mário; Qureshi, Hamza Ahmad; Abreu, António; Mata, Pedro Neves",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34492043/,397

Although the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is respiratory involvement, there is evidence suggesting the neuroinvasive potential of COVID-19. There are limited reports of neurological complications of COVID-19 infection in the literature. Herein, we aim to describe 2 members of a family affected by COVID-19, presenting with ascending paresthesia with the final diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old man presented with a history of ascending paresthesia and bilateral facial droop since 5 days before admission. The medical history was positive for flu-like symptoms affecting all the members of his family. The neurological examination was notable for bilateral peripheral facial paralysis, generalized areflexia, and derceased sensation in distal limbs. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed an albuminocytologic dissociation. In addition, the electromyography-nerve conduction study findings were suggestive of acute axonal-demyelinating polyneuropathy. Meanwhile the patient was treated with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome, his 14-year-old daughter presented with a history of progressive paresthesia and weakness. Similar to her father, the paraclinical evaluations were consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Taking into account clinical findings and the outbreak of COVID-19, the suspicion of COVID-19 was proposed. Eventually, on the basis of throat swab samples stand on polymerase chain reaction, the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our cases revealed the familial occurrence of Guillain-Barré syndrome after COVID-19 infection.

The uncontrolled release of cytokines is seen from the primary stages of symptoms to last acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, it is necessary to find out safe and effective drugs against this deadly coronavirus as soon as possible. Here, we downloaded the three-dimensional model of NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase (PDB-ID: 6w6l) and main protease (PDB-ID: 6lu7) of COVID-19. Using these molecular models, we performed virtual screening with our anti-viral, inti-infectious, and anti-protease compounds, which are attractive therapeutics to prevent infection of the COVID-19. We found that top screened compound binds with protein molecules with good dock score with the help of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. We observed that protease complexed with Cyclocytidine hydrochloride (anti-viral and anti-cancer), Trifluridine (anti-viral), Adonitol, and Meropenem (anti-bacterial), and Penciclovir (anti-viral) bound with a good docking score ranging from −6.8 to −5.1 (Kcal/mol). Further, NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase complexed with Telbivudine, Oxytetracycline dihydrate (anti-viral), Methylgallate (anti-malarial), 2-deoxyglucose and Daphnetin (anti-cancer) from the docking score of −7.0 to −5.7 (Kcal/mol). In conclusion, the selected compounds may be used as a novel therapeutic agent to combat this deadly pandemic disease, SARS-CoV-2 infection, but needs further experimental research. HIGHLIGHTS: NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase and main protease complex of SARS CoV-2 bind with selected drugs.

This study aimed to investigate the anti-obesity effect of Polygalin C (PC) isolated from Polygala japonica Houtt. in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Based on Oil Red O assay results, PC significantly decreased lipid accumulation compared to the control. We found that PC suppressed adipogenesis transcription factors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR γ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α, and lipogenic factors such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP 1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Moreover, PC inhibited the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells by regulating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/protein kinase B (MAPK/Akt) signaling pathways. Additionally, we confirmed that PC inhibited early adipogenesis factors C/EBP β and C/EBP δ. Therefore, PC inhibited adipogenesis and lipogenesis in vitro. Thus, PC appears to exert potential therapeutic effects on obesity by suppressing lipid metabolism.","Jee, Wona; Lee, Seung-Hyeon; Ko, Hyun Min; Jung, Ji Hoon; Chung, Won-Seok; Jang, Hyeung-Jin",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms221910405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34638751/,397
639021,The effects of wearing facemasks on oxygenation and ventilation at rest and during physical activity,2021-02-24,"BACKGROUND: An association between IL-6 levels and cytokine storm syndrome in COVID-19 patients has been suggested. Cases with higher IL-6 levels have more rapid progression and a higher complication rate. On the other hand, COVID-19 cases with anosmia have a milder course of the disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between serum IL-6 levels and presence of anosmia in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 based on laboratory (PCR) were stratified into two groups based on presence of olfactory dysfunction (OD). In all cases with and without anosmia; psychophysical test (Sniffin' Sticks test) and a survey on olfactory symptoms were obtained. Threshold (t) – discrimination (d) – identification (i), and total (TDI) scores reflecting olfactory function were calculated. Clinical symptoms, serum IL-6 levels, other laboratory parameters, and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were included, comprising 23 patients with anosmia and 36 patients without OD based on TDI scores. Patients with anosmia (41.39 ± 15.04) were significantly younger compared to cases without anosmia (52.19 ± 18.50). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of comorbidities, smoking history, and symptoms including nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. Although serum IL-6 levels of all patients were above normal values (7 pg/mL), patients with anosmia had significantly lower serum IL-6 levels (16.72 ± 14.28 pg/ml) compared to patients without OD (60.95 ± 89.33 pg/ml) (p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 related anosmia tend to have significantly lower serum levels of IL-6 compared to patients without OD, and the lower IL-6 levels is related to milder course of the disease. With the effect of low cytokine storm and IL-6 level, it may be said that anosmic cases have a milder disease in COVID-19.","Sanli, Deniz Esin Tekcan; Altundag, Aytug; Kandemirli, Sedat Giray; Yildirim, Duzgun; Sanli, Ahmet Necati; Saatci, Ozlem; Kirisoglu, Ceyda Erel; Dikensoy, Oner; Murrja, Edvin; Yesil, Atakan; Bastan, Serdar; Karsidag, Tamer; Akinci, Ibrahim Ozkan; Ozkok, Sezen; Yilmaz, Eren; Tuzuner, Filiz; Kilercik, Meltem; Ljama, Taner",Am J Otolaryngol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196070920304907; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33152573/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196070920304907?v=s5,397
639387,Analysis of the factors affecting the adoption and compliance of the NHS COVID-19 mobile application: a national cross-sectional survey in England,2021-08-13,"BACKGROUND: Annually recurring optometric screening helps to identify children with increased axial growth and also to create awareness for wearing properly corrected glasses and for spending enough time outdoors, both of which are crucial for healthy eyes. The obtained biometric data help to expand the epidemiological information on myopia in schoolchildren, which is fundamental for the selection of the correct treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Contact-free biometry of the eye was used to assess central corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness and axial length. Central choroidal thickness was manually assessed using optical coherence tomography (OCT). In addition, the mesopic and photopic pupil sizes were measured. RESULTS: Biometric data were obtained from 257 (mean age 11.2 ± 1.1 years, 31.9% female, n = 82, 68.1% male, n = 175) out of a total of 274 examined children. Mean corneal radius (mean ± SD, female/male) was 7.74 ± 0.23 mm/7.89 ± 0.22 mm, central corneal thickness was 556.80 ± 31.31 µm/565.68 ± 33.12 µm, anterior chamber depth was 3.62 ± 0.28 mm/3.71 ± 0.25 mm, lens thickness was 3.48 ± 0.18 mm/3.46 ± 0.17 mm and axial length was 23.03 ± 0.88 mm/23.51 ± 0.88 mm. Choroidal thickness was assessed in 240 children and was 335.12 ± 60.5 µm. Mesopic and photopic pupil sizes were 6.38 ± 0.70 mm and 3.11 ± 0.63 mm, respectively. CONCLUSION: The axial lengths found are consistent with the normal values for European children. A difference between male and female eyes could be observed. The repetition of these examinations in the future will enable the generation of growth charts.","Kaymak, Hakan; Neller, Kai; Graff, Birte; Körgesaar, Kristina; Langenbucher, Achim; Seitz, Berthold; Schwahn, Hartmut",Ophthalmologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114061/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00347-021-01427-z,397
640433,Prevalence of cheilitis in Health care workers managing COVID-19 patients,2020-07-16,"BACKGROUND: Health professionals are key personnel to containing infectious diseases like COVID-19. In the face of long work shifts (that reach 16 h per day on average), the risk of getting infected by a high-infectious disease and the lack of enough biological protection measures, mental suffering among health professionals suddenly became evident. METHOD: We carried out an updated meta-analysis to investigate the psychiatric impacts on health professionals in the face of the physical and psychological conditions to which they are subjected due to the high demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Papers were researched in four databases from December 2019 to April 2020. In total, eight papers were included in the study. RESULTS: Health professionals working to fight COVID-19 are being more severely affected by psychiatric disorders associated with depression, anxiety, distress and insomnia, stress, and indirect traumatization than other occupational groups. No significant differences were observed in the publication bias. CONCLUSION: There is a strong association between health professionals and COVID-19 in terms of psychiatric repercussions. Our meta-analysis showed that health professionals have a higher level of indirect traumatization, in which the level of damage exceeds psychological and emotional tolerance and indirectly results in psychological abnormalities. The incidence of obsessive-compulsive traces and somatizations was higher in situations involving front-line professionals.","da Silva, Flaviane Cristine Troglio; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110057; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278584620303730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32777327/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584620303730?v=s5,397

641978,Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms Among People Under Quarantine During the COVID-19 Epidemic in China: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021-02-15,"In the late stages of an epidemic, infections are often sporadic and geographically distributed. Spatially structured stochastic models can capture these important features of disease dynamics, thereby allowing a broader exploration of interventions. Here we develop a stochastic model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission amongst an interconnected group of population centres representing counties, municipalities and districts (collectively, ``counties''). The model is parameterized with demographic, epidemiological, testing, and travel data from the province of Ontario, Canada. We explore the effects of different control strategies after the epidemic curve has been flattened. We compare a local strategy of re-opening (and re-closing, as needed) schools and workplaces county-by-county according to triggers for county-specific infection prevalence, to a global strategy of province-wide re-opening and re-closing according to triggers for province-wide infection prevalence. We find that the local strategy results in far fewer person-days of closure but only slightly more coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases, even under assumptions of high inter-county travel. However, both cases and person-days lost to closure rise significantly when county triggers are not coordinated by the province and when testing rates vary among counties. Finally, we show that local strategies can also do better in the early epidemic stage but only if testing rates are high and the trigger prevalence is low. Our results suggest that phased plans for re-opening economies on the far side of the COVID-19 epidemic curve should consider preceding larger-scale re-openings with coordinated local re-openings.","Karatayev, V.; Anand, M.; Bauch, C.

Understanding the demographic and clinical features of influenza‐like illness (ILI) presenting to primary care in urban Vietnam is vital to understand these transmission dynamics. METHODS: An observational study of patients with ILI in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, was conducted between August 2013 and November 2015 in a mix of public and private primary care settings. Molecular testing for influenza A and influenza B and 12 other respiratory viruses was performed. RESULTS: A total of 1152 ILI patients were recruited. 322 and 136 subjects tested positive for influenza A and influenza B, respectively. 193 subjects tested positive for another respiratory virus; most commonly rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus 3. Influenza was detected in 81% of the 116 study weeks. Three peaks of influenza activity were detected; an H3N2 peak April‐June 2014, an influenza B peak July‐December 2014, and a mixed H3N2 and H1N1 peak March‐September 2015. Subjects recruited from private clinics were more likely to have higher income and to have reported previous influenza vaccination. Antibiotic use was common (50.3%) despite limited evidence of bacterial infection. CONCLUSION: Influenza in southern Vietnam has complex transmission dynamics including periods of intense influenza activity of alternating types and subtypes. Broadening surveillance from hospital to the community in tropical settings is feasible and a valuable for improving our understanding of the global spread and evolution of the virus.","Todd, Stacy; Huong, Nguyen Thi Cam; Thanh, Nguyen Thi Le; Vy, Nguyen Ha Thao; Hung, Nguyen Thanh; Thao, Tran Thi Nhu; Phuong, Huynh Thi; van Doorn, Rogier; Hang, Vu Thi Ty; Chau, Nguyen Van Vinh; Read, Jonathan M.; Lalloo, David G.; Boni, Maciej F.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29858879/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12574,397

To handle this challenge, one of the foremost problems is the models’ excessive dependence on the low-level attributes used to train them, which reduces the models’ portability. To solve this issue, the use of high-level attributes with more semantic meaning, such as ontologies, may be very useful. Along this line, we propose the utilization of an ontology that uses a taxonomy of actions that summarises students’ interactions with the Moodle learning management system. We compare the results of this proposed approach against our previous results when we used low-level raw attributes obtained directly from Moodle logs. The results indicate that the use of the proposed ontology improves the portability of the models in terms of predictive accuracy. The main contribution of this paper is to show that the ontological models obtained in one source course can be applied to other different target courses with similar usage levels without losing prediction accuracy.","López-Zambrano, Javier; Lara, Juan A.; Romero, Cristóbal",J Comput High Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776379/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12528-021-09273-3,397

643799,Longitudinal assessment of mental health and well-being in patients being treated with medications for opioid use disorder in primary care,2021-04-23,"Abstract Transfer of functional blood IgG1 to the gastrointestinal tract was measured in neonatal calves. Radiolabelled immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anti-DNP antibody was administered to 2 day old calves by intravenous injection. The serum clearance rate was measured and was compared to the rate of protein-bound 125I excretion in the feces over a 10 day period to determine the importance of transfer to the gastrointestinal tract as a mechanism of serum IgG1 clearance. The amount of protein-bound and DNP-binding 125I present in the gastrointestinal tract of 10 day old calves at necropsy was also measured. Fecal excretion of protein-bound 125I accounted for 32% of the serum 125I-IgG1 clearance. Protein-bound 125I was present in the gastrointestinal tract at necropsy in amounts estimated to account for 68% of the total 125I-IgG1 clearance, and retained 65% of the DNP-binding ability of the original antibody. The discrepancy between the fecal excretion (32% of total IgG1 clearance) and the GI clearance estimated from protein-bound 125I in the gut (68% of total IgG1 clearance) is explained in part by IgG1 proteolysis occurring after transfer to the gastrointestinal tract but before fecal excretion. These results indicate that transfer to the calf gastrointestinal tract accounts for most IgG1 clearance in young calves, and that the intestinal antibody retains antigen binding function and may contribute to intestinal immunity.","Besser, T.

An effective, feasible way is to use the pre-existing ΔORF6 mutant of SARS-CoV as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, since both lack the moiety responsible for interferon antagonistic effects. By analyzing temporal profiles of upregulated genes in ΔORF6-infected Calu-3 cells, we prioritized 55 genes and 238 ligands to reposition currently available medications for COVID-19 therapy. Eight of them are already in clinical trials. Of particular importance is the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1 that have not been used in COVID-19 treatment.

New drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are in urgent need. Considering the long development time for new drugs, the identification of promising inhibitors from FDA-approved drugs is an imperative and valuable strategy. Recent studies have shown that the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the receptor to infect human cells. METHODS: We combined molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to identify potential inhibitors for ACE2 from available commercial medicines. We also designed coronavirus pseudoparticles that contain the spike protein assembled onto green fluorescent protein or luciferase reporter gene-carrying vesicular stomatitis virus core particles. RESULTS: We found that thymoquinone, a phytochemical compound obtained from the plant Nigella sativa, is a potential drug candidate. SPR analysis confirmed the binding of thymoquinone to ACE2. We found that thymoquinone can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and NL63 pseudoparticles infecting HEK293-ACE2 cells, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 4.999, 7.598, and 6.019 μM, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle inhibition had half-maximal cytotoxic concentration of 35.100 μM and selection index = 7.020.

646300,Preventing and Addressing the Stress Reactions of Health Care Workers Caring for Patients With COVID-19: Development of a Digital Platform (Be + Against COVID),2020-10-05,"BACKGROUND: The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to deliver mental health and addictions (MHA) services is a global priority, especially considering the urgent shift towards virtual delivery of care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to monitor the evolving role of technology in MHA services. Given that MHA policy documents represent the highest level of priorities for a government’s vision and strategy for mental health care, one starting point is to measure the frequency with which technology is mentioned and the terms used to describe its use in MHA policy documents (before, during, and after COVID-19). Yet, to our knowledge, no such review of the extent to which ICTs are referred to in Canadian MHA policy documents exists to date. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic policy review was to examine the extent to which technology is addressed in Canadian government–based MHA policy documents prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to establish a baseline for documenting change. METHODS: We reviewed 22 government-based MHA policy documents, published between 2011 and 2019 by 13 Canadian provinces and territories. We conducted content analysis to synthesize the policy priorities addressed in these documents into key themes, and then systematically searched for and tabulated the use of 39 technology-related keywords (in English and French) to describe and compare jurisdictions. RESULTS: Technology was addressed in every document, however, to a varying degree. Of the 39 searched keywords, we identified 22 categories of keywords pertaining to the use of technology to deliver MHA services and information. The 6 most common categories were tele (n=16/22), phone (n=12/22), tech (n=11/22), online (n=10/22), line (n=10/22), and web (n=10/22), with n being the number of policy documents in which the category was mentioned out of 22 documents. The use of terms referring to advanced technologies, such as virtual (n=6/22) and app (n= 4/22), were less frequent. Additionally, policy documents from some provinces and territories (eg, Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador) mentioned a diverse range of ICTs, whereas others described only 1 form of ICT. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that technology has been given limited strategic attention in Canadian MHA policy. Policy makers may have limited knowledge on the evidence and potential of using technology in this field, highlighting the value for knowledge translation and collaborative initiatives among policy makers and researchers. The development of a pan-Canadian framework for action addressing the integration and coordination of technology in mental health services can also guide initiatives in this field. Our findings provide a prepandemic baseline and replicable methods to monitor how the use of technology-supported services and innovations emerge relative to other priorities in MHA policy during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lal, Shalini; Siafa, Lyna; Lee, Hajin; Adair, Carol E",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/25547; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33949955/,397

The emergence of prion disease in this species made it prudent to assess the probability of entry of the pathogen into the United Kingdom (UK) from this region. Potentially contaminated products were identified as evidenced by other prion diseases. The aggregated probability of entry of the pathogen was estimated as very high and high for legal milk and cheese imports respectively and very high, high and high for illegal meat, milk and cheese products respectively. This aggregated probability represents a qualitative assessment of the probability of one or more entry events per year into the UK; it gives no indication of the number of entry events per year.

This study explored the lived experiences and perceptions of adolescents who have a brother or a sister with a diagnosis of ASD using semi-structured interviews. Using thematic analysis, the participants reported having difficulties communicating with their siblings. Feeling a mixture of emotions was common when interacting with their siblings with ASD and emotional self-regulation was a typical coping strategy utilized by these adolescents. Despite the challenges, having a sibling with ASD led to closer relationships between the siblings. These findings offer insights into these adolescents’ needs and how they may be best supported, informing the practice of speech-language pathology and other health professions.","Chu, Shin Ying; Kassim, Siti Nur Zafirah binti; Gan, Chun Hong; Fierro, Veronica; Chan, Caryn Mei Hsien; Hersh, Deborah",J Autism Dev Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34247302/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-05184-5,397

RECENT FINDINGS: To address barriers to care created by the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory agencies and payors waived longstanding restrictions, which enabled rapid expansion of telemedicine across the country. Preliminary data show that providers and persons with HIV (PWH) view telemedicine favorably. Some data suggest telemedicine has facilitated retention in care, but other studies have found increasing numbers of PWH lost to follow-up and worsened virologic suppression rates despite offering video and/or telephone visits. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated gaps in the HIV care continuum. To help mitigate the impact, most clinics have adopted new virtual care options and are now evaluating usage, impact, and concerns. Further research into the effects of telemedicine on HIV care and continued work towards universal access are needed.","Budak, Jehan Z.; Scott, John D.; Dhanireddy, Shireesha; Wood, Brian R.",Curr HIV/AIDS Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11904-021-00543-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33616811/,397

Indeed, a growing body of research has uncovered links between social media use and various aspects of health and wellbeing. However, relatively little work has examined factors that characterize how people experience and regulate their online selves on particular platforms. In the present study, we recruited a large sample of active Instagram users (N = 247; ages 18–58) to complete a questionnaire battery that included measures of participants' social anxiety, their sense of self-worth tied to Instagram use, and specific content control behaviors on the Instagram platform (e.g., editing captions, disabling comments, etc.). Results indicated that participants with higher levels of social anxiety tended to have greater Instagram contingent self-worth, and this was then associated with some content control behaviors, including editing captions and photos and videos when sharing posts. These findings suggest that those who are more socially anxious interact with Instagram differently, and this may arise from self-worth that is wedded to their experiences on the platform. Overall, this work adds to a growing body of research highlighting the benefits and risks of social media use on psychological health.","Lopez, Richard B.; Polletta, Isabel",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34512468/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.711447,397
652473,Expert opinion in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Treating patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-08-31,"BACKGROUND: Older people account for 25% of all Emergency Department (ED) admissions. This is expected to rise with an ageing demographic. Older people often present to the ED with complex medical needs in the setting of multiple comorbidities. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) has been shown to improve outcomes in an inpatient setting but clear evidence of benefit in the ED setting has not been established. It is not feasible to offer this resource-intensive assessment to all older adults in a timely fashion. Screening tools for frailty have been used to identify those at most risk for adverse outcomes following ED visit. The overall aim of this study is to examine the impact of CGA on the quality, safety and cost-effectiveness of care in an undifferentiated population of frail older people with medical complaints who present to the ED and Acute Medical Assessment Unit. METHODS: This will be a parallel 1:1 allocation randomised control trial. All patients who are ≥ 75 years will be screened for frailty using the Identification of Seniors At Risk (ISAR) tool. Those with a score of ≥ 2 on the ISAR will be randomised. The treatment arm will undergo geriatric medicine team-led CGA in the ED or Acute Medical Assessment Unit whereas the non-treatment arm will undergo usual patient care. A dedicated multidisciplinary team of a specialist geriatric medicine doctor, senior physiotherapist, specialist nurse, pharmacist, senior occupational therapist and senior medical social worker will carry out the assessment, as well as interventions that arise from that assessment. Primary outcomes will be the length of stay in the ED or Acute Medical Assessment Unit. Secondary outcomes will include ED re-attendance, re-hospitalisation, functional decline, quality of life and mortality at 30 days and 180 days. These will be determined by telephone consultation and electronic records by a research nurse blinded to group allocation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Service Executive (HSE) Mid-Western Regional Hospital Research Ethics Committee (088/2020). Our lay dissemination strategy will be developed in collaboration with our Patient and Public Involvement stakeholder panel of older people at the Ageing Research Centre and we will present our findings in peer-reviewed journals and national and international conferences.

Two criteria based on age are demographic: lives saved and years of future life saved. Vaccinating the very old against COVID-19 saves the most lives, but, since older age is accompanied by falling life expectancy, it is widely supposed that these two goals are in conflict. We show this to be mistaken. The age patterns of COVID-19 mortality are such that vaccinating the oldest first saves the most lives and, surprisingly, also maximizes years of remaining life expectancy. We demonstrate this relationship empirically in the United States, Germany, and South Korea and with mathematical analysis of life tables.

655587,The Correlation Between COVID-19 Activities and Climate Factors in Different Climate Types Areas,2021-05-21,"BACKGROUND: A variety of skin manifestations have been associated with COVID-19 infection. Acral lesions on hands and feet, closely resembling chilblains, have been reported in association with COVID-19, which are nonspecific. These acro-ischemic painful lesions have been described mainly in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic pediatric COVID-19 positive patients, without a precise pathogenetic mechanism. COVID-19-induced chilblains may portend an indolent course and a good outcome. In young patients, the IFN-1 response induces microangiopathic changes and produces a chilblain lupus erythematosus-like eruption with vasculitic neuropathic pain features. OBJECTIVES: This paper presented a case series of pediatric patients with COVID-19-related skin lesions and neuropathic-like pain. METHODS: Clinical outcomes were collected from 11 patients diagnosed with painful erythematous skin lesions with neuropathic-like pain and positive IgG for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: It is a mildly symptomatic condition not related to severe pain rates, and it is treated with paracetamol due to the transitory nature of the problem, which provides good results. CONCLUSIONS: A particular point of interest is skin lesion manifestation as a further indirect sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Due to the initial manifestation of chilblains in pauci-symptomatic pediatric patients, they need to be immediately tested and isolated. Chilblains can be considered a clinical clue to suspect SARS-CoV-2 infection and help in early diagnosis, patient triage, and infection control.","Papa, Alfonso; Salzano, Anna Maria; Di Dato, Maria Teresa; Lo Bianco, Giuliano; Tedesco, Mariangela; Salzano, Antonio; Myrcik, Dariusz; Imani, Farnad; Varrassi, Giustino; Akhavan Akbari, Ghodrat; Paladini, Antonella",Anesth Pain Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336629/; https://doi.org/10.5812/aapm.113760,397

Prone mechanical ventilation is a therapeutic strategy which has been used extensively during the COVID-19 pandemic to treat acutely hypoxemic patients with COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Though a small number of cases of unilateral NAION have been reported in patients testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we describe what is to our knowledge, the first reported case of bilateral NAION occurring in a patient proned extensively for the treatment of COVID-19 related ARDS. We consider the potential aetiological factors leading to NAION after prone mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 and suggest strategies to protect against its development. CASE PRESENTATION: : We report a case of severe, irreversible, visual impairment secondary to bilateral anterior ION in a fifty-five-year-old male who underwent eight episodes of prone mechanical ventilation to treat COVID-19 related ARDS. Once weaned from his sedation he reported bilateral painless vision loss, and bedside ophthalmological assessment identified a reduced visual acuity of 3/30 unaided in the left eye and counting fingers in the right. Dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed inferotemporal optic disc oedema with splinter haemorrhages in the right eye and mild disc oedema, temporal pallor, and nerve fibre layer haemorrhages inferiorly in the left eye. Humphrey visual field 24 − 2 testing confirmed a severely constricted visual field with macular sparing on the right and depressed inferonasal vision with preserved peripheral vision on the left eye. OCT disc imaging shortly after diagnosis revealed bilateral disc swelling and flame haemorrhages in the right eye.

This study aimed to assess anxiety levels during COVID‐19 in children with chronic kidney disease(CKD), including nephrotic syndrome(NS) and kidney transplantation(Tx). METHODS: A case‐control, cross‐sectional study was conducted with children aged of 10 to 18 years, who had been followed with diagnosis of CKD,NS,Tx between April and July 2020. Healthy control group was recruited age and gender‐matched children. A questionnaire with printed and online version is designed in three parts: demographic characteristics, opinions about the pandemic, Turkish version of The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale‐ Child Version (RCADS‐CV). RESULTS: Total of 88 children completed the questionnaire. The patient and control groups were similar by gender, age, household members and history of psychiatric treatment. Both groups stated that coronavirus is a risky disease for children(63.6%), they were afraid of contagion(69.3%). Only half of them were receiving realistic and informative answers from family members. In RCADS‐CV, 66% of them get high score from at least one subscale. Social Phobia(SP) scores of the control group was higher, although the high‐scoring ratios were similar. The ratio of high‐scored participants was higher in CKD patients for Panic Disorder, and was lower in immunosuppressive agent group for SP.

657675,Magnitude and determinants of the psychological impact of COVID-19 among health care workers: A systematic review,2021-04-25,"Alcohol is energy-dense, elicits weak satiety responses relative to solid food, inhibits dietary fat oxidation, and may stimulate food intake. It has, therefore, been proposed as a contributor to weight gain and obesity. The aim of this narrative review was to consolidate and critically appraise the evidence on the relationship of alcohol consumption with dietary intake and body weight, within mainstream (non-treatment) populations. Publications were identified from a PubMed keyword search using the terms ‘alcohol’, ‘food’, ‘eating’, ‘weight’, ‘body mass index’, ‘obesity’, ‘food reward’, ‘inhibition’, ‘attentional bias’, ‘appetite’, ‘culture’, ‘social’. A snowball method and citation searches were used to identify additional relevant publications. Reference lists of relevant publications were also consulted. While limited by statistical heterogeneity, pooled results of experimental studies showed a relatively robust association between acute alcohol intake and greater food and total energy intake. This appears to occur via metabolic and psychological mechanisms that have not yet been fully elucidated. Evidence on the relationship between alcohol intake and weight is equivocal. Most evidence was derived from cross-sectional survey data which does not allow for a cause-effect relationship to be established. Observational research evidence was limited by heterogeneity and methodological issues, reducing the certainty of the evidence. We found very little qualitative work regarding the social, cultural, and environmental links between concurrent alcohol intake and eating behaviours. That the evidence of alcohol intake and body weight remains uncertain despite no shortage of research over the years, indicates that more innovative research methodologies and nuanced analyses are needed to capture what is clearly a complex and dynamic relationship. Also, given synergies between ‘Big Food’ and ‘Big Alcohol’ industries, effective policy solutions are likely to overlap and a unified approach to policy change may be more effective than isolated efforts. However, joint action may not occur until stronger evidence on the relationship between alcohol intake, food intake and weight is established.","Fong, Mackenzie; Scott, Stephanie; Albani, Viviana; Adamson, Ashley; Kaner, Eileen",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13092927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578805/,397

659032,Implementation of a COVID-19 surveillance programme for healthcare workers in a teaching hospital in an upper-middle-income country,2021-04-14,"BACKGROUND: In December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was reported in Wuhan, China, and has now rapidly swept around the world. Much research has been carried out since the outbreak, but few studies have focused on the dysfunction of the adaptive immunity. METHODS: In this retrospective and multi-center study, 373 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Affiliated Hospital of Putian University were recruited. Demographic, clinical, radiological features, and laboratory data were recorded and analyzed at admission and at discharge. Results of immunological tests were followed up until the patients were discharged. RESULTS: Of the 373 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 322 were in the non-severe group and 51 were in the severe group. Number of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and total lymphocytes declined remarkably upon admission and elevated when the patients were discharged. At admission, counts of total lymphocytes, T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and levels of C3 and C4 in the severe group were lower than those in the non-severe group, whereas the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was higher in the severe group. Counts of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and total lymphocytes were negatively correlated with lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 might target adaptive immunity and cause a decrease in lymphocytes, especially T cells and subsets. Physicians should pay close attention to the adaptive immunity of patients upon admission. Monitoring NLR, T lymphocytes, and subsets would help physicians with the proper diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

However, studies examining outcomes of patients admitted to hospitals not in crisis are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical characteristic and outcomes of all patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospitals not in crisis, and factors associated with mortality in this population. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis PARTICIPANTS: In total, 470 consecutive patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization in one health system in Boston from January 1, 2020 to April 15, 2020.

During hospitalization, 37.9% (178/470) were admitted to the ICU, 33.6% (158/470) received mechanical ventilation, 29.4% (138/470) received vasopressors, 16.4% (77/470) reported limitations on their desire for life-sustaining therapies such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 25.1% (118/470) died. Among those admitted to the ICU (N=178), the median number of days on the ventilator was 10 days (IQR 1–29), and 58.4% (104/178) were discharged alive. Older age (OR=1.04, P<0.001), male sex (OR=2.14, P=0.007), higher comorbidities (OR=1.20, P=0.001), higher lactate dehydrogenase on admission (2nd tertile: OR=4.07, P<0.001; 3rd tertile: OR=8.04, P<0.001), and the need for supplemental oxygen on admission (OR=2.17, P=0.014) were all associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and those who received mechanical ventilation survived. These data highlight the need to examine public health and system factors that contribute to improved outcomes for this population.

However, data on the kinetics of antibodies 3 months post-vaccination are currently lacking and are important to drive the future vaccination strategy. The CRO-VAX HCP study is an ongoing multicentre, prospective and interventional study designed to assess the antibody response in a population of healthcare professionals who had received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Two hundred individuals underwent a blood drawn within 2 days before the first vaccine dose. One-hundred and forty-two persons (71%) were categorized as seronegative at baseline while 58 (29%) were seropositive. Samples were then collected after 14, 28, 42, 56, and 90 days. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein were measured in all individuals at different time points. Using a one-compartment kinetics model, the time to maximum concentration was estimated at 36 ± 3 days after the first dose and the estimated half-life of antibodies was 55 days (95% CI: 37–107 days) in seronegative participants. In seropositive participants, the time to maximum concentration was estimated at 24 ± 4 days and the estimated half-life was 80 days (95% CI: 46–303 days). The antibody response was higher in seropositive compared to seronegative participants. In both seropositive and seronegative subjects, a significant antibody decline was observed at 3 months compared to the peak response.

664779,"Risk Factors Associated with COVID-19 Infected Healthcare Workers in Muscat Governorate, Oman",2021-02-12,"BACKGROUND: Human rhinovirus (HRV) is the most common cause of the common cold but may also lead to more severe respiratory illness in vulnerable populations. The epidemiology and genetic diversity of HRV within a school setting have not been previously described. The objective of this study was to characterize HRV molecular epidemiology in a primary school in a rural location of Kenya. METHODS: Between May 2017 and April 2018, over 3 school terms, we collected 1859 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from pupils and teachers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection in a public primary school in Kilifi County, coastal Kenya. The samples were tested for HRV using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. HRV-positive samples were sequenced in the VP4/VP2 coding region for species and genotype classification. RESULTS: A total of 307 NPS (16.4%) from 164 individuals were HRV positive, and 253 (82.4%) were successfully sequenced. The proportion of HRV in the lower primary classes was higher (19.8%) than upper primary classes (12.2%; P < .001). HRV-A was the most common species (134/253; 53.0%), followed by HRV-C (73/253; 28.9%) and HRV-B (46/253; 18.2%). Phylogenetic analysis identified 47 HRV genotypes. The most common genotypes were A2 and B70. Numerous (up to 22 in 1 school term) genotypes circulated simultaneously, there was no individual re-infection with the same genotype, and no genotype was detected in all 3 school terms. CONCLUSIONS: HRV was frequently detected among school-going children with mild acute respiratory illness symptoms, particularly in the younger age groups (<5-year-olds). Multiple HRV introductions were observed that were characterized by considerable genotype diversity.","Luka, Martha M; Kamau, Everlyn; Adema, Irene; Munywoki, Patrick K; Otieno, Grieven P; Gicheru, Elijah; Gichuki, Alex; Kibinge, Nelson; Agoti, Charles N; Nokes, D James",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33094115/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa385,397

The need to increase capacity for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a variety of settings, combined with shortages of sample collection supplies, have motivated a search for alternative sample types with high sensitivity. We systematically reviewed the literature to understand the performance of alternative sample types compared to NP swabs. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv (last retrieval October 1st, 2020) for comparative studies of alternative specimen types [saliva, oropharyngeal (OP), and nasal (NS) swabs] versus NP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). A logistic-normal random-effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate % positive alternative-specimen, % positive NP, and % dual positives overall and in sub-groups. The QUADAS 2 tool was used to assess bias. Results: From 1,253 unique citations, we identified 25 saliva, 11 NS, 6 OP, and 4 OP/NS studies meeting inclusion criteria. Three specimen types captured lower % positives [NS (0.82, 95% CI: 0.73-0.90), OP (0.84, 95% CI: 0.57-1.0), saliva (0.88, 95% CI: 0.81 -0.93)] than NP swabs, while combined OP/NS matched NP performance (0.97, 95% CI: 0.90-1.0). Absence of RNA extraction (saliva) and utilization of a more sensitive NAAT (NS) substantially decreased alternative-specimen yield. Conclusions: NP swabs remain the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, although alternative specimens are promising. Much remains unknown about the impact of variations in specimen collection, processing protocols, and population (pediatric vs. adult, late vs. early in disease course) and head-to head studies of sampling strategies are urgently needed.","Lee, R.

Younger participants reported greater loneliness. The quality of the relationship with the person(s) with whom they were spending their lock-down was also correlated with loneliness. Those who reported greater loneliness also obtained frequent news about the pandemic from social media. Problematic internet use was associated with loneliness and the predictors of loneliness.

There was an urgent need of a high-throughput molecular test for screening the COVID-19 patients in the community. The Luminex NxTAG CoV extended panel is a high-throughput FDA emergency use-authorized molecular diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This system targets three genes (ORF1ab, N, and E genes) of SARS-CoV-2, the ORF1ab region of SARS-CoV, and the ORF5 region of MERS-CoV. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of this system with nasopharyngeal swab specimens of 214 suspected COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong. The results were compared with our routine COVID-19 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) protocol with a LightMix SarbecoV E-gene kit and an in-house RdRp/Hel RT-PCR assay. The NxTAG CoV extended panel demonstrated 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity to SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. On low-viral load specimens, the sensitivity of the NxTAG panel could still maintain at 85.71%. Strong agreement was observed between the NxTAG panel and the routine COVID-19 RT-PCR protocol (kappa value = 0.98). Overall, the E gene target of the NxTAG panel demonstrated the highest sensitivity among the three SARS-CoV-2 targets, while the N gene targets demonstrated the least. In conclusion, the NxTAG CoV extended panel is simple to use, and it has high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. We recommend this diagnostic system for high-throughput COVID-19 screening in the community.","Chen, Jonathan Hon-Kwan; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Poon, Rosana Wing-Shan; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",J Clin Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482633/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00936-20,397
671638,A Cross-Sectional Survey on Medication Management Practices for Noncommunicable Diseases in Europe During the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-06-07,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at examining the reliability and validity of the Teruel Orthorexia Scale (TOS) among a sample of Lebanese adolescents (15 to 18 years old). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that was conducted between May and June 2020 and had enrolled 555 Lebanese adolescents. To assess the internal structure of the TOS scale, we administered the confirmatory factor analysis based on polychoric correlation matrix using Weighted Least Squares with Means and Variance Adjusted estimation (WLSMV) method in Mplus v 7.2 as suggested in the original validation paper. To assess the degree to which the Lebanese adaptation converges with the original scale, we have conducted the Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MGCFA; estimated as CFA) between the data reported in the current paper and from the original validation paper. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 16.66 ± 1.01 years, with 76.1% females. The bi-dimensional model fitted the data well (χ(2)((118)) = 429.09; p < 0.001; CFI = 0.954; RMSEA = 0.069[0.062, 0.076]). The latent factors were highly correlated (ρ = 0.74; p < 0.001), and the strength of the standardized factor loadings was adequate on both factors (i.e., all > 0.60). The fit indices of the scalar model were at the boundary of the threshold and thus, with some pinch of caution, it might be interpreted as invariant (i.e., having equal item intercepts across groups). We have identified latent mean differences in orthorexia nervosa (0.30; p < 0.001), where Spanish individuals scored higher, but we did not find any differences in the healthy eating (0.03; p = 0.636). Higher DOS scores were significantly correlated with higher scores on the TOS subscale OrNe (r = 0.715; p < 0.001) as well as with higher scores on the TOS subscale HeOR (r = 0.754; p < 0.001). Higher ORTO-R scores were significantly associated with less TOS OrNe (r = − 0.437; p < 0.001) and TOS HeOr (r = − 0.305; p < 0.001) scores, respectively. CONCLUSION: The Arabic version of the TOS can be considered a reliable valuable instrument to assess the ON tendencies and behaviors in Lebanese adolescents, emphasizing the fine contrast between ON’s two dimensions: healthy vs. pathological.

At the heart of this controversy is a complex linguistic and social process that cannot be illuminated by appealing to the semantics of the modifier evidence-based. The complexity lies in the nature of evidence as a basic concept that circulates in both expert and non-expert spheres of communication, supports different interpretations in different contexts, and is inherently open to contestation. We outline a new methodology that combines a social epistemological perspective with advanced methods of corpus linguistics and elements of conceptual history to investigate this and other basic concepts that underpin the practice and ethos of modern medicine. The potential of this methodology to offer new insights into controversies such as those surrounding EBM is demonstrated through a case study of the various meanings supported by evidence and based, as attested in a large electronic corpus of online material written by non-experts as well as a variety of experts in different fields, including medicine.","Buts, Jan; Baker, Mona; Luz, Saturnino; Engebretsen, Eivind",Med Health Care Philos,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11019-021-10027-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34057664/,397

The difference between estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated by sCr (eGFRcr) and CysC (eGFRcysc) of critically ill COVID-19 patients were investigated in this study. METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-center study of critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) at Wuhan, China. Control cases were moderate COVID-19 patients matched in age and sex at a ratio of 1:1. The eGFRcr and eGFRcysc were compared. The association between eGFR and death were analyzed in critically ill cases. The potential factors influencing the divergence between eGFRcr and eGFRcysc were explored. RESULTS: A total of 76 critically ill COVID-19 patients were concluded. The mean age was 64.5 ± 9.3 years. The eGFRcr (85.45 (IQR 60.58–99.23) ml/min/1.73m(2)) were much higher than eGFRcysc (60.6 (IQR 34.75–79.06) ml/min/1.73m(2)) at ICU admission. About 50 % of them showed eGFRcysc < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) while 25% showed eGFRcr < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (χ(2) = 10.133, p = 0.001). This divergence was not observed in moderate group. The potential factors influencing the divergence included serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) level as well as APACHEII, SOFA scores. Reduced eGFRcr (<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was associated with death (HR = 1.939, 95%CI 1.078–3.489, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: The eGFRcr was generally higher than eGFRcysc in critically ill COVID-19 cases with severe inflammatory state. The divergence might be affected by inflammatory condition and illness severity. Reduced eGFRcr predicted in-hospital death. In these patients, we advocate for caution when using eGFRcysc.","Liu, Yanan; Xia, Peng; Cao, Wei; Liu, Zhengyin; Ma, Jie; Zheng, Ke; Chen, Limeng; Li, Xuewang; Qin, Yan; Li, Xuemei",Renal failure,https://doi.org/10.1080/0886022x.2021.1948428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34238117/,397

AIMS: To identify respiratory viruses in the general population and those associated with hospitalisation in AECOPD using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), and the relationship between symptoms, viral detection and inflammatory markers. METHODS: A review of viruses detected in the general population in a health district between August 2014 and July 2015, using multiplex PCR for viruses from NPA samples. In addition, a single hospital, retrospective audit of patients admitted with suspected AECOPD was conducted. RESULTS: Of the 8811 NPA tested, 5599 (64%) were positive for at least one virus and 2069 of these were obtained from adults. In adults, the most common viruses identified were Influenza A (31%), Rhinovirus (27%) and respiratory syncytial virus A/B (10%). Most patients with AECOPD (102 of 153) had NPA sent for viral PCR testing and 59 (58%) were positive. The most common viruses identified were Influenza A (31%), Rhinovirus (24%) and respiratory syncytial virus A/B (17%) with co‐infecting bacteria cultured in 22 sputum samples. Patients with influenza‐like symptoms were more likely to have a positive viral PCR than those without symptoms (P < 0.004). The median C‐reactive protein on admission was lower in the virus‐infected than uninfected AECOPD (28 vs 60 mg/L, P < 0.026). CONCLUSION: The spectrum of viruses detected in patients with AECOPD is similar to that of the general population. Viruses are more likely to be identified in patients with AECOPD who present with influenza‐like symptoms and a low C‐reactive protein.","Biancardi, E.; Fennell, M.; Rawlinson, W.; Thomas, P.

Lectins are functionally classified based on their relative binding reactivities with the structural units of carbohydrate or glyco-epitopes. They are grouped according to their monosaccharide specificities and then further sub-grouped based on their reactivities with more complex structures. Carbohydrate specificities of biomedically important lectins are classified into six groups according to their specificities to monosaccharides. The chapter introduces a practical platform of carbohydrate microarrays that is useful for lectin characterization and classification. Finally, the chapter discusses a few examples to illustrate the application of this technology in lectin-related experimental investigations.","Wang, Denong; Wu, Albert M.",Lectins,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444530776500089; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444530776500089,397

Since the effects of a small number of conditionally marketed vaccines need further clinical observation, there is still an urgent need to quickly and effectively repurpose potentially available drugs before the next disease peak. In this work, we have manually collected a set of experimentally confirmed virus-drug associations through the publicly published database and literature, consisting of 175 drugs and 95 viruses, as well as 933 virus-drug associations. Then, because the samples are extremely sparse and unbalanced, negative samples cannot be easily obtained. We have developed an ensemble model, EMC-Voting, based on matrix completion and weighted soft voting, a semi-supervised machine learning model for computational drug repurposing. Finally, we have evaluated the prediction performance of EMC-Voting by fivefold crossing-validation and compared it with other baseline classifiers and prediction models. The case study for the virus SARS-COV-2 included in the dataset demonstrates that our model achieves the outperforming AUPR value of 0.934 in virus-drug association’s prediction.","Li, Wen; Wang, Shulin; Xu, Junlin",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367094/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.694534,397

Experts also opine that school closures might have negative effects on the scholastic abilities of children and also an adverse impact on the economy and health care system, considering the responsibilities conferred upon the parents. Also, in a developing country like India, it is difficult for the rural population to afford distance online learning, which brings into importance the reopening of schools in a safe environment to avoid adversities such as increased drop-outs in the upcoming academic year, loss of in-person benefits such as mid-day meal scheme. This study highlights a field experience in relation to readiness assessment of a rural school in the Jodhpur district of Rajasthan, India, for a safe reopening to accept students in a safe and conducive atmosphere, which shall help prevent transmission of the virus in the schools among the children. In this regard, an indigenous readiness checklist has been developed to achieve the purpose, which assesses the readiness in 3 domains: (1) procedural readiness; (2) supplies, sanitation, and infrastructure-related; and (3) education and training.","Baskaran, Pritish; Raghav, Pankaja; Naveen, K.

678190,Knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 and associated factors among health care providers in Northwest Ethiopia,2020-08-28,"OBJECTIVE Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a disabling systemic disease that seriously threatens the patient's quality of life. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly preferred in clinical diagnosis due to its high contrast and tissue resolution. However, since the uncertainty and intensity inhomogeneous of the AS lesions in MRI, it is still challenging and time-consuming for doctors to quantify the lesions to determine the grade of the patient's condition. Thus, an automatic AS grading method is presented in this study, which integrates the lesion segmentation and grading in a pipeline. APPROACH To tackle the large variations in lesion shapes, sizes, and intensity distributions, a lightweight hybrid multi-scale convolutional neural network with reinforcement learning (LHR-Net) is proposed for the AS lesion segmentation. Specifically, the proposed LHR-Net is equipped with the newly proposed hybrid multi-scale module (HMS), which consists of multiply convolution layers with different kernel sizes and dilation rates for extracting sufficient multi-scale features. Additionally, a reinforcement learning-based data augmentation module is utilized to deal with the subjects with diffuse and fuzzy lesions that are difficult to segment. Furthermore, to resolve the incomplete segmentation results caused by the inhomogeneous intensity distributions of the AS lesions in MR images, a voxel constraint strategy is proposed to weigh the training voxel labels in the lesion regions. With the accurately segmented AS lesions, automatic AS grading is then performed by a ResNet-50-based classification network. MAIN RESULTS The performance of the proposed LHR-Net was extensively evaluated on a clinically collected three datasets: AS MRI dataset, COVID-19 CT dataset, and MICCAI-2019 StructSeg CT dataset, which consist ofincludes 100 subjects, 117 subjects, and 50 subjects, respectively. Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Average Surface Distance (ASD), Hausdorff Distance at 〖95〗^th percentile (HD95), Predicted Positive Volume (PPV), and Sensitivity (SEN) were employed to quantitatively evaluate the segmentation results. The average DSC of the proposed LHR-Net on the AS dataset reached 0.71 on the test set, which outperforms the other state-of-the-art segmentation method by 0.04. SIGNIFICANCE With the accurately segmented lesions, 31 subjects in the test set (38 subjects) were correctly graded, which demonstrates that the proposed LHR-Net might provide a potential automatic method for reproducible computer-assisted diagnosis of AS grading.","Gou, Shuiping; Lu, Yunfei; Tong, Nuo; Huang, Luguang; Liu, Ningtao; Han, Qing",Physics in medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ac262a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34517352/,397

It has been used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and several other companies in their Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) assays. RT-qPCR requires expensive equipment such as RNA isolation instruments and real-time PCR thermal cyclers, which are not available in many low resource settings and developing countries. As a pandemic, COVID-19 has quickly spread to the rest of the world. Many underdeveloped and developing counties do not have the means for fast and accurate COVID-19 detection to control this outbreak. Using COVID-19 positive clinical specimens, we demonstrated that RT-PCR assays can be performed in as little as 12 minutes using untreated samples, heat-inactivated samples, or extracted RNA templates. Rapid RT-PCR was achieved using thin-walled PCR tubes and a setup including sous vide immersion heaters/circulators.

Malaria and COVID-19 share striking similarities in their symptoms. A cross-sectional randomized study was conducted to investigate the role of sex in the coinfection of malaria and COVID-19 as well as some associated factors in Rivers State, Nigeria. METHODS: Ethical approval was obtained from the Rivers State Health and Ethics Committee before the commencement of this study, and the study was conducted at the COVID-19 Treatment Center Medical Laboratory, Rivers State, Nigeria. Intravenous blood samples from three hundred randomly selected consenting study participants were examined for Plasmodium species using Giemsa microscopy, while pretested questionnaires were used to obtain data on sex, risk factors, and symptoms. All data generated were analyzed statistically using the Chi-square test with a P < 0.05 value considered significant. RESULTS: All study participants had Plasmodium species (100% prevalence) with varying parasite loads, and P. falciparum was the only species observed. Study participants (irrespective of sex) with low and high parasitaemia had the highest and least prevalence, respectively (P > 0.05). Male study participants experienced more symptoms than females (P > 0.05) except for sore throat which had an equal value among males and females. Travel history was the only risk factor that showed significant association with sex, and males had a higher value than females (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Malaria and COVID-19 are major public health issues in Nigeria; more researches on these diseases especially in epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine production are vital.","Onosakponome, E.

I considered the number of US physician deaths in comparison to the expected COVID death rate in the general population. AIMS: To estimate the whether US physicians are at increased risk of death from COVID-19 due to occupational exposures. METHODS: COVID-related physician deaths were identified through searches using Medscape In Memoriam, and multiple internet searches using Google and Facebook. An obituary or death notice was obtained in all but one case. Death rates among physicians were compared to the expected rate based on COVID deaths in the US population. RESULTS: Up to 7 October 2020, there were 108 deaths among US physicians. Physicians make up about 0.33% of the US population. By 1 October 2020, there were 210 000 COVID deaths in the US population with 693 expected physician deaths. Observed deaths were 16% of expected. Seventy-five per cent of the deaths occurred among physicians older than age 60 and about half appeared to be among those retired from clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Observed physician deaths were significantly below expected based on deaths the general population. Prudent use of personal protective equipment may explain the lower-than-expected death rates.","Kaplan, R M",Occup Med (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399206/; https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqaa210,397

DESIGN: Series of cross sectional online surveys. SETTING: 37 nationally representative surveys in the UK, 2 March 2020 to 27 January 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 74 697 responses from 53 880 people living in the UK, aged 16 years or older (37 survey waves, about 2000 participants in each wave). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of the main symptoms of covid-19 (cough, high temperature or fever, and loss of sense of smell or taste), self-reported adherence to self-isolation if symptoms were present and intention to self-isolate if symptoms were to develop, requesting a test for covid-19 if symptoms were present and intention to request a test if symptoms were to develop, and intention to share details of close contacts. RESULTS: Only 51.5% of participants (95% confidence interval 51.0% to 51.9%, n=26 030/50 570) identified the main symptoms of covid-19; the corresponding values in the most recent wave of data collection (25-27 January 2021) were 50.8% (48.6% to 53.0%, n=1019/2007). Across all waves, duration adjusted adherence to full self-isolation was 42.5% (95% confidence interval 39.7% to 45.2%, n=515/1213); in the most recent wave of data collection (25-27 January 2021), it was 51.8% (40.8% to 62.8%, n=43/83). Across all waves, requesting a test for covid-19 was 18.0% (95% confidence interval 16.6% to 19.3%, n=552/3068), increasing to 22.2% (14.6% to 29.9%, n=26/117) from 25 to 27 January. Across all waves, intention to share details of close contacts was 79.1% (95% confidence interval 78.8% to 79.5%, n=36 145/45 680), increasing to 81.9% (80.1% to 83.6%, n=1547/1890) from 25 to 27 January. Non-adherence was associated with being male, younger age, having a dependent child in the household, lower socioeconomic grade, greater financial hardship during the pandemic, and working in a key sector. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of adherence to test, trace, and isolate are low, although some improvement has occurred over time. Practical support and financial reimbursement are likely to improve adherence. Targeting messaging and policies to men, younger age groups, and key workers might also be necessary.","Smith, Louise E; Potts, Henry W W; Amlôt, Richard; Fear, Nicola T; Michie, Susan; Rubin, G James",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789843/,397

Objective: To develop a quantitative assay for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 proteins that could readily be implemented in clinical and research laboratories. Methods: The biotin-streptavidin technique was used to conjugate SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding-domain (RBD) or nucleocapsid protein to the solid-phase of the ImmunoCAP resin. Plasma and serum samples from patients with COVID-19 (n=51) and samples from donors banked prior to the emergence of COVID-19 (n=109) were used in the assay. SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were followed longitudinally in a subset of samples and were related to total IgG and IgG to reference antigens using an ImmunoCAP 250 platform. Results: Performance characteristics demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity at a cut-off level of 2.5 g/mL for both SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Among 36 patients evaluated in a post-hospital follow-up clinic, median levels of IgG to spike-RBD and nucleocapsid were 34.7 g/mL (IQR 18-52) and 24.5 g/mL (IQR 9-59), respectively. Among 17 patients with longitudinal samples there was a wide variation in the magnitude of IgG responses, but generally the response to spike-RBD and to nucleocapsid occurred in parallel, with peak levels approaching 100 g/mL, or 1% of total IgG. Conclusions: We have described a quantitative assay to measure IgG to SARS-CoV-2 that could be used in clinical and research laboratories and implemented at scale. The assay can easily be adapted to measure IgG to novel antigens, has good performance characteristics and a read-out in standardized units.","Keshavarz, B.; Wiencek, J. R.; Workman, L.

We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is less frequent and less severe in children than in adults. This study analyzed the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection among all children aged <18 years in the Apulia region of southern Italy and the characteristics of the infected children. Clinical and demographic data were collected through the national platform for COVID-19 surveillance. Of the 166 infected children in the Apulia region, 104 (62.6%) were asymptomatic, 37 (22.3%) had mild infections, 22 (13.3%) had moderate infections, and 3 (1.8%) had severe infections. Only ten children (6.0%) were hospitalized, but none required intensive care support and none died. SARS-CoV-2 infection was transmitted mainly from parents or relatives to children. Because of school closure during the lockdown, infection was unlikely to have been transmitted among children. It is unclear whether school reopening would enhance virus spread, leading the Italian government to develop guidelines for safe school reopening. The actual role of children in virus transmission remains unclear. A sensitive surveillance system, prompt identification of cases, testing, and contact tracing will be key to reducing the further spread of infection.","Loconsole, Daniela; Caselli, Desirèe; Centrone, Francesca; Morcavallo, Caterina; Campanella, Silvia; Aricò, Maurizio; Chironna, Maria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32825563/,397

684119,Health-related quality of life of the Vietnamese during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-12-18,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus and the disease it causes COVID-19, like other viral outbreaks, have an unpredictable timeline. Therefore, a triumph in the battle against COVID-19 could only be achieved if a health care system's capacity to support a potentially overwhelming increase in critical patient care needs is maintained, and the viral curve is flattened. Accordingly, health care bodies around the globe called upon prioritising appropriate resource allocation as it relates to elective invasive procedures and minimising the use of essential items required to care for patients. The unpredictability COVID-19 timeline in the absence of effective drug treatments and vaccination along with the restrictive health care policies implemented suggest that patients may be deprived of access to needed surgical care, likely for many months. However, the potential undue delay in delivering essential elective surgical care may have a more detrimental impact on patients’ health compared to that of COVID-19 itself. This particularly applies to the paediatric population in which infection rates have been demonstrated to be considerably lower and mortalities have not been reported yet. Therefore, the need emerges for actions to be taken that allow for the resumption of essential elective surgical procedures in this population of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search through surgical guidance and recommendations to develop a set of evidence based recommendations that allow for the safe and timely delivery of essential paediatric surgical care during the time of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: No compelling evidence that the paediatric population is at an increased risk of morbidity or mortality exists. Therefore, delaying essential paediatric surgical care cannot be justified as it may have a potentially negative health impact, and continuous refinements of surgical recommendations are encouraged in view of evolving circumstances.","Al-Omar, Khaled; Bakkar, Sohail",Afr J Paediatr Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33595537/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ajps.ajps_96_20,397

Data related to the applicability of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) for risk stratification in patients with COVID-19 are currently lacking. We investigated the ability of CFS to predict need for mechanical ventilation and the duration of hospital stays in European patients with COVID-19. In total, 42 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the University Medical Center Mainz between March 3 and April 15 2020 were included into this validation study and data were retrospectively analyzed. CFS was assessed at admission in all patients. Patients were followed for need for mechanical ventilation and time to hospital discharge. At admission, the median CFS was 3 (range: 1–7) and 14 (33.3%) patients were considered as at least pre-frail (CFS >3). 24 (57.1%) patients were discharged from hospital after a median time of 7 days (IQR 4–8). 12 (28.6%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, higher CFS scores (HR 1.659, 95% CI 1.090 to 2.525, p=0.018) were an independent predictor for a higher risk of mechanical ventilation after adjusting for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index and quick sepsis-related organ failure score.

684361,Mitigating lockdown challenges in the response to COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa,2020-05-11,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The visitor effect describes how zoo animals respond to the presence of visitors to their enclosures in a positive, negative or neutral manner. The period of enforced closure of zoos due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 (and subsequent reopening later that year) allowed for the effect of visitor presence to be evaluated on several species of amphibian. Results have shown that amphibian visibility (i.e., likelihood to be on show in their enclosure) is potentially influenced by the presence of people, and therefore, enclosure layout, collection planning and amphibian husbandry should consider how to minimize any negative influences of the viewing public. ABSTRACT: Amphibians are an understudied group in the zoo-focussed literature. Whilst commonly housed in specialist exhibits and of real conservation value due to the global extinction crisis, amphibian welfare is not often investigated empirically in zoo settings. The limited research that is available suggests that enclosure design (structure, planting and naturalistic theming) has a positive impact on the time that amphibians will be on show to visitors. However, the categorisation of any “visitor effect” (i.e., influences of visitor presence on amphibian activity and time on display) is hard to find. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of zoological organisations in the UK for several months from March 2020, with gradual re-openings from the summer into autumn and winter. This event provided a unique opportunity to study the effect of the lack of visitors, the presence of essential zoo staff only, the wider return of organisational staff, and then the return of visitors over a prolonged period. This project at WWT Slimbridge Wetlands Centre assessed the number of individuals of six species of amphibian—common toad (Bufo bufo), common frog (Rana temporaria), smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), pool frog (Pelophylax lessonae), golden mantella (Mantella aurantiaca) and golden poison dart frog (Phyllobates terribilis)—visible to observers under different conditions. All amphibians were housed in a purpose-built indoor exhibit of individual enclosures and were recorded when visible (as a proportion of the total population of the enclosure) during closure, the return of extra centre staff and visitor periods. The results showed species-specific differences in visibility, with some species of amphibian being more likely to be on view when the presence of people at their enclosure was less likely or in smaller numbers. Such differences are likely related to the specific camouflage or anti-predation tactics in these focal species. Further study to quantify amphibian sensitivity to, and perception of, environmental change caused by public presence (e.g., light levels and sound) would be useful welfare-themed research extensions. Our results can help inform husbandry, collection planning and amphibian enclosure design to reduce any noticeable visitor effects, and provide a useful benchmark for further, more complex, welfare assessment measures.","Boultwood, Jack; O’Brien, Michelle; Rose, Paul",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11071982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34359109/,397

As a substitution of an external light source, self-luminescent therapeutics featuring in situ light emission aims to address the lack of tissue penetration in conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT). Luminol-based self-luminescent systems are successfully incorporated in PDT and detection of pathogens in infectious diseases. In these systems, luminol/hydrogen peroxide is served as luminescence source which can be activated by horseradish peroxidase (HRP). As a supplement strategy to the HRP-based bioluminescence, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) provided an electric-driven therapeutic solution and demonstrated potential capabilities of wearable healthcare devices with properly constructed transparent flexible hydrogels. Besides the diagnosis of infection and detection of bacteria, fungi and virus in solution or powder samples have been achieved by ATP-derived self-luminescence as the light source. In this inspirational note, we provide an overview on latest progress in the PDT and microbial detection by self-luminescent systems with an emphasis on the bioluminescence and ECL.

The aim of our study was to get an insight on the present situation in Serbia, review the EU actions when managing shortages, and discern a set of potential measures. A short survey was conducted among 500 pharmacists in public pharmacies, in 23 cities in Serbia. The survey questions addressed frequency of drug shortages, professional actions in the event of shortages, main consequences to patients and pharmacies, putative causes, and pivotal measures for the prevention/mitigation of drug shortages under current conditions. Moreover, a Panel of Experts was organized, whose suggestions and opinions were used to analyze the present situation and to form a set of potential solutions and effective measures to mitigate shortages of medicines. In-depth analysis of current Serbian legislation was conducted, with emphasis on specific steps to be made within the actual legal framework. Examples of good practice in the EU, applicable to a country such as Serbia, were examined. Our research showed that although Serbia is, in some aspects, behind EU countries regarding the approaches to overcome medicine shortages, progress can be made within short period of time, by specific well-targeted actions. Both patients and pharmacists would benefit from it.","Jovanović Lješković, Nataša; Jovanović Galović, Aleksandra; Stojkov, Svetlana; Jojić, Nikola; Gigov, Slobodan",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13040448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33810412/,397

Specifically, Study 1 examined the moderating effect of the pandemic on the relationship between six predictors (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, price saving benefit, time saving benefit, food safety risk perception, and trust) and OFD usage intention, and Study 2 extended the model by adding customer perceptions of COVID-19 (perceived severity and vulnerability) during the pandemic. Study 1 showed that all of the predictors except food safety risk perception significantly affected OFD usage intention, but no moderation effect of COVID-19 was found. In Study 2, while perceived severity and vulnerability had no significant impact on OFD usage intention, the altered effects of socio-demographic variables during the COVID-19 pandemic were found.

686757,"Perceptions of individuals in treatment for substance use disorder during COVID-19: insight on mental health, sobriety, access to treatment, and telehealth",2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Influenza type A virus infections are still one of the major concerns for the health of humans and various species of domestic and companion animals. Wild birds play an essential role in the transmission cycle of the virus. Regularly monitoring the spread of the virus is a significant step in its mitigation. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, including H5N1 and H5N8, have been reported in birds in the Arabian Peninsula, including Saudi Arabia, in recent decades. This study aimed to evaluate the immune status of birds, domestic and companion animals for Influenza type A virus in Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 195 serum samples from dromedary camels, sheep, goats, native breed chickens, doves, dogs, and cats. We tested these sera for the presence of specific antibodies against influenza type A virus using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Our results show that 4% of the tested samples had antibodies in sera, including some doves, chickens, and dogs. These data suggest exposure and seroconversion of these animals or birds to the influenza type A virus. CONCLUSION: The presence of antibodies against influenza type A virus in sera of some animals and birds without a previous vaccination history against the virus indicates a natural exposure history regarding this virus and seroconversion. Further large-scale molecular and epidemiological studies are needed to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of influenza type A virus among various species of animals and birds.","Alnaeem, Abdelmohsen Abduallah; Al-Shabeb, Abdulkareem; Hemida, Maged Gomaa",Vet World,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132612/; https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2020.1966-1969,397

Secreted IFN acts via JAK/STAT signaling pathways to direct a huge gene expression program, including antiviral, apoptotic, survival and immune genes. Only recently, the molecular patterns and their receptors as well as the connected signaling pathways leading to transcriptional activation of IFN genes have been elucidated. Ubiquitous cytosolic RNA helicases like RIG‐I which sense intracellular triphosphate RNAs and activate the IFN‐controlling transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 seem to play a major role in antiviral defense and immunity. Recognition of extracellular nucleic acids by a subset of Toll‐like receptors in addition contributes to a generalized host IFN response. During co‐evolution with the host, viruses have learned to counteract every piece of the IFN network. Learning from viruses how to target the IFN system may lead us to novel strategies for therapeutic intervention.","Brzózka, Krzysztof; Pfaller, Christian; Conzelmann, Karl‐Klaus",Signal Transduct,https://doi.org/10.1002/sita.200600115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327963/,397

The ORF7a protein has a structural homology with ICAM-1 which binds to the T lymphocyte integrin receptor LFA-1. As COVID-19 has a strong immune component as part of the disease, we sought to determine whether SARS-CoV2 would have a similar structural interaction with LFA-1. Using molecular docking simulations, we found that SARS-CoV2 ORF7a has the key structural determinants required to bind LFA-1 but also the related leukocyte integrin Mac-1, which is also known to be expressed by macrophages. Our study shows that SARS-CoV2 ORF7a protein has a conserved Ig immunoglobulin-like fold containing an integrin binding site that provides a mechanistic hypothesis for SARS-CoV2’s interaction with the human immune system. This suggests that experimental investigation of ORF7a-mediated effects on immune cells such as T lymphocytes and macrophages (leukocytes) could help understand the disease further and develop effective treatments.","Nizamudeen, Zubair Ahmed; Xu, Emma-Ruoqi; Karthik, Vivin; Halawa, Mohamed; Arkill, Kenton P.; Jackson, Andrew M.; Bates, David O.; Emsley, Jonas",Biosci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20203837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305306/,397
689431,Access considerations for a COVID-19 vaccine for South Africa,2020-10-29,"OBJECTIVE: A systematic review of mental health outcomes and needs of children and families during past pandemics was conducted based on the PRISMA protocol. The objectives were to evaluate the quality of existing studies on this topic, determine what is known about mental health outcomes and needs of children and families, and provide recommendations for how COVID-19 policies can best support children and families. METHODS: Seventeen studies were identified through a search of PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: Studies examining child outcomes indicate that social isolation and quarantining practices exert a substantial negative impact on child anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and fear symptoms. Potential risk factors such as living in rural areas, being female, and increasing grade level may exacerbate negative mental health outcomes for children. Studies examining parental and family outcomes indicate that parents experience high stress, anxiety, and financial burden during pandemics. The age of the parent and family socioeconomic status (SES) appeared to mitigate negative outcomes, where older parents and higher SES families had lower rates of mental health problems. Parents’ fear over the physical and mental health of their children, concerns over potential job loss and arranging childcare contributes to elevated stress and poorer well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this review suggest current gaps in COVID-19 policies and provide recommendations such implementing “family-friendly” policies that are inclusive and have flexible eligibility criteria. Examples include universal paid sick leave for parents and financial supports for parents who are also frontline workers and are at an elevated risk for contracting the disease.","C.
