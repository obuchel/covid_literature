223511,"Response to: ""Comment on: Nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission in postoperative infection and mortality: analysis of 14 798 procedures""",2021,"BACKGROUND: The global outbreak of human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infection represents an urgent need for readily available, accurate and rapid diagnostic tests. Nucleic acid testing of respiratory tract specimens for SARS-CoV-2 is the current gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the diagnostic accuracy of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid may be lower than optimal. The detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies should be used as a serological non-invasive tool for the diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AIM: To investigate the diagnostic value of SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG and nucleic acid detection in COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 652 suspected COVID-19 patients, and 206 non-COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Integrated TCM and Western Medicine Hospital. Data on SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and serum antibody tests were collected to investigate the diagnostic value of nucleic acid RT-PCR test kits and immunoglobulin (Ig)M/IgG antibody test kits. The &#967;2 test was used to compare differences between categorical variables. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was provided by the Wilson score method. All analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). RESULTS: Of the 652 suspected COVID-19 patients, 237 (36.3%) had positive nucleic acid tests, 311 (47.7%) were positive for IgM, and 592 (90.8%) were positive for IgG. There was a significant difference in the positive detection rate between the IgM and IgG test groups (P < 0.001). Using the RT-PCR results as a reference, the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of IgM/IgG combined tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection were 98.5%, 95.8%, and 97.1%, respectively. Of the 415 suspected COVID-19 patients with negative nucleic acid test results, 366 had positive IgM/IgG tests with a positive detection rate of 88.2%. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that serological IgM/IgG antibody combined test had high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and can be used in combination with RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Meng, Qing-Bin; Peng, Jing-Jing; Wei, Xin; Yang, Jia-Yao; Li, Peng-Cheng; Qu, Zi-Wei; Xiong, Yong-Fen; Wu, Guang-Jiang; Hu, Zhi-Min; Yu, Jian-Chun; Su, Wen",World J Clin Cases,,960

In this study, a symmetry-information-loaded structure-based Hamiltonian is developed using recent Cryo-EM structural data to explore the complete conformational energy landscape of the full-length prefusion spike protein. The study finds the 2019-nCoV prefusion spike to adopt a unique strategy by undertaking a dynamic conformational asymmetry that results in two prevalent asymmetric structures of spike where one or two spike heads rotate up to provide better exposure to the host-cell receptor. A few unique interchain interactions are identified at the interface of closely associated N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor binding domain (RBD) playing a crucial role in the thermodynamic stabilization of the up conformation of the RBD in the case of the 2019-nCoV spike. The interaction-level information decoded in this study may provide deep insight into developing effective therapeutic targets.","Roy, Susmita; Jaiswar, Akhilesh; Sarkar, Raju",J Phys Chem Lett,,960

355859,Nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission in postoperative infection and mortality: analysis of 14 798 procedures,2020,"Importance: Patients with cancer and health care workers (HCWs) are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessing the antibody status of patients with cancer and HCWs can help understand the spread of COVID-19 in cancer care. Objective: To evaluate serum SARS-CoV-2 antibody status in patients with cancer and HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Design, Setting, and Participants: Participants were enrolled for this prospective cross-sectional study between August 3 and October 30, 2020, from 2 comprehensive cancer centers in the epidemic area around Tokyo, Japan. Patients with cancer aged 16 years or older and employees were enrolled. Participants with suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of enrollment were excluded. Exposures: Cancer of any type and cancer treatment, including chemotherapy, surgery, immune checkpoint inhibitors, radiotherapy, and targeted molecular therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Seroprevalence and antibody levels in patients with cancer and HCWs. Seropositivity was defined as positivity to nucleocapsid IgG (N-IgG) and/or spike IgG (S-IgG). Serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. Results: A total of 500 patients with cancer (median age, 62.5 years [range, 21-88 years]; 265 men [55.4%]) and 1190 HCWs (median age, 40 years [range, 20-70 years]; 382 men [25.4%]) were enrolled. In patients with cancer, 489 (97.8%) had solid tumors, and 355 (71.0%) had received anticancer treatment within 1 month. Among HCWs, 385 (32.3%) were nurses or assistant nurses, 266 (22.4%) were administrative officers, 197 (16.6%) were researchers, 179 (15.0%) were physicians, 113 (9.5%) were technicians, and 50 (4.2%) were pharmacists. The seroprevalence was 1.0% (95% CI, 0.33%-2.32%) in patients and 0.67% (95% CI, 0.29%-1.32%) in HCWs (P = .48). However, the N-IgG and S-IgG antibody levels were significantly lower in patients than in HCWs (N-IgG: ß, -0.38; 95% CI, -0.55 to -0.21; P < .001; and S-IgG: ß, -0.39; 95% CI, -0.54 to -0.23; P < .001). Additionally, among patients, N-IgG levels were significantly lower in those who received chemotherapy than in those who did not (median N-IgG levels, 0.1 [interquartile range (IQR), 0-0.3] vs 0.1 [IQR, 0-0.4], P = .04). In contrast, N-IgG and S-IgG levels were significantly higher in patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors than in those who did not (median N-IgG levels: 0.2 [IQR, 0.1-0.5] vs 0.1 [IQR, 0-0.3], P = .02; S-IgG levels: 0.15 [IQR, 0-0.3] vs 0.1[IQR, 0-0.2], P = .02). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of Japanese patients with cancer and HCWs, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies did not differ between the 2 groups; however, findings suggest that comorbid cancer and treatment with systemic therapy, including chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, may influence the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","Yazaki, Shu; Yoshida, Tatsuya; Kojima, Yuki; Yagishita, Shigehiro; Nakahama, Hiroko; Okinaka, Keiji; Matsushita, Hiromichi; Shiotsuka, Mika; Kobayashi, Osamu; Iwata, Satoshi; Narita, Yoshitaka; Ohba, Akihiro; Takahashi, Masamichi; Iwasa, Satoru; Kobayashi, Kenya; Ohe, Yuichiro; Yoshida, Tomokazu; Hamada, Akinobu; Doi, Toshihiko; Yamamoto, Noboru",JAMA oncol.

Cirrhotic portal hypertension (PH) gradually develops with deteriorating liver function and can lead to life-threatening complications. Other than an increase in intrahepatic flow resistance due to morphological remodeling of the organ, a functional dysregulation of the sinusoids, the smallest functional units of liver vasculature, plays a pivotal role. Vascular tone is primarily regulated by the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway, wherein soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) are key enzymes. Recent data showed characteristic alterations in the expression of these regulatory enzymes or metabolite levels in liver cirrhosis. Additionally, a disturbed zonation of the components of this pathway along the sinusoids was detected. This review describes current knowledge of the pathophysiology of PH with focus on the enzymes regulating cGMP availability, i.e., sGC and PDE-5. The results have primarily been obtained in animal models of liver cirrhosis. However, clinical and histochemical data suggest that the new biochemical model we propose can be applied to human liver cirrhosis. The role of PDE-5 as potential target for medical therapy of PH is discussed.","Kreisel, Wolfgang; Schaffner, Denise; Lazaro, Adhara; Trebicka, Jonel; Merfort, Irmgard; Schmitt-Graeff, Annette; Deibert, Peter",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32872119/,960
