278645,Síndrome Torácica Aguda Secundária a Covid-19 Em Paciente Com Anemia Falciforme,2020,"BACKGROUND: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on behavioural and psychosocial aspects related to oral health is unknown. AIM: This study evaluated the psychosocial and behavioural changes related to oral health in adolescents immediately before and during the pandemic period of COVID-19, enabling a longitudinal assessment of the perceived changes. DESIGN: This cohort study evaluated 290 adolescents from November 2019 to February 2020 (T1-before the pandemic in Brazil) and from June to July 2020 (T2) in southern Brazil. Sociodemographic, behavioural, and psychosocial variables were measured before and during the pandemic. Issues related to social distancing and job loss were also collected. The differences between the variables in T1 and T2, as well as the effect of social distancing, were assessed using a multilevel-adjusted logistic regression model for repeated measures. RESULTS: A total of 207 adolescents were re-evaluated at T2 (a response rate of 71.3%). During the pandemic, the frequency of toothbrushing, the use of dental services, and the self-perceived need for dental treatment significantly decreased. Sugar consumption, bruxism, and quality of sleep did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: Behavioural and psychosocial factors showed significant changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents.","Brondani, Bruna; Knorst, Jessica Klöckner; Tomazoni, Fernanda; Cósta, Marina Dutra; Vargas, Andressa Weber; Noronha, Thaís Gioda; Mendes, Fausto Medeiros; Ardenghi, Thiago Machado",Int J Paediatr Dent,,966

354349,Manifestações Da Doença Falciforme Na Covid-19: Revisão Sistemática,2020,"Background: Due to the novelty of COVID­19 there is lack of evidence-based recommendations regarding the mechanical ventilation of these patients. Objective: Identification and delineation of critical parameters enabling individualized lung and diaphragm protective mechanical ventilation. Material and methods: Selective literature search, critical evaluation and discussion of expert recommendations. Results: In the current literature a difference between ARDS in COVID­19 and classical ARDS is described; however, there are no evidence-based recommendations for dealing with this discrepancy. In the past parameters and approaches for a personalized mechanical ventilation strategy were already introduced and applied. Conclusion: Using the parameters presented here it is possible to individualize the mechanical ventilation of COVID­19 patients in order to adjust and increase its compatibility to the heterogeneous clinical presentation of the COVID­19 ARDS.","Neetz, B; Herth, F J F; Müller, M M",Gefasschirurgie,,966

433341,Infecção.por Sars-cov2 Em Paciente Com Hemoglobinúria Paroxística Noturna,2020,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of elective, outpatient orthopaedic sports procedures during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic at a high-volume orthopaedic practice. Methods: All patients who were scheduled for elective, outpatient orthopaedic sports medicine procedures at one of two of outpatient surgical centers between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were asked to complete a custom survey during a post-operative clinic visit or phone call at a minimum of two-weeks or were subject to a routine screening questionnaire and temperature screen at the time of the first post-operative follow-up visit. The survey questionnaire assessed for any COVID-19-related symptoms. Surgical case logs were retrieved to review for any cancelled surgeries due to a positive pre-operative COVID-19 test. Results: A total of 3.5% of patients (n=39/1119) scheduled for surgery were diagnosed with COVID-19 during preoperative testing, resulting in surgical cancellation. Patients with a positive pre-operative COVID-19 test were found to be significantly younger (46 ± 20 years) when compared to all other patients with a negative test (51 ± 21 years; p=0.002). No patient was diagnosed with COVID-19, reported symptoms concerning for COVID infection, underwent additional testing, or reported close contact with another individual with a positive test or possessed symptoms concerning for COVID-19 at a minimum of two-weeks post-operatively. Conclusion: This study found that 3.5% of patients tested positive for COVID-19 and were significantly younger when compared to patients testing negative. No patient investigated for potential infection post-operatively reported the development of any symptoms related to COVID-19 or reported a positive test post-operatively. Using current protocols for pre-operative screening, elective outpatient orthopaedic surgery performed in an ASC is safe with no documented cases of COVID-19 transmission in this cohort.","Singh, Harsh; Isak, Inis; Knapik, Derrick M; Vadhera, Amar S; Gursoy, Safa; Cole, Brian J; Verma, Nikhil N",,,966
614457,MANIFESTAÇÕES DA DOENÇA FALCIFORME NA COVID-19: REVISÃO SISTEMÁTICA,2020-11-30,"AIMS: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a widely used antimalarial drug, is proposed to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, no report is currently available regarding the direct effects of HCQ on gut microbiota, which is associated with the outcomes of elderly patients with COVID-19. Here, we first investigated the effects of HCQ on intestinal microecology in mice. MAIN METHODS: Fifteen female C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into two groups: HCQ group (n = 10) and control group (n = 5). Mice in the HCQ group were administered with HCQ at dose of 100 mg/kg by gavage daily for 14 days. The feces of mice were collected before and on the 7th and 14th days after HCQ challenge, and then analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. At the end of the experiment, the hematology, serum biochemistry and cytokines were determined, respectively. The mRNA expression of tight junction proteins in colonic tissues were also studied by RT-PCR. KEY FINDINGS: HCQ challenge had no effects on the counts of white blood cells, the levels of serum cytokines, and the gene expression of tight junction proteins in colon. HCQ also did not increase the content of serum d-lactate in mice. Notably, HCQ significantly decreased the diversity of gut microbiota, increased the relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes whereas decreased that of Firmicutes. SIGNIFICANCE: Short-term high dose HCQ challenge changes gut microbiota but not the intestinal integrity and immunological responses in mice. Special attention should be paid to the effects of HCQ on intestinal microecology in future clinical use.","Pan, Zhi-Yuan; Chang, Yu-Xiao; Han, Ni; Hou, Feng-Yi; Lee, B.J.

653798,ANTICOAGULAÇÃO PROFILÁTICA DURANTE A INTERNAÇÃO HOSPITALAR NA COVID-19: REVISÃO DE LITERATURA,2020-11-30,"COVID‐19 has led to an unprecedented reduction in demand for energy for transportation and electricity, a crash in prices and employment in the fossil fuel industries and record‐breaking reductions in global carbon emissions. This paper discusses whether this “demand destruction” could spell the beginning of the end for fossil fuels or a temporary recession and the imperative to recover from the current crisis by “building back better” and not the same as before. There are encouraging signs for the renewable energy industry that could make COVID‐19 a cloud with a silver lining; whether this is the case will depend not only on the technological realities and social response to the crisis but also on political will and foresight.","Khanna, Madhu",Appl Econ Perspect Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230405/; https://doi.org/10.1002/aepp.13102,966
654616,REPERCUSSÕES HEMATOLÓGICAS NA INFECÇÃO POR COVID-19,2020-11-30,"AIMS: Hip fracture patients are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness, and admission into hospital puts them at further risk. We implemented a two-site orthopaedic trauma service, with ‘COVID’ and ‘COVID-free’ hubs, to deliver urgent and infection-controlled trauma care for hip fracture patients, while increasing bed capacity for medical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A vacated private elective surgical centre was repurposed to facilitate a two-site, ‘COVID’ and ‘COVID-free’, hip fracture service. Patients were screened for COVID-19 infection and either kept at our ‘COVID’ site or transferred to our ‘COVID-free’ site. We collected data for 30 days on patient demographics, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores (NHFS), time to surgery, COVID-19 status, mortality, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: In all, 47 hip fracture patients presented to our service: 12 were admitted to the ‘COVID’ site and 35 to the ‘COVID-free’ site. The ‘COVID’ site cohort were older (mean 86.8 vs 78.5 years, p = 0.0427) and with poorer CFS (p = 0.0147) and NHFS (p = 0.0023) scores. At the ‘COVID-free’ site, mean time to surgery was less (29.8 vs 52.8 hours, p = 0.0146), and mean LOS seemed shorter (8.7 vs 12.6 days, p = 0.0592). No patients tested positive for COVID-19 infection while at the ‘COVID-free’ site. We redirected 74% of our admissions from the base ‘COVID’ site and created 304 inpatient days’ capacity for medical COVID patients. CONCLUSION: Acquisition of unused elective orthopaedic capacity from the private sector facilitated a two-site trauma service. Patients were treated expeditiously, while successfully achieving strict infection control. We achieved significant gains in medical bed capacity in response to the COVID-19 demand. The authors propose the repurposing of unused elective operating facilities for a two-site ‘COVID’ and ‘COVID-free’ model as a safe and effective way of managing hip fracture patients during the pandemic.
