This study aimed to assess the well-being of Vietnamese people after COVID-19 lockdown measures were lifted and life gradually returned to normal. An online survey was organized from 21 to 25 April 2020 among Vietnamese residents aged 18 and over. The survey was launched by the Hue University of Medicine and Pharmacy. The WHO-5 Well-Being Index (scored 0-25) was used to score participants' well-being. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the predictors of well-being. A total of 1922 responses were analyzed (mean age: 31 years; 30.5% male; 88.2% health professionals or students in the health sector). The mean well-being score was 17.35 ± 4.97. Determinants of a high well-being score (&#8805;13) included older age, eating healthy food, practicing physical exercise, working from home, and adhering to the COVID-19 preventive measures. Female participants, persons worried about their relatives' health, and smokers were more likely to have a low well-being score. In conclusion, after the lockdown measures were lifted, the Vietnamese have people continued to follow COVID-19 preventive measures, and most of them scored high on the well-being scale. Waiting to achieve large-scale COVID-19 vaccine coverage, promoting preventive COVID-19 measures remains important, together with strategies to guarantee the well-being of the Vietnamese people.","Hoang, Tuyen Dinh; Colebunders, Robert; Fodjo, Joseph Nelson Siewe; Nguyen, Nhan Phuc Thanh; Tran, Trung Dinh; Vo, Thang Van",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),603,6
204138,204138,204138,South Korea's COVID-19 Infection Status: From the Perspective of Re-positive Test Results After Viral Clearance Evidenced by Negative Test Results,22.76343,1.3032719,2020,"The worldwide shortage of single-use N95 respirators and surgical masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many health care personnel to use their existing equipment for as long as possible. In many cases, workers cover respirators with available masks in an attempt to extend their effectiveness against the virus. Due to low mask supplies, many people instead are using face coverings improvised from common fabrics. Our goal was to determine what fabrics would be most effective in both practices. Under laboratory conditions, we examined the hydrophobicity of fabrics (cotton, polyester, silk), as measured by their resistance to the penetration of small and aerosolized water droplets, an important transmission avenue for the virus causing COVID-19. We also examined the breathability of these fabrics and their ability to maintain hydrophobicity despite undergoing repeated cleaning. Laboratory-based tests were conducted when fabrics were fashioned as an overlaying barrier for respirators and when constructed as face coverings. When used as material in these two situations, silk was more effective at impeding the penetration and absorption of droplets due to its greater hydrophobicity relative to other tested fabrics. We found that silk face coverings repelled droplets in spray tests as well as disposable single-use surgical masks, and silk face coverings have the added advantage over masks such that they can be sterilized for immediate reuse. We show that silk is a hydrophobic barrier to droplets, can be more breathable than other fabrics that trap humidity, and are re-useable via cleaning. We suggest that silk can serve as an effective material for making hydrophobic barriers that protect respirators, and silk can now be tested under clinical conditions to verify its efficacy for this function. Although respirators are still the most appropriate form of protection, silk face coverings possess properties that make them capable of repelling droplets.","Parlin, Adam F; Stratton, Samuel M; Culley, Theresa M; Guerra, Patrick A",PLoS One,603,30

The purpose of the present critical review is to describe challenges faced by health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic, make suggestions on self care techniques and indicate ways to augment their empowerment. However, not all health professionals develop the same level of stress and/or burnout, since they differ in their ways of reacting to various challenges. In the context of self-care, during the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological empowerment can strengthen resilience, optimize the quality of care provided, contribute to health professionals’ personal development and enhance their sense of personal control. It is important for health professionals to forge their own “shield” of self care that will help them protect against adversities.

Outbreaks or clusters in leisure settings (e.g. households, beaches, parties) or related to mass gatherings and social events (e.g. choir practice, church visits or funerals) are outside of the scope of this document. This report does not address all occupational groups, but takes a broad approach to describing COVID-19 clusters reported by EU/EEA countries and the UK to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and information on relevant COVID-19 clusters gathered by ECDC's Epidemic Intelligence (see Methods chapter). This document does not aim to provide guidance or recommendations on occupational health and safety measures for particular professions in relation to COVID-19 infection control, as this does not fall within ECDC's mandate. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) has published guidance specifically addressing issues related to workplaces during the COVID-19 pandemic, which also references national and international occupational safety and health guidance for a variety of sectors and occupations. While data on the full spectrum of COVID-19 clusters in occupational settings in the EU/EEA and the UK remain limited, it is clear that the most common exposure relates to lack of physical distancing, particularly in indoor settings, including shared accommodation, canteens, rest rooms and transport. Factors associated with transmission also included face-to-face contact with clients in sectors such as transport and retail, lack of access to hand-washing facilities, the housing conditions of seasonal or migrant workers and appropriate communication of the recommended public health measures. The number of clusters is probably significantly under-identified in occupational settings and at present it is difficult to investigate all clusters thoroughly. Many occupational clusters have been reported in the health and social care sectors, particularly in LTCFs and hospitals;however, these sectors are probably over-represented due to frequent testing in such settings.",,COVID-19 clusters and outbreaks in occupational settings in the EU/EEA and the UK|2020. 17 pp. 67 ref.,603,1

Mixed evidence exists on the aerosol-generating potential of orthodontic procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate splatter and/or settled aerosol contamination during orthodontic debonding.Material and methods Fluorescein dye was introduced into the oral cavity of a mannequin. Orthodontic debonding was undertaken with surrounding samples collected. Composite bonding cement was removed using a speed-increasing handpiece with dental suction. A positive control condition included a water-cooled, high-speed air-turbine crown preparation. Samples were analysed using digital image analysis and spectrofluorometric analysis.Results Contamination across the eight-metre experimental rig was 3% of the positive control on spectrofluorometric analysis and 0% on image analysis. Contamination of the operator, assistant and mannequin was 8%, 25% and 28% of the positive control, respectively.Discussion Splatter and settled aerosol from orthodontic debonding is distributed mainly within the immediate locality of the mannequin. Widespread contamination was not observed.Conclusions Orthodontic debonding is unlikely to produce widespread contamination via splatter and settled aerosol, but localised contamination is likely. This highlights the importance of personal protective equipment for the operator, assistant and patient. Further work is required to examine suspended aerosol.","Llandro, Hayley; Allison, James R; Currie, Charlotte C; Edwards, David C; Bowes, Charlotte; Durham, Justin; Jakubovics, Nicholas; Rostami, Nadia; Holliday, Richard",Br. dent. j,603,30

These difficulties have an adverse effect on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), thus psychometrically robust measures of speech and swallowing are needed to better understand the impact of these domains across the course of the disease. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to establish the clinical utility of two new patient-reported outcome measures (PROs), HDQLIFE Speech Difficulties and HDQLIFE Swallowing Difficulties. METHODS: Thirty-one participants with premanifest or manifest HD, and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy control participants were recruited for this study. Participants completed several PROs [HDQLIFE Speech Difficulties, HDQLIFE Swallowing Difficulties, Communication Participation Item Bank (CPIB)], as well as several clinician-rated assessments of speech and functioning. A computational algorithm designed to detect features of spoken discourse was also examined. Analyses were focused on establishing the reliability and validity of these new measures. RESULTS: Internal consistency was good for Swallowing (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89) and excellent for Speech and the CPIB (both Cronbach's alpha &#8805; 0.94), and convergent/discriminant validity was supported. Known groups validity for the PROs was supported by significant group differences among control participants and persons with different stages of HD (all p < 0.0001). All PROs were able to distinguish those with and without clinician-rated dysarthria (likelihood ratios far exceeded the threshold for clinical decision making [all &#8805; 3.28]). CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the clinical utility of the HDQLIFE Speech and Swallowing PROs and the CPIB for use across the HD disease spectrum. These PROs also have the potential to be clinically useful in other populations.","Carlozzi, Noelle E; Boileau, Nicholas R; Roberts, Angela; Dayalu, Praveen; Hanifan, Dana L; Miner, Jennifer A; Claassen, Daniel; Provost, Emily Mower",Qual. life res,603,27

However, the mechanism by which the intolerance of COVID-19-related uncertainty (COVID-19 IU) affects negative emotions in adolescents remains unclear. This study explored the underlying mechanism from COVID-19 IU to negative emotions using a moderated mediation model in adolescents. In total, 3037 teenagers completed a cross-sectional survey including measures of COVID-19 IU, risk perception, social exclusion, perceived efficacy, and negative emotions. The results showed that COVID-19 IU positively predicted negative emotions and that risk perception and social exclusion mediated this relationship. In addition, both the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions and the mediating effect of risk perception on this relationship were moderated by perceived efficacy; in particular, COVID-19 IU had a greater impact on negative emotions among adolescents with lower levels of perceived efficacy. These findings suggest that COVID-19 IU is closely associated with negative emotions among adolescents and that effective measures should be taken to enable adolescents to improve their perceived efficacy and develop a reasonable perception of risk, help them eliminate the stigma of the disease, and strengthen their connections with society.","Li, Qi; Luo, Ronglei; Zhang, Xiaoya; Meng, Guangteng; Dai, Bibing; Liu, Xun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),603,30

With this study, we sought to survey pediatric centers and highlight the variations in care related to perioperative medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the availability of protective equipment, the practice of pediatric anesthesia, and economic impact. AIM: The aim of the survey was to determine how COVID-19 directly impacted pediatric anesthesia practices during the study period. METHODS: A survey concerning four major domains (testing, safety, clinical management/policy, economics) was developed. It was pilot tested for clarity and content by members of the Pediatric Anesthesia COVID-19 Collaborative. The survey was administered by email to all Pediatric Anesthesia COVID-19 Collaborative members on September 1, 2020. Respondents had six weeks to complete the survey and were instructed to answer the questions based on their institution's practice during September 1 - October 13, 2020. RESULTS: Sixty-three institutions (100% response rate) participated in the COVID-19 Pediatric Anesthesia Survey. Forty-one hospitals (65%) were from the United States, and 35% included other countries. N95 masks were available to anesthesia teams at 91% of institutions (n = 57) (95% CI: 80%-96%). COVID-19 testing criteria of anesthesia staff and guidelines to return to work varied by institution. Structured simulation training aimed at improving COVID-19 safety and patient care occurred at 62% of institutions (n = 39). Pediatric anesthesiologists were economically affected by a reduction in their employer benefits and restriction of travel due to employer imposed quarantine regulations. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the testing, safety, clinical management, and economics of pediatric anesthesia practice.

Based on this premise, thermodynamic features of pure, graphene, and carbon nanotube (CNT)-based gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are investigated using molecular dynamics approach. Melting, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, contact angle of molten AuNPs, and phase transition are calculated as indicators of thermodynamic properties of pure and carbon-based AuNPs. Simulation results indicate that the presence of a carbon platform and its contact surface area has a significant role in the thermodynamic properties of AuNPs and leads the phononic heat capacity and thermal conductivity to decrease for AuNPs. The platform also causes the melting point temperature of AuNPs to increase. The melting of gold on the carbon base is of the first-order type. In addition, contact angle for molten AuNPs on the Graphene is significantly higher than the one on the CNT due to more contact area on the Graphene substrate.Graphical abstract .","Gowdini, E; Ahmad, A A; Mabudi, A; Hadipour, N L; Kharazian, B",J Mol Model,603,16

All semi-urgent and elective medical care has come to a halt to conserve capacity to care for patients during this pandemic. As the numbers of COVID-19 cases decrease across Canada, our healthcare system also began to reopen various facilities and medical offices. The aim for this document is to compile the current evidence and provide expert consensus on the safe return to clinic practice in Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery. These recommendations will also summarize general precaution principles and practical tips for office across Canada to optimize patient and provider safety. Risk assessment and patient selection are crucial to minimizing exposure to COVID-19. Controversial topics such as COVID-19 mode of transmission, duration of exposure, personal protective equipment, and aerosol-generating procedures will be analyzed and discussed. Practical solutions of pre-visit office preparation, front office and examination room set-up, and check out procedures are explored. Specific considerations for audiology, pediatric population, and high risk AGMPs are also addressed. Given that the literature surrounding COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, these guidelines will serve to start our specialty back into practice over the next weeks to months and they may change as we learn more about this disease.","Chan, Y; Angel, D; Aron, M; Hartl, T; Moubayed, S P; Smith, K A; Sommer, D D; Sowerby, L; Spafford, P; Mertz, D; Witterick, I J",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,603,23

Moreover, two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much slower translation rate. Calculating the composition of host specific slow codons and slow di-codons in the viral protein coding sequences can predict the order of viral protein synthesis rates between different virus strains. Comparison of human-specific slow codon and slow di-codon compositions in the genomes of 590 coronaviruses infect humans revealed that the protein synthetic rates of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may be much faster than other coronaviruses infect humans. Analysis of host-specific slow codon and di-codon compositions provides links between viral genomic sequences and capability of virus replication in host cells that may be useful for surveillance of the transmission potential of novel viruses.","Yang, Chu-Wen; Chen, Mei-Fang",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,603,6

Social distancing measures were introduced in the UK in March 2020 and virtual consultations (via telephone or video call) were identified as a potential alternative to face-to-face consultations at this time. LOCAL PROBLEM: The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) sees on average 11 200 face-to-face consultations a month. On average 7% of these are delivered virtually via telephone. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the RNOH set a target of reducing face-to-face consultations to 20% of all outpatient attendances. This report outlines a quality improvement initiative to rapidly implement virtual consultations at the RNOH. METHODS: The COVID-19 Action Team, a multidisciplinary group of healthcare professionals, was assembled to support the implementation of virtual clinics. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement approach to quality improvement was followed using the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. A process of enablement, process redesign, delivery support and evaluation were carried out, underpinned by Improvement principles. RESULTS: Following the target of 80% virtual consultations being set, 87% of consultations were delivered virtually during the first 6 weeks. Satisfaction scores were high for virtual consultations (90/100 for patients and 78/100 for clinicians); however, outside of the COVID-19 pandemic, video consultations would be preferred less than 50% of the time. Information to support the future redesign of outpatient services was collected. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that virtual consultations can be rapidly implemented in response to COVID-19 and that they are largely acceptable. Further initiatives are required to support clinically appropriate and acceptable virtual consultations beyond COVID-19. REGISTRATION: This project was submitted to the RNOH's Project Evaluation Panel and was classified as a service evaluation on 12 March 2020 (ref: SE20.09).","Gilbert, Anthony William; Billany, Joe C T; Adam, Ruth; Martin, Luke; Tobin, Rebecca; Bagdai, Shiv; Galvin, Noreen; Farr, Ian; Allain, Adam; Davies, Lucy; Bateson, John",,603,1

However, gynecological emergencies and malignancies must be addressed despite the restricted resources and the need for protective measures against COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the types of gynecological surgeries performed, difficulties encountered, and their outcomes in the setting of the pandemic. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study over 6 months at a single tertiary center, including 60 women with gynecological complaints, categorized as emergencies and semi-emergencies, who underwent further surgery. Their surgical outcomes were measured through various parameters. Results: We found that 68.3% were emergency cases, while the rest were classified as semi-emergencies. Fibroid and adenomyosis with failed medical management (48.3%), followed by CIN (10%), and malignancies (10%) accounted for the semi-emergency cases, while ruptured ectopic pregnancies (13.3%) and torsion and ovarian cysts (18.4%) comprised the emergency cases. The decision to incision time between emergency and semi-emergency cases varied widely due to the safety prerequisites during the pandemic, ranging from 1 hour in emergency cases to 48 hours in semi-emergency cases. In addition, we studied the ease of preoperative preparation, patient satisfaction, and the average number of personnel available to run the operation theaters at these times.

Evidence of immune involvement point to the participation of T, B, and NK cells in the lack of control of virus replication leading to COVID-19. NK cells contribute to early phases of virus control and to the regulation of adaptive responses. The precise mechanism of NK cell dysregulation is poorly understood, with little information on tissue margination or turnover. We investigated these aspects by multiparameter flow cytometry in a cohort of 28 patients hospitalized with early COVID-19. Relevant decreases in CD56brightCD16+/- NK subsets were detected, with a shift of circulating NK cells toward more mature CD56dimCD16+KIR+NKG2A+ and ""memory"" KIR+CD57+CD85j+ cells with increased inhibitory NKG2A and KIR molecules. Impaired cytotoxicity and IFN-Î³ production were associated with conserved expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors and perforin. Moreover, intense NK cell activation with increased HLA-DR and CD69 expression was associated with the circulation of CD69+CD103+ CXCR6+ tissue-resident NK cells and of CD34+DNAM-1brightCXCR4+ inflammatory precursors to mature functional NK cells. Severe disease trajectories were directly associated with the proportion of CD34+DNAM-1brightCXCR4+ precursors and inversely associated with the proportion of NKG2D+ and of CD103+ NK cells.

Plastic-based color 3D printing is a common color 3D printing process, and most factors affecting its color reproduction quality have been studied from printing materials to parameters in the fixed consecutive layers. In this work, and combined with variable stair thickness, the colored layer sequence in sliced layers of a specific 3D color test chart is deliberately changed to test the effects of colored layer features on its final color reproduction quality. Meanwhile, the colorimetric measurement and image acquisition of printed 3D color test charts are both achieved under standard conditions. Results clearly show that the chromatic aberration values and mean structural similarity (MSSIM) values of color samples have a significant correlation with the colored stair thickness, but both did not display a linear relationship. The correlation trends between colored layer sequence and the above two indexes are more localized to the colored stair thickness. Combined with color structural similarity (SSIM) maps analysis, a comprehensive discussion between colored layer features and color reproduction quality of color 3D printing is presented, providing key insights for developing further accurate numerical models.","Yuan, Jiangping; Tian, Jieni; Chen, Chen; Chen, Guangxue",Molecules (Basel),603,29

Here, we found the deglycosylation and Maillard reaction with galactooligosaccharide (GOS) and fructooligosaccharide (FOS) can induce conformational transformation of OVM from other structures (ß-turn, strang, and random coils) to &#945;-helix. We also introduced an approach to reduce the allergenicity of Gallus domesticus OVM by Maillard reaction with GOS and FOS. However, the OVM glycated by mannosan (MOS) and deglycosylated OVM exhibited higher allergenicity than native OVM. Therefore, GOS and FOS, especially GOS, could be applied in the reduction of the potential allergenicity of OVM through glycation. Furthermore, these findings may provide new insights into the development of hypoallergenic egg products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, the allergenicity and conformation of OVM treated with deglycosylation and glycation (GOS, FOS, and MOS) were investigated. The results would provide a better understanding of the effects of deglycosylation and Maillard reaction with different reducing sugars on the molecular characteristics of OVM and further provide new insights into the development of hypoallergenic egg products.","Ma, Junjie; Zhou, Jinru; Chen, Lerong; Zhang, Hong; Wang, Yanbo; Fu, Linglin",J. food sci,603,1
